abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IS-IS is commonly used as an underlay routing protocol for
    MSDC\n   (Massively Scalable Data Center) networks.  For a given IS-IS router\n
    \  within the CLOS topology, it would receive multiple copies of exactly\n   the
    same LSP from multiple IS-IS neighbors.  In addition, two IS-IS\n   neighbors
    may send each other the same LSP simultaneously.  The\n   unneccessary link-state
    information flooding wastes the precious\n   process resource of IS-IS routers
    greatly due to the fact that there\n   are too many IS-IS neighbors for each IS-IS
    router within the CLOS\n   topology.  This document proposes some extensions to
    IS-IS so as to\n   reduce the IS-IS flooding within MSDC networks greatly.  The\n
    \  reduction of the IS-IS flooding is much beneficial to improve the\n   scalability
    of MSDC networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
