abstract:
- content: <p>This document updates RFCs 8029 and 8611, both of which define IANA
    registries for MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping. In particular, the registration
    procedure "Private Use" (previously known as "Vendor Private Use") has been changed
    to "First Come First Served" for the TLV and sub-TLV registries. It also updates
    the description of the procedures for the responses sent when an unknown or erroneous
    code point is found. The updates are to clarify and align this namespace with
    recent developments, e.g., aligning terminology with RFC 8126 instead of the now
    obsoleted RFC 5226 (both titled "Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations
    Section in RFCs").</p>
