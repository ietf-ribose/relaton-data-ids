abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN, RFC7432) is becoming\n
    \  prevalent in Data Centers, Data Center Interconnect (DCI) and Service\n   Provider
    VPN applications. When multi-homing from a CE to multiple\n   PEs, including links
    in an EVPN instance on a given Ethernet Segment,\n   in an all-active redundancy
    mode, [RFC7432] describes a basic\n   mechanism to elect a Designated Forwarder
    (DF), and [I-D.ietf-bess-\n   evpn-df-election-framework] improves basic DF election
    by a HRW\n   algorithm. [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-per-mcast-flow-df-election] enhances\n
    \  the HRW algorithm for the multicast flows to perform DF election at\n   the
    granularity of (ESI, VLAN, Mcast flow). This document specifies a\n   new algorithm,
    based on multicast bandwidth utilization and multicast\n   state quantity, in
    order for the multicast flows to elect a DF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
