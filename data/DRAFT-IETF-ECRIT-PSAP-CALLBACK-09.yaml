abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated\n
    \  by the emergency caller or normally by the call taker) it is possible\n   that
    the call taker feels the need for further communication.  For\n   example, the
    call may have been dropped by accident without the call\n   taker having sufficient
    information about the current situation of a\n   wounded person.  A call taker
    may trigger a callback towards the\n   emergency caller using the contact information
    provided with the\n   initial emergency call.  This callback could, under certain\n
    \  circumstances, be treated like any other call and as a consequence it\n   may
    get blocked by authorization policies or may get forwarded to an\n   answering
    machine.\n\n   The IETF emergency services architecture specification already
    offers\n   a solution approach for allowing PSAP callbacks to bypass\n   authorization
    policies to reach the caller without unnecessary\n   delays.  Unfortunately, the
    specified mechanism only supports limited\n   scenarios.  This document discusses
    shortcomings of the current\n   mechanisms and illustrates additional scenarios
    where better-than-\n   normal call treatment behavior would be desirable.  A solution
    based\n   on a new header field value, called \"psap-callback\", for the SIP\n
    \  Priority header field is specified to accomplish the PSAP callback\n   marking.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
