abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF 6LoWPAN working group defines IPv6 over Low-power
    Wireless\n   Personal Area Networks such as IEEE 802.15.4.  This and other similar\n
    \  link technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due\n   to
    energy conservation.  In addition, the wireless network may not\n   strictly follow
    traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links.  IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery was
    not designed for non-transitive wireless\n   links.  The traditional IPv6 link
    concept and heavy use of multicast\n   make the protocol inefficient and sometimes
    impractical in a low\n   power and lossy network.  This document describes simple\n
    \  optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, addressing mechanisms and\n   duplicate
    address detection for 6LoWPAN and similar networks.  The\n   document, thus updates
    RFC 4944 to specify the use of the\n   optimizations defined here.\n\n\t </p>\n
