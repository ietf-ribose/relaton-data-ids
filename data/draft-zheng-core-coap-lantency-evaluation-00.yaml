abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the evaluation results of CoAP in terms of various
    latency metrics over UDP/TCP under different network environments. We conduct
    experiments via both GPRS and WiFi. We also evaluate how the latency metrics are
    impacted by the background traffic.</p>"
