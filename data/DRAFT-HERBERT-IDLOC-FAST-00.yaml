abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This proposal provides a method to implement identifier to
    locator\n   mapping in the datapath without the need to access an in-network\n
    \  mapping database or cache. Mappings are encoded in Firewall and\n   Service
    Tickets (FAST) tickets as locator information. When a packet\n   is sent by a
    mobile node, a ticket is attached that providers the\n   locator to use in the
    return path. Peer nodes receive packets with\n   these tickets, cache the tickets
    in a flow context, and then attach\n   them to packets they send as reflected
    tickets. When a packet with a\n   reflected ticket enters an identifier-locator
    domain, the ticket is\n   parsed to extract the locator. That locator is then
    used to send the\n   packet to the appropriate destination over a network overlay.\n\n\t
