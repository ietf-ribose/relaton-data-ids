abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec Virtual Private Network (VPN) is widely used by enterprises to
    interconnect their geographical dispersed branch office locations across the Wide
    Area Network (WAN) or the Internet, especially in the Software-Defined-WAN (SD-WAN)
    era. In addition, IPsec is also increasingly used by cloud providers to encrypt
    IP traffic traversing data center networks and data center interconnect WANs so
    as to meet the security and compliance requirements, especially in financial cloud
    and governmental cloud environments. To fully utilize the bandwidth available
    in the data center network, the data center interconnect WAN or the Internet,
    load balancing of IPsec traffic over Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and/or Link
    Aggregation Group (LAG) is much attractive to those enterprises and cloud providers.
    This document defines a method to encapsulate IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload
    (ESP) packets over UDP tunnels for improving load-balancing of IPsec ESP traffic.</p>"
