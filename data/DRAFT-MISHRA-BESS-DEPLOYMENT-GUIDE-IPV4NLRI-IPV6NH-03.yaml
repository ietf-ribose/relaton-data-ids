abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field
    or\n   green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP-\n
    \  BGP)now plays an important role in the transition of the core as well\n   as
    an edge from IPv4 to IPv6.  Operators can now continue to support\n   the legacy
    IPv4, Virtual Private Network (VPN)-IPv4, and Multicast\n   VPN-IPv4 customers.\n\n
    \  This document describes the critical use case and OPEX savings of\n   being
    able to leverage the MP-BGP capability exchange usage as a pure\n   transport,
    allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 to be carried over the same\n   (Border Gateway Protocol)
    BGP TCP session.  By doing so, provides for\n   the elimination of Dual Stacking
    on the Provider Edge - Customer Edge\n   connections.  Thus making the eBGP peering
    IPv6-ONLY to now carry\n   both IPv4 and IPv6 Network Layer Reachability Information
    (NLRI).\n\n   This document now provides a solution for Internet Exchange Point\n
    \  (IXP) that are facing IPv4 address depletion at these peering points\n   to
    use BGP-MP capability exchange defined in [RFC8950] to carry IPv4\n   (Network
    Layer Reachability Information) NLRI in an IPv6 next hop\n   using the [RFC5565]
    softwire mesh framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
