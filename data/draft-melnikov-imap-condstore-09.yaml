abstract:
  content: "<p>Often, multiple IMAP clients need to coordinate changes to a commonIMAP
    mailbox. Examples include different clients for the same user,and multiple users
    accessing shared mailboxes. These clientsneed a mechanism to synchronize state
    changes for messages within themailbox. They must be able to guarantee that only
    one client can changemessage state (e.g., message flags or annotations) at any
    time. Anexample of such an application is use of an IMAP mailbox as a messagequeue
    with multiple dequeueing clients.The Conditional Store facility provides a protected
    update mechanism formessage state information that can detect and resolve conflicts
    betweenmultiple writers.</p>"
