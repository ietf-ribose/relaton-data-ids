abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A variety of network virtualization over layer 3 methods are\n
    \  currently being developed and deployed.  These methods treat IPv4 and\n   IPv6
    as equivalent underlay network technologies.  This memo suggests\n   how IPv6's
    additional capabilities may be used to enhance Virtual\n   Network encapsulation
    over an IPv6 Underlay Network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
