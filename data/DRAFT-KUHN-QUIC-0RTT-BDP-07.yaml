abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   0-RTT mechanisms reduce the time it takes for the first bytes
    of\n   application data to be processed in a transport connection and can\n   greatly
    reduce connection latency during setup.  The 0-RTT transport\n   features described
    by quic-transport help clients establish secure\n   connections with a minimal
    number of round-trips.\n\n   This document describes a generic method to exchange
    path parameters\n   relating to transport.  The additional transport parameters
    can help\n   a connection that continues after an interruption or restarts by\n
    \  sharing connection properties.  They can be used to increase the\n   performance
    for a path with large RTT.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
