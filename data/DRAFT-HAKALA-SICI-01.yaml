abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses how Serial Item and Contribution Identifiers
    \n(SICIs; persistent and unique identifiers for serial issues and \ncontributions
    such as articles) can be supported within the URN \nframework and the syntax for
    URNs defined in RFC 2141 [Moats]. Much of \nthe discussion below is based on the
    ideas expressed in RFC 2288 \n[Lynch]. Chapter 5 contains a URN namespace registration
    request \nmodelled according to the template in RFC 2611 [Daigle et al.].\n\t
