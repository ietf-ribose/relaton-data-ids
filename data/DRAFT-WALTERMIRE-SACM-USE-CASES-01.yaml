abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document identifies foundational use cases, derived functional\n
    \  capabilities and requirements, architectural components, and the\n   supporting
    standards needed to define an interoperable, automation\n   infrastructure required
    to support timely, accurate and actionable\n   situational awareness over an organization's
    IT systems.  Automation\n   tools implementing a continuous monitoring approach
    will utilize this\n   infrastructure together with existing and emerging event,
    incident\n   and network management standards to provide visibility into the state\n
    \  of assets, user activities and network behavior.  Stakeholders will\n   be
    able to use these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant security\n   and operational
    data to understand the organizations security\n   posture, quantify business risk,
    and make informed decisions that\n   support organizational objectives while protecting
    critical\n   information.  Organizations will be able to use these tools to\n
    \  augment and automate information sharing activities to collaborate\n   with
    partners to identify and mitigate threats.  Other automation\n   tools will be
    able to integrate with these capabilities to enforce\n   policies based on human
    decisions to harden systems, prevent misuse\n   and reduce the overall attack
    surface.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
