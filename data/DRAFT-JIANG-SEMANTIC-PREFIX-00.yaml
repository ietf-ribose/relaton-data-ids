abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some Internet Service Providers desire to be aware of more\n
    \  information about each packet, so that packets can be treated\n   differently
    and efficiently. IPv6, with a large address space, allows\n   semantics to be
    embedded into addresses. Routers can easily apply\n   relevant operations accordingly.
    This document provides analysis on\n   how to form semantic prefix and corresponding
    use cases, and\n   identifies the technical requirements to maximize the benefits
    of the\n   semantic prefix approach. It is recommended to use 4~12 bits in\n   prefix
    for embedded semantics.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
