abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip\n
    \  times to the closest DNS root server.  Some DNS recursive resolver\n   operators
    want to prevent snooping of requests sent to DNS root\n   servers by third parties.
    \ Such resolvers can greatly decrease the\n   round-trip time and prevent observation
    of requests by running a copy\n   of the full root zone on the same server, such
    as on a loopback\n   address.  This document shows how to start and maintain such
    a copy\n   of the root zone that does not pose a threat to other users of the\n
    \  DNS, at the cost of adding some operational fragility for the\n   operator.\n\n
    \  This draft will update RFC 7706.  See Section 1.1 for a list of\n   topics
    that will be added in the update.\n\n   [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets
    ([]) is additional background\n   information, answers to freqently asked questions,
    general musings,\n   etc.  They will be removed before publication.]\n\n   [ This
    document is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/wkumari/draft-kh-dnsop-7706bis.
    \ The most recent\n   version of the document, open issues, and so on should all
    be\n   available there.  The authors gratefully accept pull requests. ]\n\n\t
