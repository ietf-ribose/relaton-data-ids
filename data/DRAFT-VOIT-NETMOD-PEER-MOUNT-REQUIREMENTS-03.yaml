abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network integrated applications want simple ways to reference
    and\n   access YANG objects and subtrees.  These simplifications might\n   include
    aliasing of local YANG information.  These simplifications\n   might include remote
    referencing of YANG information distributed\n   across network.\n\n   For such
    applications, development complexity must be minimized.\n   Specific aspects of
    complexity developers want to ignore include:\n\n   o  whether multiple aliases
    and paths for the same information are\n      exposed on a single device,\n\n
    \  o  whether authoritative information is actually sourced from local\n      or
    remote datastores,\n\n   o  the overhead of session establishment and maintenance
    which is\n      needed in order to access information on remote datastores,\n\n
    \  o  whether objects have been locally cached or not, and\n\n   o  whether there
    is a mix of controllers, NMSs, and/or CLI which have\n      access permission
    to update the primary copy of a particular\n      object.\n\n   The solution requirements
    described in this document detail what is\n   needed to support application access
    to authoritative network YANG\n   objects locally (via aliasing), or remotely
    from controllers or\n   peering network devices in such a way to meet these goals.\n\n\t
