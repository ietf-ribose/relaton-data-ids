abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the Autokey security model for authenticating servers
    to clients using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and public key cryptography.
    Its design is based on the premise that IPsec schemes cannot be adopted intact,
    since that would preclude stateless servers and severely compromise timekeeping
    accuracy. In addition, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) schemes presume authenticated
    time values are always available to enforce certificate lifetimes; however, cryptographically
    verified timestamps require interaction between the timekeeping and authentication
    functions. This memo includes the Autokey requirements analysis, design principles,
    and protocol specification. A detailed description of the protocol states, events,
    and transition functions is included. A prototype of the Autokey design based
    on this memo has been implemented, tested, and documented in the NTP version 4
    (NTPv4) software distribution for the Unix, Windows, and Virtual Memory System
    (VMS) operating systems at http://www.ntp.org. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
