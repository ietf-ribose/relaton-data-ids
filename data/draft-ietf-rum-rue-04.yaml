abstract:
- content: <p>Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by which
    a hearing persons can communicate with deaf/Hard of Hearing user using an interpreter
    ("Communications Assistant") connected via a videophone to the deaf/HoH user and
    an audio telephone call to the hearing user. The CA interprets using sign language
    on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link. Often the interpreters
    may be supplied by a company or agency termed a "provider" in this document. The
    provider also provides a video service that allows users to connect video devices
    to their service, and subsequently to CAs and other deaf/HoH users. It is desirable
    that the videophones used by the deaf/HoH/H-I user conform to a standard so that
    any device may be used with any provider and that video calls direct between deaf/HoH
    users work. This document describes the interface between a videophone and a provider.</p>
