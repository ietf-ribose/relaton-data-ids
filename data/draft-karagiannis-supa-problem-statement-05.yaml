abstract:
- content: "<p>The raise in complexity and size of modern networks makes it significantly
    more challenging to deploy new services and to keep networks up to date while
    maintaining stability and availability for critical business services. This is
    a major challenge that network operators (service providers, SME, etc) face today.
    The operators aim at streamlining operations and the deployment of new services
    by relying increasingly on programmatic control of network elements and the use
    of various virtualization technologies. In this context, providing network operators
    with a set of standard generic YANG-based data models that enable management and
    automation of services on their network is essential. This document describes
    the set of related problems addressed by the SUPA (Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions
    ) working group.</p>"
