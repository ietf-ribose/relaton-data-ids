abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an extension to 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery\n
    \  (ND) defined in RFC6775 and updated in [I-D.ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update].\n   The
    new extension is called Address Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-\n   ND) and
    it protects the owner of an address against address theft and\n   impersonation
    attacks in a low-power and lossy network (LLN).  Nodes\n   supporting this extension
    compute a cryptographic identifier (Crypto-\n   ID) and use it with one or more
    of their Registered Addresses.  The\n   Crypto-ID identifies the owner of the
    Registered Address and can be\n   used to provide proof of ownership of the Registered
    Addresses.  Once\n   an address is registered with the Crypto-ID and a proof-of-ownership\n
    \  is provided, only the owner of that address can modify the\n   registration
    information, thereby enforcing Source Address\n   Validation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
