abstract:
- content: "<p>Network administrators typically enforce Quality of Service (QoS) policies
    according to Service Level Agreement (SLA) with their providers. The enforcement
    of such policies often relies upon vendor-specific configuration language. Both
    learning of SLA, either thru SLA documents or via some other out-of-band method,
    and translating them to vendor specific configuration language is a complex, many
    times manual, process and prone to errors. This document proposes an in-band method
    of SLA signaling which can help to simplify some of the complexities. This document
    defines an optional transitive attribute to signal SLA details in-band, across
    administrative boundaries (considered as Autonomous Systems (AS)), thus simplifying
    and facilitating some of the complex provisioning tasks. Though the use case with
    the proposed BGP attribute is explicitly defined in this document, purpose of
    this attribute is not limited to this use case only.</p>"
