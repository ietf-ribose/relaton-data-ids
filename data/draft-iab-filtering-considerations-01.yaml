abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium. This
    openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can also
    allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by certain parties. Thus,
    as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact of
    abusive or allegedly illegal communications. Recently, there has been an increasing
    emphasis on "blocking" or "filtering," the active prevention of abusive or allegedly
    illegal communications. This document examines several technical approaches to
    Internet content blocking in terms of their alignment with the overall Internet
    architecture. In general, the approach to content filtering that is most coherent
    with the Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable
    services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or illegal communications.</p>
