abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4] does not support\n
    \  reporting spam on its own.  There are a number of solutions available\n   based
    on the multipart/report content type defined in [REPORT].\n   However, these solutions
    require including the message contents and\n   hence, consume bandwidth to transmit
    the entire message.  In\n   bandwidth-constrained environments - such as mobile
    networks - it is\n   highly desirable to send only a minimum set of information
    - a\n   reference - instead of the entire message.  Furthermore, it is\n   desirable
    to permit individual server implementations to handle spam\n   in any way these
    systems choose to: do nothing, flag, recommend\n   deletion or relocation, perform
    deletion or relocation, and, involve\n   any choice of spam aggregator services
    in the decision process, such\n   as [OMA-SPAMREP].  Solutions that exist today
    employ manipulating\n   proprietary flags in the IMAP storage to achieve the bare
    minimum,\n   however more advanced solutions cannot be developed by using flags\n
    \  only; the IMAP server needs to be involved actively in the spam\n   reporting
    process.\n\n   This document specifies the syntax of the SREP command, which allows\n
    \  a client to inform the server that the user considered a message (or\n   parts
    thereof) spam, or, that the user no longer considers a message\n   (or parts thereof)
    spam.  Since all information about the message is\n   readily available on the
    server, the command also allows the server\n   to implement a more intelligent
    and accurate decision logic, which\n   may be invoked when the spam is reported
    and the server can respond\n   with its decision to the client.\n\n   Additionally,
    this document contains example flows, illustrating\n   various decisions that
    the server may choose to evaluate, including\n   invoking a service based on [OMA-SPAMREP].\n\n
    \  This document focuses only on the client-server interactions and the\n   scope
    is limited to messages that either exist on the IMAP server,\n   or, exist elsewhere
    and the IMAP server is configured to access them.\n   Consequently, deposit-time
    filtering, messages that have been\n   deleted, or, exist in an external storage
    but are accessible via an\n   access protocol unknown to the IMAP server are out
    of scope.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
