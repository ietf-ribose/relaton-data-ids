abstract:
- content: <p>This document details the possible architectural and design choices
    in order to determine i) the spatial location of the so-called "IRS interface"
    and the functional entities it directly and/or indirectly involves, ii) the number
    of levels of redirection between routing modules and application (and associated
    identifier space), and iii) the various constraints that can be anticipated when
    dealing with the coupling of functional planes including the prevention of oscillations
    between two or more routing system states, coupling effects (leading to amplification
    chains) and, concurrency (leading to antagonistic action-reaction).</p>
