abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Kerberos 5 network authentication protocol, originally
    specified\n   in RFC1510, can use the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for\n   encryption.
    \ Almost 30 years after first publishing DES, the National\n   Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) finally withdrew the\n   standard in 2005, reflecting a
    long-established consensus that DES is\n   insufficiently secure.  By 2008, commercial
    hardware costing less\n   than USD 15,000 could break DES keys in less than a
    day on average.\n   DES is long past its sell-by date.  Accordingly, this document\n
    \  updates RFC1964, RFC4120, RFC4121, and RFC4757 to deprecate the use\n   of
    DES, \"export strength\" RC4, and other weak cryptographic\n   algorithms in Kerberos.
    \ Because RFC1510 (obsoleted by RFC4120)\n   supports only DES, this document
    reclassifies RFC1510 as Historic.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
