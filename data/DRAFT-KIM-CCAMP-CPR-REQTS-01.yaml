abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The resilience of control plane refers to the ability of control
    \n   plane to continue its operation even under failure conditions of \n   control
    components such as control entities, control nodes, and \n   control channels.
    This document describes requirements for providing \n   the resilience capability
    of control plane (in other words, control \n   network) in non-(G)MPLS and (G)MPLS.
    This contribution, as a document \n   that proposes a framework to provide the
    resilience capability of \n   control plane, include terminologies, basic concepts
    of control \n   networks, possible configurations, necessities and requirements,
    \n   additional considerations including the relationship with other \n   protocol
    such as LMP for the resilience of control plane. \n\t </p>\n      "
