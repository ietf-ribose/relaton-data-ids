abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>One of the main motivations behind VPLS is its ability to provide
    \nconnectivity not only among customer routers and servers/hosts but \nalso among
    customer bridges. If only connectivity among customer IP \nrouters/hosts was desired,
    then IPLS solution [IPLS] could have been \nused. The strength of the VPLS solution
    is that it can provide \nconnectivity to both bridge and non-bridge types of CE
    devices. VPLS \nis expected to deliver the same level of service that current
    \nenterprise users are accustomed to from their own enterprise bridged \nnetworks
    today or the same level of service that they receive from \ntheir Ethernet Service
    Providers using IEEE 802.1ad-based networks \n[P802.1ad] (or its predecessor â€“
    QinQ-based network). \n  \nWhen CE devices are IEEE bridges, then there are certain
    issues and \nchallenges that need to be accounted for in a VPLS network. Majority
    \nof these issues have currently been addressed in IEEE 802.1ad \nstandard for
    provider bridges and they need to be addressed for VPLS \nnetworks. This draft
    discusses these issues and wherever possible, \nthe recommended solutions to these
    issues.\n\t </p>\n      "
