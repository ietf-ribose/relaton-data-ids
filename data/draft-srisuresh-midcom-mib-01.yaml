abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Middlebox communication (midcom) was conceived to moveapplication
    level gateway (ALG) intelligence out of middleboxes into application specific
    midcom agents. Midcomagents will be assumed to use midcom to control middleboxresources
    so as to permit applications to traverse amiddlebox. The scope of the middleboxes
    is limited to NAT andfirewall devices. This document defines SNMP managed midcomobjects
    to control middlebox resources and justifies adaptingSNMPv3 as the midcom protocol.</p>"
