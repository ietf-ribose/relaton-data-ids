abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the motivation, desirable properties, system
    model, roles/responsibilities, and component models associated with an asynchronous
    management architecture (AMA) suitable for providing application-level network
    management services in a challenged networking environment. Challenged networks
    are those that require fault protection, configuration, and performance reporting
    while unable to provide human-in-the-loop operations centers with synchronous
    feedback in the context of administrative sessions. In such a context, networks
    must exhibit behavior that is both deterministic and autonomous while maintaining
    compatibility with existing network management protocols and operational concepts.</p>"
