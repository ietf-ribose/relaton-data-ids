abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a transport protocol for SCSI that works on
    top of TCP. The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with the standardized
    SCSI Architecture Model (SAM-2). RFC 3720 defined the original iSCSI protocol.
    RFC 3721 discusses iSCSI naming examples and discovery techniques. Subsequently,
    RFC 3980 added an additional naming format to the iSCSI protocol. RFC 4850 followed
    up by adding a new public extension key to iSCSI. RFC 5048 offered a number of
    clarifications as well as a few improvements and corrections to the original iSCSI
    protocol. This document obsoletes RFCs 3720, 3980, 4850, and 5048 by consolidating
    them into a single document and making additional updates to the consolidated
    specification. This document also updates RFC 3721. The text in this document
    thus supersedes the text in all the noted RFCs wherever there is a difference
    in semantics.</p>"
