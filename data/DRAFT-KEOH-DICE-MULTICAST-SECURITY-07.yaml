abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CoAP standard is fast emerging as a key protocol in the
    area of\n   resource-constrained devices.  Such IP-based systems are foreseen
    to\n   be used for building and lighting control systems where devices\n   interconnect
    with each other, forming, for example, low-power and\n   lossy networks (LLNs).
    \ Both multicast and its security are key needs\n   in these networks.  This draft
    presents a method for securing IPv6\n   multicast communication based on the DTLS
    which is already supported\n   for unicast communication for CoAP devices.  This
    draft deals with\n   the adaptation of the DTLS record layer to protect multicast
    group\n   communication, assuming that all group members already have the group\n
    \  security association parameters in their possession.  The adapted\n   DTLS
    record layer provides message confidentiality, integrity and\n   replay protection
    to group messages using the group keying material\n   before sending the message
    via IPv6 multicast to the group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
