abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPsec supports secure communication over potentially insecure
    network\ncomponents such as intermediate routers.  IPsec protocols support two\noperating
    modes, transport mode and tunnel mode.  Explicit Congestion\nNotification (ECN)
    is an experimental addition to the IP architecture\nthat provides notification
    of onset of congestion to delay- or loss-\nsensitive applications.  ECN provides
    congestion notifications to\nenable adaptation to network conditions without the
    impact of dropped\npackets [RFC 2481].  The use of two bits in the IPsec header
    for ECN\nexperimentation conflicts with header processing at IPsec tunnel\nendpoints
    in a manner that makes ECN unusable in the presence of\nIPsec tunnels.  This document
    considers issues related to this\nconflict, describes two alternative solutions,
    and updates the IPsec\narchitecture [RFC 2401] to include these alternatives.
    \ Support for\none or the other of these alternatives is REQUIRED to remove the\nunderlying
    conflict.\n\t </p>\n      "
