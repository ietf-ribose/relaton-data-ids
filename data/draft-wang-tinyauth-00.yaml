abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies basic security standards for authenticationprotocol
    on Ad hoc. The security standards are based on the ECDH todiscover a authentication
    protocol between two nodes, and on theTinyOS simulation platform and Mica nodes.
    This document alsodefines elements of procedure for authentication protocol, includingSystem
    Initialization, Key extract and the identity authentication.With these standards,
    authentication between two nodes can becompleted in a certain time and a certain
    circles.</p>"
