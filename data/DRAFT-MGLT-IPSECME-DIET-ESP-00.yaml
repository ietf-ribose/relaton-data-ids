abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPsec/ESP has been designed to secure IP packets exchanged
    between\n   two nodes.  IPsec implements security at the IP layer which makes\n
    \  security transparent to the applications, as opposed to TLS or DTLS\n   that
    requires application to implement TLS/DTLS.  As a result, IPsec\n   enable to
    define the security rules in a similar way one establishes\n   firewall rules.\n\n
    \  One of the IPsec's drawbacks is that implementing security on a per\n   packet
    basis adds overhead to each IP packet.  Considering IoT\n   devices, the data
    transmitted over an IP packet is expected to be\n   rather small, and the cost
    of sending extra bytes is so high that\n   IPsec/ESP can hardly be used for IoT
    as it is currently defined in\n   RFC 4303.\n\n   This document defines Diet-ESP,
    a protocol that compress and reduce\n   the ESP overhead of IPsec/ESP so that
    it can fit security and energy\n   efficient IoT requirements.  Diet-ESP use already
    existing mechanism\n   like IKEv2 to negotiate the compression format.  Furthermore
    a lot of\n   information, already existing for an IPsec Security Association,
    are\n   reused to offer light negotiation in addition to maximum compression.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
