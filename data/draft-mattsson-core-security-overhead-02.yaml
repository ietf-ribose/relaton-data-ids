abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes and compares per-packet message size overheads
    when using different security protocols to secure CoAP. The analyzed security
    protocols are DTLS 1.2, DTLS 1.3, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, and OSCORE. DTLS and TLS are
    analyzed with and without compression. DTLS are analyzed with two different alternatives
    for header compression as well as with and without Connection ID.</p>"
