abstract:
- content: "<p>Fast re-route (FRR) is a technique that allows productive forwarding
    to continue in a network after a failure has occurred, but before the network
    has has time to re-converge. This is achieved by forwarding a packet on an alternate
    path that will not result in the packet looping. Preferred Path Routing (PPR)
    provides a method of injecting explicit paths into the routing protocol. The use
    of PPR to support FRR has a number of advantages. This document describes the
    advantages of using PPR to provide a loop-free alternate FRR path, and provides
    a framework for its use in this application.</p>"
