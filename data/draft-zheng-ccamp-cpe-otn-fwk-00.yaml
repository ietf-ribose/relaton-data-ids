abstract:
- content: "<p>The term Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) describes the terminals
    that are associated with a carrier's telecommunication network. The CPE provides
    access between a customer's devices and the network. This document describes the
    framework for control of CPEs in optical transport networks. Gap analysis is also
    included as guidance for potential solutions such as protocol extensions.</p>"
