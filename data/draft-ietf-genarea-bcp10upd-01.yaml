abstract:
- content: "<p>BCP 10 (RFC 3777) specifies IETF processes for selection, confirmation
    and recall of appointees to IETF positions. It also refers to the mechanism of
    resignation as part of a sequence that moves a sitting member to a new IETF position.
    However it does not more generally deal with vacancies created by resignation,
    death or uncontested, sustained absence from participation. This update to BCP
    10 specifies procedures for handling vacancies.</p>"
