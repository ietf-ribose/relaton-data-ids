abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Traffic has constantly shown the pattern that a very small
    amount of the traffic flows generate a high traffic volume while a significant
    amount of small flows contribute a small amount of traffic volume. Differentiating
    such large flow and small flow in the packet switched network enables an enhanced
    transport method over Equal Cost Multi Paths (ECMP). This draft describes the
    enhanced ECMP transport with the large flow awareness.</p>"
