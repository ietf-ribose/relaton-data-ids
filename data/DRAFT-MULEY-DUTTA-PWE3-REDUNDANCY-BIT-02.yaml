abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism for standby status signaling
    of \nredundant PWs between their termination points. A set of redundant \nPWs
    is configured between PE nodes in SS-PW applications, or between \nT-PE nodes
    in MS-PW applications.  \n\nIn order for the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred
    PW path to \nforward to one another, a new status bit is needed to indicate a
    \npreferential forwarding status of active or standby for each PW in \nthe redundancy
    set.  \n\nIn addition, a second status bit is defined to allow peer PE/T-PE \nnodes
    to coordinate a switchover operation of the PW/MS-PW path. \n\n \n\nConventions
    used in this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119
    [1].\n\t </p>\n      "
