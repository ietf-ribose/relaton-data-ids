abstract:
- content: "<p>The I2RS (the Interface to the Routing System) is a programmatic asynchronous
    interface for transferring state into and out of the routing system. The I2RS
    can provide programmable control planes for network service providers (NSPs).
    In this sense, the I2RS could be also considered as one of candidates to facilitate
    CDNI Request Routing. This document discusses how I2RS can be used for downstream
    CDN selection within CDNI request routing.</p>"
