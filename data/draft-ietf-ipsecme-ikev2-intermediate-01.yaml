abstract:
- content: "<p>This documents defines a new exchange, called Intermediate Exchange,
    for the Internet Key Exchange protocol Version 2 (IKEv2). This exchange can be
    used for transferring large amount of data in the process of IKEv2 Security Association
    (SA) establishment. Introducing Intermediate Exchange allows re-using existing
    IKE Fragmentation mechanism, that helps to avoid IP fragmentation of large IKE
    messages, but cannot be used in the initial IKEv2 exchange.</p>"
