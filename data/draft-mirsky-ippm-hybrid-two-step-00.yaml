abstract:
- content: "<p>Development of and advancements in automation of network operations
    brought new requirements toward measurement methodology. Among them is ability
    to collect the instant telemetry as the packet being processed by the networking
    elements along its path through the domain. This document introduces new hybrid
    measurement method, referred to as hybrid two-step, as it separates act of measuring
    and/ or calculating performance metric from the act of collecting and transporting
    telemetry.</p>"
