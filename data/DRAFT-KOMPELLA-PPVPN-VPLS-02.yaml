abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), also known as Transparent
    LAN\nService, and Virtual Private Switched Network service, is a useful\nService
    Provider offering.  The service offered is a Layer 2 VPN;\nhowever, in the case
    of VPLS, the customers in the VPN are connected\nby a multipoint network, in contrast
    to the usual Layer 2 VPNs, which\nare point-to-point in nature.\nThis document
    describes the functions required to offer VPLS, and\nproposes a mechanism for
    signaling a VPLS, as well as for forwarding\nVPLS frames across a packet switched
    network.\n\t </p>\n      "
