- content: "<p>This document provides guidance to aid in the understanding of collaboration
    on standards development between the International Telecommunication Union --
    Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) and the Internet Society (ISOC)
    / Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It is an update of and obsoletes [RFC
    2436]. The updates reflect changes in the IETF and ITU-T since RFC 2436 was written.
    The bulk of this document is common text with ITU-T Supplement 3 to the ITU-T
    A-Series Recommendations. This was approved by TUT-T TSAG on 30 November 2001
    as a supplement to the ITU-T A-Series of recommendations (will be numbered as
    A- Series Supplement 3)</p>"
