abstract:
- content: "<p>Consider large networks deploying traditional PIM multicast service.
    Typically, each portion of these large networks have their own mandates and requirements.
    It might be desirable to deploy BIER technology in some part of these networks
    to replace traditional PIM services. In such cases downstream PIM states need
    to be signaled over the BIER Domain toward the source. This draft specifies the
    procedure to signal PIM join/prune messages through a BIER Domain, as such enabling
    the provisioning of traditional PIM services through a BIER Domain. These procedures
    are valid for forwarding PIM join/prune messages to the Source (SSM) or Rendezvous
    Point (ASM).</p>"
