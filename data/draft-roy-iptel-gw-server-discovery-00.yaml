abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This contribution describes a discovery protocol that can be usedbetween
    gateways (GWs) and severs as well as among servers in intra-ITAD communications
    environment. The entities work in peer-to-peermode to discover each other. A peer
    can find which peer(s) toregister with based on policy. Each peer can also decide
    whethercapabilities should also be taken into consideration during thediscovery
    process before they proceed for registration. Thediscovery protocol will be a
    part for building a single unifiedintra-ITAD protocol described in a following
    contribution. Themessage formats of the intra-ITAD protocol including the discoverymessage
    are similar to TRIP.</p>"
