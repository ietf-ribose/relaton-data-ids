abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network Time Protocol version 4 (NTPv4) defines the peer
    process,\n   the clock filter algorithm, the system process and the clock\n   description
    algorithm.  The clock filter algorithm and the system\n   process, as defined
    in RFC 5905, are the mechanism according to which\n   an NTP client chooses the
    NTP servers it synchronized with.  This\n   document specifies an alternative
    set of client mechanisms, named\n   Chronos, that is backward compatible with
    NTPv4, and offers an\n   improved level of security against time shifting attacks.\n\n\t
