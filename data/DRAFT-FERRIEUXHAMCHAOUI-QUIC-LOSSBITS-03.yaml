abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an extension to the QUIC transport protocol
    to\n   allow endpoints to signal packet loss in a way that can be used by\n   network
    devices to measure and locate the source of the loss.\n\n   Discussion of this
    work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF\n   mailing list quic@ietf.org [1]
    or on the GitHub repository which\n   contains the draft: https://github.com/igorlord/draft-\n
    \  ferrieuxhamchaoui-lossbits [2].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
