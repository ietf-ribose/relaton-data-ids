abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment routing supports the creation of explicit paths using adjacency-sids,
    node-sids, and binding-sids. It is important to provide fast reroute (FRR) mechanisms
    to respond to failures of links and nodes in the Segment-Routed Traffic-Engineered(SR-TE)
    path. A point of local repair (PLR) can provide FRR protection against the failure
    of a link in an SR-TE path by examining only the first (top) label in the SR label
    stack. In order to protect against the failure of a node, a PLR may need to examine
    the second label in the stack as well, in order to determine SR-TE path beyond
    the failed node. This document specifies how a PLR can use the first and second
    label in the label stack describing an SR-TE path to provide protection against
    node failures.</p>"
