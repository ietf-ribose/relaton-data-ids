abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Hosts and applications may benefit from the knowledge if an IPv6\naddress
    is synthesized, which would mean a NAT64 is used to reach the\nIPv4 network or
    Internet.  This document analyses a number of\nproposed solutions for communicating
    whether the synthesis is taking\nplace, used address format, and the IPv6 prefix
    used by the NAT64 and\nDNS64.  This enables both NAT64 avoidance and intentional
    utilization\nby allowing local IPv6 address synthesis.\n\t </p>\n      "
