abstract:
- content: "<p>While MPLS is deployed further and further to the access network, a
    converging network edge point which provides both MPLS and PON access capability
    appears. To provide resiliency for its services, multi- homing is needed to support
    PON access in MPLS. This document describes the multi-chassis PON protection architecture
    in MPLS and also proposes the ICCP extension to support it.</p>"
