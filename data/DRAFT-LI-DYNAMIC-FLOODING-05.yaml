abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Routing with link state protocols in dense network topologies
    can\n   result in sub-optimal convergence times due to the overhead\n   associated
    with flooding.  This can be addressed by decreasing the\n   flooding topology
    so that it is less dense.\n\n   This document discusses the problem in some depth
    and an\n   architectural solution.  Specific protocol changes for IS-IS, OSPFv2,\n
    \  and OSPFv3 are described in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
