abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the addition of the ECN-nonce RFC 3540
    [4] to\n   the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) RFC 2960 [3].  The\n
    \  ECN-nonce reduces the vulnerability of ECN senders to misbehaving\n   receivers
    that conceal congestion signals like ECN marks and packet\n   losses.  The ECN-nonce
    approach is different in SCTP because SCTP\n   uses chunks for extensible protocol
    features and is selective\n   acknowlegement (SACK)-based; this document describes
    those\n   differences.  In particular this document describes (1) protocol\n   extensions
    in the form of a single new parameter for the INIT/\n   INIT-ACK chunks, and a
    single bit flag in the SACK chunk, and (2)\n   rules governing the sender and
    receiver side implementation.\n\n   This document outlines a minimum response
    that an SCTP sender should\n   apply after detecting a misbehaving receiver.\n\n\n\t
