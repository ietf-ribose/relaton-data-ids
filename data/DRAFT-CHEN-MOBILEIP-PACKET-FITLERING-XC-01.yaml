abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides considerations for some requirements on
    \nthe IPv6 nodes using MIPv6  to communicate with their peers across\na network
    boundary where some specific packet filtering is \ndeployed for operator and service
    provider controlled access to  \nthe services and network resources. Depending
    on the operational \npolicies, the packet filtering can be applied on either the
    \nincoming packets or the outgoing packets or in both directions. \nA mobile node
    using MIPv6 sends packets with Home IP address in \nthe extension headers, while
    the packet filtering is often based \non either the source address or the destination
    address or both \nin the basic IPv6 header.Packet filtering that complies with
    the \npolicies from the mobility unaware applications will fail to \nperform properly
    due to the change of the source and destination \naddresses in the basic IPv6
    header when MIPv6 is used. This \ndocument provides an analysis on the operation
    requirements on \npacket filtering and then proposes a simple solution that does
    \nnot impose any change on IPv6 but requires an  addition to IPv6 \nnodes using
    MIPv6.\n\t </p>\n      "
