abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines two IANA registries in order to assign\n
    \  transitive and non-transitive extended communities from.  These are\n   similar
    to the existing well-known BGP communities defined in RFC\n   1997 but provide
    an easier control of inter-AS community\n   advertisement as a community could
    be chosen as transitive or non-\n   transitive across ASes.\n\n   For that purpose,
    this document defines the use of the reserved AS\n   number 0 for the transitive
    and non-transitive generic four-octet AS\n   specific extended community types.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
