abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network functions are traditionally implemented on specialized\n
    \  hardware rather than on general purpose servers, but there is a clear\n   trend
    to implement a number of network functions, such as firewall or\n   load balancer,
    as software on virtualized computing platforms.  These\n   virtualized functions
    are called Virtualized Network Functions\n   (VNFs).  We call a group of such
    VNFs a VNF set, which can be used to\n   build network services.  The use of VNF
    set to build network services\n   introduces additional challenges on reliability,
    such as additional\n   points of failure and the need to coordinate various VNFs.\n\n
    \  This document introduces a general idea of VNF Pools to support\n   reliable
    function provision by the VNF set.  We then highlight the\n   reliability challenges
    and problems when using the VNF set to build\n   services.  Related IETF works
    are also briefly described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
