abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines Multicast Virtual Private Network (VPN)\n
    \  extensions and procedures that allow fast failover for upstream\n   failures
    by allowing upstream Provider Edges (PEs) to determine a\n   single forwarder
    for a VPN multicast flow, without the downstream\n   PEs' duplication prevention.
    \ The fast failover is accomplished by\n   using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
    (VRRP) [RFC5798] or similar\n   technologies for the upstream PEs to determine
    a single desinated\n   fowarder.  Also, this document introduces a new BGP Extended\n
    \  Community called \"Upstream Forwarder Selection\", carried by BGP VPN\n   route
    so that the upstream PEs can inform downstream PEs the election\n   behavior.
    \ The downstream PEs, accordingly, send C-multicast routes\n   to both the primary
    and standby upstream PEs and forward the\n   multicast flow comming from both
    sides to the CEs.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
