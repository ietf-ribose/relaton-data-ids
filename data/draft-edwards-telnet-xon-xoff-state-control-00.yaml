    mechanism for the telnet client to control andquery the outbound Xon/Xoff flow
    control state of the telnet server'sphysical serial port. This capability is exposed
    in the serial portAPI on some operating systems and is needed by telnet clients
    thatimplement a port-redirector service which provides applications localto the
    redirector/telnet-client with transparent access to the remoteserial port on the
