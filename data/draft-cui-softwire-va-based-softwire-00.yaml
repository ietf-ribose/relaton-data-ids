abstract:
  content: "<p>The increasing deployment of IPv6 networks in both customer networksand
    ISP networks leads to two common traversing transition scenarios:in the first
    scenario, an IPv6-only backbone network needs to provideIP connectivity between
    IPv4 networks, we call it IPv4-over-IPv6scenario; In the second scenario, IPv6
    networks need to beinterconnected over an IPv4 transit network, we call it IPv6-over-IPv4
    scenario. In both scenarios, the ISP operating the transitnetwork of one address
    family must offer transit services forattached client networks of the other address
    family. The SoftwireWG has defined softwire mesh mechanism [RFC5565] for the twotraversing
    scenarios. Softwire mesh uses automatic softwire tunnelsemploying multi-protocol
    BGP extensions for distributing E-IP routes,where both BGP peers and tunnels between
    PEs forms a full-mesharchitecture.Inspired by the Virtual Aggregation approach
    [I-D.ietf-grow-va] toIPv4 routing scalability, in this draft we proposed a scalablemechanism
    for distributing E-IP routes over the transit network. Oursolution can significantly
    reduce the forwarding information base(FIB) size at Address Family Border Routers
    (AFBRs) as well as thetotal amount of routing updates, and offers the ISP an easy
    way tomanage the transit service.</p>"
