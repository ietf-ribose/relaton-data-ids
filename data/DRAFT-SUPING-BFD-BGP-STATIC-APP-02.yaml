abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of the Bidirectional Forwarding\n
    \  Detection protocol with BGP and the static route over IPv4 or IPv6. \n   The
    main purpose of this draft is to solve the BFD bootstrap problem\n   with BGP
    and static routes. As to the encapsulation and \n   demultiplexing issues there
    have been descriptions in BFD single hop\n   draft [BFD-1HOP] and multi-hop draft
    [BFD-MULI]. With the BFD\n   interaction with BGP graceful restart, the rules
    described in BFD\n   single hop [BFD-1HOP] with IS-IS and OSPF graceful restart
    are also\n   applicable to the BFD with BGP graceful restart, and will not \n
    \  iteratein in this draft. \n   Comments on this draft should be directed to
    rtg-bfd@ietf.org or \n   to author directly.\n\t </p>\n      "
