abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Virtual Aggregation (VA) is a mechanism for shrinking the size of
    theDFZ FIB in routers [I-D.francis-idr-intra-va]. VA can result inlonger paths
    and increased load on routers within the ISP thatdeploys VA. This document describes
    a mechanism that allows an ASthat originates a route to associate a tunnel endpoint
    terminating atitself with the route. This allows routers in a remote AS to tunnelpackets
    to the originating AS. If transit ASes between the remote ASand the originating
    AS install the prefixes associated with tunnelendpoints in their FIBs, then tunneled
    packets that transit throughthem will take the shortest path. This results in
    reduced load forthe transit AS, and better performance for the customers at thesource
    and destination.</p>"
