abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is twofold. First, it describes various
    alternatives for exchanging inter-domain routing information across domain boundaries,
    where one of the peering domain is CIDR-capable and another is not. Second, it
    addresses the implications of running CIDR- capable inter-domain routing protocols
    (e.g., BGP-4, IDRP) on intra- domain routing. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard.</p>"
