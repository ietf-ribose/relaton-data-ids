abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) defines the common framework
    for\n   applications to announce and discover services.  This includes\n   service
    names, service instance names, common parameters for\n   selecting a service instance
    (weight, priority) as well as service\n   specific parameters.\n\n   GRASP is
    intended to also be used for service discovery.  Reinventing\n   service discovery
    for GRASP with a similar set of fetures would\n   result in duplication of work.
    \ Therefore, this document defines how\n   to use GRASP to announce and discover
    services in a way that inherits\n   DNS-SD features and also tries to be compatible
    in spirit as much as\n   possibel while still maintaining the intended simplicity
    of GRASP.\n\n   The goal of this document is to permit defining service and their\n
    \  parameters once and then use that in GRASP, mDNS and (unicast) DNS.\n   Future
    work can also define DNS-SD &lt;-&gt; GRASP gateway functions.\n\n   In support
    of service discovery, this document also defines name\n   discovery and schemes
    for reuseable elements in GRASP objectives\n   which are designed to be extensible
    so that future work that\n   identifies elements required across multiple objectives
    do not need\n   to define a scheme how to do this.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
