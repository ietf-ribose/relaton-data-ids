abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will
    come\n   the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different\n
    \  cryptographic algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual\n   post-quantum
    algorithms is at question, a multi-key cryptographic\n   operation will need to
    be performed in such a way that breaking it\n   requires breaking each of the
    component algorithms individually.\n   This requires defining new structures for
    holding composite\n   encryption data.\n\n   This document defines a content encryption
    process following the\n   hybrid model as described in the NIST Post-Quantum Crypto
    FAQ.  This\n   draft defines three composite encryption modes.  First, Composite
    Key\n   Transport using Encryption primitives which encrypts a message\n   (typically
    a content encryption key) for a recipient with a composite\n   public key composed
    entirely of encryption keys by encrypting it with\n   multiple one-time-pad keys,
    each encrypted under a different\n   recipient public key.  Second, Composite
    Key Transport using\n   Encryption and KEM primitives is the generalization of
    the previous\n   mode to support a mixture of encryption and KEM algorithms.  Third,\n
    \  Composite Key Exchange is the most general and supports establishing\n   a
    shared secret using any combination of encryption, KEM, and key\n   exchange primitives
    where a master shared secret is generated using\n   NIST SP 800-56Cr2.\n\n\t </p>\n
