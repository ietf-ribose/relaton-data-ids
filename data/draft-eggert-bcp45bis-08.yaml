abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing list
    furthers the development and specification of Internet technology through the
    general discussion of technical, procedural, operational and other topics for
    which no dedicated mailing lists exists. As this is the most general IETF mailing
    list, considerable latitude in terms of topics is allowed, but there are posts
    and topics that are unsuitable for this mailing list. This document defines the
    charter for the IETF discussion list and explains its scope. This document obsoletes
    RFC3005 and updates RFC3683.</p>"
