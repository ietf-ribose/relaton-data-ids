abstract:
  content: "\t <t>One basic model for IETF operations is that the IESG is given generalguidance
    in specific procedural documents but sufficient discretionand flexibility to adapt
    the rules and make new ones in order to makethe IETF work smoothly. This model
    underlies a number of reformproposals, including recent ones from this author.
    However, therehas been an undercurrent of suspicion from some members of thecommunity
    -- suspicion that the IESG is abusive of that discretionand cannot be trusted.
    Those suspicions have, to some extent, beenreinforced by questions about IESG-adopted
    procedures that seem tocontradict procedures approved by the community and documented
    inBCPs. The community cannot move forward with models based on bothtrust and distrust
    in the IESG's ability, and level ofresponsibility, to do its job. In an attempt
    to focus this part ofthe debate, this document proposes to dramatically narrow
    IESG'sscope of authority and discretion.In particular, it proposes to move the
    IESG, procedurally, onto an 'anything not explicitly required is forbidden' model,
    and, indeed, avery narrow and punitive member of that family. While the authorbelieves
    this would be a terrible idea, it appears to be time thatthe community either
    focuses on it and moves in this direction orstops wasting time hinting about it.</p>"
