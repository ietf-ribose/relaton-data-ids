abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism in Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    for peers to provide a proof of ownership of an identity, such as an X.509 certificate.
    This proof can be exported by one peer, transmitted out-of-band to the other peer,
    and verified by the receiving peer.</p>"
