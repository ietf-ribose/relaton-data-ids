abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network edge appliances such as subscriber termination, firewalls,\n
    \  tunnel switching, intrusion detection, and routing are currently\n   provided
    using dedicated network function hardware.  As network\n   function is migrated
    from dedicated hardware platforms into a\n   virtualized environment, a set of
    use cases with application specific\n   requirements begin to emerge.  These use
    cases and requirements cover\n   a broad range of capability and objectives, which
    will require\n   detailed investigation and documentation in order to identify\n
    \  relevant architecture, protocol and procedure solutions.\n\n   This document
    provides an analysis of the key management requirements\n   for applications that
    may be hosted within a virtualized environment.\n   These engineering requirements
    are based on a variety of uses cases\n   and goals , which include: virtual application
    security, reliability,\n   scalability, performance, operation and automation.\n\n
    \  Note that this document is not intended to provide or recommend\n   protocol
    solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
