abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a technique for using as subset HTML as a source
    format for documents in the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and Request for Comments (RFC)
    series. The HTML subset provides equivalent functionality to the traditional XML2RFC
    tool but is designed for ease of use with readily available editing tools. Extensions
    to the HTML markup allow the use of external bibliography files to manage citations
    and references in the manner of BibTeX. Planned extensions include building concordances
    of defined terms and normative language.</p>"
