abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo proposes requirements for protocols between web browsers\nand
    relying parties at websites; these requirements also impact third\nparties involved
    in the authentication process.  These requirements\nminimize the likelihood that
    criminals will be able to gain the\ncredentials necessary to impersonate a user
    or be able to\nfraudulently convince users to disclose personal information.  To\nmeet
    these requirements browsers must change.  Websites must never\nreceive information
    such as passwords that can be used to impersonate\nthe user to third parties.
    \ Browsers should authenticate the website\nto the browser as part of authenticating
    the user to the website.\nBrowsers MUST flag situations when this authentication
    fails and flag\nsituations when the target website is not authorized to accept
    the\nidentity being offered as this is a strong indication of fraud.\nThese requirements
    may serve as a basis for requirements for\npreventing fraud in environments other
    than the web.\n\t </p>\n      "
