abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new SRv6 network function which can be used
    for SRv6 Network Resource Programming. A new SRv6 Endpoint behavior is used to
    associate with a set of network resource partition, called End.NRP. By using the
    End.NRP SID , the SRv6 policy can provide the capability of network resources
    programming.</p>"
