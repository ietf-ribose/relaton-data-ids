abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev2 (IMAP4rev2) allows
    a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server. IMAP4rev2
    permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally
    equivalent to local folders. IMAP4rev2 also provides the capability for an offline
    client to resynchronize with the server. IMAP4rev2 includes operations for creating,
    deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing
    messages, setting and clearing flags, RFC 5322, RFC 2045 and RFC 2231 parsing,
    searching, and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof.
    Messages in IMAP4rev2 are accessed by the use of numbers. These numbers are either
    message sequence numbers or unique identifiers. IMAP4rev2 does not specify a means
    of posting mail; this function is handled by a mail submission protocol such as
    RFC 6409.</p>"
