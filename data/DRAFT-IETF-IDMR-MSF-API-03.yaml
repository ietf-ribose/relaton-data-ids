abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IGMPv3 for IPv4 adds the capability for applications to express\nsource
    filters on multicast group memberships, which allows\nreceiver applications to
    determine the set of senders (sources)\nfrom which to accept multicast traffic.
    \ This capability also\nsimplifies support of one-to-many type multicast applications.
    \ It\nis expected that in the future, the same capability will be\navailable in
    IPv6 as well.\n\nThis document specifies new socket options and ioctl commands
    to\nmanage source filters for IP Multicast group memberships.  It also\ndefines
    the socket structures to provide input and output\narguments to these new APIs.
    \ These extensions are designed to\nprovide access to the source filtering features,
    while introducing\na minimum of change into the system and providing complete\ncompatibility
    for existing multicast applications.\n\t </p>\n      "
