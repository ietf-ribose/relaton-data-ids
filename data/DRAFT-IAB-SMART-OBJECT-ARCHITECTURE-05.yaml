abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The term \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) denotes a trend where
    a large\n   number of embedded devices employ communication services offered by\n
    \  the Internet protocols.  Many of these devices, often called \"smart\n   objects\"
    are not directly operated by humans, but exist as components\n   in buildings
    or vehicles, or are spread out in the environment.\n   Following the theme \"Everything
    that can be connected will be\n   connected\", engineers and researchers designing
    smart object networks\n   need to decide how to achieve this in practice.\n\n
    \  This document offers guidance to engineers designing Internet\n   connected
    smart objects.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
