abstract:
- content: "<p>In some applications it may be necessary to send multiple media encodings
    derived from the same media source in independent RTP media streams. This is called
    Simulcast. This document discusses the best way of accomplishing this in RTP and
    how to signal it in SDP. It is concluded that a solution where the different simulcast
    versions are based on separate SDP media descriptions provides best support for
    simulcast. A solution is defined by making two extensions to SDP. The first extension
    consists of two new attributes in SDP that express capability to send or receive
    simulcast streams, respectively. The second extension describes how to group media
    descriptions belonging to the same simulcast source by using the grouping framework.</p>"
