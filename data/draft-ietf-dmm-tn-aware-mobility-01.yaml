abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework and mapping of slices in 5G mobile
    systems to transport network slices in IP, Layer 2 or Layer 1 transport networks.
    Slices in 5G systems are characterized by latency bounds, reservation guarantees,
    jitter, data rates, availability, mobility speed, usage density, criticality and
    priority. These characteristics mapped to transport network slice include bandwidth,
    latency and criteria such as isolation, directionality and disjoint routes. Mobile
    slice criteria are mapped to the appropriate transport slice and capabilities
    offered in backhaul, midhaul and fronthaul connectivity segments between radio
    side network functions and user plane function(gateway). This document describes
    how mobile network functions map its slice criteria to identifiers in IP and Layer
    2 packets that transport network segments use to grant transport layer services
    during UE mobility scenarios. Applicability of this framework and underlying transport
    networks, which can enable different slice properties are also discussed. This
    is based on mapping between mobile and transport underlays (L2, Segment Routing,
    IPv6, MPLS and IPv4).</p>"
