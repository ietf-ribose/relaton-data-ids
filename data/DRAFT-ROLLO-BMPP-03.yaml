abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    BMPP is a protocol which allows bulk emailers to discover
    if a\n   mailbox is willing to accept bulk email.\n \n   From the bulk emailer's
    point of view, it allows them to find out for\n   certain if their email will
    be accepted or rejected by the recipient.\n \n   From the mailbox owner's point
    of view, it allows them to provide\n   permission to bulk emailers in jurisdictions
    where permission is\n   required, and allows them to express their desire not
    to receive such\n   bulk mailings in jurisdictions where permission is not required.\n\n\t
