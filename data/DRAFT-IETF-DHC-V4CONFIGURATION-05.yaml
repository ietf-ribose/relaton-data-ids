abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, some service providers
    are\n   choosing to deploy IPv6 only networks without dual-stack\n   functionality
    for IPv4.  However, as access to IPv4 based services\n   will continue to be a
    requirement for the foreseeable future, IPv4\n   over IPv6 mechanisms, such as
    softwire tunnels are being developed.\n\n   In order to provision end-user's hosts
    with the IPv4 configuration\n   necessary for such mechanisms, a number of different
    approaches have\n   been proposed.  This memo discusses each of the proposals,
    identifies\n   the benefits and drawbacks and recommends approaches to be used
    as\n   the basis for future deployment and development.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
