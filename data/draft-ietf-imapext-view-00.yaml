abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The VIEW extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4]permits
    a subset of messages in the mailbox to be processedseparately from the entire
    set of messages in the mailbox. Thisallows a client to restrict its view to only
    the messages appearingin this set. The subset of messages also need not be returned
    inorder of their sequence numbers, allowing clients to access messagesin a particular
    sort order.The subsetting and sorting of messages is handled by existing[IMAP4]
    commands that return a set of messages as their result.This extension takes the
    set returned from such a command andapplies the VIEW methodology to it.</p>"
