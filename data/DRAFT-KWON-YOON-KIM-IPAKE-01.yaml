abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Although password authentication is the most widespread user\n
    \  authentication method today, cryptographic protocols for mutual\n   authentication
    and key agreement, i.e., password authenticated key\n   exchange (PAKE), in particular
    authenticated key exchange (AKE) based\n   on a password only, are not actively
    used in the real world. This\n   document introduces a quite novel form of PAKE
    protocols that employ\n   a particular concept of ID-based encryption (IBE). The
    resulting\n   cryptographic protocol is the ID-based password authenticated key\n
    \  exchange (I-PAKE) protocol which is a secure and efficient PAKE\n   protocol
    in both soft- and hard-augmented models. I-PAKE achieves the\n   security goals
    of AKE, PAKE, and hard-augmented PAKE. I-PAKE also\n   achieves the great efficiency
    by allowing the whole pre-computation\n   of the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman public
    keys by both server and\n   client.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
