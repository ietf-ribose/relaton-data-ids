abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document supplements and revises RFC7606.  According to
    RFC\n   7606, when an UPDATE packet received from a neighbor contains an\n   attribute
    of incorrect format, the BGP session cannot be reset\n   directly.  Instead, the
    BGP session must be reset based on the\n   specific problem.  Error packets must
    minimize the impact on routes\n   and do not affect the correctness of the protocol.
    \ Different error\n   handling methods are used.  The error handling methods include\n
    \  discarding attributes, withdrawing routes, disabling the address\n   family,
    and resetting sessions.\n\n   RFC 7606 specifies the error handling methods of
    some existing\n   attributes and provides guidance for error handling of new\n
    \  attributes.\n\n   This document supplements the error handling methods for
    common\n   attributes that are not specified in RFC7606, and provides\n   suggestions
    for revising the error handling methods for some\n   attributes.  The general
    principle remains unchanged: Maintain\n   established BGP sessions and keep valid
    routes updated.  However,\n   discard or delete incorrect attributes or packets
    to minimize the\n   impact on the current session.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
