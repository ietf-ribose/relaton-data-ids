abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a fully-specified simple FEC scheme for
    LDPC-staircase codes that can be used to protect media streams along thelines
    defined by the FECFRAME framework. These codes have manyinteresting properties:
    they are systematic codes, they perform closeto ideal codes in many use-cases
    and they also feature very highencoding and decoding throughputs. LDPC-Staircase
    codes aretherefore a good solution to protect a single high bitrate sourceflow,
    or to protect globally several mid-rate flows within a singleFECFRAME instance.
    They are also a good solution whenever theprocessing load of a software encoder
    or decoder must be kept to aminimum.</p>"
