abstract:
  content: "<p>TCP Delayed Acknowledgments (ACKs) is a widely deployed mechanism that
    allows reducing protocol overhead in many scenarios. However, Delayed ACKs may
    also contribute to suboptimal performance. When a relatively large congestion
    window (cwnd) can be used, less frequent ACKs may be desirable. On the other hand,
    in relatively small cwnd scenarios, eliciting an immediate ACK may avoid unnecessary
    delays that may be incurred by the Delayed ACKs mechanism. This document specifies
    the TCP ACK Rate Request (TARR) option. This option allows a sender to indicate
    the ACK rate to be used by a receiver, and it also allows to request an immediate
    ACK from a receiver.</p>"
