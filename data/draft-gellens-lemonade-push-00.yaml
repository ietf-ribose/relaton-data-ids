abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes an IMAP protocol extension allowing clientsto
    submit new messages using IMAP. This is the so-called 'IMAPPush' approach currently
    being considered by the lemonade workinggroup as one solution to the 'forward
    without download' problem(that is, as a means for clients to send new messages
    consisting ofor containing all or parts of previously received messages withouthaving
    to download and upload the data). This proposal relies onadditional IMAP extensions,
    including CATENATE and Annotations. TheIMAP extension described here requires
    that the message to besubmitted be already composed and ready to go at the time
    ofsubmission.</p>"
