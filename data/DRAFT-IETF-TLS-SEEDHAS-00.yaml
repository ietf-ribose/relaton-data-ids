abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the
    TLS\nprotocol 1.0 [TLS] to support SEED and HAS-160.\nThe SEED algorithm is 128-bit
    symmetric block cipher algorithm.\n[SEED] The HAS-160 is 160-bit secure hash function,
    whose block size\nis 512 bit. [HAS] Both algorithms are developed in Korea since
    1997\nfor stronger communication security.  Currently, SEED is widely used\nand
    is the mandatory cipher in banking and stock applications in\nKorea.\n\t </p>\n
