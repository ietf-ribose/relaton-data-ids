abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Limited Use of Remote Keys (LURK) BOF has been scheduled
    with the\n   objective of discussing approaches to mitigating security risks to\n
    \  TLS private keys.  In particular in situations where a Content\n   Delivery
    Network (CDN) is used to deliver content and thus the party\n   that is being
    authenticated is not the party that the user is\n   attempting to authenticate.\n\n
    \  Three classes of solution are considered, short term credentials, a\n   remote
    service offering to perform private key operations and a\n   remote service that
    is further constrained through the use of some\n   form of threshold approach.
    \ A JSON/HTTP protocol implementing the\n   second and third protocol is demonstrated
    and documented.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
