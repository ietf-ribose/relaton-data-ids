abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Privacy protection is the bigger and bigger concern of many\n
    \  governments and public in general. ND has a few open man-in-the-\n   middle
    attack vectors. MITM is considered among the most dangerous\n   attack types because
    of information leakage. This document proposes\n   minimal modifications for ND
    to protect IPv6 nodes against still\n   open MITM attacks. It could be implemented
    gradually on any nodes,\n   with the biggest benefit from support on routers.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
