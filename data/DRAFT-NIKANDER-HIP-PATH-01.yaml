abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the extensions defined in this document Host Identity
    Protocol\n   (HIP) can traverse legacy Network Address Translators (NATs) and\n
    \  certain firewalls.  The extension will be useful as part of the base\n   exchange
    and with the HIP Registration Extension.  By using a\n   rendezvous server an
    additional entity inside the network is\n   utilized, which not only allows but
    also supports more restrictive\n   NATs to be traversed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
