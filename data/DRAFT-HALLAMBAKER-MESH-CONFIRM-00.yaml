abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mesh Confirmation Protocol (Mesh/Confirm) is a three-party
    Web\n   Service that supports a transactional second factor confirmation\n   mechanism
    that provides a superset of the capabilities of traditional\n   second factor
    authentication schemes.  The three parties in the\n   protocol are Enquirer who
    posts a confirmation request, a Responder\n   who may or may not respond to the
    request and the Broker where the\n   requests and responses are posted.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
