abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the Virtual Router (VR) model of Provider Provisioned VPNs\nmultiple
    VRs may be connected using tunnels over an existing IP\nnetwork, such as IPSec
    or MPLS based tunnels. In the VR model\nthese tunnels often run routing protocols
    such as RIP or OSPF in\norder to distribute route reachability information. This
    memo\npresents methods for assigning a meaningful metric to these tunnel\nlinks
    that can be used by such routing protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
