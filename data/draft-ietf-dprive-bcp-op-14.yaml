abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents operational, policy, and security considerations
    for DNS recursive resolver operators who choose to offer DNS privacy services.
    With these recommendations, the operator can make deliberate decisions regarding
    which services to provide, as well as understanding how those decisions and the
    alternatives impact the privacy of users. This document also presents a non-normative
    framework to assist writers of a Recursive operator Privacy Statement, analogous
    to DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) Policies and DNSSEC Practice Statements described
    in RFC 6841.</p>"
