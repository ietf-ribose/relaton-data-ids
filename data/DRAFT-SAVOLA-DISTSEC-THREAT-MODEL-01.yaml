abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The distributed security framework document describes an approach\n
    \  where hosts take greater responsibility for protecting against\n   attacks
    on security vulnerabilities targeted at themselves.  This\n   memo analyzes the
    threat model of the distributed security approach,\n   in particular pointing
    out areas which the mechanism cannot protect\n   against.\n\n   XXX: generic comment
    from JariA: \"The main issue that I could see is\n   that its still rather simple
    presentation of the issues, e.g. does\n   not necessarily go as deep as some other
    ongoing work goes.\"\n\n   XXX: generic comment from EKR: \"I found the organization
    rather\n   confusing.  It seems to me like a lot of the material in the\n   framework
    document would make more sense in the threat model.\n   Without that context,
    it's fairly hard to understand what you're\n   trying to accomplish.\"  (Similar
    comment from others: addressing this\n   would require significant(?) text duplication
    from the framework\n   doc..)\n\t </p>\n      "
