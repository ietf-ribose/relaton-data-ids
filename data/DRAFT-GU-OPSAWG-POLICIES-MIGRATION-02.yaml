abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In accompany with the migration of a Virtual Machine (VM),
    state\n   associated with the VM located on the Hypervisors and the network\n
    \  side devices (e.g., Firewalls) need to be updated in order to\n   guarantee
    that the services executed on the migrated VM will not be\n   disrupted.  VM vendors
    have their own ways to migrate VM's state on\n   Hypervisors, and so this is out
    the scope of this draft.This draft\n   introduces the background of state migration
    on network devices using\n   several application scenarios and tries to specify
    a clear scope for\n   the future standardization work on state migration on network\n
    \  devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
