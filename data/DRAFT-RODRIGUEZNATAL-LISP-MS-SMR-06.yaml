abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends [RFC6830] to allow Map Servers to send
    SMR\n   messages.\n\n   This extension is intended to be used in some SDN deployments
    that\n   use LISP as a southbound protocol with (P)ITRs that are compliant\n   with
    [RFC6830].  In this use-case mapping updates do not come from\n   ETRs, but rather
    from a centralized controller that pushes the\n   updates directly to the Mapping
    System.  In such deployments, Map\n   Servers will benefit from having a mechanism
    to inform directly\n   (P)ITRs about updates in the mappings they are serving.
    \ Although\n   implementations of this extension exist, this extension is deprecated\n
    \  by [I-D.rodrigueznatal-lisp-pubsub] and it is being documented for\n   informational
    purposes.  Newer implementations should look into\n   [I-D.rodrigueznatal-lisp-pubsub]
    to support PubSub in LISP\n   deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
