abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a survey of commonly used or notable network
    security protocols, with a focus on how they interact and integrate with applications
    and transport protocols. Its goal is to supplement efforts to define and catalog
    transport services [RFC8095] by describing the interfaces required to add security
    protocols. It examines Transport Layer Security (TLS), Datagram Transport Layer
    Security (DTLS), Quick UDP Internet Connections with TLS (QUIC + TLS), MinimalT,
    CurveCP, tcpcrypt, Internet Key Exchange with Encapsulating Security Protocol
    (IKEv2 + ESP), SRTP (with DTLS), and WireGuard. This survey is not limited to
    protocols developed within the scope or context of the IETF.</p>"
