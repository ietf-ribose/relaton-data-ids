abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides illustrations of the use of ENUM [2] \nfunctionality
    within the larger context of service-level call flows \nfor Voice over IP communication
    where interworking between the PSTN \nand IP-based networks are necessary to complete
    a call. Details are \npresented for simple calls made on a 'direct dial' basis.
    Some \ndetails are also provided for calls made using the ITU-defined \n'Global
    Services' [3,4,5]. The impact of number portability within \nthe call scenarios
    is discussed. The objective of this document is \nto identify areas where gaps
    exist in the provision of services and \nsuggest where protocol extensions for
    ENUM, SIP, TRIP, etc. are \nneeded.\n\t </p>\n      "
