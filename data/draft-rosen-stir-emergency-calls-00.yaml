abstract:
- content: "<p>Emergency calls from citizens to authorities, and call back of such
    emergency calls by authorities to citizens need assurances that headers intended
    to get appropriate priority from the networks they traverse, and in some cases,
    appropriate routing. Protection of the SIP Resource Priority Header and the SIP
    Priority header is needed for such calls. This document describes the environment
    for placing emergency calls and call backs which motivate the need and use of
    the mechanisms described in other documents</p>"
