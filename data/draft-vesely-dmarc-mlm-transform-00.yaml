abstract:
- content: "<p>The widespread adoption of Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting,
    and Conformance (DMARC) led Mailing List Managers (MLM) to rewrite the From: header
    field as a workaround. This document describes cases where it is possible to revert
    MLM transformations and hence verify DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) signatures
    that were applied at submission time. For reliable results, some compliance is
    required of all agents involved, author domain signers, MLMs, forwarders, and
    final recipients. MLM transformation reversion reduces the DMARC's effects on
    indirect mail flows.</p>"
