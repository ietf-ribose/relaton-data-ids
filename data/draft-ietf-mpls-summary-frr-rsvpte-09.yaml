abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC 4090 for the Resource Reservation Protocol
    (RSVP) Traffic Engineering (TE) procedures defined for facility backup protection.
    The updates include extensions that reduce the amount of signaling and processing
    that occurs during Fast Reroute (FRR); as a result, scalability when undergoing
    FRR convergence after a link or node failure is improved. These extensions allow
    the RSVP message exchange between the Point of Local Repair (PLR) and the Merge
    Point (MP) nodes to be independent of the number of protected Label Switched Paths
    (LSPs) traversing between them when facility bypass FRR protection is used. The
    signaling extensions are fully backwards compatible with nodes that do not support
    them.</p>"
