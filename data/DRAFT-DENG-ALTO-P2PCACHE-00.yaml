abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transparent forwarding caching effectively localizes the downloading\n
    \  P2P traffic within the sub-net under its coverage resulting in\n   reduction
    of network cost for cross-boundary peer selection, whereas\n   transparent reverse
    caching blocks the uploading traffic outside a\n   wireless sub-net leading to
    elimination of network cost for wireless\n   uploading peer selection.  In other
    words, caching between pairs of\n   endpoints changes the traffic cost along the
    way.\n\n   Therefore, it is proposed to use locations of caches as dividers of\n
    \  different DIPs to guide intra-ISP network abstraction and mark costs\n   among
    them according to the location and type of relevant caches.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
