abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines mobility and multihoming extensions to the
    Host\nIdentity Protocol (HIP).  Specifically, this document defines a\ngeneral
    \"LOCATOR\" parameter for HIP messages that allows for a HIP\nhost to notify peers
    about alternate addresses at which it may be\nreached.  This document also defines
    elements of procedure for\nmobility of a HIP host -- the process by which a host
    dynamically\nchanges the primary locator that it uses to receive packets.  While\nthe
    same LOCATOR parameter can also be used to support end-host\nmultihoming, detailed
    procedures are left for further study.\n\nStatus of This Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft
    is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the\nprovisions of BCP 78 and BCP
