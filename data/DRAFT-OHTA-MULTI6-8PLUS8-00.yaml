abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes 8+8 address format, which is an IPv6 address\nformat
    with locator/ID separation useful for end to end multihoming.\nA 16 byte address
    of an end is separated into two 8 byte fields:\nlocator, which is used to route
    packets to a link to which the end is\nattached, and ID, which is used to globally
    identify the end.\n\nLocators are assigned from (top level) ISPs to sites (and
    lower level\nISPs) in hierarchical and aggregatable manner that a multihomed site\n(and
    ISPs) receive multiple locators from upstream ISPs.\n\nA usual host in a multihomed
    site (or a singly homed site under a\nmultihomed ISP) is expected to have an ID
    and multiple locators and\ntransport layer protocols are expected to handle multiple
    locators of\nthe host and its peer.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
