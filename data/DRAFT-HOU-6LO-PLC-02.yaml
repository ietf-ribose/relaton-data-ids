abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using the electric-power
    lines\n   for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to\n
    \  support Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially the smart\n   meters
    for electricity.  The inherent advantage of existing\n   electricity infrastructure
    facilitates the expansion of PLC\n   deployments, and moreover, a wide variety
    of accessible devices\n   raises the potential demand of IPv6 for future applications.
    \ As part\n   of this technology, Narrowband PLC (NBPLC) is focused on the low-\n
    \  bandwidth and low-power scenarios that includes current standards\n   such
    as IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T G.9903.  This document describes how\n   IPv6 packets
    are transported over constrained PLC networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
