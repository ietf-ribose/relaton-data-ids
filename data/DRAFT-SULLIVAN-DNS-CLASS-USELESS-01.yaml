abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Domain Name System Resource Records are identified in part
    by their\n   class.  The class field is not effective, and it is not used the
    way\n   it appears to have been intended.  This memo makes no recommendation\n
    \  about the DNS parameters registry, but urges those defining new\n   RRTYPEs
    to define them for all classes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
