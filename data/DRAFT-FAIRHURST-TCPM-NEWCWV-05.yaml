abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an update to RFC 5681 to address issues
    that\n   arise when TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where\n
    \  the sending rate is limited by the application rather than the\n   congestion
    window.  It updates TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart\n   quickly following
    either an idle or rate-limited interval.  This\n   method is expected to benefit
    applications that send rate-limited\n   traffic using TCP, while also providing
    an appropriate response if\n   congestion is experienced.\n\n   It also evaluates
    TCP Congestion Window Validation, CWV, an IETF\n   experimental specification
    defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that\n   CWV sought to address important issues,
    but failed to deliver a\n   widely used solution.  This document therefore proposes
    an update to\n   the status of RFC 2861 by recommending it is moved from Experimental\n
    \  to Historic status, and that it is replaced by the current\n   specification.\n\n\t
