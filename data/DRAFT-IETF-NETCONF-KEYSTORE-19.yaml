abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a YANG 1.1 module called \"ietf-keystore\"
    that\n   enables centralized configuration of both symmetric and asymmetric\n
    \  keys.  The secret value for both key types may be encrypted.\n   Asymmetric
    keys may be associated with certificates.  Notifications\n   are sent when certificates
    are about to expire.\n\nEditorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)\n\n   This
    draft contains placeholder values that need to be replaced with\n   finalized
    values at the time of publication.  This note summarizes\n   all of the substitutions
    that are needed.  No other RFC Editor\n   instructions are specified elsewhere
    in this document.\n\n   Artwork in this document contains shorthand references
    to drafts in\n   progress.  Please apply the following replacements:\n\n   *  \"AAAA\"
    --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-crypto-\n      types\n\n
    \  *  \"CCCC\" --&gt; the assigned RFC value for this draft\n\n   Artwork in this
    document contains placeholder values for the date of\n   publication of this draft.
    \ Please apply the following replacement:\n\n   *  \"2020-07-10\" --&gt; the publication
