abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo is a contribution to the ongoing debate in the Megaco
    working\ngroup on the use of SDP or H.245 to describe Termination Descriptors.\nOne
    of the stingy point in the debate has been the need, for some gate-\nways, to
    provide H.323 compatible 'capability exchanges.' It has some-\ntimes been asserted
    that such exchanges would be hard to provide with an\nSDP syntax. This memo, on
    the contrary, provides a simple solution to\nthe problem, based on the following
    ideas:\n*    usage of SDP to describe termination parameters,\n*    usage of the
    audit procedure to enquire about capabilities,\n*    a syntax in the audit procedure
    allowing to return several       termination descriptors, corresponding to alternative
    capability\n     sets,\n*    an algorithm for translating a set of SDP encoded
    capability sets\n     into an H.245 capability descriptor.\n\t </p>\n      "
