abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) defines base YANG
    data\n   models to encode policy, which will point to device-, technology-,\n
    \  and service-specific YANG models developed in other working groups.\n   Policy
    rules within an operator's environment can be used to express\n   high-level,
    possibly network-wide policies to a network management\n   function (within a
    controller, an orchestrator, or a network element).\n   The network management
    function can then control the configuration\n   and/or monitoring of network elements
    and services. This document\n   describes the SUPA basic framework, its elements
    and interfaces.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
