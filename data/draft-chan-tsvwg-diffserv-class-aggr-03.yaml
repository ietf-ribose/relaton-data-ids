abstract:
- content: "<p>In the core of a high capacity network, service differentiation is
    still needed to support applications' utilization of the network. Applications
    with similar traffic characteristics and performance requirements are mapped into
    different diffserv service classes based on end-to-end behavior requirements of
    the applications. However, some network segments may be configured in such a way
    that a single forwarding treatment satisfy the traffic characteristics and performance
    requirements of two or more service classes. For such cases, it may be desirable
    to aggregate two or more service classes into a forwarding treatment. This document
    provides guidelines for aggregation of service classes into forwarding treatments.</p>"
