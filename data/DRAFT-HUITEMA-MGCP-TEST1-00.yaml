abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF Megaco working group is currently working on defining
    a proto-\ncol for controlling Media Gateways (MG) from external control elements\nsuch
    as a Media Gateway Controller (MGC). Different models have been\nproposed to address
    this problem, and in order to judge the different\nmodels, a series of test cases
    will be considered.\n \nThis document explains how the Media Gateway Control Protocol
    (MGCP) can\nbe used to handle the first test case, which considers a Voice over
    IP\ngateway with directly subtending DTMF lines placing a call to an H.323\nclient.
    The document contains an introduction with further details on\nthe test case,
    two different call flows to solve it, followed by the\nconclusion of the test
    case. MGCP is defined in a companion document\n[0].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
