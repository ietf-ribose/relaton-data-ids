abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a practical mechanism to implement
    IP fast\n   reroute using dynamic SPF to compute local and remote loop free \n
    \  nexthops efficiently. Upon link failure, all the destinations \n   reachable
    via the primary nexthop will be forwarded to alternative \n   loop free nexthop,
    if any. If the alternative nexthop is remote, \n   packet will be forwarded using
    any connectionless (for example,\n   IP-in-IP) or connection-oriented (for example,
    MPLS) tunnels. This \n   mechanism doesn't impose any new protocol message/capability
    \n   exchange. It is shown that simple changes to existing IGP shortest\n   path
    computation and routing table structures are sufficient to \n   achieve the desired
    functionality. More over, routers which \n   implement the proposed mechanism
    can co-exist and can be fully\n   backward compatible with existing unmodified
    routers.\n\t </p>\n      "
