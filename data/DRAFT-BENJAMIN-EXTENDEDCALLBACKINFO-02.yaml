abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>AFS cache-control strategy is callback (invalidate) based. The
    \nAFS callback design allows a client to know when an object it \nhas cached is
    no longer consistent, but the callback \nnotification message itself provides
    no specific information \nabout the triggering event. This is a protocol inefficiency,
    as \nin several scenarios it results in unnecessary round-trips to \nfile servers
    to verify file status information, file access \ninformation, or to fetch file
    data which has not changed. We \npropose an extension of the callback mechanism
    to provide \ninformation about the event(s) triggering a callback, in the \npayload
    of the callback notification message itself. The \nproposed mechanism eliminates
    most or all unnecessary \nround-trips imposed by the current callback mechanism,
    and \nsimultaneously allows AFS implementations to (efficiently) \nprovide correct
    semantics in several scenarios involving \nmultiple writers (ie, where AFS currently
    provides incorrect \nsemantics).\n\t </p>\n      "
