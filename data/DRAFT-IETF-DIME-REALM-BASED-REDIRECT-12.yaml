abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Message redirection is a basic capability provided by the Diameter\n
    \  base protocol.  In its conventional form, message redirection is\n   performed
    by an application-independent \"redirect agent\", which\n   returns one or more
    individual hosts to the message sender as\n   possible destinations of the redirected
    message.\n\n   However, in some circumstances an operator may wish to redirect\n
    \  messages to an alternate domain without specifying individual hosts.\n   This
    document specifies an application-specific mechanism by which\n   that can be
    achieved when S-NAPTR is not used for dynamic peer\n   discovery.  New applications
    may incorporate this capability by\n   reference to the present document.\n\n
    \  Because the redirection mechanism is application-specific, it must be\n   performed
    by a Diameter server or proxy rather than a basic redirect\n   agent as defined
    in the Diameter base protocol.  A new term, \"Realm-\n   based Redirect Server\",
    is introduced in this document to\n   differentiate the application-specific nature
    of realm-based\n   redirection from the conventional Diameter redirection performed
    by a\n   basic redirect agent.\n\n   This memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14
    of RFC6733 with respect to\n   the usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time\n
    \  AVPs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
