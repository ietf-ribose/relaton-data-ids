abstract:
  content: "<p>This document introduces the transport of call control related Userto
    User Information (UUI) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),and develops several
    requirements for a new SIP mechanism. Some SIPsessions are established by or related
    to a non-SIP application.This application may have information that needs to be
    transportedbetween the SIP User Agents during session establishment. A commonexample
    in another protocol is the ITU-T Q.931 User to UserInformation Service. As networks
    move to SIP it is important thatapplications requiring this data can continue
    to function in SIPnetworks as well as the ability to interwork with this ISDN
    servicefor end-to-end transparency. This document discusses requirementsand approaches.
    This extension will also be used for native SIPendpoints implementing similar
    services and interworking with ISDNservices. Example use cases include an exchange
    between two useragents, retargeting by a proxy, and redirection. An exampleapplication
    is an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) in a contactcenter.</p>"
