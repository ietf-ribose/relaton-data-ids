abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer
    Traffic\n   Optimization (ALTO) protocol.  It extends the ALTO Cost Map service\n
    \  and ALTO Property Map service so that the application can decide\n   which
    endpoint(s) to connect based on not only numerical/ordinal cost\n   values but
    also details of the paths.  This is useful for\n   applications whose performance
    is impacted by specified components of\n   a network on the end-to-end paths,
    e.g., they may infer that several\n   paths share common links and prevent traffic
    bottlenecks by avoiding\n   such paths.  This extension introduces a new abstraction
    called\n   Abstract Network Element (ANE) to represent these components and\n
    \  encodes a network path as a vector of ANEs.  Thus, it provides a more\n   complete
    but still abstract graph representation of the underlying\n   network(s) for informed
    traffic optimization among endpoints.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
