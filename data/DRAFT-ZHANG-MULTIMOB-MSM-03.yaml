abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in RFC 5213 [1],
    is a network-\n       based mobility management protocol. It uses a Mobile Access
    Gateway\n       (MAG) and a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) to allow hosts to move
    around\n       within a domain while keeping their address or address prefix stable.\n
    \      Although the issues of mobile multicast in the PMIPv6 network are\n       being
    discussed in the Multimob WG, how to provide the service\n       connectivity
    when the multicast source is moving is still a problem\n       for the PMIPv6.
    This document proposes and analyzes the potential\n       solutions of the multicast
    source mobility in PMIPv6.\n\n    \n\t </p>\n      "
