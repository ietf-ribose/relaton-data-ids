abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of this document is to provide information to the
    \ gen-\neral Internet community regarding security expectations of Internet Ser-\nvice
    Providers (ISPs).\n \nIt is not the intent of this document to define a set  of
    \ require-\nments  that would be appropriate for all ISPs, but rather to provide
    the\ncommunity with a framework for discussion of security expectations  with\ncurrent
    and prospective service providers.\n\nThis document is written from  the  perspective
    \ of  the  consumer.\nCompanion documents provide information from the ISP perspective.\n\t
