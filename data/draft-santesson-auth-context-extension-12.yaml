    defined in this document holds data about how the certificate subject was authenticated
    by the Certification Authority that issued the certificate in which this extension
    appears. This document also defines one data structure for inclusion in this extension.
    The data structure is designed to hold information when the subject is authenticated
    using a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertion.</p>"
