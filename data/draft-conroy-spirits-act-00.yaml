abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This Internet Draft has been written at the request of one of theSPIRITS
    Working Group co-chairs in order to elicit discussion on whatextended functionality
    SPIRITS may be used to provide.It has been requested that mapping to any specific
    protocol is notundertaken at this juncture. As such, only 'possible' functionalityis
    identified and no mapping to existing protocol methods is given.This document
    is only intended to provide a basis for discussion andwould be expected to form
    one aspect of the requirements for SPIRITS.As such the terminology used is deliberately
    and (we hope) suitablyambiguous.</p>"
