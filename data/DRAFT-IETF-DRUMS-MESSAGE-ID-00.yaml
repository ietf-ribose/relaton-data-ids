abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This is a proposal of a text to include msgfmt in order to clarify
    the\nrelation between changes in the ''Message-ID'' header and other parts of\na
    message. This information is important, because many mailers use the\n''Message-ID''
    to eliminate duplicates of the same message, and\ninformation may be lost if this
    is not done the right way.\n \nTemporary note\n \nThis document does not at this
    time (21 November 1997) represent any\nconsensus opinion in the drums working
    group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
