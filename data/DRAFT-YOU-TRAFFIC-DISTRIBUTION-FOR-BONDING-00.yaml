abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) Tunnel Bonding as an L3
    overlay\n   tunneling mechanism is used for Hybrid Access (HA) bonding between\n
    \  HCPE (Hybrid Customer Premises Equipment) and HAG (Hybrid Access\n   Gateway).
    \ The bonding performance depends upon the performance for\n   each individual
    link.  This document specifies a trying overflow\n   mechanism to avoid the bonding
    performance downgrading due to the\n   situation that an individual link is disrupted
    or its quality\n   downgrages too much so that the bonding is no longer applicable.\n\n\n\t
