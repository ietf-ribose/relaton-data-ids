abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>VPNs are a common service being offered by providers.  The PPVPN
    WG\nis tasked with defining a limited number of solutions to support the\ninteroperable
    deployment of VPN services.  As part of this effort, a\ndesign team was tasked
    with defining the requirements of PPVPN\ndiscovery proposals, to analyze if additional
    discovery schemes are\nneeded, and to characterize potential solutions to the
    problem. \nThis draft is the output of that design work.  Consensus was not\nreached
    on the solution characteristics.  However, this draft\nattempts to capture the
    discussions and positions of the design team\nexchanges.  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
