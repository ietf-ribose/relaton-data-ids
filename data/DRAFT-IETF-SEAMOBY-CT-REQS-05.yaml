abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The success of time sensitive services like VoIP telephony, video,
    \netc., in a mobile environment depends heavily on the ability to \nminimize the
    impact of the traffic redirection during a change of \npacket forwarding path.
    In the process of establishing the new \nforwarding path, the nodes along the
    new path must be prepared to \nprovide similar forwarding treatment to the IP
    packets. The transfer\nof context information may be advantageous in minimizing
    the impact\nof host mobility on IP services. This document captures the set of
    \nrequirements for a context transfer framework and the requirements\nfor a generic
    context transfer protocol to carry the context between\nthe context transfer peers.\n\t
