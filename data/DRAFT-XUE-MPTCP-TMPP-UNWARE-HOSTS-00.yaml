abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transparent MPTCP Proxy(TMPP) is a network-based function,
    which is\n   under MPTCP architecture.  It can help two MPTCP-unaware hosts enjoy\n
    \  multipath support, and can be extensively used both in the access\n   networks
    and operators' networks.  Meanwhile, in MPTCP architecture\n   with TMPP, TMPP
    needs to modify the received packets and transmit\n   them again(just like gateway
    in NAT environment).  In this document,\n   we also discuss the guarantee for
    data transfer on TMPP's side.  The\n   consideration of data transfer can be expanded
    to the MPTCP\n   architecture with proxy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
