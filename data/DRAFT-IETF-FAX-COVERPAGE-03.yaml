abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In traditional GSTN-based fax, a coverpage is often sent before
    the\nactual document.  Some of the uses for a coverpage are:\no routing the document
    to the correct recipient\no identifying the sender\no providing comments to the
    recipient about the document\no page count\no transmission date\nCurrent fax-over-SMTP
    aware applications do not have a standard way\nto indicate that a coverpage has
    been included with a message, or that\nthere is a good possibilty that a coverpage
    is part of the message.\nThis memo provides a mechanism to indicate that a coverpage
    has been\nincluded or has probably incluced in a message.\n\t </p>\n      "
