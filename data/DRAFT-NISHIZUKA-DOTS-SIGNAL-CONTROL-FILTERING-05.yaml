abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an extension to the DOTS signal channel
    to\n   control the filtering rules when an attack mitigation is active.\n\n   Particularly,
    this extension allows a DOTS client to activate or de-\n   activate existing filtering
    rules during a DDoS attack.  The\n   characterization of these filtering rules
    is supposed to be conveyed\n   by a DOTS client during peace time by means of
    DOTS data channel.\n\nEditorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)\n\n   Please
    update these statements within the document with the RFC\n   number to be assigned
    to this document:\n\n   o  \"This version of this YANG module is part of RFC XXXX;\"\n\n
    \  o  \"RFC XXXX: Controlling Filtering Rules Using DOTS Signal Channel\";\n\n
    \  o  reference: RFC XXXX\n\n   o  [RFCXXXX]\n\n   Please update these statements
    with the RFC number to be assigned to\n   the following documents:\n\n   o  \"RFC
    SSSS: Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling\n      (DOTS) Signal
    Channel Specification\" (used to be\n      [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel])\n\n
    \  o  \"RFC DDDD: Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling\n      (DOTS)
    Data Channel Specification\" (used to be\n      [I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel])\n\n
    \  Please update the \"revision\" date of the YANG module.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
