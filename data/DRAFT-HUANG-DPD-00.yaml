abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a method of detecting a dead IKE peer.  The
    \nmethod, called Dead Peer Detection (DPD) uses IPSec traffic patterns \nto limit
    the number of IKE messages sent.  DPD, like other keepalive \nmechanisms, is often
    necessary to perform IKE peer failover, or to \nreclaim lost resources. \n\n\t
