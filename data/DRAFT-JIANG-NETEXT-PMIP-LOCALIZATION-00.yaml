abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply
    mobility\n   management for mobile nodes (MN) in a local small area. When the\n
    \  numbers of MNs which attaching to the same MAG is very large, how to\n   manage
    those MNs is very urgent. Some MNs are active and have to\n   update the location
    information frequently; other ones are in idle\n   state so how to localize them
    is a little harder. This document\n   proposes a scheme to localize the idle MN
    in the PMIPv6 network. When\n   the MN is moving in the MD, the network can quickly
    obtain its\n   location information to achieve the state synchronization and reduce\n
    \  the data forwarding delay.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
