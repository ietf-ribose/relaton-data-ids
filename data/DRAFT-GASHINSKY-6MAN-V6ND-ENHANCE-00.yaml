abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough
    to cover\n   the actual number of machines on the subnet.  In contrast, the\n
    \  default IPv6 subnet size is a /64, a number so large it covers\n   trillions
    of addresses, the overwhelming number of which will be\n   unassigned.  Consequently,
    simplistic implementations of Neighbor\n   Discovery can be vulnerable to denial
    of service attacks whereby they\n   attempt to perform address resolution for
    large numbers of unassigned\n   addresses.  Such denial of attacks can be launched
    intentionally (by\n   an attacker), or result from legitimate operational tools
    that scan\n   networks for inventory and other purposes.  As a result of these\n
    \  vulnerabilities, new devices may not be able to \"join\" a network, it\n   may
    be impossible to establish new IPv6 flows, and existing ipv6\n   transported flows
    may be interrupted.\n\n   This document describes possible modifications to the
    traditional\n   [RFC4861] neighbor discovery protocol for improving the resilience
    of\n   the neighbor discovery process as well as an alternative method for\n   maintaining
    ND caches.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
