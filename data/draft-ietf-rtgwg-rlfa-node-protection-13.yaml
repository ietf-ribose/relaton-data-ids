abstract:
- content: <p>The loop-free alternates (LFAs) computed following the current remote-LFA
    specification guarantees only link protection. The resulting remote-LFA next hops
    (also called "PQ-nodes") may not guarantee node protection for all destinations
    being protected by it. This document describes an extension to the remote-loop-free-based
    IP fast reroute mechanisms that specifies procedures for determining whether or
    not a given PQ-node provides node protection for a specific destination. The document
    also shows how the same procedure can be utilized for the collection of complete
    characteristics for alternate paths. Knowledge about the characteristics of all
    alternate paths is a precursor to applying the operator-defined policy for eliminating
    paths not fitting the constraints.</p>
