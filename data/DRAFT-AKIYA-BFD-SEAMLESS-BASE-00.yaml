abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a generic simplified mechanism to
    use\n   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) with large portions of\n   negotiation
    aspects eliminated, and to allow full and partial\n   reachability validations.
    \ For MPLS based BFD, extensions to the\n   generic mechanism are defined for
    BFD to perform a level of label\n   verifications.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
