abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft proposes a PMIP-based routing optimization method
    in\n   distributed anchor architecture.  The anchor of the mobile node is\n   able
    to communicate with the anchor of corresponding node directly\n   using optimized
    routing.  In this draft, there are two modes for the\n   setup of routing optimization:
    the direct mode and the relay mode.\n   The difference of them lies in that the
    routing optimization is set\n   up directly or under the assistance of a third
    anchor.  The situation\n   that Communication Node(CN) is a fixed terminal or
    a content server\n   is also considered and 3 solutions are provided correspondingly.
    \ The\n   method proposed in this draft can reduce the delay and ve signaling\n
    \  overhead in the current scheme.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
