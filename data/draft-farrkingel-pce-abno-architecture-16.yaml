abstract:
- content: "<p>Services such as content distribution, distributed databases, or inter-data
    center connectivity place a set of new requirements on the operation of networks.
    They need on-demand and application-specific reservation of network connectivity,
    reliability, and resources (such as bandwidth) in a variety of network applications
    (such as point-to-point connectivity, network virtualization, or mobile back-haul)
    and in a range of network technologies from packet (IP/MPLS) down to optical.
    An environment that operates to meet these types of requirements is said to have
    Application-Based Network Operations (ABNO). ABNO brings together many existing
    technologies and may be seen as the use of a toolbox of existing components enhanced
    with a few new elements. This document describes an architecture and framework
    for ABNO, showing how these components fit together. It provides a cookbook of
    existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and meet the needs of the applications.</p>"
