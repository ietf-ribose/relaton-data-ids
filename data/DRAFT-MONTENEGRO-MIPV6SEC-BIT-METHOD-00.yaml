abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IPv6 uses 'return routability' to secure route optimization.\nEven
    after using this procedure, there are residual threats for which\nother stronger
    methods provide protection.  Since these are optional,\nand return routability
    is the default, an attacker may engage in\n'bidding down' attacks.  These attacks
    aim at coercing participants\nin Mobile IPv6 route optimization to forgo the stronger
    methods for\nthe default return routability.  This document discusses what the\nparticipants
    in route optimization can do to deter or alleviate\nbidding down attacks: the
    'step down' procedure for the mobile node\nand the 'bit method' at the correspondent
    node.\n\t </p>\n      "
