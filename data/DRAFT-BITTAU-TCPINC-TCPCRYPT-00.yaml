abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents tcpcrypt, a TCP extension for\n   cryptographically
    protecting TCP segments.  Tcpcrypt maintains the\n   confidentiality of data transmitted
    in TCP segments against a passive\n   eavesdropper.  It protects connections against
    denial-of-service\n   attacks involving desynchronizing of sequence numbers, and
    when\n   enabled, against forged RST segments.  Finally, applications that\n   perform
    authentication can obtain end-to-end confidentiality and\n   integrity guarantees
    by tying authentication to tcpcrypt Session ID\n   values.\n\n   The extension
    defines two new TCP options, CRYPT and MAC, which are\n   designed to provide
    compatible interworking with TCPs that do not\n   implement tcpcrypt.  The CRYPT
    option allows hosts to negotiate the\n   use of tcpcrypt and establish shared
    secret encryption keys.  The MAC\n   option carries a message authentication code
    with which hosts can\n   verify the integrity of transmitted TCP segments.  Tcpcrypt
    is\n   designed to require relatively low overhead, particularly at servers,\n
    \  so as to be useful even in the case of servers accepting many TCP\n   connections
    per second.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
