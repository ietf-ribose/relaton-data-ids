abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) is a generalization
    of\n   the applicability of the Pseudowire (PW) Associated Channel Header\n   (ACH).
    \ RFC 5586 defines the concept of Type-Length-Variable (TLV)\n   constructs that
    can be carried in messages on the G-ACh by placing\n   them in the ACH.\n\n   No
    Associated Channel Type yet defined uses a TLV.  Furthermore, it\n   is believed
    that handling TLVs in hardware introduces significant\n   problems to the fast-path,
    and since G-ACh messages are intended to\n   be processed substantially in hardware,
    the use of TLVs in\n   undesirable.\n\n   This document updates RFC 5586 by retiring
    ACH TLVs and removing the\n   associated registry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
