abstract:
- content: "<p>Appendix A of the IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) document in
    RFC 4862 discusses Loopback Suppression and DAD. However, RFC 4862 does not settle
    on one specific automated means to detect loopback of Neighbor Discovery (ND of
    RFC 4861) messages used by DAD. Several service provider communities have expressed
    a need for automated detection of looped backed ND messages used by DAD. This
    document includes mitigation techniques and then outlines the Enhanced DAD algorithm
    to automate detection of looped back IPv6 ND messages used by DAD. For network
    loopback tests, the Enhanced DAD algorithm allows IPv6 to self-heal after a loopback
    is placed and removed. Further, for certain access networks the document automates
    resolving a specific duplicate address conflict.</p>"
