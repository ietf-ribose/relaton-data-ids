abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Function Virtualization (NFV) aims at evolving the
    way\n   network operators design, deploy and provision their networks by\n   leveraging
    standard IT virtualization technologies to move and\n   consolidate a wide range
    of network functions and services onto\n   industry standard high volume servers,
    switches and storage.  Primary\n   area of impact for operators is the network
    edge, being stimulated by\n   the recent updates on NFV and SDN.  In fact, operators
    are looking at\n   their future datacenters and Points of Presence (PoPs) as\n
    \  increasingly dynamic infrastructures to deploy Virtualized Network\n   Functions
    (VNFs) and on-demand chained services with high elasticity.\n\n   This document
    presents an orchestration framework for automated\n   deployment of highly available
    VNF chains.  Resiliency of VNFs and\n   chained services is a key requirement
    for operators to improve, ease,\n   automate and speed up services lifecycle management.
    \ The proposed\n   VNFs orchestration framework is also positioned with respect
    to\n   current NFV and Service Function Chaining (SFC) architectures and\n   solutions.\n\n\t
