abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a TCP option for use by middleboxes
    to\n   facilitate transparent detection of other middleboxes along the path\n
    \  of the TCP connection during the connection initiation phase.  The\n   option
    has no effect if an appropriate middlebox is not present on\n   the path.  The
    TCP end hosts are unaware of this option and its usage\n   is strictly for use
    by TCP middleboxes.  Multiple vendors of WAN\n   optimization products have used
    similar (but incompatible and\n   proprietary) mechanisms since at least 2004.
    \ Those existing vendor\n   systems use multiple TCP option code points, all of
    which are\n   officially unassigned by IANA.  The goal of this memo is to\n   standardize
    a single TCP option code point for this functionality.\n   This memo is the product
    of discussion among some of the vendors\n   currently using incompatible proprietary
    TCP options for middlebox\n   discovery.  It is a non-goal of this memo to achieve
    interoperability\n   of middlebox discovery between multiple vendors.  It needs
    to be\n   noted that an earlier document\n   [I-D.knutsen-tcpm-middlebox-discovery],
    is re-written as the current\n   document after agreement from multiple vendors.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
