abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n
    \  In particular, it describes managed objects for information related\n   to
    the Fibre Channel network's Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF)\n   routing protocol.
    \ At present, this memo is in development as part of\n   the SM-FSM project of
    T11.5 (http://www.t11.org).  The plan is that\n   it will later become a work
    item of IETF's IMSS working group.\n\t </p>\n      "
