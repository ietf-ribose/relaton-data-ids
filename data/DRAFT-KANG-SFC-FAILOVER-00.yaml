abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architecture, a SDN\n
    \  controller establishes flow paths.  SDN controller, classifier, and\n   SFF(Service
    Function Forwarder) do closely interact for SFC packet\n   transmission.  However,
    failure can happen at some nodes in SFC-\n   enabled domain preventing packet
    forwarding, and such situation\n   should be avoided.  Backup SF(Service Function)
    can be one of\n   solutions.  Additionally, mandatory/optional criterion can decide\n
    \  whether to bypass the failed SF.  In this document, we illustrate\n   failover
    method locally by SFF and globally by controller.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
