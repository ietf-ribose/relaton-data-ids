abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes CSIP, a protocol architecture that provides
    thesupport of TCAP user applications over an IP network. The core part ofthe CSIP
    architecture is the specification of the CSIP (ConnectionlessSCCP over IP) adaptation
    layer, that provides adaptation between theSCCP layer already defined in [2] and
    the IP family protocols IP, UDP,TCP and ICMP. UDP is used when SCCP class 0 is
    used, TCP is usedwhen SCCP class 1 is used. CSIP provides the primitives and parametersto
    SCCP than MTP, and provides backward compatibility that guaranteesthe seamless
    connection between nodes implementing CSIP and classicalSS7 nodes by means of
    a CSIP gateway. The design of CSIP is oriented tofulfill the requirements of TCAP
    user applications running on a WAN.</p>"
