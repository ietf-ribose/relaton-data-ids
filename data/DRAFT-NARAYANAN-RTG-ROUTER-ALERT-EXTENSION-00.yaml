abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IP Router Alert Option is an IP option that alerts transit\nrouters
    to more closely examine the contents of an IP packet.  RSVP,\nPGM and IGMP are
    some of the protocols which make use of the IP\nRouter Alert option.  The current
    specification for the IP Router\nAlert Option does not define mechanisms to facilitate
    discriminating\nacross different users of Router Alert.  As a result, networks
    using\nrouter Alert may have more secuity exposure than necessary and/or may\nunnecessarily
    block some transit Router Alert packets.  This document\ndescribes new rules for
    the IP Router-Alert Option that aid routers\nto process these packets more selectively.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
