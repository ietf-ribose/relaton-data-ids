abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Service Providers (NSPs) are currently considering to deploy
    Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) within their networks. As a consequence of this
    development, there is a need for interconnecting these local CDNs. The necessary
    interfaces for inter-connecting CDNs are currently being defined in the Content
    Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) WG. This document focuses on the CDNI
    Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI). Specifically, this
    document outlines how the solutions currently being defined in the Application
    Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) WG can facilitate Footprint &amp; Capabilities
    Advertisement in a CDNI context, i.e. how the CDNI FCI can be realised with the
    ALTO protocol. Concrete examples of how ALTO can be integrated within CDNI request
    routing and in particular in the process of selecting a downstream CDN are given.
    The examples in this document are based on the use cases and examples currently
    being discussed in the CDNI WG.</p>"
