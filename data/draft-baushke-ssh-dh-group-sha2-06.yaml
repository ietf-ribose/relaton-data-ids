abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two added Modular Exponential (MODP) Groups for
    the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. It also updates [RFC4253], [RFC4419], [RFC4462],
    and [RFC5656] by specifying the set key exchange algorithms that currently exist
    and which ones MUST, SHOULD, MAY, and SHOULD NOT be implemented including two
    new Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithms using SHA-2 hashes.</p>"
