abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a protocol independent message format for
    \nrequesting and reporting state related to keys or buttons.  The \ndocument also
    defines a SIP Event Package to make use of this \nextensible framework through
    the SIP SUBSCRIBE &amp; NOTIFY messages. \nThe draft currently defines key event
    sub-packages to represent the \nstate of telephone dial pads, feature buttons
    found on many \ncommercial telephones, standard keyboards as well as support for
    \nuser or device specific buttons (for instance, a 'Double Latte' \nbutton).  The
    event package and associated key packages can be used \nto enable new SIP services
    where an application or SIP entity \nrequires notification of user interface activity
    either associated \nwith a particular SIP session or simply in relation to the
    device \nitself. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
