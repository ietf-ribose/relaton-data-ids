abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes how to use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol,
    HTTP, for communication across delay- and disruption-tolerant networks, by making
    every transit node in the network HTTP-capable, and doing peer HTTP transfers
    between nodes to move data hop-by-hop or subnet-by-subnet towards its final destination.
    HTTP is well- known and straightforward to implement in these networks.</p>"
