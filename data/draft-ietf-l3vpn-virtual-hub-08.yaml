abstract:
- content: "<p>With BGP/MPLS Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), providing any-to-any
    connectivity among sites of a given VPN would require each Provider Edge (PE)
    router connected to one or more of these sites to hold all the routes of that
    VPN. The approach described in this document allows the VPN service provider to
    reduce the number of PE routers that have to maintain all these routes by requiring
    only a subset of these routers to maintain all these routes. Furthermore, when
    PE routers use ingress replication to carry the multicast traffic of VPN customers,
    the approach described in this document may, under certain circumstances, reduce
    bandwidth inefficiency associated with ingress replication and redistribute the
    replication load among PE routers.</p>"
