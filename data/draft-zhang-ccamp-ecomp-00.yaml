abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a usecase, called enhanced coordinated multi-
    point (eCoMP), for integreting radio and optical networks. It focus on the fronthaul
    flexibility that allows "any-RRH_A to any-BBU_A" connection to improve the eCoMP
    service performance. The procedure of the usecase is based on the unified radio
    and optical control archtecture, and an extended OpenFlow protocol is introduced
    to realize the procedure.</p>
