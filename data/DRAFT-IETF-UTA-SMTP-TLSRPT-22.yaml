abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels\n
    \  between SMTP Mail Transfer Agents, including STARTTLS, DANE TLSA, and\n   MTA-STS.
    \ These protocols can fail due to misconfiguration or active\n   attack, leading
    to undelivered messages or delivery over unencrypted\n   or unauthenticated channels.
    \ This document describes a reporting\n   mechanism and format by which sending
    systems can share statistics\n   and specific information about potential failures
    with recipient\n   domains.  Recipient domains can then use this information to
    both\n   detect potential attacks and diagnose unintentional\n   misconfigurations.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
