abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is a position paper.  It documents the author's personal
    views\n   on how Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities ought to be accommodated\n
    \  in ICN protocols like CCNx or NDN which employ flow-balanced\n   Interest/Data
    exchanges and hop-by-hop forwarding state as their\n   fundamental machinery.
    \ It argues that such protocols demand a\n   substantially different approach
    to QoS from that taken in TCP/IP,\n   and proposes specific design patterns to
    achieve both classification\n   and differentiated QoS treatment on both a flow
    and aggregate basis.\n   It also considers the effect of caches as a resource
    in addition to\n   memory, CPU and link bandwidth that should be subject to explicitly\n
    \  unfair resource allocation.  The proposed methods are intended to\n   operate
    purely at the network layer, providing the primitives needed\n   to achieve both
    transport and higher layer QoS objectives.  It\n   explicitly excludes any discussion
    of Quality of Experience (QoE)\n   which can only be assessed and controlled at
    the application layer or\n   above.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
