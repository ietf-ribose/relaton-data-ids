abstract:
- content: "<p>It seems reasonable to suggest that, despite the huge variety of types
    of endpoints on the Internet, there are categories of similarity. These categories
    are important because categories of endpoint devices may share particular advantages
    or limitations for endpoint security. This draft attempts to suggest a classification
    of endpoints as a foundation for further work on operational security. The goal
    is to identify classes of endpoints with similar characteristics. Those characteristics
    may lead to the discovery that the devices in a particular category share similar
    characteristics for endpoint security.</p>"
