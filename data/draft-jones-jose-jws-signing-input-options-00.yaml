abstract:
- content: "<p>JSON Web Signature (JWS) represents the payload of a JWS as a base64url
    encoded value and uses this value in the JWS Signature computation. While this
    enables arbitrary payloads to be integrity protected, some have described use
    cases in which the base64url encoding is unnecessary and/or an impediment to adoption,
    especially when the payload is large and/or detached. This specification defines
    a means of accommodating these use cases by defining an option to change the JWS
    Signing Input computation to not base64url- encode the payload. Also, JWS includes
    a representation of the JWS Protected Header and a period ('.') character in the
    JWS Signature computation. While this cryptographically binds the protected Header
    Parameters to the integrity protected payload, some of have described use cases
    in which this binding is unnecessary and/or an impediment to adoption, especially
    when the payload is large and/or detached. This specification defines a means
    of accommodating these use cases by defining an option to change the JWS Signing
    Input computation to not include a representation of the JWS Protected Header
    and a period ('.') character in the JWS Signing Input. These options are intended
    to broaden the set of use cases for which the use of JWS is a good fit.</p>"
