abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Monitoring, metering and accounting of packets are increasingly\n
    \  important functionalities that need to be provided in the Internet.\n   This
    document motivates and describes a framework for the path-\n   coupled configuration
    of Metering Entities to record monitoring and\n   measurement data and report
    it to a data collector.  Different\n   scenarios are described where such a path-coupled
    configuration is\n   useful.  Currently, the focus is on two scenarios: accounting
    and QoS\n   measurement.\n\n   Moreover, this document gathers requirements for
    a path-coupled\n   configuration protocol of Metering Entities.  Finally, the\n
    \  applicability of the NSIS architecture for this purpose is discussed.\n   The
    protocol itself is specified in a separate document\n   [I-D.dressler-nsis-metering-nslp]\n\n\t
