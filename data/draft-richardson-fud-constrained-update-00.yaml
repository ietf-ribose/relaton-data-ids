abstract:
- content: "<p>This document details the problems of upgrading small devices that
    need complete firmware replacements, but which do not have enough storage to keep
    an entire copy of the replacement image. In addition to detailing the specific
    challenge, a conceptual architecture for a solution is posited involving use of
    DTLS session resumption tickets with CoAP Block Transfer mode.</p>"
