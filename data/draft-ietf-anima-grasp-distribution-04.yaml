abstract:
- content: "<p>Autonomic network infrastructure (ANI) is a generic platform for tenant
    applications (i.e. AFs). As we will see in some examplery use cases, AFs may not
    only require communication capability supported from the infrastructure side,
    but also the capability the infrastructure can hold and re-distribute information
    on-demand. This document proposes a set of solutions for information distribution
    in the ANI. Information distribution is categorized into two different modes:
    1) instantaneous distribution and 2) publishing for retrieval. In the former case,
    the information is sent, propagated and disposed of after reception. In the latter
    case, information needs to be stored in the network; additionally, conflict resolution
    is also needed when information stored in the network is updated with proposals
    from two different AFs. The capability of information distribution is a fundamental
    need for an autonomous network ([RFC7575]). This document describes typical use
    cases of information distribution in ANI and requirements to ANI, such that abundant
    ways of information distribution can be natively supported. This draft proposes
    a series of extensions to the autonomic nodes and suggests an implementation based
    on GRASP ([RFC8990]) extensions as a protocol on the wire.</p>"
