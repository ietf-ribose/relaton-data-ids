abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IGMP is used by IPv4 system to report their multicast group\n
    \  memberships to multicast routers.\n   \n   This document adds support for router
    annoucing information, that\n   is, the ability for a multicast router to annouce
    information about a\n   group to host. For example, some hosts may send reports
    to join a\n   group that do not exist, so the router would send some message to\n
    \  inform the hosts.\n\t </p>\n      "
