abstract:
  content: <p>This document proposes an RFC 3933 [RFC3933] experiment for the IETFRFC
    publication process. The experiment is limited in scope andduration. The specific
    experiment has been chosen because (a) it haspotential to provide a significant
    process improvement, (b) it can beexecuted at a low cost, (c) it addresses a widely
    recognized problemin the IETF process, and (d) tool support can be (and has been)
    builtfor it. The experiment relates to the copyediting and other manualtasks in
    the publication process. Specifically, the amount of workthese manual tasks require
    differs widely between drafts, and for acertain subset of drafts there are either
    very minor editorialchanges or no changes needed at all, if we discount the differentformatting
    requirements between RFCs and drafts. The experimentinvolves identification of
    this subset of drafts and processing themseparately with a "fast path" process
    that uses almost entirelyautomated processes. For the drafts that belong to this
    subset, itis expected that the RFC Editor queuing time is reduced from monthsor
    years to weeks or less.</p>
