abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC TBD describes a new model and set of requirements to implement
    a\n   labeling system on Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) objects where\n   the
    entity in charge of doing the label enforcement is under the\n   control of a
    central authority rather than the recipient of the\n   object.\n\n   This document
    describes a protocol to be used by senders and\n   recipients of CMS objects to
    communicate with a centralized label\n   enforcement server.  The document outlines
    how a client will get the\n   set of labels or policies that it can use for sending
    messages,\n   composes a secure CMS object with a label on it and gets the\n   necessary
    keys to decrypt a CMS object from the server.  This\n   document is designed to
    be used with RFC TBD2 which describes the\n   extensions used in CMS objects to
    hold the label information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
