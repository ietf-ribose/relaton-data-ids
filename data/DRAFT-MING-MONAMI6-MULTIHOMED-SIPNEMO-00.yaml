abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network mobility is proposed to let a mobile network change
    its point\n   of attachment and still to keep all nodes attached to the mobile\n
    \  network globally reachable.  However, due to scare bandwidth, limited\n   signaling
    coverage and frequent link failure, a mobile network needs\n   multihoming, i.e.,
    multiple paths simultaneously to access the\n   Internet, on the perspective of
    performance and reliability.  The\n   document specifies how to support multihoming
    in network mobility\n   using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The proposed
    Multihomed\n   SIP-based Network Mobility (SIP-NEMO) can dynamically select a
    path\n   per session according to the status of egress interfaces and/or\n   gateways.\n\n\n\n\t
