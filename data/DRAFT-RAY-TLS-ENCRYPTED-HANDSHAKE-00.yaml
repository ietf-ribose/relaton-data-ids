abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    extension\n   which allows endpoints to negotiate the use of encryption with\n
    \  forward secrecy at the beginning of the handshake.  Two levels of\n   functionality
    are defined.  Implementations are free to support one\n   or both levels, with
    the first level incurring no additional\n   computational or round-trip overhead.
    \ The TLS cryptographic\n   calculations are unchanged.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
