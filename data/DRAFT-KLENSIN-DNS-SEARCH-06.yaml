abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo discusses strategies for supporting 'DNS searching'
    --\nfinding of names in the DNS, or references that will ultimately point\nto
    DNS names, by a mechanism layered above the DNS itself that\npermits fuzzy matching,
    selection that uses attributes or facets, and\nuse of descriptive terms. Demand
    for these facilities appear to be\nincreasing with growth in the Internet (and
    especially the web) and\nwith requirements to move beyond the restricted subset
    of ASCII names\nthat have been the traditional contents of DNS 'Class=IN'.  This\ndocument
    proposes a three-level system for access to DNS names in\nwhich the upper two
    levels involve search, rather than lookup\n(exactly known target), functions.
    It also discusses some of the\nissues and challenges in completing the design
    of, and deploying,\nsuch a system.\n\t </p>\n      "
