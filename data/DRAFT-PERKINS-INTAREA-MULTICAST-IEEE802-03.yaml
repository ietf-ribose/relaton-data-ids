abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Performance issues have been observed when multicast packet\n
    \  transmissions of IETF protocols are used over IEEE 802 wireless\n   media.
    \ Even though enhamcements for multicast transmissions have\n   been designed
    at both IETF and IEEE 802, there seems to exist a\n   disconnect between specifications,
    implementations and configuration\n   choices.  This draft describes the different
    issues that have been\n   observed, the multicast enhancement features that have
    been specified\n   at IETF and IEEE 802 for wireless media, as well as the operational\n
    \  chioces that can be taken to improve the performace of the network.\n   Finally,
    it provides some recommendations about the usage and\n   combination of these
    features and operational choices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
