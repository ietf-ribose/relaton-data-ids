abstract:
- content: "<p>RSVP has been extended in several directions [Policy], [Identity],
    [DCLASS], [AggrRSVP], [DiffModel],[COPS-RSVP], These extensions have broadened
    the applicability of RSVP characterizing it as a signaling protocol usable outside
    the IntServ model. With the addition of the 'Null Service Type' [NullServ], RSVP
    is being adopted also by mission critical applications that require some form
    of prioritized service, but cannot readily specify their resource requirements.
    These applications do not need to set-up a reservation end-to-end, but only to
    signal to the network their policy information [Policy], [Identity] and obtain
    in response an applicable DSCP [DCLASS]. RSVP Receiver Proxy is an extension to
    the RSVP message processing (not to the protocol itself), mainly designed to operate
    in conjunction with the Null Service Type and with an extension of the COPS for
    RSVP protocol [COPS-RSVP-EXT].</p>"
