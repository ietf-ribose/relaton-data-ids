abstract:
  content: "\t <t>RSVP has been extended in several directions [Policy], [Identity],[DCLASS],
    [AggrRSVP], [DiffModel],[COPS-RSVP], These extensions havebroadened the applicability
    of RSVP characterizing it as a signalingprotocol usable outside the IntServ model.With
    the addition of the 'Null Service Type' [NullServ], RSVP isbeing adopted also
    by mission critical applications that require someform of prioritized service,
    but cannot readily specify theirresource requirements. These applications do not
    need to set-up areservation end-to-end, but only to signal to the network theirpolicy
    information [Policy], [Identity] and obtain in response anapplicable DSCP [DCLASS].RSVP
    Receiver Proxy is an extension to the RSVP message processing(not to the protocol
    itself), mainly designed to operate inconjunction with the Null Service Type and
    with an extension of theCOPS for RSVP protocol [COPS-RSVP-EXT].</p>"
