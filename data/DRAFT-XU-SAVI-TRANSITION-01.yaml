abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many proposals have been presented for preventing IP spoofing
    from\n   occurring in network. An outstanding of them is the SAVI (Source\n   Address
    Validation Improvement) proposal which was advocated by IETF\n   SAVI workgroup
    for solving this problem from user access switch. SAVI\n   Working Group is developing
    standardize mechanisms that prevent nodes\n   attached to the same IP link from
    spoofing each other's IP addresses,\n   and achieve IP source address validation
    at a finer granularity.\n   However, up to now, to the best of our knowledge,
    none of them has\n   focused on the scenarios of 4over6 transition, that is, IPv4
    packets\n   transit IPv6 network and arrive at other edge IPv4 network(s). With\n
    \  the boom of IPv6 networks, this issue becomes more and more urgent.\n   In
    addition, since 4over6 plans are plenty and various, one solution\n   cannot meet
    all requirements of these plans. This document describes\n   a framework of IP
    source address validation and traceback for 4over6\n   transition scenarios, which
    extract out the essential and mutual\n   properties from these plans and form
    corresponding sub-solution for\n   each property. When one 4over6 plan is combined
    by some of them, the\n   solution of IP source address validation and traceback
    for this plan\n   are directly comprised of the combination of corresponding sub-\n
    \  solution. Thus, the most exciting advantage of this framework is that\n   it
    is a once for all solution no matter how 4over6 plans changes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
