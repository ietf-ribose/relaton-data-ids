abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When there is a change in network topology either due to a
    link going\n   down or due to a new link addition, all the nodes in the network
    need\n   to get the complete view of the network and re-compute the routes.\n
    \  There will generally be a small time window when the forwarding state\n   of
    each of the nodes is not synchronized.  This can result in\n   transient loops
    in the network, leading to dropped traffic due to\n   over-subscription of links.
    \ Micro-looping is generally more harmful\n   than simply dropping traffic on
    failed links, because it can cause\n   control traffic to be dropped on an otherwise
    healthy link involved\n   in micro-loop.  This can lead to cascading adjacency
    failures or\n   network meltdown.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
