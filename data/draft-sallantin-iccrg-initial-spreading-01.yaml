abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new fast start-up mechanism for TCP that can
    be used to speed the beginning of an Internet connection and then improved the
    short-lived TCP connections performance. Initial Spreading allows to safely increase
    the Initial Window size in any cases, and notably in congested networks. Merging
    the increase in the IW with the spacing of the segments belonging to the Initial
    Window (IW), Initial Spreading is a very simple mechanism that improves short-lived
    TCP flows performance and do not deteriorate long-lived TCP flows performance.</p>"
