abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document addresses a vulnerability in publicly accessible
    SIP\nservers (servers includes both UASes and proxies) that enables them\nto be
    used as an amplifier in an untracable reflected denial of\nservice attack.  The
    amplification ratio is between 1:10 to over\n1:350 in both packets and bytes.\n\nAs
    a proposed solution, a mechanism for stateless cookie exchange\nbetween a SIP
    server and client to ensure that a public SIP server\nthat wishes to accept SIP
    requests from hosts over datagram can not\nbe used as an amplifier for a denial
    of service attack.  This brings\nSIP over datagram transports (such as UDP) in
    line with TCP in terms\nof routability to the source IP address.\n\t </p>\n      "
