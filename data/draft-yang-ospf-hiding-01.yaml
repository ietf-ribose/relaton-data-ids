abstract:
- content: "<p>A transit-only network is defined as a network connecting routers only.
    In OSPF, transit-only networks are usually configured with routable IP addresses,
    which are advertised in LSAs but not needed for data traffic. In addition, remote
    attacks can be launched against routers by sending packets to these transit-only
    networks. This document presents a mechanism to hide transit-only networks to
    speed up network convergence and minimize remote attack vulnerability.</p>"
