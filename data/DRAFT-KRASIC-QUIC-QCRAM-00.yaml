abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The design of the core QUIC transport and the mapping of HTTP\n
    \  semantics over it subsume many HTTP/2 features, prominent among them\n   stream
    multiplexing and HTTP header compression.  A key advantage of\n   the QUIC transport
    is that provides stream multiplexing free of HoL\n   blocking between streams,
    while in HTTP/2 multiplexed streams can\n   suffer HoL blocking primarily due
    to HTTP/2's layering above TCP.\n   However, assuming HPACK is used for header
    compression, HTTP over\n   QUIC is still vulnerable to HoL blocking, because of
    how HPACK\n   exploits header redundancies between multiplexed HTTP transactions.\n
    \  This draft defines QCRAM, a variation of HPACK and mechanisms in the\n   QUIC
    HTTP mapping that allow QUIC implementations the flexibility to\n   avoid header-compression
    induced HoL blocking.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
