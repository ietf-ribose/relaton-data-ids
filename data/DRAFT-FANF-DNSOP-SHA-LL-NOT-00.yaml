abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNSSEC deployments have often used the SHA-1 cryptographic
    hash\n   algorithm to provide authentication of DNS data.  This document\n   explains
    why SHA-1 is no longer secure for this purpose, and\n   deprecates its use in
    DNSSEC signatures.  This document updates RFC\n   8624.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
