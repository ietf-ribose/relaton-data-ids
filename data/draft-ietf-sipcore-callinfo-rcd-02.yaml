abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a SIP Call-Info header field usage defined
    to include rich data associated with the identity of the calling party that can
    be rendered to a called party for providing more useful information about the
    caller or the specific reason for the call. This includes extended comprehensive
    information about the caller such as what a jCard object can represent for describing
    the calling party or other call specific information such as describing the reason
    or intent of the call. The elements defined for this purpose are intended to be
    extensible to accommodate related information about calls that helps people decide
    whether to pick up the phone and additionally, with the use of jCard and other
    elements, to be compatible with the STIR/PASSporT Rich Call Data framework.</p>"
