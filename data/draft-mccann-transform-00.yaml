abstract:
  content: "<p>The deployment of Mobile IP in a wide area network presents severalchallenges,
    not the least of which is how to provide subscriberswith secure access to remote
    private networks. This draft outlinesmechanisms whereby the home and visited network
    may negotiate theuse of IP transforms, such as IP Security ESP and AH protocols,
    onthe Mobile IP redirection tunnels. These mechanisms allow for thesecure distribution
    of both keys and policies through a DIAMETER AAAinfrastructure, obviating the
    need for other forms of keydistribution or policy negotiation. The mechanisms
    are extensibleto other kinds of IP transforms, such as IP Compression.</p>"
