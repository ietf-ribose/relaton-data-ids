abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Modifications to 6lowpan Neighbor Discovery protocol are proposed
    in\n   order to secure the neighbor discovery for low-power and lossy\n   networks.
    \ This document defines lightweight and secure version of\n   the neighbor discovery
    for low-power and lossy networks.  The nodes\n   generate a Cryptographically
    Generated Address, register the\n   Cryptographically Generated Address with a
    default router and\n   periodically refresh the registration.  Cryptographically
    generated\n   address and digital signatures are calculated using elliptic curve\n
    \  cryptography, so that the cryptographic operations are suitable for\n   low
    power devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
