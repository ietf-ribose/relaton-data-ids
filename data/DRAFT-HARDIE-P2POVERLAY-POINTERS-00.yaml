abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Discovering overlay networks and the resources found within in
    them\npresents a number of bootstrapping problems.  While those hard\nproblems
    are under discussion, this draft proposes a small set of\nmechanisms which are
    intended to be generically useful for\nproviding pointers to peer-to-peer overlay
    networks in web pages,\nemail messages, and other textual media.  While the mechanisms\ndescribed
    below each meet similar needs, they are not mutually\nexclusive; it is expected
    that each will find some useful\ndeployment during the early days of peer-to-peer
    overlay\ndeployment.\n\t </p>\n      "
