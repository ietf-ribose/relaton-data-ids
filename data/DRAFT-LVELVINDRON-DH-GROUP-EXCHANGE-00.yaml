abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH)\n
    \  Transport layer Protocol specifies that servers and clients should\n   support
    groups with a modulus length of k bits, where the recommended\n   minumum value
    is 1024 bits.  Recent security research has shown that\n   a minimum value of
    1024 bits is insufficient against state-sponsored\n   actors.  As such, this document
    formally updates RFC 4419 [RFC4419]\n   such that the minimum recommended value
    for k is 2048 bits and the\n   group size is 2048 bits at minimum.\n\n\t </p>\n
