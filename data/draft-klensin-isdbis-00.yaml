abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The current IETF standard-track maturity level definitions, includingthe
    assumption that most specification of successful protocols wouldadvance rapidly
    to Internet Standard, the never-used automaticexpiration mechanism, and the STD
    nnnn designation, have not workedwell. Users of IETF Standards have found it difficult
    to determinewhat standards were associated with others in groups, the actualstatus
    of specifications within a related group, and the level ofinteroperability testing
    and deployment and use for any givenstandard or set of features. The community
    has rarely used the\"requirement level\" mechanism in recent years. There is now
    anerrata mechanism for published RFCs, but the errata lists do notprovide authoritative,
    consensus-based, corrections to standards-track documents. This document suggests
    that all of those issues aresymptoms of a single system of interrelated issues
    and problems andproposes an integrated solution.</p>"
