abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IASA 2.0 changes will have an impact in the IETF Trust
    as well,\n   because members of the IET Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)\n
    \  IAOC have also served as trustees of the IETF Trust.  A proposal for\n   a
    minimal change regarding this has been provided separately in\n   [I-D.arkko-iasa2-trust-update].\n\n
    \  This companion memo provides some background on the details of the\n   current
    IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect of the rules in\n   the founding
    documents during a transition to a new arrangement, and\n   provides a rationale
    for the update.\n\n   This memo is provided only for discussion.\n\n\t </p>\n
