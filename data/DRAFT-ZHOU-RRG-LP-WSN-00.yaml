abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the related applications of wireless sensor networks getting\n
    \  into our lives quickly, the research of WSN is growing more and more\n   necessary.
    \ The most significant problem which threatens the\n   successful deployment of
    sensor systems is privacy, there are many\n   protocols providing the security
    of news content for the WSNs.\n   However, due to the open feature of sensor networks,
    context\n   information is still in an exposed state, which makes the network
    be\n   vulnerable to traffic analysis attack and hop by hop tracing back\n   packet
    attack.  Thus location privacy protection programs have been\n   proposed.  In
    this paper, we analyze and compare the existing major\n   schemes comprehensively,
    meanwhile illustrate their theoretical\n   models, principles and the advantages
    and disadvantages in detail.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
