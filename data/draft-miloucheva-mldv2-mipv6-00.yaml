abstract:
  content: "<p>Protocol mechanisms for fast mobile multicast in IPv6 based on multicastlistening
    context transfer are proposed. The focus is the context transfer for mobile multicast
    listeners usingMulticast Listener Discovery protocol Version 2 (MLDv2).Multicast
    context transfer block and operational considerations foroptimised multicast context
    transfer based on Fast Handovers for MobileIPv6 and Candidate Access Router Discovery
    are described. The requirements for MLDv2 context extension and operation at accessrouters
    to support multicast context transfer for mobile IPv6 arespecified. Interactions
    of MLDv2 with Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse Mode(PIM-SM) for multicast
    routing state update based on multicastlistening context transfer are overviewed.Operational
    considerations for MLDv2 and PIM-SM to support multicastreceiver and source mobility
    based on context transfer are discussed.Comparison with other multicast protocol
    proposals for Mobile IPv6(MIPv6) is given.</p>"
