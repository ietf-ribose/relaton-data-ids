abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the \"Form\" HTTP authentication scheme.
    \ It\n   allows web developers access to standard HTTP-based authentication\n
    \  mechanisms whilst retaining control over the look and feel of their\n   log-in
    page, without requiring any client-side scripting.  Comments\n   are requested
    and should be addressed to the author.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
