abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a way to perform mobility in IPv4 (potentially
    IPv6) without requiring any new entity in networks infrastructure (e.g. Home Agent,
    Foreign Agent, etc.). Instead of using infrastructure entities this method delegates
    all the mobility function to the end nodes. The method relies on source and destination
    address translation at the end nodes, and signaling between end nodes to perform
    hand offs - all these function can be encapsulated in an entity called Mobility
    Agent (MA) in the end nodes.</p>"
