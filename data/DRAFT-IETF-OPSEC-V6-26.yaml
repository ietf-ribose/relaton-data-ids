abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Knowledge and experience on how to operate IPv4 networks securely
    is\n   available: whether it is an Internet Service Provider or an\n   enterprise
    internal network.  However, IPv6 presents some new\n   security challenges.  RFC
    4942 describes security issues in the\n   protocol, but network managers also
    need a more practical,\n   operations-minded document to enumerate advantages
    and/or\n   disadvantages of certain choices.\n\n   This document analyzes the
    operational security issues associated\n   with several types of network and proposes
    technical and procedural\n   mitigation techniques.  This document is only applicable
    to managed\n   networks, such as enterprise networks.  The recommendations in
    this\n   document are not applicable to residential user cases, even in cases\n
    \  where a Service Provider may be managing the home gateway.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
