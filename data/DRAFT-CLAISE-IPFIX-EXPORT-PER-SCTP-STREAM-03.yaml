abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an improvement to the use of SCTP \n        as
    specified in the IPFIX specifications in order to be \n        able to deduce
    the data record loss per template record in \n        case of partially-reliable
    SCTP export.  This specification \n        offers several extra advantages: immediate
    export of the \n        template withdrawal message, immediate reuse of template
    ID \n        within a stream, and the collecting process's job is \n        easier.
    \n\t </p>\n      "
