abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Based on live deployments and three interoperability events,
    this\n   document provides advice to network operators about best practices\n
    \  when implementing IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) networks.\n   It
    is principally addressed to system integrators and solution\n   providers, including
    those that do not yet support SPB.  Some advice\n   to implementers is also included.
    \ The intention of the advice is to\n   facilitate multi vendor network deployments
    as well as provide\n   guidance for new installations.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
