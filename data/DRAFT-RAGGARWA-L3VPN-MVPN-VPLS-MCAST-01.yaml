abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a solution framework for overcoming
    the\n   limitations of existing Multicast VPN (MVPN) and VPLS multicast\n   solutions.
    \ It describes procedures for enhancing the scalability of\n   multicast for BGP/MPLS
    VPNs. It also describes procedures for VPLS\n   multicast that utilize multicast
    trees in the sevice provider (SP)\n   network.  The procedures described here
    reduce the overhead of PIM\n   neighbor relationships that a PE router needs to
    maintain for\n   BGP/MPLS VPNs. They also reduce the state (and the overhead of\n
    \  maintaining the state) in the SP network by removing the need to\n   maintain
    in the SP network at least one dedicated multicast tree per\n   each VPN.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
