abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo describes the distribution mechanism of route optimizationhints,
    which can be used by a mobile node to determine when the nodeshould initiate the
    route optimization procedure when communicatingwith correspondent nodes. Usually,
    a mobile node will perform ROprocedure to any correspondent node as described
    in Mobile IPv6specification [1]. However, in some cases, it is better not toperform
    RO. A typical example is a firewalled network. This memoalso describes a configuration
    of a firewall which makes mobile nodespossible to move between an intranet and
    the Internet by using ROhints.</p>"
