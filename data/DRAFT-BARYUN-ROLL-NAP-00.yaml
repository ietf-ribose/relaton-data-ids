abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some Wireless Ad hoc Networks (WANETs) like LLNs often have\n
    \  different devices capabilities, with large scale deployment at\n   different
    regions or environment conditions. In that network\n   context, nodes may not
    be able to participate in certain time\n   periods because of determined conditions.
    The Node Ability of\n   Participation (NAP) protocol enhances the network use
    of its\n   activities and capabilities. Routers and actuators in such\n   networks
    can be adaptive and efficient for different unpredicted\n   situations.\n\n\t
