abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC
    may not\n   have a normative reference to a non standards track specification\n
    \  except those from other\n   standards bodies.  This document creates an External
    Specification\n   registry, similar to the DownRef registry that has been created
    based\n   on [RFC3967] and permits normative references to community accepted\n
    \  external specifications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
