abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a hybrid naming scheme for unifying all kinds
    of information. As many proposals of novel network architectures emerge, such
    as DONA, ICN, NDN, the location-based routing starts to transfer to the content-based
    ones. Currently, it is incompatible that many different information naming schemes
    are adopted in different network proposals, respectively, i.e. flat names in DONA,
    hierarchical names in NDN. The naming format defined is to identify different
    routing information uniformly. The format adopts a hybrid structure including
    hierarchical component, flat component and attribute component, providing great
    compatibility and advantages.</p>"
