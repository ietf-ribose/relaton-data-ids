abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2544 has defined a benchmarking methodology for network interconnect
    devices. We recommend a few upgrades to it for producing more reasonable results.
    The recommended upgrades can be classified into two categories: the application
    of the novelties of RFC 8219 for the legacy RFC 2544 use cases and the following
    new ones. Checking a reasonably small timeout individually for every single frame
    in the throughput and frame loss rate benchmarking procedures. Performing a statistically
    relevant number of tests for all benchmarking procedures. Addition of an optional
    non-zero frame loss acceptance criterion for the throughput measurement procedure
    and defining its reporting format.</p>"
