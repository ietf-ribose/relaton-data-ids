abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5444 specifies a generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) packet/message
    format and describes an intended use for multiplexed MANET routing protocol messages;
    this use is mandated by RFC 5498 when using the MANET port or protocol number
    that it specifies. This document updates RFC 5444 by providing rules and recommendations
    for how the multiplexer operates and how protocols can use the packet/message
    format. In particular, the mandatory rules prohibit a number of uses that have
    been suggested in various proposals and that would have led to interoperability
    problems, to the impediment of protocol extension development, and/or to an inability
    to use optional generic parsers.</p>"
