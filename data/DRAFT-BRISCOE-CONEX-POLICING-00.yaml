abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes why policing using congestion information
    can\n   isolate users from network performance degradation due to each\n   other's
    usage, but without losing the multiplexing benefits of a LAN-\n   style network
    where anyone can use any amount of any resource.\n   Extensive numerical examples
    and diagrams are given.  The document is\n   agnostic to how the congestion information
    reaches the policer.  The\n   congestion exposure (ConEX) protocol is recommended,
    but other tunnel\n   feedback mechanisms have been proposed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
