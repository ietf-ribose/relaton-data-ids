abstract:
- content: "<p>Current efforts in the scope of Network Function Virtualisation(NFV)
    propose YAML-based descriptors for Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and for their
    composition in Network Services (NS) These descriptors are human-readable but
    hardly understandable by humans. On the other hand, there has been an effort proposed
    to the IETF to define a human-readable (and understandable) representation for
    networks, known as NEMO. In this draft, we propose a simple extension to NEMO
    to accommodate VNF Descriptors (VNFDs) in a similar manner as inline assembly
    is integrated in higher-level programming languages. This approach enables the
    creation of recursive VNF forwarding graphs in Service Descriptors, practically
    making them recursive.</p>"
