abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Increasingly the need for IPv6 ND Proxy [RFC4389]) to be a StandardsTrack
    document is growing. During the specification of the IPv6 CERouter in the IETF
    v6ops Working Group, the IPv6 CE Router has usefor ND Proxy to bridge disparate
    MAC layers LAN ports. There is alsothe use of ND Proxy in cable broadband NBMA
    network for DAD and NDaddress resolution on a cable access concentrator. Another
    casewhere ND Proxy is required is when one does not have enough IPv6address space
    to route. This short note recommends that the ND ProxyRFC be changed to a Standards
    Track document.Status of this MemoThis Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in
