abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a method called "dry-run DNSSEC" that allows
    for testing DNSSEC deployments without affecting the DNS service in case of DNSSEC
    errors. It accomplishes that by introducing a new DS Type Digest Algorithm that
    signals to validating resolvers that dry- run DNSSEC is used for the zone. DNSSEC
    errors are then reported with DNS Error Reporting, but the bogus response is withheld.
    Instead resolvers fallback from dry-run DNSSEC and provide the response that would
    have been answered without the presence of a dry- run DS. A further option is
    presented for clients to opt-in for dry- run DNSSEC errors and allow for end-to-end
    DNSSEC testing.</p>
