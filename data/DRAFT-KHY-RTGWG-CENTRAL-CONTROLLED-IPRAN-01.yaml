abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces the requirements and use cases for
    IP RAN\n   (Radio Access Networks). To support the requirements, the document\n
    \  provides an architecture with centralized control plane as well as\n   separation
    of control plane and data plane.  The document also\n   describes techniques for
    IP RAN network initialization and\n   construction; interfacing to management
    plane and third party\n   applications.  This document can be used as a guideline
    for central\n   controlled IP RAN design and development.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
