abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)
    option\n   that allows DNS clients and servers to signal support for DNS\n   protocol
    capabilities.  Clients and servers that support this option\n   can take advantage
    of new DNS protocol features when completing a\n   transaction, and by caching
    the set of capabilities advertised by a\n   DNS server, a DNS client can utilize
    any mutually supported DNS\n   protocol capability in subsequent queries.\n\n\t
