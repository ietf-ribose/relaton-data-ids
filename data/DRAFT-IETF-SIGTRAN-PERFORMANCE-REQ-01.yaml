abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document serves as input into the IETF SIGTRAN requirements
    \nprocess. It includes call setup delay requirements, derived from \nrelevant
    ISDN and SS7 standards published by ITU-T (International \nTelecommunications
    Union--Telecommunications Standardization Sector) and \ngeneric requirements published
    by Telcordia Technologies (formerly \nBellcore). To gain user acceptance of Voice-over-IP
    (VoIP) services and \nto enable interoperability between Switched Circuit Networks
    (SCNs) and \nVoIP systems, it is imperative that the VoIP signaling performance
    be \ncomparable to that of the current SCNs. The requirements given in this \nInternet
    Draft are intended to be the worst-case requirements, for at \nleast in the United
    States SCN calls are typically set up at a faster \nspeed than the derived requirements.
    At the end of the draft, several \nVoIP call connection scenarios based on the
    latest megaco protocol are \nanalyzed and compared with similar cases in the PSTN.
    It indicates the \nPDD performance of VoIP systems is somewhat worst but not by
    much. An\nimprovement in some network element can bring VoIP systems to have\ncomparable
    PDD performance as the PSTN.\n\t </p>\n      "
