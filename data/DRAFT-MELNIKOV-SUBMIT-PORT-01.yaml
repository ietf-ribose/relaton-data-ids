abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>[RFC-2476] defines a new protocol used  for  message  submission.
    \ \nIn many circumstances it could be located on port different from the\ntraditional
    SMTP port.  The fate of a message may depend on whether\nparticular server is
    Submit or SMTP server, because even inside the\nsame organization Submit and SMTP
    \ servers  may  inforce  different\npolicy. Thus the correct discovering of submit
    server location is \nimportant.\n\t </p>\n      "
