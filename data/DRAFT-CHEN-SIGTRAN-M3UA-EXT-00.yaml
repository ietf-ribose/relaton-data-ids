abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 4666 defines a protocol for supporting the transport of
    any SS7 \n   MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using
    the \n   services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Some parts of \n
    \  the specification are unclear that may lead to misinterpretations \n   that
    may impair interoperability between different implementations. \n   RFC 4666 doesn't
    define the application of IPSTP-IPSEP interface. For \n   the signalling network
    management function, messages and procedures, \n   it needs more contributes.
    \n\n   This document provides clarifications and amendments to RFC 4666. \n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
