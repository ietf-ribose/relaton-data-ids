abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a solution to the Internet address
    depletion\n   problem through use of a clever IPv4 options mechanism as a solution.\n
    \  This IPv4 protocol extension is called enhanced IP (EnIP).  Because\n   it
    is IPv4, it maximizes backward compatibility while increasing\n   address space
    by a factor of 17.9 million.  Unlike other similar\n   proposals, care was taken
    to avoid costly changes and requirements to\n   the core network and border routers,
    with the exception that options\n   be passed in that equipment as described below.
    \ Because it is\n   backward compatible, current IPv4 software, network equipment,\n
    \  firewalls, intrusion detection/protection, and layer 5 firewalls can\n   be
    maintained until IPv6 system information security reaches\n   acceptable maturity
    and availability.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
