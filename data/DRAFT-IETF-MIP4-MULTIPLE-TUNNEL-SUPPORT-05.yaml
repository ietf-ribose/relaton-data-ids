abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines extensions to Mobile IPv4 protocol
    for\n   allowing a mobile node with multiple interfaces to register a care-of\n
    \  address for each of its network interfaces and to simultaneously\n   establish
    multiple Mobile IP tunnels with its home agent.  This\n   essentially allows the
    mobile node to utilize all the available\n   network interfaces and build an higher
    aggregated data pipe with the\n   home agent for its home address traffic.  Furthermore,
    these\n   extensions also allow the mobile node and the home agent to negotiate\n
    \  flow policies for binding individual traffic flows with the\n   registered
    care-of addresses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
