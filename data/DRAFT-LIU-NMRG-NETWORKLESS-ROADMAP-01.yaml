abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document aims to illustrate possible approaches to make
    network\n   management and operations more autonomic in several aspects.  The\n
    \  ultimate goal is that the network could run all by itself, so that\n   users
    and administrators may feel that there is no network to take\n   care of at all
    (a.k.a.  \"Networkless\").  The approaches are described\n   in a form of different
    levels (inspired by the Self-Driven Car\n   levels).  The higher the level is,
    the more autonomic management\n   capabilities the network would have.\n\n   Although
    some specific technologies are categorized into different\n   levels, it is not
    the document's intent to rank them; rather, this\n   document is more about discussing
    the possible next stage and the\n   ultimate vision.  Hopefully, this document
    could collect people's\n   consensus in the industry and provide guidance for
    future technology\n   developments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
