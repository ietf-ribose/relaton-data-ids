abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft describes how a Virtual Private LAN (VPL) can be realizedby
    setting up point-to-point tunnels from CE (Customer Edge) or CLE(Customer Located
    Equipment) to CE/CLE over a PSN, and bridgingEthernet traffic at the CE/CLE. Regardless
    of the access technologyused (e.g. DSL or Ethernet) or the geographic distribution
    ofCEs/CLEs, an end customer may use an emulated LAN service via anEthernet interface,
    as long as the CEs/CLEs of the emulated LAN arereachable over the PSN. When used
    in conjunction with IPSec, theproposal allows secure transmission of Ethernet
    traffic, from onesite to another site of a VPL, over the PSN.</p>"
