abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The current IPv6 Neighbor Discovery specification does not providesemantics
    for carrying vendor-specific options in the IPv6 NeighborDiscovery messages. With
    the anticipated wide scale deployment ofIPv6 networks, it is useful for organizations
    and vendors to have theability to carry organization/vendor specific information
    in the IPv6Neighbor Discovery messages. This will facilitate the vendors andorganizations
    to make deployment specific extensions as needed insystem deployment. This document
    defines a new vendor-specificinformation option that can be carried in IPv6 Neighbor
    Discoverymessages exchanged between IPv6 nodes on a link.</p>"
