abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   XML signature standard [RFC3275]identifies signed elements
    by their\n   unique identities in the XML document.  However this allows shifting\n
    \  of XML elements from one location to another within the same XML\n   document,
    without affecting the ability to verify the signature.\n   This flexibility paves
    the way for an attacker to tweak the original\n   XML message without getting
    noticed by the receiver, leading to XML\n   Signature wrapping or rewriting attacks.
    \ This document proposes to\n   use absolute XPath as a \"Positional Token\" and
    modifies the existing\n   XML Digital Signature algorithm to overcome this attack.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
