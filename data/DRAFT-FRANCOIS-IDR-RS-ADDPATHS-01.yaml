abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP speakers at Internet Exchange Points typically exchange
    routes\n   with a large number of peers.  To reduce the burden of maintaining\n
    \  many sessions, IXPs implement and administrate BGP route servers.\n   Route
    servers announce to their clients the paths of multiple peers\n   by using a single
    eBGP session.  Route servers, however, are\n   restricted to propagating a single
    path per NLRI per eBGP session.\n   This constraint affects the diversity of paths
    received by clients.\n   To overcome this limitation, we propose the extension
    of ADD-PATH to\n   eBGP peers.  ADD-PATH allows a BGP speaker to send multiple
    paths for\n   the same NLRI, typically through different nexthops, over a single\n
    \  session with a peer.  By supporting ADD-PATH, a route server hence\n   allows
    a client to potentially select among all the available paths\n   for that NLRI,
    instead of the one arbitrarily chosen by the Route\n   Server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
