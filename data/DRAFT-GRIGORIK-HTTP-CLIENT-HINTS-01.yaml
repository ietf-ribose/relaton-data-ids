abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An increasing diversity of Web-connected device form factors
    and\n   software capabilities has created a need to deliver varying, or\n   optimized
    content for each device.\n\n   HTTP Client Hints can be used as input to proactive
    content\n   negotiation; just as the Accept header allowed clients to indicate\n
    \  what formats they prefer, Client Hints allow clients to indicate a\n   list
    of device and agent specific preferences.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
