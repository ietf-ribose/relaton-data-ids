abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is a file describing
    the\n   expected use of a class of devices, usually an Internet of Things\n   class
    of devices.  It is prepared by a manufacturer and placed on a\n   generally available
    web server, and is addressable via a Uniform\n   Resource Identifier (URI).  The
    URI is often included in a discovery\n   protocol (e.g., DNS, LLDP).  A Network
    Access Server (NAS) in the\n   path of the discovery protocol can collect and
    forward the URI to a\n   RADIUS server, which processes the URI.  This draft defines
    the\n   RADIUS extension needed for the NAS to forward the URI to the RADIUS\n
    \  server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
