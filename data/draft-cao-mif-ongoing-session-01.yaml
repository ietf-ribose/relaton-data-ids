abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the problem of holding the ongoing sessions
    on a multi-homed host. When there is an application running on one interface and
    another interface with a better routing metric is enabled, it is desirable to
    hold the application on the current interface and avoid it being terminated and
    shifted to another interface.</p>"
