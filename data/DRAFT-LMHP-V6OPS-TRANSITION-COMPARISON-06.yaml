abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Several IPv6 transition technologies have been developed to
    provide\n   customers with IPv4-as-a-Service (IPv4aaS) for ISPs with an IPv6-only\n
    \  access and/or core network.  All these technologies have their\n   advantages
    and disadvantages, and depending on existing topology,\n   skills, strategy and
    other preferences, one of these technologies may\n   be the most appropriate solution
    for a network operator.\n\n   This document examines the five most prominent IPv4aaS
    technologies\n   considering a number of different aspects to provide network\n
    \  operators with an easy to use reference to assist in selecting the\n   technology
    that best suits their needs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
