abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a feedback message intended to enable congestion
    control for interactive real-time traffic. The RTP Media Congestion Avoidance
    Techniques (RMCAT) Working Group formed a design team to analyze feedback requirements
    from various congestion control algorithms and to design a generic feedback message
    to help ensure interoperability across those algorithms. The feedback message
    is designed for a sender-based congestion control, which means the receiver of
    the media will send necessary feedback to the sender of the media to perform the
    congestion control at the sender.</p>"
