abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft analyzes the complexities involved in setting up
    the\n   certification infrastructure for multi-tenant, multi-domain SDN\n   adopted
    network environment. There are certain architectural options\n   available to
    address these complexities, and the same have been\n   consolidated and analyzed
    in the draft. However, there are certain\n   implementation level challenges that
    create difficulties to\n   operationalize these options. And these challenges
    have been\n   recognized in the draft and further translated into requirements
    for\n   setting up an operational framework suitable for managing certificate\n
    \  chains for SDN integrated environment. Finally, a next level of\n   assessment
    has been carried out to consolidate contemporary work\n   happening in different
    Work Groups and their likely coverage over\n   identified operational framework
    requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
