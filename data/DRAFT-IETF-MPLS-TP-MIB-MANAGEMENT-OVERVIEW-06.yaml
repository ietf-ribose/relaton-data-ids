abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A range of Management Information Base (MIB) modules has been\n
    \  developed to help model and manage the various aspects of\n   Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) networks.  These MIB modules are\n   defined in separate
    documents that focus on the specific areas of\n   responsibility of the modules
    that they describe.\n\n   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of
    MPLS\n   functionality specific to the construction of packet-switched\n   transport
    networks.\n\n   This document describes the MIB-based architecture for MPLS-TP,\n
    \  and indicates the interrelationships between different existing MIB\n   modules
    that can be leveraged for MPLS-TP network management and\n   identifies areas
    where additional MIB modules are required.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
