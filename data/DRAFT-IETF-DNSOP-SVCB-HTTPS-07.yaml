abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the \"SVCB\" and \"HTTPS\" DNS resource
    record\n   (RR) types to facilitate the lookup of information needed to make\n
    \  connections to network services, such as for HTTPS origins.  SVCB\n   records
    allow a service to be provided from multiple alternative\n   endpoints, each with
    associated parameters (such as transport\n   protocol configuration and keys for
    encrypting the TLS ClientHello).\n   They also enable aliasing of apex domains,
    which is not possible with\n   CNAME.  The HTTPS RR is a variation of SVCB for
    HTTPS and HTTP\n   origins.  By providing more information to the client before
    it\n   attempts to establish a connection, these records offer potential\n   benefits
    to both performance and privacy.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated
    on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/MikeBishop/dns-alt-svc\n   (https://github.com/MikeBishop/dns-alt-svc).
    \ The most recent working\n   version of the document, open issues, etc. should
    all be available\n   there.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.\n\n\t
