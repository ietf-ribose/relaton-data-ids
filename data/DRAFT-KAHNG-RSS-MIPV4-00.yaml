abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>From a viewpoint of a layer architecture, a network layer should
    \nfeature a mobility support. Then the users can enjoy their mobility \nwhatever
    data-link devices and user applications they use. \nMobile IP has been proposed
    for a solution to provide IP-layer \nhandoffs between subnets served by different
    Foreign Agents. However, \nit still suffers an interruption of the communications
    for real-time \napplications.\n\t </p>\n      "
