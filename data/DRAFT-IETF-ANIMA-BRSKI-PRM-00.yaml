abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines enhancements to the bootstrapping a remote\n
    \  secure key infrastructure (BRSKI, [RFC8995] ) to facilitate\n   bootstrapping
    in domains featuring no or only timely limited\n   connectivity between a pledge
    and the domain registrar.  This\n   specifically targets situations, in which
    the interaction model\n   changes from a pledge-initiator-mode as in BRSKI to
    a pledge-\n   responder-mode as desribed here.  To support this functionality\n
    \  BRSKI-PRM introduces a new registrar-agent component, which\n   facilitates
    the communication between pledge and registrar during the\n   bootstrapping phase.
    \ To support the establishment of a trust\n   relation between a pledge and the
    domain registrar, BRSKI-PRM relies\n   on the exchange of authenticated self-contained
    objects (signature-\n   wrapped objects).  The defined approach is agnostic regarding
    the\n   utilized enrollment protocol, deployed by the registrar to\n   communicate
    with the Domain CA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
