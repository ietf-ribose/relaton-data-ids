abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an end-to-end secure infrastructure
    that facilitates the exchange of configuration and credential data between multiple
    user devices. The core protocols of the Mesh are described with examples of common
    use cases and reference data. [Note to Readers] Discussion of this draft takes
    place on the MATHMESH mailing list (mathmesh@ietf.org), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=mathmesh.
