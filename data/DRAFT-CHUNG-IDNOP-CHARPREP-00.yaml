abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Charprep intends to take up where Nameprep [NAMEPREP] left off
    to \nprovide additional preventive measures to bridge the users conceptual \nperception
    of a multilingual domain name with the domain matching \nprocess.  The critical
    development from Nameprep is that common user \nperception is taken into account.
    \ That is, Charprep strives to take \nthe 'case-insensitivity' concept of user-friendliness
    to another \nlevel for IDNs because of the inherent complexity and potential \nconfusion
    that could arise from the use of multilingual characters in \ndomain names. \nCharprep
    is designed to be a framework for Zone Administrators (e.g. \ndomain registries)
    to employ relevant equivalency tables to compute \nand generate variants from
    the original string to variants that could \npossibly create confusion with users.
    \ The actual management of \nReserved Variants (RV), Zone Variants (ZV) with the
    original string \n(Primary Domain) will be discussed in Zoneprep [ZONEPREP]. \nFurthermore,
    Charprep and Zoneprep are designed to be a recommended \nfeature to be offered
    to users by a Zone Administrator (e.g. Domain \nRegistries) in the management
    of Internationalized domain names \n(IDN).  A key concept is that these are done
    without affecting the \nIDN protocol specified in [RFC3490], [RFC3491] and [RFC3492].
