abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Full internationalization of electronic mail requires not only
    the\n   capability to transmit non-ASCII content, to encode selected\n   information
    in specific header fields, and to use international\n   characters in envelope
    addresses.  It also requires being able to\n   express those addresses and information
    based on them in mail header\n   fields.  This document specifies the use of Unicode
    encoded in UTF-8,\n   rather than ASCII, as the base form for Internet email header
    fields.\n   This form is permitted in transmission only if authorized by an SMTP\n
    \  extension, as specified in an associated specification.\n\t </p>\n      "
