abstract:
- content: "<p>The mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) enables a mobile node (MN) to maintain its
    connectivity with a correspondent node (CN) while changing its point of attachment.
    Since, in MIPv6, packets sent from a CN to an MN during handover can be lost,
    several mechanisms such as FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 have been proposed to reduce the
    number of lost packets. However, such mechanisms still suffer from the performance
    degradation due to not only packet losses but also out-of-sequence packets. In
    this draft, we propose I-FHMIPv6 which integrates FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 efficiently.
    I-FHMIPv6 uses the Flush message and can minimize packet losses.</p>"
