abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Historically MPLS label distribution was driven by protocols
    like\n   LDP, RSVP and LBGP.  All of those protocols are session oriented.  In\n
    \  order to obtain label binding for a given destination FEC from a\n   given
    router one needs first to establish an LDP/RSVP/LBGP session\n   with that router.\n\n
    \  Advertising MPLS labels in IGPs\n   [I-D.gredler-rtgwg-igp-label-advertisement]
    describes several use\n   cases where utilizing the flooding machinery of link-state
    protocols\n   for MPLS label distribution allows to obtain the binding without\n
    \  requiring to establish an LDP/RSVP/LBGP session with that router.\n\n   This
    document describes the protocol extension to distribute MPLS\n   label bindings
    by the OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocol.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
