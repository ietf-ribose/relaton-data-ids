abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 7252 defines the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),
    along\n   with a number of additional specifications, including RFC 7641, RFC\n
    \  7959, RFC 8132, and RFC 8323.  RFC 6690 defines the link format that\n   is
    used in CoAP self-description documents.\n\n   Some parts of the specification
    may be unclear or even contain errors\n   that may lead to misinterpretations
    that may impair interoperability\n   between different implementations.  The present
    document provides\n   corrections, additions, and clarifications to the RFCs cited;
    this\n   document thus updates these RFCs.  In addition, other clarifications\n
    \  related to the use of CoAP in other specifications, including RFC\n   7390
    and RFC 8075, are also provided.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
