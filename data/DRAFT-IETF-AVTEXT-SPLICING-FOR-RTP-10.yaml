abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Content splicing is a process that replaces the content of
    a main\n   multimedia stream with other multimedia content, and delivers the\n
    \  substitutive multimedia content to the receivers for a period of\n   time.
    \ Splicing is commonly used for local advertisement insertion by\n   cable operators,
    replacing a national advertisement content with a\n   local advertisement.\n\n
    \  This memo describes some use cases for content splicing and a set of\n   requirements
    for splicing content delivered by RTP.  It provides\n   concrete guidelines for
    how an RTP mixer can be used to handle\n   content splicing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
