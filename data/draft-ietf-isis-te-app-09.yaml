abstract:
- content: "<p>Existing traffic engineering related link attribute advertisements
    have been defined and are used in RSVP-TE deployments. Since the original RSVP-TE
    use case was defined, additional applications (e.g., SRTE, LFA) have been defined
    which also make use of the link attribute advertisements. In cases where multiple
    applications wish to make use of these link attributes the current advertisements
    do not support application specific values for a given attribute nor do they support
    indication of which applications are using the advertised value for a given link.
    This draft introduces new link attribute advertisements which address both of
    these shortcomings. It also discusses backwards compatibility issues and how to
    minimize duplicate advertisements in the presence of routers which do not support
    the extensions defined in this document.</p>"
