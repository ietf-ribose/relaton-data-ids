abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [VPLS] is used to interconnect
    \nsystems across a wide-area or metropolitan-area network, making it \nappear
    to those systems as if they are interconnected on a private \nLAN.  The systems
    which are interconnected in this way may \nthemselves be LAN switches.  If, however,
    the interconnected systems \nare NOT LAN switches, but rather are IP hosts or
    IP routers, certain \nsimplifications are possible.  We call this simplified type
    of \nvirtual private LAN service an 'IP over LAN Service' (IPLS).  In \nIPLS,
    as in VPLS, LAN interfaces are run in promiscuous mode, and \nframes are forwarded
    based on their MAC Destination Addresses. \nHowever, the maintenance of the MAC
    forwarded tables is done via \nsignaling, rather than via the 'MAC Address Learning'
    procedures of \nIEEE 802.1D.  Further, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages
    \nare proxied, rather than being carried transparently. This draft \nspecifies
    the protocols and procedures for support of the IPLS \nservice.\n\t </p>\n      "
