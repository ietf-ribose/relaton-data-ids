abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimental protocol and new DNS Resource
    Record that can be used to provide a message digest over DNS zone data. The ZONEMD
    Resource Record conveys the message digest data in the zone itself. When a zone
    publisher includes an ZONEMD record, recipients can verify the zone contents for
    accuracy and completeness. This provides assurance that received zone data matches
    published data, regardless of how the zone data has been transmitted and received.
    ZONEMD is not designed to replace DNSSEC. Whereas DNSSEC protects individual RRSets
    (DNS data with fine granularity), ZONEMD protects protects a zone's data as a
    whole, whether consumed by authoritative name servers, recursive name servers,
    or any other applications. As specified at this time, ZONEMD is not designed for
    use in large, dynamic zones due to the time and resources required for digest
    calculation. The ZONEMD record described in this document includes fields reserved
    for future work to support large, dynamic zones.</p>"
