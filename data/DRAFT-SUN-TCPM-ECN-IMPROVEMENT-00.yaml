abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes TCP fairness performance enhancement
    scheme\n   by use of two parameters congestion degree and link idle rate. It\n
    \  uses IP header flag reserved field and ECN 2 bits field to form a new\n   IP
    congestion and Spare Flag (ICSF) and uses 3bits of reserved bits\n   in the TCP
    header to compose the TCP Congestion and Spare Flag (TCSF)\n   field. This method
    identifies the congestion and link idle status to\n   make sure that every TCP
    flow can receive the same degree of fairness\n   and can improve TCP send window
    adjustment speed and transmission\n   efficiency.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
