abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The base WebDAV protocol [WebDAV] provides basic support for\ncollections.
    \ It defines a MKCOL method for creating collections\nand specifies how other
    HTTP and WebDAV methods interact with\ncollections.  It supports internal members
    of collections, which it\ndefines as members whose URIs are immediately relative
    to the URI\nof the collection.\n \nThis draft sets out requirements for more advanced,
    optional\ncollection functionality. It extends the base functionality in two\ngeneral
    directions: support for referential resources, and support\nfor ordered collections.
    \ A separate WebDAV specification is\nexpected to define protocol elements providing
    the functionality\ndescribed here.\n\t </p>\n      "
