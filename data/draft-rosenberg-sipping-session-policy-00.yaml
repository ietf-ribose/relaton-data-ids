abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) was designed to supportestablishment
    and maintenance of end-to-end sessions. Proxy serversprovide call routing, authentication
    and authorization, mobility, andother signaling services that are independent
    of the session.Effectively, proxies provide signaling policy enforcement. However,numerous
    scenarios have arisen which require the involvement ofproxies in some aspect of
    the session policy. SIP has no support forsuch capabilities, as the community
    has generally consideringinvolvement of proxies in session details 'evil'. Practicalimplementations
    have therefore resorted to non-standard manipulationof SDP messages in order to
    enforce session policy. Theseimplementations are fragile and frought with problems.
    In thisdocument, we discuss a middle-ground approach which permits proxieslimited
    involvement in session policy, but retains the robustnessthat derives from the
    current prohibition on SDP manipulation.</p>"
