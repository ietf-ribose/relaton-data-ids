abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a source address validation solution
    for WLAN\n   enabling 802.11i or other security mechanisms. This mechanism snoops\n
    \  NDP and DHCP to bind IP address with MAC address, and relies on the\n   security
    of MAC address guaranteed by 802.11i or other mechanisms to\n   filter IP spoofing
    packets. It can work in the special situations\n   described in the charter of
    SAVI workgroup, such as multiple MAC\n   addresses on one interface. This document
    describes three different\n   deployment scenarios, with solutions for migration
    of binding entries\n   when hosts move from one access point to another.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
