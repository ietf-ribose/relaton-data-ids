abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes an innovative frame, called PLIC,(\"PerformanceLayer
    Inboard Computing\") able to support active, passive or hybridperformance measurements
    on any kind of unicast and multicast servicepassing through a network. It is based
    on an algorithm which, througha distributed computation, floods the performance
    measurements of eachnode to the rest of the network, without necessity of any
    externaltopology database or operation support system. It has been inventedand
    engineered in the Telecom Italia Core Network.</p>"
