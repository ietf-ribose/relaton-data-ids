abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Geolocation header introduces a mechanism to send a device\n
    \  location over an HTTP Secure Context from a user agent to a server.\n\n   The
    Geolocation-Request header is used by a server to inform the user\n   agent when
    a Geolocation header is requested to be sent.\n\n   This mechanism, through persistent
    Geolocation-Requests, provides a\n   single-roundtrip solution to obtain location-aware
    responses for\n   location-aware services, as oposed to existing JS-based Geolocation\n
    \  API that require two round trips.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
