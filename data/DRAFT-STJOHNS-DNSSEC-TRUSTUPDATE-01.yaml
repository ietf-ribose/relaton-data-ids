abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a means for automated, authenticated and\n
    \  authorized updating of DNSSEC \"trust anchors\".  The method provides\n   protection
    against single key compromise of a key in the trust point\n   key set.  Based
    on the trust established by the presence of a current\n   anchor, other anchors
    may be added at the same place in the\n   hierarchy, and, ultimately, supplant
    the existing anchor.\n\n   This mechanism, if adopted, will require changes to
    resolver\n   management behavior (but not resolver resolution behavior), and the\n
    \  addition of a single flag bit to the DNSKEY record.\n\t </p>\n      "
