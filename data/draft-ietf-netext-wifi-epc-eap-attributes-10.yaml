abstract:
- content: "<p>With Wi-Fi emerging as a trusted access network for service providers,
    it has become important to provide functions commonly available in 3G and 4G networks
    in Wi-Fi access networks as well. Such functions include Access Point Name (APN)
    Selection, multiple Packet Data Network (PDN) connections, and seamless mobility
    between Wi-Fi and 3G/4G networks. The EAP/AKA (and EAP/AKA') protocol is required
    for mobile devices to access the mobile Evolved Packet Core (EPC) via trusted
    Wi-Fi networks. This document defines a few new EAP attributes to enable the above-mentioned
    functions in trusted Wi-Fi access networks.</p>"
