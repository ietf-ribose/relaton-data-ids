abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates [RFC1123]. This document strongly encourages
    the operational practice of permitting DNS messages to be carried over TCP on
    the Internet as a best current practice. Such encouragement is aligned with the
    implementation requirements in RFC 7766. The use of TCP includes both DNS over
    unencrypted TCP, as well as over an encrypted TLS session. The document also considers
    the consequences with this form of DNS communication and the potential operational
    issues that can arise when this best current practice is not upheld.</p>"
