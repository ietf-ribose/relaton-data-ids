abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is an environment that
    enforces\n   that only authorized code can execute within that environment, and\n
    \  that any data used by such code cannot be read or tampered with by\n   any
    code outside that environment.  This architecture document\n   motivates the design
    and standardization of a protocol for managing\n   the lifecycle of trusted applications
    running inside such a TEE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
