abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The [IEEE802154e] standardizes the TSCH mode of operation and
    defines\n   the mechanisms for layer 2 communication between conforming devices.\n
    \  6top defines a set of commands to monitor and manage the TSCH\n   schedule.
    \ To realize the full functionality of sensor networks and\n   allow their adoption
    and use in real applications we need additional\n   mechanisms.  Specifically,
    the interaction with 6top, control and\n   modify schedules, monitor parameters
    etc must be defined.  Higher\n   layers monitoring and management entities are
    then able to use these\n   capabilities to create feedback loops.  Although, there
    have been\n   many custom implementations of such feedback loops between the\n
    \  routing, transport and MAC layers in sensor network deployments,\n   there
    has been a lack of standards based approaches.  This draft\n   defines the messaging
    between monitoring and management entities and\n   the 6top layer and a mapping
    to the 6top commands.  The document also\n   presents a particular implementation
    of the generic data model\n   specified in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-interface] based
    on CoAP and CBOR.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
