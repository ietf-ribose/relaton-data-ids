abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery) normally discloses information about
    both the devices offering services and the devices requesting services. This information
    includes host names, network parameters, and possibly a further description of
    the corresponding service instance. Especially when mobile devices engage in DNS
    Service Discovery over Multicast DNS at a public hotspot, a serious privacy problem
    arises. We propose to solve this problem by developing a private discovery profile
    for UDP based transports using TLS, such as DTLS and QUIC. The profile is based
    on using the Encrypted SNI extension. We also define a standalone private discovery
    service, that can be combined with arbitrary applications in the same way as DNS-SD.</p>"
