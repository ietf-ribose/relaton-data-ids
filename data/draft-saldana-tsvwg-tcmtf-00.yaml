abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to improve the bandwidth utilization
    of network paths that carry multiple streams in parallel between two endpoints,
    as in voice trunking. The method combines standard protocols that provide compression,
    multiplexing, and tunneling over a network path for the purpose of reducing the
    bandwidth used when multiple streams are carried over that path.</p>"
