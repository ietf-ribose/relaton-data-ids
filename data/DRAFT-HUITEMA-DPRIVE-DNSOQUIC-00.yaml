abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of QUIC to provide transport
    privacy\n   for DNS.  The encryption provided by QUIC has similar properties to\n
    \  that provided by TLS, while QUIC transport eliminates the head-of-\n   line
    blocking issues inherent with TCP and provides more efficient\n   error corrections
    than UDP.  DNS over QUIC (DoQ) has privacy\n   properties similar to DNS over
    TLS (DoT) specified in RFC7858, and\n   performance characteristics similar to
    classic DNS over UDP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
