abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a set of extensions for supporting explicit rate
    congestion control using RSVP. It should be perceived as an extension to the RSVP
    functional specifications [RFC2205] These extensions include the standard format
    of the ER_SPEC object, and a description of RSVP's handling of the ER_SPEC object.
    This document does not advocate a particular distributed explicit rate congestion
    control algorithm.</p>"
