abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a simple process that allows authors of
    Internet-Drafts to record the status of known implementations by including an
    Implementation Status section. This will allow reviewers and working groups to
    assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which
    may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made
    the implemented protocols more mature.\n\n This process is not mandatory. Authors
    of Internet-Drafts are encouraged to consider using the process for their documents,
    and working groups are invited to think about applying the process to all of their
    protocol specifications. This document obsoletes RFC 6982, advancing it to a Best
    Current Practice.\n\t </p>\n      "
