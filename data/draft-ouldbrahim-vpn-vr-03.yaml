abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft describes a network based VPN architecture using virtualrouters.
    The VPN service is built based on the virtual router (VR)concept, which has exactly
    the same mechanisms as a physical router,and therefore inherits all existing mechanisms
    and tools forconfiguration, operation, accounting, and maintenance. Within a VPNdomain,
    an instance of routing is used to distribute VPNreachability information among
    VR routers. Any routing protocol canbe used, and no VPN-related modifications
    or extensions are neededto the routing protocol for achieving VPN reachability.
    Virtualrouters can be deployed in different VPN configurations, direct VRto VR
    connectivity through layer-2 or by aggregating multiple VRsinto a single VR combined
    with IP or MPLS based tunnels. Thisarchitecture accommodates different backbone
    deployment scenarios,e.g. where the service provider owns their own backbone,
    and wherethe service provider obtains backbone service from one or more otherservice
    providers.</p>"
