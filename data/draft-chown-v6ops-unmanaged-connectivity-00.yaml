abstract:
- content: "<p>Tunneling IPv6 packets over the IPv4 Internet played a major role in
    the early stages of IPv6 deployment. This was useful because in the early days
    the routers in the internet did not support IPv6. Nowadays, tunneling is used
    to get across legacy equipment and ISPs that do not support IPv6. Many different
    tunneling mechanisms have been invented. This document describes the drivers for
    IPv6 tunneling, the general architectures of existing mechanisms, and a set of
    desirable properties against which subsequent analysis of the mechanisms may be
    made. The document is aimed at small end sites that may typically utilise tunneling
    methods in an early IPv6 deployment.</p>"
