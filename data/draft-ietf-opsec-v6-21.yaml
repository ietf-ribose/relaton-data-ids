abstract:
- content: "<p>Knowledge and experience on how to operate IPv4 securely is available:
    whether it is the Internet or an enterprise internal network. However, IPv6 presents
    some new security challenges. RFC 4942 describes the security issues in the protocol
    but network managers also need a more practical, operations-minded document to
    enumerate advantages and/or disadvantages of certain choices. This document analyzes
    the operational security issues in several places of a network (enterprises, service
    providers and residential users) and proposes technical and procedural mitigations
    techniques. Some very specific places of a network such as the Internet of Things
    are not discussed in this document.</p>"
