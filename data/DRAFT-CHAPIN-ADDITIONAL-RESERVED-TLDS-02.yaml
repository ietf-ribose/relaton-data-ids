abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) defines a tree of names\n
    \  starting with root, \".\", immediately below which are top level domain\n   (TLD)
    names such as \".com\" and \".us\".  In June 1999 [RFC2606]\n   reserved a small
    number of TLD names for use in documentation\n   examples, private testing, experiments,
    and other circumstances in\n   which it is desirable to avoid conflict with current
    or future actual\n   TLD names in the DNS.\n\n   There has been significant evolution
    of Internet engineering and\n   operation practices since [RFC2606] was published.
    \ In February 2013\n   [RFC6761] defined criteria and procedures for reserving
    a domain name\n   for special use, and established an IANA registry for such names.\n
    \  This document reserves three domain name labels for special use in\n   accordance
    with the criteria and procedures of [RFC6761]: home, corp,\n   and mail.\n\n   It
    is important to note that TLD names may be reserved, in other\n   contexts, for
    policy, political, or other reasons that are distinct\n   from the IETF's concern
    with Internet engineering and operations.\n   This document reserves TLD names
    only for operational and engineering\n   reasons.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
