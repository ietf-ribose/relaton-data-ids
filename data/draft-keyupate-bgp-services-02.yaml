abstract:
- content: "<p>A variety of services, such as NATs, firewalls, or caches, can be embedded
    in a service provider network or instantiated in data centers attached to the
    network. This document proposes extensions to BGP that facilitate discovery of
    such service instances by interested clients and allows dissemination of service
    information, such as services capabilities or capacities, thoughtout the network
    domain. The proposed extensions allow for optimal routing of requests to service
    instances that can optimally serve them.</p>"
