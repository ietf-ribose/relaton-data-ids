abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Privacy is an important issue that concerns many governments
    and\n   users and its importance becoming more evident every day. Nodes\n   change
    their IP addresses frequently in order to avoid being tracked\n   by attackers.
    The act of frequently changing IP addresses also helps\n   in preventing nodes
    from leaking information. In IPv6 networks there\n   is currently one solution
    for maintaining the privacy of nodes when\n   IPv6 StateLess Address AutoConfiguration
    (SLAAC) (RFC 4862) is used.\n   Unfortunately there are some problems associated
    with this solution\n   which entails the use of the Privacy Extension (RFC 4941).
    One of the\n   issues with this RFC concerns the wording that is used that allows\n
    \  the implementation to make the choice as to what approach to use, and\n   in
    so doing, in some cases, the choice made is not the most prudent\n   or best approach,
    and this thus is not ideal and can lead to some\n   problems. Some of these problems
    are related to not generating a new\n   Interface ID (IID) after changing the
    router prefix. Another concern\n   is the fact that nodes may use an IID that
    was generated based on a\n   MAC address as a public address, and then use this
    in their response.\n   The act of cutting the current connections to other nodes,
    if the max\n   lifetime of the old IID has elapsed, is also not clearly explained\n
    \  nor is whether or not the already used IID should be kept in stable\n   storage,
    There is also a concern about the need to have stable\n   storage available for
    the generation of a randomized IID. The\n   document also did not clearly explain
    how to use the same approach,\n   for the random value generation in all implementations,
    when there is\n   a lack of available stable storage. The purpose of this document
    is\n   to address these issues; to update the current RFC.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
