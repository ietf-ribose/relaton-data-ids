abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension of Access Node Control Protocol
    to enforce security policy for network anti-attacking. An access router or NAS
    uses the proposed mechanism to send security policy to a layer 2 device which
    an attacking host may directly connects to. The solution proposed here can be
    used in either public access networks or enterprise networks.</p>"
