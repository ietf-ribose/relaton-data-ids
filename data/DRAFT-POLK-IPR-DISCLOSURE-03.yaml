abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The disclosure process for intellectual property rights (IPR)
    in\n   documents produced within the IETF stream is essential to the\n   accurate
    development of community consensus.  However, this process\n   is not always followed
    by participants during IETF standardization.\n   Regardless of the cause or motivation,
    noncompliance with IPR\n   disclosure rules can derail or delay completion of
    standards\n   documents.  This document describes strategies for promoting\n   compliance
    with the IPR disclosure rules.  The strategies are\n   primarily intended for
    area directors, working group chairs, and\n   working group secretaries.\n\n\t
