abstract:
- content: "<p>Current Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure will not be able
    to deal with the next future traffic increase. As such traffic is being offloaded
    on alternate networks like WLAN. Contrary to RAN, WLAN MAY not be trusted networks,
    so the End User has to secure offloaded communications. Current offload architectures
    consist in tunneling the End User traffic to a Security Gateway. Alternatively,
    ISPs MAY provide End-to-End security and connect directly the End User to the
    Server. Because WLAN network are not managed by ISPs, WLAN Access Points MAY not
    be reliable making End User willing to benefit from multiple connections. This
    draft presents the Security Requirements for an offloaded End User with multiple
    interfaces. From the Security Requirements, the draft explains why IPsec is the
    most appropriated security protocol, and points the Multihoming feature current
    IKEv2 Extension MOBIKE are lacking.</p>"
