abstract:
  content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path computation
    in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. When a Path Computation Client (PCC) requests
    a PCE for a route, it may be useful for the PCC to specify as constraints to the
    path computation abstract nodes, resources, and Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs)
    that are to be explicitly excluded from routes. Such constraints are termed route
    exclusions. The PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) is designed as a communication
    protocol between PCCs and PCEs. This document presents PCEP extensions for route
    exclusions.</p>"
