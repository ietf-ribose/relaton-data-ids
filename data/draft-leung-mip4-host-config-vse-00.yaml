abstract:
- content: "<p>An IP device requires basic host configuration to be able to communicate.
    For example, the IP address on the interface and the DNS server for a hostname
    to IP address lookup. This information is configured statically or obtained dynamically
    using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or Point-to- Point Protocol/IP
    Control Protocol (PPP/IPCP). However, both DHCP and PPP/IPCP provides host configuration
    based on the access network. In Mobile IPv4, the registration process boots up
    a Mobile Node at an access network, also known as foreign network. The information
    to configure the host needs to be based on the home network. This document describes
    the extensions used to provide the base host configuration in the Registration
    Request and Reply messages.</p>"
