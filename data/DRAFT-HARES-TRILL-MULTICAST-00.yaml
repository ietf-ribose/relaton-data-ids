abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Rbridges are transparent Layer 2 bridges that provide the ability
    to\n   have an entire campus, with multiple physical links look like a\n   single
    subnet.  The Rbridge technology utilizes Rbridges to link\n   together Layer 2
    areas using spanning trees to calculate paths.  The\n   Rbridges run a link state
    protocol to determine the least cost paths\n   Rbridges and exchange information
    about the location of MAC\n   addresses.  The Rbridges will run a level 1 or a
    single area routing\n   protocol.  To forward multicast packets, the Rbirdges
    may treat these\n   as broadcast (sending the packets to all Rbridges) or use
    methods to\n   snoop the Multicast MAC addresses (GARP, MAC learning) or IP/MAC\n
    \  address packets (IGMP/PIM snooping).\n\n   Multicast Link State Rbridge connections
    suggest a Hybrid Multicast\n   Link state extensions to ISIS and OSPF for Rbridges.\n\t
