abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document addresses issues that arise when TCP is used
    to support\n   variable-rate traffic that exhibts periods where the transmission\n
    \  rate is limited by the application rather than the congestion window.\n   It
    updates TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart quickly following\n   either an idle
    or applications-limited interval.  The method is\n   expected to benefit variable-rate
    TCP applications, while also\n   providing an appropriate response if congestion
    is experienced.\n\n   The document also evaluates TCP Congestion Window Validation
    (CWV),\n   an IETF experimental specification defined in RFC 2861, and concludes\n
    \  that CWV sought to address important issues, but failed to deliver a\n   widely
    used solution.  This document recommends that the IETF should\n   consider moving
    RFC 2861 from Experimental to Historic status, and\n   that this is replaced by
    the current specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
