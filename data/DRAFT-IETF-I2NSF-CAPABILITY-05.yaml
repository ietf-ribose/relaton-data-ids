abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft defines the concept of an NSF (Network Security
    Function)\n   capability, as well as its information model. Capabilities are a
    set\n   of features that are available from a managed entity, and are\n   represented
    as data that unambiguously characterizes an NSF.\n   Capabilities enable management
    entities to determine the set of\n   features from available NSFs that will be
    used, and simplify the\n   management of NSFs.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
