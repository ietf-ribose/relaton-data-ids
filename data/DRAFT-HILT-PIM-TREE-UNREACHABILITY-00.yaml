abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, PIM-SM is the most widely deployed multicast routing\n
    \  protocol in the Internet.  Nevertheless this multicast protocol lacks\n   connectivity
    debugging function, making it difficult to identify for\n   example; -multicast
    routing problem, -source unavailability, -RP\n   failure, etc...  When a host
    wants to receive a multicast group/\n   channel, if for any reason the associated
    tree branch cannot be\n   built, nothing exists to inform the receiver or its
    network about\n   this failure.  We propose here a new PIM message suitable for
    Join\n   forwarding error notification.  It is able to inform where and why\n
    \  such an error happened in the network and this without using a\n   multicast
    traceroute mechanism.  This message is also suitable to\n   reduce globally the
    impact of useless branches in a PIM domain.\n   Furthermore it should be used
    to block DDoS (Distributed Denial of\n   Service) attacks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
