abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The draft describes an interface based on CoAP to manage constrained\n
    \  devices via MIBs.  The proposed integration of CoAP with SNMP reduces\n   the
    code- and application development complexity by accessing MIBs\n   via a standard
    CoAP server.  The payload of the MIB request is CBOR\n   based on JSON.  The mapping
    from SMI to CBOR is specified.\n\nNote\n\n   Discussion and suggestions for improvement
    are requested, and should\n   be sent to core@ietf.org.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
