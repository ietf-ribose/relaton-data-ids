abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The ICMPv6 protocol provides many functions which in IPv4 were
    either\nnon-existent or provided by lower layers.  IPv6 architecture also\nmakes
    it possible to secure all IP packets using IPsec, even ICMPv6\nmessages.  IPsec
    architecture has a Security Policy Database that\nspecifies which traffic is protected,
    and how.  It turns out that the\nspecification of policies in the presence of
    ICMPv6 traffic is hard,\nparticularly with ICMPv6 packets related to Neighbor
    Discovery.\nSound looking policies may easily lead to loops: The establishment
    of\nsecurity requires Neighbor Discovery messages which can not be sent\nsince
    security has not been established yet.  The purpose of this\ndraft is to inform
    system administrators and IPsec implementors in\nwhich manner they can handle
    the ICMPv6 messages.  Common\nunderstanding of the way that these messages are
    handled is also\nnecessary for interoperability, in case vendors hardcode such
    rules\nin to products.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
