abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) protocol provides authentication,
    confidentiality, integrity, data-origin authentication and anti- replay. Currently,
    IKEv2 is mainly used as a control channel to negotiate IPsec SA(s). IPsec is not
    well suited to provide transport layer security for applications as it resides
    at the network layer and most of the IPsec implementations require integration
    into operating systems making it difficult to deploy. IPsec uses different sessions
    for control and data traffic which is not NAT and load balancer friendly. TLS/DTLS,
    the other popular security mechanism to provide the above security services does
    not mandate mutual peer authentication and Diffie Hellman exchange. This document
    describes an IKEv2 based lightweight secure data communication protocol and a
    way to provide transport layer security for UDP client/server applications. The
    protocol provides integrity protected encryption and integrity-only protection
    based on application needs. As most of the IoT applications are UDP based, IKEv2
    can be used for key management as well secure data communication in IoT due to
    its simplicity, scalability, lightweightedness and ease of deployment.</p>"
