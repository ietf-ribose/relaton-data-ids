abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobility has become a basic premise of network communications,\n
    \  thereby requiring a native integration into 5G networks.  Despite\n   numerous
    efforts to propose and standardize effective mobility-\n   management models for
    IP, the result is a complex, poorly flexible\n   set of mechanisms.  The natural
    support for mobility offered by ICN\n   (Information Centric Networking) makes
    it a good candidate to define\n   a radically new solution relieving limitations
    of the traditional\n   approaches.  If consumer mobility is supported in ICN by
    design, in\n   virtue of its connectionless pull-based communication model, producer\n
    \  mobility is still an open challenge.  In this document, we focus on\n   two
    prominent ICN architectures, CCN (Content Centric Networking) and\n   NDN (Named
    Data Networking) and describe MAP-Me, an anchor-less\n   solution to manage micro-mobility
    of content producers via a name-\n   based CCN/NDN data plane, with support for
    latency-sensitive\n   applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
