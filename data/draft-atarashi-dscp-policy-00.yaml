abstract:
- content: "<p>In reviewing the specific use of the Differentiated Services Architecture
    for supporting the Internet Emergency Preparedness System, we found what we believe
    is a general issue. This is that even though a client or peer can connect to a
    server or peer with a predictable DSCP value, the response does not have a predictable
    DSCP value. We consider the issues, and recommend an approach to application policy
    regarding the DSCP.</p>"
