abstract:
  content: "<p>In reviewing the specific use of the Differentiated ServicesArchitecture
    for supporting the Internet Emergency PreparednessSystem, we found what we believe
    is a general issue. This is thateven though a client or peer can connect to a
    server or peer with apredictable DSCP value, the response does not have a predictable
    DSCPvalue. We consider the issues, and recommend an approach toapplication policy
    regarding the DSCP.</p>"
