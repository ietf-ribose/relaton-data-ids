abstract:
- content: "<p>To improve network resource utilization and reduce operational expense,
    the Control-Plane and User-Plane separation concept is defined in Broadband Forum
    TR-384. This document describes the information model for the interface between
    the Control-Plane (CP) and the User-Plane (UP) in the CP/UP separation BNG. This
    information model may involve both the control channel interface and the configuration
    channel interface. The interface for the control channel allows the Control-Plane
    to send flow tables to the User- Plane, such as user's information table, user's
    interface table, and user's QoS table. And it also allows the User-Plane to report
    resource and statistics information to the Control-Plane. The interface for the
    configuration channel is in charge of the protocol version negotiation between
    the Control-Plane and User-Plane, the configuration for devices of the Control-Plane
    and User-Plane, and the reports of User-Plane's capabilities, etc. The information
    model defined in this document supports defining a standardized data model. Such
    a data model can be used to specify an interface to the CU separation BNG.</p>"
