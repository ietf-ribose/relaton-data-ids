abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) and its corresponding\n
    \  protocol extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do\n   stateful
    control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic\n   Engineering Label
    Switched Paths (TE LSP).  One application that\n   stateful PCE can realize is
    data traffic reoptimization among the\n   LSPs.  Data traffic traversed in a LSP
    can be switched to another\n   PCE-initiated LSP.  Moreover, data traffic can
    be balanced to\n   multiple PCE-initiated LSPs and may also be policed based on
    a\n   signaling bandwidth of a PCE-Initiated LSP using stateful PCE.\n\n   This
    document specifies the extensions to Path Computation Element\n   Protocol (PCEP)
    that allow a stateful PCE to do switchover, balancing\n   and policing of data
    traffic with PCE-initiated LSPs.  This document\n   also specifies the extensions,
    usage and handling of stateful PCEP\n   messages and the expected behavior of
    PCC as the RSVP-TE headend.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
