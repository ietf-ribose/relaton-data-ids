abstract:
  content: <p>The proposed [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] defines DNS records that advertisethe
    extent to which a domain employs [RFC4871] to sign [RFC2822]messages, and defines
    how other hosts can access theseadvertisements. Its laudable goal is to allow
    domains control overthe use of the From header field. When a message is not adequatelysigned,
    advertised assertions, referenced by a domain in the Fromheader field, assist
    in resolving the message's intended disposition.Rather than dealing with keys
    that impose a restriction on the "on-behalf-of" identity as a separate security
    consideration to behandled independently from an assertion that a domain signs
    theirmessages, [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] instead employs a flawed two-stagesignature
    validation process that works in conjunction withadvertised practices. The two-stage
    approach will most likely occurafter message acceptance, and impairs the range
    of authenticationassertions permitted by a single signature. The limitations onauthentication
    assertions inhibits tactics needed to deal with replayabuse.As currently structured,
    advertised practices not only assert whethera signature should be expected, they
    also constrain the"on-behalf-of" identity applied by signing agents that are nototherwise
    so restricted by [RFC4871]. By constraining the "on-behalf-of" identity for all
    signing agents, the draft neglects thepredominate role of the domain as a point
    of trust, and incorrectlyassumes the signature is limited to supporting assertions
    regardingthe identity of the author. By limiting the DKIM signature's "on-behalf-of"
    value to being representative of only the message'sauthor, the draft goes well
    beyond the working group's charter andappears to infringe on S/MIME's and OpenPGP's
    role.[I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] impairs security in other ways as well, such asthe only
    directly actionable practice is defined using a term likelyto negatively impact
    the integrity of delivery status. Fortunatelyminor changes to the definition of
    a compliant signature can remedythe impairment created, where the critical security
    issues are besthandled independent of any [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] assertion.</p>
