abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multihomed mobile nodes are capable of simultaneous attachment
    to\nmultiple access networks.  In this case, a PMIPv6-enabled local\nmobility
    anchor should distribute the application traffic to a proper\naccess network which
    the mobile nodes wish to receive from.  This\ndocument specifies how mobile nodes
    send their desire of flow\nmovement to an attached mobile access gateway, which
    then relays it\nto a local mobility anchor.\n\t </p>\n      "
