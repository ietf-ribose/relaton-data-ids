abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document contains an initial specification for the Explicit\n
    \  Control Protocol (XCP), an experimental congestion control protocol.\n   XCP
    is designed to deliver the highest possible end-to-end throughput\n   over a broad
    range of network infrastructure, including links with\n   very large bandwidth-delay
    products, which are not well served by the\n   current control algorithms.  XCP
    is potentially applicable to any\n   transport protocol, although initial testing
    has applied it to TCP in\n   particular.  XCP routers are required to perform
    a small calculation\n   on congestion state carried in each data packet.  XCP
    routers also\n   periodically recalculate the local parameters required to provide\n
    \  fairness.  On the other hand, there is no per-flow congestion state\n   in
    XCP routers.\n\n   XCP is currently not ready for wide-scale deployment on the
    public\n   Internet and the intent of this document is to provide a starting\n
    \  point for future experimentation and development as well as to record\n   the
    authors' implementation experiences and caveats.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
