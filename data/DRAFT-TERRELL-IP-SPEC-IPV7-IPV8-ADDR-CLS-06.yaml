abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This paper is a direct result, necessitated by the correction
    of the\nmathematical anomaly that plague IPv4. Whose resolution also proposed\nan
    end to the disparities resulting from a shortage of available IP\nAddresses. However,
    the proposal did not seem to garner the unfledging\nsupport through the suggestion
    of an alternate IP system of \naddressing. Which is nothing more than an exploitation
    of the present\nIPv4 system. As presented in the paper entitled; 'The Mathematical\nReality
    of IP Addressing in IPv4 Questions the need for Another IP\nSystem of Addressing'.\n
    \nNeedless to say, it is thought that a greater clarification of the\nunderlining
    foundation of this subject matter is that which is\nneeded. Notwithstanding my
    personal beliefs, that the promises made\nby the IT Industry itself, will not
    be forth coming if an adequate\nIP System of Addressing is not employed. Nor the
    mention of the hidden \ncost the consumer is expected to pay, which is a direct
    result of \ntheir knowledge regarding a clear understanding of our present\ntechnology,
    and the ability of the Technology to the IT Industry,\nwhich could reduce the
    overall cost today. All while fulfilling of the\npromises they made to the consumer,
    which becomes the reality of a\nfuture which benefits all mankind.\n\n\t </p>\n
