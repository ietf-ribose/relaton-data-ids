  content: "\n\t <p>   In-network computing can be conceived in many different ways
    - from\n   active networking, data plane programmability, running virtualized\n
    \  functions, service chaining, to distributed computing.\n\n   This memo proposes
    a particular direction for Computing in the\n   Networking (COIN) research and
    lists suggested research challenges.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
