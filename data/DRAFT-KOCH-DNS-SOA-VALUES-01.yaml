    of\nfreedom and thus several opportunities of making mistakes. Most DNS\nzones
    today are small and have to be set up and maintained by non-\nexperts. This document
    gives recommendations on which values to use\nfor the SOA resource record of small,
    stable DNS zones to aid novice\nadministartors and to contribute to DNS stability
    end efficiency.\n\t </p>\n      "
