abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an approach to engineer a hierarchical
    \nnetwork by means of offline traffic engineering. This approach can \nbe used
    as a stand-alone solution, as was recently described as an \nexample of a best
    current practice, or it may be combined with \nonline traffic engineering. The
    offline approach presented here uses \nglobal information about network topology
    and traffic matrix to \noptimize explicit routes in the network. The optimization
    is based \non the definition of global network performance parameters. \n\n\t
