abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Building management systems have evolved toward IP communication
    at\nthe enterprise level during the past decade.  IP implementation at\nthe real-time
    control and sensor layers would provide a single\npervasive protocol usable across
    the entire system increasing\nflexibility and code reuse.  This document will
    describe the topology\nof these building networks, the application protocols widely
    used in\ntheir deployment and the application use cases.\n\t </p>\n      "
