abstract:
  content: "<p>{ Work in progress to update OpenPGP } This document is maintained
    in order to publish all necessary information needed to develop interoperable
    applications based on the OpenPGP format. It is not a step-by-step cookbook for
    writing an application. It describes only the format and methods needed to read,
    check, generate, and write conforming packets crossing any network. It does not
    deal with storage and implementation questions. It does, however, discuss implementation
    issues necessary to avoid security flaws. OpenPGP software uses a combination
    of strong public-key and symmetric cryptography to provide security services for
    electronic communications and data storage. These services include confidentiality,
    key management, authentication, and digital signatures. This document specifies
    the message formats used in OpenPGP.</p>"
