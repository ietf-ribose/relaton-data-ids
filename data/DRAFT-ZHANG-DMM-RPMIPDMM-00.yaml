abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based centralized
    mobility\n       management protocol, which has many disadvantages for utilizing
    the\n       centralized anchor LMA. As networks are moving towards flat\n       architectures,
    a distributed approach is needed to PMIPv6. This\n       document defines a robust
    solution for PMIPv6-based distributed\n       mobility management which ensures
    the robustness by organizing the\n       distributed anchors (MAARs) into a Chord
    ring.\n\n    \n\t </p>\n      "
