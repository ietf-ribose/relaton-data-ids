abstract:
- content: "<p>To reduce the likelihood of addressing conflicts and confusion between
    lab deployments and non-lab (i.e., production) deployments, an IPv6 unicast address
    prefix is reserved for use in lab, proof-of- concept, and validation networks
    as well as for for any similar use case. This document describes the use of the
    IPv6 address prefix 0200::/7 as a prefix reserved for this purpose (repurposing
    the deprecated OSI NSAP-mapped prefix).</p>"
