abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IETF specifications may not receive significant review,especially
    beyond a single working group, until theyare submitted to the IESG. Hence, significant
    problemswith a specification often are not detected until aproblematic approach
    has been adopted and considerableeffort has been spent developing and documenting
    thisapproach. Major changes to address problems identifiedlate in the process
    take considerable effort andsignificantly delay a document that its authorsbelieved
    to be ready for publication. The proceduredescribed in this document is intended
    to solve, orpalliate, a number of related problems that have beenobserved in the
    IETF process. The basic model is tocreate a team of Senior IETF Reviewers (SIRS),
    and haveall documents receive a certain number of reviews bySIRs, prior to being
    submitted for publication. Reviewby SIRs at a very early stage is strongly encouraged.</p>"
