abstract:
- content: <p>Many Service Providers (SPs) offer the Virtual Private Network (VPN)
    services to their customers, using a technique in which Customer Edge (CE) routers
    are routing peers of Provider Edge (PE) routers. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
    is used to distribute the customer's routes across the provider's IP backbone
    network, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel customer packets
    across the provider's backbone. This is known as a "BGP/MPLS IP VPN". Originally
    only IPv4 was supported and it was later extended to support IPv6 VPNs as well.
    Extensions were later added for the support of the Open Shortest Path First protocol
    version 2 (OSPFv2) as a PE-CE routing protocol for the IPv4 VPNs. This document
    extends those specifications to support OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) as a PE-CE routing
    protocol. The OSPFv3 PE-CE functionality is identical to that of OSPFv2 except
    for the differences described in this document.</p>
