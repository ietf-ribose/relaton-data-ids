abstract:
- content: <p>This specification updates RFC 5545 by introducing a number of new iCalendar
    properties and components that are of particular use for event publishers and
    in social networking. This specification also defines a new "STRUCTURED-DATA"
    property for iCalendar (RFC 5545) to allow for data that is directly pertinent
    to an event or task to be included with the calendar data.</p>
