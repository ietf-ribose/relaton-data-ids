abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes some extensions for enhancing SIP response\n
    \  authentication.  In the real-world SIP deployment, TLS may be not\n   available
    on some hops.  Due to the lack of other response\n   authentication mechanisms
    in SIP, several kinds of security attacks\n   could be conducted on those hops
    through SIP response.  This draft\n   suggests some approaches for complementary
    enhancement on SIP\n   response authentication.  With the new per-hop response\n
    \  authentication proposed in this draft, the security gaps on the hops\n   without
    TLS can be bridged.\n\t </p>\n      "
