abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The high amount of small packets present in nowaday's networks\n
    \  results in a low efficiency, as the size of the headers and the\n   payload
    of these packets can be in the same order of magnitude.  In\n   some situations,
    multiplexing a number of small packets into a bigger\n   one is desirable in order
    to improve the efficiency.  For example, a\n   number of small packets can be
    sent together between a pair of\n   machines if they share a common network path.
    \ Thus, the traffic\n   profile can be shifted from small to larger packets, reducing
    the\n   network overhead and the number of packets per second to be managed\n
    \  by intermediate routers.\n\n   This document describes Simplemux, a protocol
    able to encapsulate a\n   number of packets belonging to different protocols into
    a single\n   packet.  Small headers (separators) are added at the beginning of\n
    \  each multiplexed packet, including some flags, the packet length and\n   a
    \"Protocol\" field.  This allows the inclusion of a number of packets\n   belonging
    to different protocols (the \"multiplexed packets\") on a\n   packet of another
    protocol (the \"tunneling protocol\").\n\n   In order to reduce the overhead,
    the size of the multiplexing headers\n   is kept very low (it may be a single
    byte when multiplexing small\n   packets).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
