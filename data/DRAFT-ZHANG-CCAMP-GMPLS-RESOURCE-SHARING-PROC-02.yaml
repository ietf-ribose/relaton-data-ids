abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In transport networks, there are requirements where Generalized\n
    \  Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) end-to-end recovery scheme\n   needs
    to employ restoration Label Switched Path (LSP) while keeping\n   resources for
    the working and/or restoration LSPs reserved in the\n   network after the failure
    occurs.\n\n   This document reviews how the LSP association is to be provided
    using\n   Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)\n   signaling
    in the context of GMPLS end-to-end recovery when using\n   restoration LSP where
    failed LSP is not torn down.  In addition, this\n   document compliments existing
    standards by explaining the missing\n   pieces of information during the RSVP-TE
    signaling procedure in\n   support of resource sharing-based LSP setup/teardown
    in GMPLS-\n   controlled circuit networks.  No new procedures or mechanisms are\n
    \  defined by this document, and it is strictly informative in nature.\n\n\n\n\t
