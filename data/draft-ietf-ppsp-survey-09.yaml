abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a survey of some of the most popular Peer-to-
    Peer (P2P) streaming applications on the Internet. The main selection criteria
    have been popularity and availability of information on operation details at writing
    time. In doing this, selected applications are not reviewed as a whole, but they
    are reviewed with main focus on the signaling and control protocol used to establish
    and maintain overlay connections among peers and to advertise and download streaming
    content.</p>"
