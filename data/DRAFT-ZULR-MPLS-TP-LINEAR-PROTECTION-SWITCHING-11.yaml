abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF Standards Track solution for MPLS Transport Profile
    (MPLS-\n   TP) Linear Protection is provided in RFC 6378, draft-ietf-mpls-psc-\n
    \  updates and draft-ietf-mpls-tp-psc-itu.\n\n   This document describes the pre-standard
    implementation of MPLS-TP\n   Linear Protection that has been deployed by several
    network operators\n   using equipment from multiple vendors.  At the time of publication\n
    \  these pre-standard implementations were still in operation carrying\n   live
    traffic.\n\n   The specified mechanism supports 1+1 unidirectional/bidirectional\n
    \  protection switching and 1:1 bidirectional protection switching.  It\n   is
    purely supported by MPLS-TP data plane, and can work without any\n   control plane.\n\n
    \  [Editor's note] The followings are to be included in \"Status of\n   Memo\":\n\n
    \  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\n   published
    for informational purposes.\n\n   This is a contribution to the RFC Series, independently
    of any other\n   RFC stream.  The RFC Editor has chosen to publish this document
    at\n   its discretion and makes no statement about its value for\n   implementation
    or deployment.  Documents approved for publication by\n   the RFC Editor are not
    a candidate for any level of Internet\n   Standard; see Section 2 of RFC 5741.\n\n
