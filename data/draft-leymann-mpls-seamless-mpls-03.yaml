abstract:
  content: <p>This documents describes an architecture which can be used to extendMPLS
    networks to integrate access and aggregation networks into asingle MPLS domain
    ("Seamless MPLS"). The Seamless MPLS approach isbased on existing and well known
    protocols. It provides a highlyflexible and a scalable architecture and the possibility
    to integrate100.000 of nodes. The separation of the service and transport planeis
    one of the key elements; Seamless MPLS provides end to end serviceindependent
    transport. Therefore it removes the need for servicespecific configurations in
    network transport nodes (without end toend transport MPLS, some additional services
    nodes/configurationswould be required to glue each transport domain). This draft
    definesa routing architecture using existing standardized protocols. Itdoes not
    invent any new protocols or defines extensions to existingprotocols.</p>
