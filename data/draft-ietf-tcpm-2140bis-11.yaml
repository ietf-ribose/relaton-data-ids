abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides guidance to TCP implementers that is intended to
    help improve connection convergence to steady-state operation without affecting
    interoperability. It updates and replaces RFC 2140's description of sharing TCP
    state, as typically represented in TCP Control Blocks, among similar concurrent
    or consecutive connections.</p>"
