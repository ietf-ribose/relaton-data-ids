abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Active traffic measurements are starting to become more widely used
    toascertain network performance characteristics. All active measurementsystems
    have the capability to measure one-way delay and one-way lossmetrics, as defined
    in RFC2679 [1] A One- way Delay Metric for IPPM andRFC 2680 [2] A One-way Packet
    Loss Metric for IPPM, respectively. Toensure that the resulting numbers have some
    meaning, we attempt tocharacterize how the measurements are taken and what would
    ensure thatthe end numbers are indeed meaningful. This document describes anapplicability
    statement (formerly known as best current practices) formeasuring the one-way
    delay and one-way loss metrics in operationalnetworks.</p>"
