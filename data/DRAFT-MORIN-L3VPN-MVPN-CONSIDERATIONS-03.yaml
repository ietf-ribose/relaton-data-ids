abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The current proposal for multicast in BGP/MPLS includes multiple\nalternative
    mechanisms for some of the required building blocks of\nthe solution.  The aim
    of this document is to leverage previously\ndocumented requirements to identify
    the key elements and help move\nforward solution design, toward the definition
    of a standard having a\nwell defined set of mandatory procedures.  The different
    proposed\nalternative mechanisms are examined in the light of requirements\nidentified
    for multicast in L3VPNs, and suggestions are made about\nwhich of these mechanisms
    standardization should favor.  Issues\nrelated to existing deployments of early
    implementations are also\naddressed.\n\t </p>\n      "
