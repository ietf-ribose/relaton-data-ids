abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Static Context Header Compression (SCHC)
    framework, which provides header compression and fragmentation functionality.
    SCHC has been tailored for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). SCHC compression
    is based on a common static context stored in LPWAN devices and in the network.
    This document applies SCHC compression to IPv6/UDP headers. This document also
    specifies a fragmentation and reassembly mechanism that is used to support the
    IPv6 MTU requirement over LPWAN technologies. Fragmentation is mandatory for IPv6
    datagrams that, after SCHC compression or when it has not been possible to apply
    such compression, still exceed the layer two maximum payload size. The SCHC header
    compression mechanism is independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which
    it will be used. Note that this document defines generic functionality. This document
    purposefully offers flexibility with regard to parameter settings and mechanism
    choices, that are expected to be made in other, technology-specific, documents.</p>"
