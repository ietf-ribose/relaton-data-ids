abstract:
- content: "<p>Recipients of emergency alerts need to be able to verify that an alert
    they receive was issued by an authorized source. The Common Alerting Protocol
    (CAP) provides a standard way of encoding alert information, but does not provide
    any security features that would support authentication of alert originators.
    This document describes a security wrapper for Common Alerting Protocol objects
    to allow alerts to be signed by alert originators. Please send feedback to the
    atoca@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
