abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The goal of this document is to define approaches to achieve a
    \"once\nand only once\" delivery of messages. The EDIINT AS2 protocol [AS2] is\nimplemented
    by a number of software tools on a variety of platforms\nwith varying capabilities
    and with varying network service quality.\nAlthough the AS2 protocol defines a
    unique \"Message-ID\", current\nimplementations of AS2 do not provide a standard
    method to prevent\nthe same message (re-transmitted by the initial sender) from
    reaching\nback-end business applications at the initial receiver. TCP\nunderpinnings
    of HTTP over which AS2 operates generally provide a\ngood quality of network connectivity,
    but experience indicates a need\nto be able to compensate for both transient server
    and socket\nexceptions, including \"Connection refused\" as well as \"Server busy.\"\nIn
    addition, difficulties with server availability, stability, and\nloads can result
    in reduced operational reliability. This document\ndescribes some ways to compensate
    for exceptions and enhance the\nreliability of AS2 protocol operation. Implementation
    of these\nreliability features is indicated by presence of the \"AS2-\nReliability\"
    value in the EDIINT-Features header.\n\nIntended Status\n\nThe intent of this
    document is to be placed on the RFC track as an\nInformational RFC.\n\nFeedback
    Instructions:\nNOTE TO RFC EDITOR:  This section should be removed by the RFC
    editor\nprior to publication.\n\nIf you want to provide feedback on this draft,
    follow these\nguidelines:\n\n-Send feedback via e-mail to the ietf-ediint list
    for discussion,\nwith \"AS2 Reliability\" in the Subject field. To enter or follow
    the\ndiscussion, you need to subscribe to ietf-ediint@imc.org.\n\n-Be specific
    as to what section you are referring to, preferably\nquoting the portion that
    needs modification, after which you state\nyour comments.\n\n-If you are recommending
    some text to be replaced with your suggested\ntext, again, quote the section to
    be replaced, and be clear on the\nsection in question.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
