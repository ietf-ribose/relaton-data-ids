abstract:
- content: "<p>When tightening the security of the core routing infrastructure, two
    steps are necessary. The first is to secure the routing protocols' packets on
    the wire. The second is to ensure that the keying material for the routing protocol
    exchanges is distributed only to the appropriate routers. This document specifies
    requirements on that distribution and proposes the use of a set of protocols to
    achieve those requirements.</p>"
