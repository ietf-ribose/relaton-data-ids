abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a mechanism to address issues that arise when
    TCP is used for traffic that exhibits periods where the sending rate is limited
    by the application rather than the congestion window. It provides an experimental
    update to TCP that allows a TCP sender to restart quickly following a rate-limited
    interval. This method is expected to benefit applications that send rate-limited
    traffic using TCP while also providing an appropriate response if congestion is
    experienced. This document also evaluates the Experimental specification of TCP
    Congestion Window Validation (CWV) defined in RFC 2861 and concludes that RFC
    2861 sought to address important issues but failed to deliver a widely used solution.
    This document therefore reclassifies the status of RFC 2861 from Experimental
    to Historic. This document obsoletes RFC 2861.</p>"
