abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a scheme to support Fast Handover over
    HMIPv6 \nnetworks. The HMIPv6 was developed to reduce the signaling overhead \nand
    delay concerned with Binding Update in Mobile IPv6. Therefore \nHMIPv6 still need
    a further handover enhancement for supporting the \nreal-time applications. Currently
    FMIPv6 is the typical protocol to \nreduce the handover latency. Accordingly it
    may be straightforward to \nsimply introduce FMIPv6 into HMIPv6 networks. However,
    it is noted \nthat such simple approach may induce unnecessary processing overhead.
    \nF-HMIPv6, described in this document, considers how to integrate these \ntwo
    protocols and provides a scheme for effective integration. \n\t </p>\n      "
