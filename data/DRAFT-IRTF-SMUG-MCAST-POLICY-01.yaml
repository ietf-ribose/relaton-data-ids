abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Security is increasingly becoming a concern in applications built
    on\nmulti-party communication.  Centrally, protection of the application\ncontent
    from non-authorized or malicious parties is the fundamental\ngoal of any security
    policy specification.  This draft seeks to\nilluminate the design space of secure
    multicast communication\npolicy.  The security requirements of existing application
    policies\nare intended to be addressable by these policy dimensions.  It is\nfrom
    an understanding of policy design space that the mechanisms for\npolicy specification
    and enforcement can be derived.\n\t </p>\n      "
