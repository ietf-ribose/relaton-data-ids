abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This paper extends the Nemo Basic Support [10] for a Mobile
    Router to\n   synchronize its Mobile Network Prefixes with its Home Agents and\n
    \  obtain new ones dynamically.  The proposed prefix delegation\n   mechanism
    is agnostic to the way the prefixes are managed and\n   provisioned at the Home
    Agent; it might be used for bootstrapping,\n   resynchronization at binding creation
    or after a loss of states (eg\n   MR reboot), MNP Renumbering, and configuration
    checking for loop\n   avoidance.\n\t </p>\n      "
