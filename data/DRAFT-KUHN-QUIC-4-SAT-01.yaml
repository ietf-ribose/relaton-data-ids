abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   QUIC's congestion control is not designed for operating over
    an\n   Internet path with a high BDP.  This limits the user experience.\n   Moreover,
    a path can combine satellites network segment together with\n   a wide variety
    of other network technologies (Ethernet, cable modems,\n   WiFi, cellular, radio
    links, etc): this complicates the\n   characteristics of the end-to-end path.
    \ If this is not addressed,\n   the end-to-end quality of experience will be degraded.\n\n
    \  This memo identifies the characteristics of a SATCOM link that impact\n   the
    operation of the QUIC transport protocol and proposes current\n   practice to
    ensure acceptable protocol performance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
