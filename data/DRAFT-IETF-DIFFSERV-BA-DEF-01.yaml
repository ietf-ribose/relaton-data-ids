abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The diffserv WG has defined the general architecture for differen-\ntiated
    services (RFC 2475) and has been focused on the definition \nand standardization
    of the 'per-hop forwarding behaviors' (or \nPHBs) required in routers (RFCs 2474,
    2597, and 2598). The dif-\nferentiated services framework creates services within
    a network \nby applying rules at the edges in the creation of traffic aggregates
    \n(known as Behavior Aggregates) coupled with the forwarding \npath behavior.
    The WG has also discussed the behavior required \nat diffserv network edges or
    boundaries for conditioning the \naggregates, elements such as policers and shapers
    [MODEL, \nMIB]. A major feature of diffserv is that only the components \napplying
    the rules at the edge need to be changed in response to \nshort-term changes in
    QoS goals in the network, rather than \nreconfiguring the interior behaviors.\n\t
