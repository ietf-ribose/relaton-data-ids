abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC, which contains the text of an individual Internet Draft that
    was submitted originally to the DISPATCH Working Group, is being published now
    as an Informational document to provide a reference for later RFCs. The original
    Abstract follows. There is a need for having a globally unique session identifier
    for the same SIP session, which can be consistently maintained across Proxies,
    B2BUAs and other SIP middle-boxes, for the purpose of Troubleshooting. This draft
    proposes a new SIP header to carry such a value: Session-ID.</p>"
