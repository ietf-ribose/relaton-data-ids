abstract:
- content: <p>This document moves "Use of /127 Prefix Length Between Routers Considered
    Harmful" (RFC 3627) to Historic status to reflect the updated guidance contained
    in "Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter- Router Links" (RFC 6164). A Standards
    Track document supersedes an informational document; therefore, guidance provided
    in RFC 6164 is to be followed when the two documents are in conflict. This document
    links the two RFCs so that the IETF's updated guidance on this topic is clearer.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>
