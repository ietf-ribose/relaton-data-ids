abstract:
  content: '<p>In common SIP practice, a two-phase "offer/answer" exchange ofsession
    description documents negotiates preferences, capabilitiesand requested sessions.
    However, the structure of the sessiondescription greatly confuses the disambiguation
    of these elements andthus the clear characterization of sessions. The current
    workproposes an alternative to the offer/answer model which leveragespre-association
    between user agents to recast those two phases into aless ambiguous form: an Advertisement
    of capabilities and preferenceswhich occurs in non-real-time before a session
    is ever requested,which is followed during session establishment by a unidirectionaland
    complete Proposal of a session.</p>'
