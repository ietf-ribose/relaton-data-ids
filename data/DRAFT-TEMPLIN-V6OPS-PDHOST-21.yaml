abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers
    which\n   assign them to their downstream-attached links and networks.  The\n
    \  requesting node can provision the prefix according to whether it acts\n   as
    a router on behalf of any downstream networks and/or as a host on\n   behalf of
    its local applications.  In the latter case, the requesting\n   node can use portions
    of the delegated prefix for its own multi-\n   addressing purposes.  This document
    therefore considers prefix\n   delegation consideations for both the classic routing
    and various\n   multi-addressing use cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
