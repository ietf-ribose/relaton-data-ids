abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a general framework called CoDel (Controlled\n
    \  Delay) that controls bufferbloat-generated excess delay in modern\n   networking
    environments.  CoDel consists of an estimator, a setpoint,\n   and a control loop.
    \ It requires no configuration in normal Internet\n   deployments.  CoDel comprises
    some major technical innovations and\n   has been made available as open source
    so that the framework can be\n   applied by the community to a range of problems.
    \ It has been\n   implemented in Linux (and available in the Linux distribution)
    and\n   deployed in some networks at the consumer edge.  In addition, the\n   framework
    has been successfully applied in other ways.\n\n   Note: Code Components extracted
    from this document must include the\n   license as included with the code in Section
    5.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
