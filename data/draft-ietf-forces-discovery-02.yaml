abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for discovering inter-FE topology,
    topology maintenance in Intra-NE. Such a mechanism is essential for all these
    elements in the set to behave as a single Network Element, as required by the
    ForCES architecture as well as to perform certain optimizations at the FE by making
    use of the topology. The mechanism only operates during post-association phase
    of ForCES protocol.</p>"
