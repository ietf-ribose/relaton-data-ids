abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a one-time password generation mechanism for
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest access authentication based on Global
    System for Mobile Communications (GSM) authentication and key generation functions
    A3 and A8, also known as GSM AKA or 2G AKA. The HTTP Authentication Framework
    includes two authentication schemes: Basic and Digest. Both schemes employ a shared
    secret based mechanism for access authentication. The GSM AKA mechanism performs
    user authentication and session key distribution in GSM and Universal Mobile Telecommunications
    System (UMTS) networks. GSM AKA is a challenge-response based mechanism that uses
    symmetric cryptography.</p>"
