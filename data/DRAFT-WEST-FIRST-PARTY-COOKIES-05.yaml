abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC6265 by defining a \"SameSite\" attribute\n
    \  which allows servers to assert that a cookie ought not to be sent\n   along
    with cross-site requests.  This assertion allows user agents to\n   mitigate the
    risk of cross-origin information leakage, and provides\n   some protection against
    cross-site request forgery attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
