abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, there are a lot of network services that impose specific
    demands on a communication network, which makes it significantly more challenging
    to network management and service deployment. SUPA aims to provide a set of data
    models and a framework to simply the deployment and management of network services.
    This document describes the SUPA basic framework and its elements. The main SUPA
    framework entities are the Operation and Management Application (OAMA) and the
    Management Agent (MA). OAMA is a functional entity that creates and runs network
    services; MA is a functional entity which enables the generation, maintenance
    and release of network topologies and network service specific abstractions, and
    maps network service specific abstractions in combination with network topology
    and policy to detail network element configurations.</p>"
