abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route can optionally carry an
    IPv4 or\n   IPv6 addresses associated with a MAC address. Remote PEs can use this\n
    \  information to reply locally (act as proxy) to IPv4 ARP requests and\n   IPv6
    Neighbor Solicitation messages and reduce/suppress the flooding\n   produced by
    the Address Resolution procedure. The information\n   conveyed in the MAC/IP route
    may not be enough for the remote PE to\n   reply to local ARP or ND requests.
    For example, if a PE learns an\n   IPv6-&gt;MAC ND entry via EVPN, the PE would
    not know if that particular\n   IPv6-&gt;MAC pair belongs to a host, a router
    or a host with an anycast\n   address, as this information is not carried in the
    MAC/IP route\n   advertisements. Similarly, other information relevant to the
    IP-&gt;MAC\n   ARP/ND entries may be needed. This document proposes an OPTIONAL\n
    \  extended community that is advertised along with an EVPN MAC/IP\n   Advertisement
    route and carries information relevant to the ARP/ND\n   resolution, so that an
    EVPN PE implementing a proxy-ARP/ND function\n   can reply to ARP Requests or
    Neighbor Solicitations with the correct\n   information.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
