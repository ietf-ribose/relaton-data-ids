abstract:
  content: "<p>As technologies for bidirectional communication over HTTP have becomepervasive,
    interest has grown in (1) defining improved mechanisms forsupport of existing
    technologies (short-term solutions such as newHTTP headers) and (2) the development
    of new bidirectional protocols(long-term solutions such as WebSocket, Bidirectional
    Web TransferProtocol, and Reverse HTTP). In order to provide context for suchwork,
    this document provides a tentative map of the design space forbidirectional HTTP,
    with special attention to deployed infrastructure(e.g. web clients, intermediaries,
    firewalls, NATs, web servers) andprogramming environments.</p>"
