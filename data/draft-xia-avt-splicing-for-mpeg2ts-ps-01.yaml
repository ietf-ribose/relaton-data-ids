abstract:
  content: "<p>The base MPEG2-TS splicing related protocols, i.e., Digital ProgramInsertion
    Splicing API [SCTE30] and Digital Program Insertion CueingMessage for Cable [SCTE35],
    only take into account how to insert thecontent (e.g., spot advertisements of
    various lengths, programsubstitution, public service announcements, etc) into
    any MPEG2-TSoutput multiplex on the splicer , as well as how to carrynotification
    of upcoming splicing and other timing information in thetransport stream, but
    not give enough mechanisms to direct theunderlying transport protocol such as
    RTP how to compatibly work withthe MPEG2-TS splicing. This memo highlights the
    issues of what's theimpact on RTP and RTCP when performing splicing between the
    primarychannel and the insertion channel.</p>"
