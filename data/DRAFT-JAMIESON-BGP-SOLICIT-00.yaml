abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an extension to BGP-4 which may be
    used by a\n   BGP-4 speaker to solicit Virtual Private Network (VPN) reachability\n
    \  information from other IBGP speakers.\n \n   The motivation of the proposed
    technique is to provide a means of\n   reducing the memory requirements of routers
    which use BGP-4 to\n   distribute VPN reachability information as described in
    [1] and [4].\n \n   The extension is backward compatible in that a router which
    supports\n   the extension can interoperate with a router which doesn't.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
