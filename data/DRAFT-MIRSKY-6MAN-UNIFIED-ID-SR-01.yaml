abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing architecture leverages the paradigm of source\n
    \  routing.  It can be realized in a network data plane by prepending\n   the
    packet with a list of instructions, a.k.a. segments.  A segment\n   can be encoded
    as a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) label, IPv4\n   address or IPv6 address.
    \ Segment Routing can be applied in MPLS data\n   plane by encoding segments in
    MPLS label stack.  It also can be\n   applied to IPv6 data plane by encoding list
    of segment identifiers in\n   IPv6 Segment Routing Extension Header (SRH).  This
    document extends\n   the use of the SRH to segment identifiers encoded as MPLS
    label and\n   IPv4 address.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
