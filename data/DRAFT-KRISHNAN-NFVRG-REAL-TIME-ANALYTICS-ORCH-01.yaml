abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the key goals of NFV is to optimize the infrastructure\n
    \  resource usage while driving operational simplicity. Real-time\n   analytics
    providing insight into various components such as compute\n   (e.g. dynamic CPU
    utilization), storage (e.g. dynamic capacity\n   usage), network (e.g. dynamic
    bandwidth utilization), energy (e.g.\n   dynamic power consumption) is key to
    not only providing visibility\n   into the NFV infrastructure and thus driving
    operational simplicity\n   but also optimizing resource usage for the purposes
    of\n   orchestration. This draft focusses on use cases and architectural\n   framework
    for real-time analytics and orchestration including Big\n   Data predictive analytics
    for addressing the aforementioned\n   requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
