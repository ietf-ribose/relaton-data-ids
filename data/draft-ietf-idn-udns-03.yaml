    a desire to use other characters than ASCII in domain names.Lately this desire
    have grown very strong and several groups havestarted to experiment with non-ASCII
    names. This document defineshow the Universal Character Set (UCS) [ISO10646] is
    to be used inDNS. It includes both a transition scheme for older softwaresupporting
    non-ASCII handling in applications only, as well as how touse UCS in labels and
