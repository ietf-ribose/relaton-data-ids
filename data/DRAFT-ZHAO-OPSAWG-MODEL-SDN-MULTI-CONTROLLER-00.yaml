abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a reference model for building SDN
    control\n   plane with multiple controllers. It defines the key components in\n
    \  the model and introduces an effective mechanism to balance the load\n   between
    controllers. The design also considers the tradeoff between\n   scalability and
    performance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
