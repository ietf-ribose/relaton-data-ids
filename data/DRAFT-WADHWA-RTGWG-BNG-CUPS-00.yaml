abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses separation of subscriber-management
    control\n   plane and data-plane for BNG. Traditionally, the BNG provides\n   aggregation
    of fixed access nodes (such as DSLAM and OLTs) over\n   Ethernet and provides
    subscriber management and traffic management\n   functions for residential subscribers.
    The BNG has however evolved\n   to become a multi-access edge device that also
    provides termination\n   of subscribers over fixed-wireless and hybrid access.
    Therefore,\n   this document proposes interfaces between control and user-plane
    of\n   a BNG that can support multi-access BNG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
