abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data Centre TCP (DCTCP) was designed to provide predictably
    low\n   queuing latency, near-zero loss, and throughput scalability using\n   explicit
    congestion notification (ECN) and an extremely simple\n   marking behaviour on
    switches.  However, DCTCP does not co-exist with\n   existing TCP traffic---throughput
    starves.  So, until now, DCTCP\n   could only be deployed where a clean-slate
    environment could be\n   arranged, such as in private data centres.  This specification\n
    \  defines `DualQ Coupled Active Queue Management (AQM)' to allow\n   scalable
    congestion controls like DCTCP to safely co-exist with\n   classic Internet traffic.
    \ The Coupled AQM ensures that a flow runs\n   at about the same rate whether
    it uses DCTCP or TCP Reno/Cubic, but\n   without inspecting transport layer flow
    identifiers.  When tested in\n   a residential broadband setting, DCTCP achieved
    sub-millisecond\n   average queuing delay and zero congestion loss under a wide
    range of\n   mixes of DCTCP and `Classic' broadband Internet traffic, without\n
    \  compromising the performance of the Classic traffic.  The solution\n   also
    reduces network complexity and eliminates network configuration.\n\n\t </p>\n
