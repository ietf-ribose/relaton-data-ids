abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, network operators are trying to provide fine-granularity\n
    \  Service Level Agreement (SLA) guarantee to achieve better Quality of\n   Experience
    (QoE) for end users and engage customers, such as ultra-\n   low latency and high
    reliability service.  However, with increasing\n   security threats, differentiated
    QoE services are insufficient, the\n   demands for more differentiated security
    service are emerging.\n\n   This document explores the requirements for differentiated
    security\n   services and identifies the scenarios for network operators.  To\n
    \  provide differentiated security services, possible trustworthiness-\n   based
    routing solution is discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
