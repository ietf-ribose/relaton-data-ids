abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) is used as a certificate\n
    \  provisioning protocol over HTTPS.  Low-resource devices often use the\n   lightweight
    Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for message\n   exchanges.  This document
    defines how to transport EST payloads over\n   secure CoAP (EST-coaps), which
    allows constrained devices to use\n   existing EST functionality for provisioning
    certificates.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
