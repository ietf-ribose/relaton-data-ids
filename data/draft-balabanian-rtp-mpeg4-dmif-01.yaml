abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft technical proposal describes how RTP carrying MPEG-4payloads
    interacts with the MPEG-4 Sync layer through the MPEG(Delivery Multimedia Integration
    Framework) DMIF. Single or multipleMPEG-4 streams can be carried over one RTP
    session. MPEG-4 informationessential for the efficient packing and unpacking of
    MPEG-4 streamsinto/from RTP is identified. The DMIF end-to-end signaling protocol
    is applied to identify the MPEG-4RTP payload types and ensure stack compatibility
    at both sender andreceiver locations. DMIF also interprets the RTCP reports by
    comparingits statistics to the requested MPEG-4 media based QoS. If thestatistics
    fail to meet the requested QoS then action is taken to eithercontinue with the
    impaired performance, upgrade the network serviceclass, scale down the stream
    or delete the stream. This action is apartfrom scalability using the stream back-channel
    flow control which maybe present between an encoder and its decoder. This is an
    update of the draft-ietf-avt-rtp-mpeg4-dmif-00. It reflectsthe latest MPEG-4 specs.
    In addition some clarifications are includedand an open issues section is established
    based on feedback received.</p>"
