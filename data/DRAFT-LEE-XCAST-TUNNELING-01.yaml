abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Explicit multicast(Xcast)[1] is a new kind of Internet multicast,\nand
    encodes the list of destinations within its packet.  This\ndocument specifies
    tunneling scheme of Xcast packets.  Since a\nsingle Xcast tunnel has multiple
    egress-nodes, the original Xcast\npacket can be encapsulated either within a Xcast
    packet or within a\nunicast packet. When tunneled by Xcast-in-Xcast encapsulation,
    the\nbitmap of the original Xcast packet is overwritten by the bitmap of\nthe
    tunnel Xcast packet at tunnel egress-nodes, in order to control\nthe active destination
    set.\n\t </p>\n      "
