abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
    (ND)\n   for rapid network prefix and service discovery in vehicular networks.\n
    \  It is assumed that a vehicle or a Road-Side Unit (RSU) have an\n   external
    network interface and their internal network.  The extended\n   IPv6 ND called
    vehicular ND can support vehicle-to-infrastructure\n   communications as well
    as vehicle-to-vehicle communications.  This\n   document defines new ND options
    to allow a vehicle to announce the\n   network prefixes and services inside its
    internal network to another\n   vehicle or RSU.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
