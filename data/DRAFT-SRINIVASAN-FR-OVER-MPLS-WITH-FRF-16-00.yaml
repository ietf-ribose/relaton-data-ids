  content: "\n\t <p>    A Frame Relay pseudowire (PW) with Multilink Frame Relay UNI/NNI\n
    \   (FRF.16) is a mechanism that can be used for transporting the Frame\n    Relay
    Protocol Data Units (PDUs) got after reassembling the FRF.16\n    fragments over
    a MPLS packet switched network (PSN).  The goal of\n    this document is to describe
    the encapsulation that is required for\n    this.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
