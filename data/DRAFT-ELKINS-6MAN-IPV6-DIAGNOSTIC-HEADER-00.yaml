abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IPv4 main header contained a 16-bit IPID for fragmentation
    and\nreassembly.  This field was commonly used by network diagnosticians for\ntracking
    packets on multi-tier networks. In IPv6, the IPID has been\nmoved to the Fragment
    header.  A new Diagnostic header for IPv6 which\ncan be sent with every packet
    as a part of the Destination Options\nheader with a 64-bit IPID is defined in
    this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
