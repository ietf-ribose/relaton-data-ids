abstract:
  content: <p>The XML patch document format defines an XML document structure for
    expressing a sequence of patch operations to be applied to an XML document. The
    XML patch document format builds on the foundations defined in RFC 5261. This
    specification also provides the media type registration "application/xml-patch+xml",
    to allow the use of XML patch documents in, for example, HTTP conversations.</p>
