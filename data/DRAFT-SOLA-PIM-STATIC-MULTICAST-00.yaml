abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is\n
    \  currently defined as an intra-domain multicast protocol. Although in\n   PIM-SM
    more than one Candidate Rendezvous Point (C-RP) may exist,\n   only one can be
    active at a given time, and this will be the one to\n   which receivers will send
    Join messages or sources will send Register\n   messages.  The method used in
    PIM-SM to make public the set of C-RPs\n   for a multicast group is to flood all
    over the domain packets with\n   the list of C-RPs using the so-called Bootstrap
    method.  This\n   approach may scale in domains with few routers but does not
    scale if\n   the protocol would have to be applied to provide multicast throughout\n
    \  the whole internet.\n \n   In this draft we specify the modifications needed
    in PIM-SM in order\n   to support more than one active RP simultaneously, and
    also show how\n   Static Multicast can be used to make public in an scalable way
    the\n   information regarding RPs as well as the IP multicast address for the\n
    \  multicast group.  In the presence of more than one source, having\n   more
    than one RP and placing them according to sources and receivers'\n   distribution
    on the internet will reduce the average number of hops\n   from sources to receivers,
    and will also improve the multicast\n   protocol's fault tolerance.\n\n\t </p>\n
