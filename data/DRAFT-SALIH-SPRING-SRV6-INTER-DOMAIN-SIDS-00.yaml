abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes three new SRv6 end point behaviors,
    named\n   END.REPLACE, END.REPLACEB6 and END.DB6.  These SIDs are used in\n   distributed
    inter-domain solutions for connecting SRv6 domains.  This\n   behavior is normally
    executed on border routers between different\n   domains.  These SIDs can also
    be used to provide multiple intent\n   based paths across these domains.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
