abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a single reference point for requirements
    for\n   Relying Party (RP) software for use in the Resource Public Key\n   Infrastructure
    (RPKI).  It cites requirements that appear in several\n   RPKI RFCs, making it
    easier for implementers to become aware of these\n   requirements that are segmented
    with orthogonal functionalities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
