abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the term \"Public Suffix domain\" as
    meaning a\n   domain under which multiple parties that are unaffiliated with the\n
    \  owner of the Public Suffix domain may register subdomains.  Examples\n   of
    Public Suffix domains include \"org\", \"co.uk\", \"k12.wa.us\" and\n   \"uk.com\".
    \ It also defines a file format that can be used to\n   distribute information
    about such Public Suffix domains to relying\n   parties.  As an example, this
    information is then used to limit which\n   domains an Internet service can set
    HTTP cookies for, strengthening\n   the rules already defined by the cookie specification.
    \ This\n   specification updates RFC 6265 [RFC6265] by defining the term \"Public\n
    \  Suffix domain\".\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
