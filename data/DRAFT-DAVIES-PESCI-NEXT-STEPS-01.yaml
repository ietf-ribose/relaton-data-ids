  content: "\n\t <p>This document sets out a strawman proposal for how to organize
    the\nrevision and update of any part of the Internet Engineering Task\nForce (IETF)
    processes including those for developing standards and\nother specifications.
    \ It does not propose specific changes to any of\nthese processes, which should
    be the subject of future documents.\nHowever, it does propose an initial target
    area for process change.\n\t </p>\n      "
