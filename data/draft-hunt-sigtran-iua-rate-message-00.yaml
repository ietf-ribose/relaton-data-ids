abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a new message, its associated acknowledgementmessage,
    and a new parameter to extend the ISDN Q.921-User Adaptation(IUA) protocol (RFC4233).
    The protocol extension is to support theuse of an Overload Control Agent in a
    Signaling Gateway (SG). TheOverload Control Agent is able to restrict the admission
    of neworiginating ISDN calls (sessions) messages from the ISDN End Point toeach
    Application Server Process (ASP). Both messages defined herecontain a single mandatory
    parameter, the Call (Session) AdmissionRate. An ASP is able to use this protocol
    extension to control therate of new calls admitted towards that ASP by the Overload
    ControlAgent.The new message and its acknowledgement message are added to theApplication
    Server Process Traffic Maintenance (ASPTM) message class.As the DPNSS1/DASS2 Extension
    to IUA (DUA, RFC4129) also uses theASPTM message class, the IUA protocol extension
    described in thisdocument also applies to DUA.For backward compatibility, a Signaling
    Gateway which does notsupport the new message is expected to follow standard IUA
    behaviourby discarding the message, and returning an error code of\"Unsupported
    Message Type\" to the sender.</p>"
