abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Content publishers (CPs) often use multiple Content Delivery
    Networks\n   (CDNs) to deliver content to consumers.  Though existing interactions\n
    \  between CPs and individual CDNs are beyond the scope of CDN\n   interconnection
    (CDNI), it is important to understand the management\n   capabilities and features
    available with existing non-interconnected\n   multi-CDN deployments.  Before
    migrating to CDNI, CPs must first\n   assess the suitability of CDNI as a replacement
    for their existing\n   non-interconnected multi-CDN deployments.  CDN feature
    configuration\n   and capability advertisement and enforcement is likely to occur\n
    \  through the CDNI metadata interface (MI).  This document describes an\n   approach
    to implementing the CDNI MI through the use of an extensible\n   metadata model
    and a light-weight HTTP-based API.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
