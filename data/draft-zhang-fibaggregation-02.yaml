abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The rapid growth of Forwarding Information Base (FIB) has raisedconcerns
    among many Internet Service Providers. One potentialsolution to this problem is
    FIB aggregation, i.e. letting each routeraggregate its FIB entries without affecting
    the forwarding pathstaken by data traffic. It is a simple local software optimizationwithin
    a router, requiring no changes to routing protocols or routerhardware. To understand
    the effectiveness of using FIB aggregationto extend router lifetime, in this draft
    we present several FIBaggregation algorithms and evaluate their performance using
    routingtables and updates collected from tens of networks. Our results showthat
    FIB aggregation can reduce the FIB table size by as much as 70%with small computational
    overhead. We also show that thecomputational overhead can be controlled through
    various mechanisms.</p>"
