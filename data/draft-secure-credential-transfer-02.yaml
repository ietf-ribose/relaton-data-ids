abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to transfer digital credentials
    securely between two devices. Secure credentials may represent a digital key to
    a hotel room, a digital key to a door lock in a house or a digital key to a car.
    Devices that share credentials may belong to the same or two different platforms
    (e.g. iOS and Android). Secure transfer may include one or more write and read
    operations. Credential transfer needs to be performed securely due to the sensitive
    nature of the information.</p>"
