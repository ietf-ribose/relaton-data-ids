abstract:
- content: <p>This document focuses on Class of Service Interconnection at inter-
    domain interconnection points. It specifies two new transitive attributes, which
    enable adjacent peers to signal Class of Service Capabilities and certain Class
    of Service admission control Parameters. The new "CoS Capability" is deliberately
    kept simple and denotes the general EF, AF Group BE and LE forwarding support
    across the advertising AS. The second "CoS Parameter Attribute" is of variable
    length and contains a more detailed description of available forwarding behaviours
    using the PHB id Code encoding. Each PHB id Code is associated with rate and size
    based traffic parameters, which will be applied in the ingress AS Border Router
    for admission control purposes to a given forwarding behaviour.</p>
