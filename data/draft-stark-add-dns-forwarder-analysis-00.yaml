abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft analyzes the behaviors that residential end users and home
    network owners (e.g., parents of young children) might experience when operating
    systems and clients support [I-D.ietf-add-ddr] and/or [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] for discovery
    of encrypted DNS services and the CE router of the home network offers itself
    as the Do53 resolver. This use case is explicitly mentioned in [I-D.ietf-add-requirements]
    Section 3.2 and has several requirements related to it. This draft has two goals:
    determine if the analysis it provides is accurate and, if it is accurate, determine
    if the behavior is acceptable to the WG or if there should be changes to either
    of the discovery mechanisms.</p>"
