abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Since large-scale Internetworks such as the public Internet
    must\n   continue to support escalating growth due to increasing demand, it is\n
    \  clear that Autonomous Systems (ASes) must avoid injecting excessive\n   de-aggregated
    prefixes into the interdomain routing system and\n   instead mitigate de-aggregation
    internally.  This document describes\n   an Interior Routing Overlay Network (IRON)
    architecture developed by\n   Boeing that supports sustainable growth within AS-interior
    routing\n   domains while requiring no changes to end systems and no changes to\n
    \  the exterior routing system.  In addition to routing scaling, IRON\n   further
    addresses other important issues including mobility\n   management, mobile networks,
    multihoming, traffic engineering, NAT\n   traversal and security.  While business
    considerations are an\n   important determining factor for widespread adoption,
    they are out of\n   scope for this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
