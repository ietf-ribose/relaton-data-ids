abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MPLS-TP defines a packet-based network architecture and a\n
    \  comprehensive set of tools that allow service providers to reliably\n   deliver
    next generation services and applications, in a simple,\n   scalable, and cost-effective
    way.  Such services are BW-hungry based\n   and require strict guaranteed SLA.
    \ Delivering next generation\n   services over an MPLS-TP based network in an
    economic way, enables\n   service providers to remain competitive while increasing
    their\n   revenues.\n\n   This document presents the motivations for migrating
    from different\n   legacy transport networks and services to MPLS-TP, and discusses
    the\n   considerations and strategies for the migration.\n\n   The document also
    proposes specific activities and techniques needed\n   to ensure a smooth migration
    path from the different transport\n   networks and services to MPLS-TP.\n\n\t
