abstract:
- content: "<p>Due to the way the IRC protocol is implemented, it may occur that a
    server sends incomplete messages to a client, so called continuation message lines.
    There seems to exist confusion about how to handle continuation message lines;
    many implementations are broken and do not respect them at all. Others rely on
    timers to complete continuation lines, which is not recommended due to the asyncronous
    nature of IRC communications. This Memo proposes an algorithm to handle continuation
    lines received from an IRC connection in such way that no timers are needed, and
    is intended as a supplement to the existing RFC 1459 which describes the Internet
    Relay Chat protocol.</p>"
