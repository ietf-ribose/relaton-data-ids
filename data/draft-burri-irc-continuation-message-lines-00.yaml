abstract:
  content: "<p>Due to the way the IRC protocol is implemented, it may occur that aserver
    sends incomplete messages to a client, so called continuationmessage lines.There
    seems to exist confusion about how to handle continuationmessage lines; many implementations
    are broken and do not respectthem at all. Others rely on timers to complete continuation
    lines,which is not recommended due to the asyncronous nature of IRCcommunications.This
    Memo proposes an algorithm to handle continuation lines receivedfrom an IRC connection
    in such way that no timers are needed, and isintended as a supplement to the existing
    RFC 1459 which describes theInternet Relay Chat protocol.</p>"
