abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In a network comprising thousands of BGP peers exchanging millions
    of\nroutes, many routes are reachable via more than one next-hop. Given\nthe large
    scaling targets, it is desirable to restore traffic after\nfailure in a time period
    that does not depend on the number of BGP\nprefixes. In this document we proposed
    an architecture by which\ntraffic can be re-routed to ECMP or pre-calculated backup
    paths in a\ntimeframe that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. The\nobjective
    is achieved through organizing the forwarding data\nstructures in a hierarchical
    manner and sharing forwarding elements\namong the maximum possible number of routes.
    The proposed technique\nachieves prefix independent convergence while ensuring
    incremental\ndeployment, complete automation, and zero management and provisioning\neffort.
    It is noteworthy to mention that the benefits of BGP Prefix\nIndependent Convergence
    (BGP-PIC) are hinged on the existence of more\nthan one path whether as ECMP or
    primary-backup.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
