abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cyber-physical systems and the Industrial Internet of Things
    are\n   characterized by diverse sets of requirements which can hardly be\n   satisfied
    using standard networking technology.  One example are\n   latency-critical computations
    which become increasingly complex and\n   are consequently outsourced to more
    powerful cloud platforms for\n   feasibility reasons.  The intrinsic physical
    propagation delay to\n   these remote sites can, however, already be too high
    for given\n   requirements.  The challenge is to develop techniques that bring\n
    \  together these requirements.  Utilizing available computational\n   capabilities
    within the network can be a solution to this challenge\n   which makes in-network
    computing concepts a promising starting point.\n   This document discusses select
    industrial use cases to demonstrate\n   how in-network computing concepts can
    be applied to the industrial\n   domain and to point out essential requirements
    of industrial\n   applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
