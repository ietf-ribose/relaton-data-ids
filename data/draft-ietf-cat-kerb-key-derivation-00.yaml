abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Kerberos protocol [RFC1510], cryptographic keys are used in
    a number of places. In order to minimize the effect of compromising a key, it
    is desirable to use a different key for each of these places. Key derivation [Horowitz96]
    can be used to construct different keys for each operation from the keys transported
    on the network. For this to be possible, a small change to the specification is
    necessary.</p>"
