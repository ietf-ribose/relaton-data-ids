abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Complexity is a widely used parameter in network design, yet
    there is\n   no generally accepted definition of the term.  Complexity metrics\n
    \  exist in a wide range of research papers, but most of these address\n   only
    a particular aspect of a network, for example the complexity of\n   a graph or
    software.  While it may be impossible to define a metric\n   for overall network
    complexity, there is a desire to better\n   understand the complexity of a network
    as a whole, as deployed today\n   to provide Internet services.  This document
    provides a framework to\n   guide research on the topic of network complexity,
    as well as some\n   practical examples for trade-offs in networking.\n\n   This
    document summarizes the work of the IRTF's Network Complexity\n   Research Group
    (NCRG) at the time of its closure.  It does not\n   present final results, but
    a snapshot of an ongoing activity, as a\n   basis for future work.\n\n\t </p>\n
