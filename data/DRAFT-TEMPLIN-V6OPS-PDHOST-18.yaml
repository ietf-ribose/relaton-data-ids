abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers
    which\n   assign them to their downstream-attached links and networks.  This\n
    \  document considers prefix delegation models according to whether the\n   requesting
    router acts as a router on behalf of any downstream\n   networks, as a host on
    behalf of its local applications or as both.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
