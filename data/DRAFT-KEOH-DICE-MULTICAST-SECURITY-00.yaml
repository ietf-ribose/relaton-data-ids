abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Wireless IP-based systems will be increasingly used for building\n
    \  control systems in the future where wireless devices interconnect\n   with
    each other, forming low-power and lossy networks (LLNs).  The\n   CoAP/6LoWPAN
    standards are emerging as the de-facto protocols in this\n   area for resource-constrained
    devices.  Both multicast and security\n   are key needs in these networks.  This
    draft presents a method for\n   securing multicast communication in LLNs based
    on the DTLS which is\n   already available in CoAP devices.  This draft deals
    with the\n   adaptation of the DTLS record layer to protect multicast group\n
    \  communication, assuming that all group member devices are already\n   configured
    with the group security association.  The DTLS record\n   layer implementation
    is used to encrypt and provide authentication to\n   multicast messages using
    the group keying material before sending the\n   message via IP multicast to the
    group.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
