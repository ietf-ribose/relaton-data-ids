abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use-cases of Cooperative Adaptive
    Cruise\n   Control, and Platooning, as defined by several Standards Development\n
    \  Organizations such as ETSI, IEEE P1609, SAE, 3GPP, ISO and FirstNet.\n\n   C-ACC
    and Platooning involve concepts of direct vehicle-to-vehicle,\n   and device-to-device
    communications, which are developped at least by\n   3GPP and precursory by the
    METIS EU project.  They are illustrated\n   very clearly in emergency settings
    such as FirstNet.\n\n   IP messages - instead of link-layer messages - are pertinent
    for\n   C-ACC and Platooning use-cases because applications for road safety\n
    \  such as WAZE, iRezQ and Coyote (currently involving infrastructure)\n   are
    IP messages, and proved succesful in deployments.  Applications\n   such as Sentinel
    are direct between vehicles but are not IP,\n   currently.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
