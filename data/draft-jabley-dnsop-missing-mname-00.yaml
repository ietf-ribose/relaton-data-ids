abstract:
  content: <p>The Start of Authority (SOA) Resource Record (RR) in the Domain NameSystem
    (DNS) specifies various parameters related to the handling ofdata in DNS zones.
    These parameters are variously used by authority-only servers, caching resolvers
    and DNS clients to guide them in theway that data contained within particular
    zones should be used.One particular field in the SOA RR is known as MNAME, which
    is usedto specify the "Primary Master" server for a zone. This is theserver to
    which Dynamic Updates are sent by clients. Many zones donot accept updates using
    the Dynamic Update mechanism, and any suchDNS UPDATE messages which are received
    provide no usual purpose. Forsuch zones it may be preferable not to receive updates
    from clientsat all.This document proposes a convention by which a zone operator
    cansignal to clients that a particular zone does not accept DynamicUpdates.</p>
