abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a private Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    header field (P-header) to be used by the European Telecommunications Standards
    Institute (ETSI) Telecommunications and Internet-converged Services and Protocols
    for Advanced Networks (TISPAN) for the purpose of authorizing early media flows
    in Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IP Multimedia Subsystems (IMS).
    This header field is useful in any SIP network that is interconnected with other
    SIP networks and needs to control the flow of media in the early dialog state.
