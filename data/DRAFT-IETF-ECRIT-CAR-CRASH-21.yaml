abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services\n
    \  mechanisms to support the next generation of emergency calls placed\n   by
    vehicles (automatically in the event of a crash or serious\n   incident, or manually
    invoked by a vehicle occupant) and conveying\n   vehicle, sensor, and location
    data related to the crash or incident.\n   Such calls are often referred to as
    \"Automatic Crash Notification\"\n   (ACN), or \"Advanced Automatic Crash Notification\"
    (AACN), even in the\n   case of manual trigger.  The \"Advanced\" qualifier refers
    to the\n   ability to carry a richer set of data.\n\n   This document also registers
    a MIME media type and Emergency Call\n   Additional Data Block for the vehicle,
    sensor, and location data\n   (often referred to as \"crash data\" even though
    there is not\n   necessarily a crash) and a SIP INFO package to enable carrying
    this\n   and related data in SIP INFO requests.  An external specification for\n
    \  the data format, contents, and structure are referenced in this\n   document.\n\n
    \  This document reuses the technical aspects of next-generation pan-\n   European
    eCall (a mandated and standardized system for emergency\n   calls by in-vehicle
    systems within Europe and other regions).\n   However, this document specifies
    use of a different set of vehicle\n   (crash) data, specifically, the Vehicle
    Emergency Data Set (VEDS)\n   rather than the eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD).
    \ This document is an\n   extension of the IETF eCall document, with the primary
    differences\n   being that this document makes the MSD data set optional and VEDS\n
    \  mandatory, and adds attribute values to the metadata/control object\n   to
    permit greater functionality.  This document registers a new SIP\n   INFO package
    (identical to that registered for eCall but with the\n   addition of the VEDS
    MIME type).  This document also describes legacy\n   (circuit-switched) ACN systems
    and their migration to next-generation\n   emergency calling, to provide background
    information and context.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
