abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new DNS RRtype, AUTHINFO, that is used
    by\n   authoritative servers to publish information about themselves.  This\n
    \  information can be useful because a recursive resolver can determine\n   an
    authoritative server's capabilities, such as whether an\n   authoritative server
    supports the EDNS(0) client subnet extension.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
