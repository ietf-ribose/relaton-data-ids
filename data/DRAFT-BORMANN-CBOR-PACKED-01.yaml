abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is
    a data\n   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small\n
    \  code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the\n   need
    for version negotiation.\n\n   CBOR does not provide any forms of data compression.
    \ CBOR data\n   items, in particular when generated from legacy data models often\n
    \  allow considerable gains in compactness when applying data\n   compression.
    \ While traditional data compression techniques such as\n   DEFLATE (RFC 1951)
    work well for CBOR, their disadvantage is that the\n   receiver needs to unpack
    the compressed form to make use of data.\n\n   This specification describes Packed
    CBOR, a simple transformation of\n   a CBOR data item into another CBOR data item
    that is almost as easy\n   to consume as the original CBOR data item.  A separate
    decompression\n   step is therefore often not required at the receiver.\n\n\t
