abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a protocol for decentralizing IPv4 NAT
    to the\n   customer-premises equipment (CPE) such that no state information is\n
    \  kept on the central NAT device.  The CPE uses a restricted source\n   port
    set that is encoded in its provisioned IPv4 WAN address.  The\n   NAT device performs
    only strictly stateless address (not port)\n   translation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
