abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace
    for the\n   GSMA (GSM Association)and a sub-namespace for the IMEI (International\n
    \  Mobile station Equipment Identity), and an associated parameter for\n   the
    IMEISV (International Mobile station Equipment Identity and\n   Software Version
    number).  The IMEI is 15 decimal digits long and the\n   IMEISV is 16 decimal
    digits long and both are encoded using Binary\n   Encoded Decimal (BCD).  The
    IMEI and IMEISV were introduced as part\n   of the specification for Global System
    for Mobile communications(GSM)\n   and are also now incorporated by the 3rd Generation
    Partnership\n   Project (3GPP) as part of the 3GPP specification for GSM, the\n
    \  Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and 3GPP LTE (Long\n   Term
    Evolution).  The IMEI and IMEISV are used to uniquely identify\n   Mobile Equipment
    within these systems and are managed by the GSMA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
