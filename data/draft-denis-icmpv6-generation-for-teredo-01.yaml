abstract:
  content: "<p>Teredo uses return routing to discover the closest Teredo relaycorresponding
    to any given peer. Discovery is achieved by sending anICMPv6 Echo Request and
    waiting for the appropriate relay to forwardthe ICMPv6 Echo Reply back. Unanswered
    ICMPv6 Echo Requests makeTeredo clients assume that the peer is unreachable. This
    documentidentifies two scenarios where a stateful middlebox can detect thelack
    of ICMPv6 Echo Reply and craft one for the Teredo client inorder to avoid possibly
    erroneous peer unreachability assumptions.</p>"
