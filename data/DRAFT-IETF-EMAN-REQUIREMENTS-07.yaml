abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines requirements for standards specifications
    for\n   energy management.  The requirements defined in this document concern\n
    \  monitoring functions as well as control functions.  In detail, the\n   focus
    of the requirements is on the following features:\n   identification of powered
    entities, monitoring of their Power State,\n   power inlets, power outlets, actual
    power, power properties, received\n   energy, provided energy, and contained batteries.
    \ Further\n   requirements are included to enable control of powered entities'\n
    \  power supply and Power State.  This document does not specify the\n   features
    that must be implemented by compliant implementations but\n   rather features
    that must be supported by standards for energy\n   management.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
