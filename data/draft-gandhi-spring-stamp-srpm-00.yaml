abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. SR is applicable
    to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This
    document specifies procedure for sending and processing probe query and response
    messages for Performance Measurement (PM) in Segment Routing networks. The procedure
    uses the mechanisms defined in RFC 8762 (Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol
    (STAMP)) for Delay Measurement, and uses the mechanisms defined in this document
    for Loss Measurement. The procedure specified is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6
    data planes and is used for both Links and end-to-end SR Policies.</p>"
