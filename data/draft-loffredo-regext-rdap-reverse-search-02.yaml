abstract:
- content: "<p>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include query
    capabilities to find the list of domains related to a set of entities matching
    a given search pattern. Even if such capabilities, commonly referred to as reverse
    search, respond to some needs not yet readily fulfilled by the current Whois protocol,
    they have raised concern from two perspectives: server processing impact and data
    privacy. Anyway, the impact of the reverse queries on RDAP servers processing
    is the same of the standard searches and it can be reduced by implementing policies
    to deal with big result sets, while data privacy risks can be mitigated by RDAP
    access control functionalities. This document describes RDAP query extensions
    that allows clients to request a reverse search based on the domains- entities
    relationship.</p>"
