abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Preferred Path Routing (PPR), a routing protocol
    mechanism to simplify the path description using IS-IS protocol. PPR builds on
    existing encapsulation to add the path identity to the packet and supports further
    extensions along the preferred paths. PPR aims to provide path steering, services
    and support further extensions along the paths. Preferred path routing is achieved
    through the addition of path descriptions to the IS-IS advertised prefixes, and
    mapping those to a PPR data-plane identifier.</p>"
