abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note describes the changes necessary for OSPFv3 to route
    classes\n   of IPv6 traffic that are defined by an IPv6 source prefix and a\n
    \  destination prefix.  This implies not simply routing \"to a\n   destination\",
    but \"traffic going to that destination AND coming from\n   a specified source\".
    \ It may be combined with other qualifying\n   attributes, such as \"traffic going
    to that destination AND using a\n   specified flow label AND from a specified
    source prefix\".  The\n   obvious application is egress routing, as required for
    a multihomed\n   entity with a provider-allocated prefix from each of several
    upstream\n   networks.  Traffic within the network could be source/destination\n
    \  routed as well, or could be routed from \"any prefix\", ::/0.  If\n   traffic
    is routed from the relevant PA prefixes but in fact has a\n   source address that
    is in none of them, the traffic in effect has no\n   route.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
