abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Misissued public-key certificates can prevent TLS clients from\n
    \  appropriately authenticating the TLS server.  Several alternatives\n   have
    been proposed to detect this situation and prevent a client from\n   establishing
    a TLS session with a TLS end point authenticated with an\n   illegitimate public-key
    certificate.  These mechanisms are either not\n   widely deployed or limited to
    public web browsing.\n\n   This document proposes to extend TLS with opaque pinning
    tickets as a\n   way to pin the server's identity.  During an initial TLS session,
    the\n   server provides an original encrypted pinning ticket.  In subsequent\n
    \  TLS session establishment, upon receipt of the pinning ticket, the\n   server
    proves its ability to decrypt the pinning ticket and thus the\n   ownership of
    the pinning protection key.  The client can now safely\n   conclude that the TLS
    session is established with the same TLS server\n   as the original TLS session.
    \ One of the important properties of this\n   proposal is that no manual management
    actions are required.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
