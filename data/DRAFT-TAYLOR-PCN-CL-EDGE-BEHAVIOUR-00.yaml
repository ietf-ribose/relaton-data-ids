abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality
    of\nservice for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain.  The\noverall
    PCN architecture is described in ID.PCNArch.  This memo is\none of a series describing
    possible boundary node behaviours for a\nPCN domain.  The behaviour described
    here is that for three-state\nmeasurement-based load control, known informally
    as CL.  The\nrequirement for three encoding states means that CL is for\nexperimental
    use only pending further standards action.\n\t </p>\n      "
