abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The PASSporT format defines a token that can be carried by
    signaling\n   protocols, including SIP, to cryptographically attest the identify
    of\n   callers.  Not all telephone calls use Internet signaling protocols,\n   however,
    and some calls use them for only part of their signaling\n   path.  This document
    describes use cases that require the delivery of\n   PASSporT objects outside
    of the signaling path, and defines\n   architectures and semantics to provide
    this functionality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
