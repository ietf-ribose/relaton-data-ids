abstract:
  content: "<p>This memorandum discusses the requirements for telephonysignaling and
    device control over the Internet from theperspective of meeting the needs of Internet
    service providers(ISPs) and telecom carriers wishing to provide Internet servicesthat
    include telephony. The requirements apply equally to variousInternet telephony
    and non-Internet telephony devices. For thepurpose of this Internet draft, the
    notion of telephony isbroadened to include control of other types of streaming
    mediasessions, such as RTSP based media server device control. Ratherthan severely
    restricting the device control framework to aparticular set of devices, such as
    IP telephony gateways andtelephony network access servers, this Internet draft
    presentsrequirements that are broad enough to satisfy the needs of anydevice that
    is expected to provide telephony and relatedservices on the Internet.</p>"
