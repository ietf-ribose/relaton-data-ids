abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the usage of the IP Flow Information \n
    \   Export (IPFIX) protocol for the case of exporting and processing \n    per-packet
    information by means of IPFIX.  \n    The main idea is to export two types of
    records per flow: one \n    type that consists of the usual flow information plus
    a unique \n    flow identifier; and a second type of record that consists of \n
    \   the actual per-packet information plus a flow identifier that \n    refers
    to the flow the specific packet belongs to -- that means \n    the flow identifier
    is used to associate the packet data to its \n    corresponding flow.\n\t </p>\n
