abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Original uses of an underscore character as a domain node name\n
    \  prefix, which creates a space for constrained interpretation of\n   resource
    records, were specified without the benefit of an IANA\n   registry.  This produced
    an entirely uncoordinated set of name-\n   creation activities, all drawing from
    the same namespace.  A registry\n   now has been defined.  However the existing
    specifications that use\n   underscore naming need to be modified, to be in line
    with the new\n   registry.  This document specifies those changes.  The changes\n
    \  preserve existing software and operational practice, while adapting\n   the
    specifications for those practices to the newer underscore\n   registry model.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
