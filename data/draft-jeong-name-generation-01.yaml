abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism of generating a unique DNS name
    automatically. This mechanism is useful when a node wants to configure a unique
    domain name in its network interface automatically in the environment where there
    is no dedicated DNS name server, such as the unmanaged home-network and ad-hoc
    network.</p>"
