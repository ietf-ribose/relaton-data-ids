abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and
    used by\n   Internet application protocols is the transmission of clear-text\n
    \  passwords over a channel protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS).\n   There
    are some significant security concerns with that mechanism,\n   which could be
    addressed by the use of a challenge response\n   authentication mechanism protected
    by TLS.  Unfortunately, the HTTP\n   Digest challenge response mechanism presently
    on the standards track\n   failed widespread deployment, and have had success
    only in limited\n   use.\n\n   This specification describes a family of HTTP authentication\n
    \  mechanisms called the Salted Challenge Response Authentication\n   Mechanism
    (SCRAM), which addresses the security concerns and meets\n   the deployability
    requirements.  When used in combination with TLS or\n   an equivalent security
    layer, a mechanism from this family could\n   improve the status-quo for application
    protocol authentication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
