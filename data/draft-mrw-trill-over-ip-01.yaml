abstract:
- content: "<p>The Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol is
    implemented by devices called Routing Bridges (RBridges). TRILL supports both
    point-to-point and multi-access links and is designed so that a variety of link
    protocols can be used between RBridge ports. This document standardizes methods
    for encapsulating TRILL in UDP/IP(v4 or v6) to provide a unified TRILL campus.</p>"
