abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In mobile networks, the Mobile Router (MR) is an operational
    main \n   entity. With multiple MRs, mobile networks can provide the stability
    \n   of service. And, there already exist various multi-homing scenarios. \n   However,
    because of mobility and MR-HA relations, there are several \n   security problems
    in multi-homed mobile networks. In this draft, we \n   identify threats to multi-homed
    mobile networks. And we will \n   illustrate several scenarios of Denial-of-Service
    (DoS) attacks, \n   Redirection attacks, and Replay attacks.    \n\t </p>\n      "
