abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For more than 30 years, a large number of implementations of
    the TCP/\n   IP protocol suite have been subject to a variety of attacks, with\n
    \  effects ranging from Denial of Service (DoS) or data injection, to\n   information
    leakage that could be exploited for pervasive monitoring.\n   The root of these
    issues has been, in many cases, the poor selection\n   of transient identifiers
    in such protocols, usually as a result of an\n   insufficient or misleading specifications.
    \ This document formally\n   updates RFC3552, such that RFCs are required to perform
    a security\n   and privacy analysis of the transient numeric identifiers they\n
    \  specify.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
