abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SPF is a popular tool for managing email blocking issues.  It
    has\n   also helped reduce backscatter related with Non-Delivery\n   Notifications
    as was intended.  A practically unused feature is the\n   SPF macro capability
    that SPFbis still in part retains.  This feature\n   greatly diminishes SPF's
    utility and actually threatens email\n   interchange, especially when used in
    conjunction with secondary\n   policy layers when also ignored by major providers.
    \ The macro\n   mechanism is also unable to cope with internationalization, and
    is\n   found in virtually none of the published resource records.  It is\n   counter
    productive to retain the largely unused and often unsupported\n   macro feature,
    despite efforts expended to develop the macro\n   language.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
