abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a new diagnostic tool called Extended
    Ping\n   (eping).  Network operators execute eping to determine whether a\n   remote
    interface is active.  In this respect, eping is similar to\n   ping.  Eping differs
    from ping in that it does not require network\n   reachability between itself
    and remote interface whose status is\n   being queried.\n\n   Eping relies on
    two new ICMP messages, called Extended Echo and\n   Extended Echo Reply.  Both
    ICMP messages are defined herein.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
