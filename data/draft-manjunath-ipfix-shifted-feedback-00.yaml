abstract:
- content: "<p>The [RFC2581] provides a mechanism to indicate the congestion information
    of the network to the source. In this draft, time shifting of the signal before
    usage is suggested. The time shifting operation effectively counters the impact
    of the self similarity of the traffic that originates in a DiffServe network model
    as a result of the aggregation.</p>"
