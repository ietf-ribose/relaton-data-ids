abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the basic requirements for food for
    folks\n   that attend IETF meetings require special diets, as well as those\n
    \  that prefer to eat healthy.  While, the variety of special diets is\n   quite
    broad, the most general categories are described.  There can be\n   controversy
    as to what constitutes healthy eating, but there are some\n   common, generally
    available foods that comprise the basis for healthy\n   eating and special diets.
    \ This document provides some\n   recommendations to meeting planners, as well
    as participants, in\n   handling these requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
