abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports and discusses issues on IPv6 only networks and
    IPv4/IPv6 transition technologies through our experiences on the 2nd experiment
    on the WIDE camp. The second experiment was held from March 4th to March 8th,
    2012. We tried to live in commercial IPv6 networks with four kinds of IPv4/IPv6
    transition technologies, DNS64/ NAT64, 4RD, 464XLAT and SA46T. In this -01.txt
    aims to report results of the 2nd experiment and to share issues / problems on
    the IPv4 / IPv6 transition that we met.</p>"
