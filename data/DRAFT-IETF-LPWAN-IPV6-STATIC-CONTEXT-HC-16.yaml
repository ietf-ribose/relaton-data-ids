abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the Static Context Header Compression
    (SCHC)\n   framework, which provides both header compression and fragmentation\n
    \  functionalities.  SCHC has been tailored for Low Power Wide Area\n   Networks
    (LPWAN).\n\n   SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored in
    both\n   the LPWAN devices and the network side.  This document defines a\n   header
    compression mechanism and its application to compress IPv6/UDP\n   headers.\n\n
    \  This document also specifies a fragmentation and reassembly mechanism\n   that
    is used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over the LPWAN\n   technologies.  Fragmentation
    is needed for IPv6 datagrams that, after\n   SCHC compression or when such compression
    was not possible, still\n   exceed the layer two maximum payload size.\n\n   The
    SCHC header compression and fragmentation mechanisms are\n   independent of the
    specific LPWAN technology over which they are\n   used.  Note that this document
    defines generic functionalities and\n   advisedly offers flexibility with regard
    to parameter settings and\n   mechanism choices.  Such settings and choices are
    expected to be made\n   in other technology-specific documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
