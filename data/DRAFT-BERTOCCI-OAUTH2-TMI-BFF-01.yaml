abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how a JavaScript frontend can delegate
    access\n   token acquisition to a backend component.  In so doing, the frontend\n
    \  can access resource servers directly without taking on the burden of\n   communicating
    with the authorization server, persisting tokens, and\n   performing complex operations
    within the user agent that would\n   require configuration, error management and
    reliance on authorization\n   server capabilities (such as refresh token rotation)
    that aren't\n   widely available today.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
