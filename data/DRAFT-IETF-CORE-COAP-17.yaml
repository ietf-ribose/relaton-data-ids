abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized
    web\n   transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained\n   (e.g.,
    low-power, lossy) networks.  The nodes often have 8-bit\n   microcontrollers with
    small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained\n   networks such as 6LoWPAN often
    have high packet error rates and a\n   typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s.  The
    protocol is designed for\n   machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart
    energy and\n   building automation.\n\n   CoAP provides a request/response interaction
    model between\n   application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services
    and\n   resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and\n   Internet
    media types.  CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP\n   for integration
    with the Web while meeting specialized requirements\n   such as multicast support,
    very low overhead and simplicity for\n   constrained environments.\n\n\t </p>\n
