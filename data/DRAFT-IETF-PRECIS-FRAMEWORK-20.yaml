abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Application protocols using Unicode characters in protocol
    strings\n   need to properly handle such strings in order to enforce\n   internationalization
    rules for strings placed in various protocol\n   slots (such as addresses and
    identifiers) and to perform valid\n   comparison operations (e.g., for purposes
    of authentication or\n   authorization).  This document defines a framework enabling\n
    \  application protocols to perform the preparation, enforcement, and\n   comparison
    of internationalized strings (\"PRECIS\") in a way that\n   depends on the properties
    of Unicode characters and thus is agile\n   with respect to versions of Unicode.
    \ As a result, this framework\n   provides a more sustainable approach to the
    handling of\n   internationalized strings than the previous framework, known as\n
    \  Stringprep (RFC 3454).  This document obsoletes RFC 3454.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
