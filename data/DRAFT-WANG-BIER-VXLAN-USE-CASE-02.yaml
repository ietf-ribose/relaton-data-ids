abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that\n
    \  provides optimal multicast forwarding through a \"BIER domain\" without\n   requiring
    intermediate routers to maintain any multicast related per-\n   flow state.  BIER
    also does not require any explicit tree-building\n   protocol for its operation.
    \ A multicast data packet enters a BIER\n   domain at a \"Bit-Forwarding Ingress
    Router\" (BFIR), and leaves the\n   BIER domain at one or more \"Bit-Forwarding
    Egress Routers\" (BFERs).\n   The BFIR router adds a BIER header to the packet.
    \ The BIER header\n   contains a bit-string in which each bit represents exactly
    one BFER\n   to forward the packet to.  The set of BFERs to which the multicast\n
    \  packet needs to be forwarded is expressed by setting the bits that\n   correspond
    to those routers in the BIER header.\n\n   This document tries to describe the
    drawbacks of how BUM services are\n   deployed in current data centers, and proposes
    how to take full\n   advantage of BIER to implement BUM services in data centers.\n\n\t
