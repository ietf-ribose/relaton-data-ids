abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many IETF protocols may use of cryptographic algorithms to
    provide\n   confidentiality, integrity, or non-repudiation.  Communicating peers\n
    \  must support the same cryptographic algorithm or algorithms for these\n   mechanisms
    to work properly.  This memo provides guidelines for\n   ensuring that such a
    protocol has the ability to migrate from one\n   algorithm to another over time.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
