abstract:
- content: "<p>The document describes a packet-marking variation of the IOAM DEX option,
    referred to as PBT-M (i.e., Postcard-Based Telemetry by Marking). Similar to IOAM
    DEX, PBT-M does not carry the telemetry data in user packets but send the telemetry
    data through a dedicated packet. Unlike IOAM DEX, PBT-M does not require an extra
    instruction header. However, PBT-M raises some unique issues that need to be considered.
    This document formally describes the high level scheme and cover the common requirements
    and issues when applying PBT-M in different networks. PBT-M is complementary to
    the other on-path telemetry schemes such as IOAM trace and E2E options.</p>"
