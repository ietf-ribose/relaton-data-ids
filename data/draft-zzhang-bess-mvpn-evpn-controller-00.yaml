abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies optional procedures for BGP-MVPN and EVPN BUM
    signaling with controllers. When P2MP tunnels used for BGP-MVPN and EVPN BUM are
    to be signaled from controllers, the controllers can learn tunnel information
    (identifier, root, leaf) by participating BGP-MVPN and EVPN BUM signaling, instead
    of relying on ingress PEs to collect the information and then pass to the controllers.
    Additionally, Inclusive/Selective PMSI Auto Discovery Routes can be originated
    from controllers based on central provisioning, instead of from PEs based on local
    provisioning.</p>"
