abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes a new AppMetaData subTLV carried by\n
    \  Tunnel Encap[RFC9012] Path Attribute for egress router to\n   advertise the
    running status and environment of the directly\n   attached 5G Edge Computing
    servers. The AppMetaData can be\n   used by the ingress routers in the 5G Local
    Data Network to\n   make intelligent path selection for flows from UEs. The goal\n
    \  is to improve latency and performance for 5G Edge Computing\n   services.\n\n
    \  The extension enables a feature, called soft anchoring, which\n   makes one
    Edge Computing Server at one specific location to be\n   more preferred than others
    for the same application to receive\n   packets from a specific source (UE).\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
