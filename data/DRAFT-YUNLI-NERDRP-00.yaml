abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To reliably hand over data packets to the destination in Delay
    \n\n Tolerant Networks (DTNs), many dissemination-based routing protocols \n\n
    are proposed. Dissemination-based routing protocols assure nodes \n\n including
    intermediate nodes and destinations have more chances to \n\n receive packets,
    which will increase the probability that the packets \n\n can be correctly received
    by the destination. However, the existing \n\n error recovery mechanisms in network
    layer use the simple CRC to \n\n check the data packets independently, and discard
    the error packets \n\n even if one correct packet can be obtained from more than
    one partly \n\n error packets. This document describes Dissemination-based Routing
    \n\n Protocol with Network-layer Error Control (NER-DRP). NER-DRP divides \n\n
    a data packet into RS blocks and inserts redundancy to each block. So \n\n the
    intermediate nodes and destinations can recover a correct data \n\n packet from
    multiple partially error copies of the same packet.\n\t </p>\n      "
