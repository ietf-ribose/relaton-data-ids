abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is designed for
    resource-\n   constrained nodes and networks such as sensor nodes in a low-power\n
    \  lossy network (LLN).  Yet to implement this Internet protocol on\n   Class
    1 devices (as per RFC 7228, ~ 10 KiB of RAM and ~ 100 KiB of\n   ROM) also lightweight
    implementation techniques are necessary.  This\n   document provides lessons learned
    from implementing CoAP for tiny,\n   battery-operated networked embedded systems.
    \ In particular, it\n   provides guidance on correct implementation of the CoAP
    specification\n   RFC 7252, memory optimizations, and customized protocol parameters.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
