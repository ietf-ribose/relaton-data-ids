abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need for common definitions of terminology in the work to
    be done around IP mobility. This memo defines terms for mobility related terminology.
    It is intended as a living document for use by the Seamoby working group, and
    especially for use in Seamoby drafts and in WG discussions. Other working groups
    dealing with mobility may also take advantage of this terminology</p>"
