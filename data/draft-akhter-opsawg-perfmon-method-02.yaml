abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need to be able to quantify and report the performance of
    network applications and the network service in handling user data. This performance
    data provides information essential in validating service level agreements, fault
    isolation as well as early warnings of network greater problems. This document
    describes a generic methodology for calculating metrics related to network based
    applications. In addition, to the performance metrics, several additional information
    elements are included to help provide greater context to the reports. The measurements
    use audio/video applications as base examples but are not restricted to these
    class of applications.</p>"
