abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a Vehicular Neighbor Discovery (VND)
    as an\n   extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IP-based vehicular\n   networks.
    \ An optimized Address Registration and a multihop Duplicate\n   Address Detection
    (DAD) mechanism are performed for having operation\n   efficiency and also saving
    both wireless bandwidth and vehicle\n   energy.  In addition, three new ND options
    for prefix discovery,\n   service discovery, and mobility information report are
    defined to\n   announce the network prefixes and services inside a vehicle (i.e.,
    a\n   vehicle's internal network).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
