abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The first step in the Transaction SIGnature (TSIG) (RFC 2845)
    process\n   is the generation of a shared secret to be used between a DNS server\n
    \  and a host. The second step consists of modifying the DNS\n   configuration
    so that the DNS server will know what key to use with\n   which host, because
    this shared secret is only valid between a pair\n   of hosts. This document, CGA-TSIG,
    proposes a possible way to\n   eliminate the human intervention needed for the
    generation and\n   exchange of keys between a DNS server and a host when SEcure
    Neighbor\n   Discovery (SEND) (RFC 3971) is used. CGA-TSIG will facilitate the\n
    \  authentication process of a host with a DNS server and will reduce\n   the
    time needed to accomplish DNS Updates. It will also provide a\n   means for securing
    the authentication process between resolvers and\n   clients. CGA-TSIG will be
    added, as an extension, to TSIG in order to\n   provide data integrity and proof
    of IP address ownership. The current\n   signature generation and verification
    process used in TSIG will be\n   substituted with the use of the same parameters
    as are used in\n   generating a secure address in IPv6 networks, i.e., Cryptographically\n
    \  Generated Addresses (CGA) (RFC 3972).\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
