abstract:
- content: "<p>In a large switched topology with either many routers or routers that
    transmit a high rate of multicast advertisements per router, as suggested to support
    mobile nodes, the cost of distributing the many resulting multicast messages to
    certain classes of devices might be prohibitive. This is the case of a device
    that runs on batteries, or a device that is reachable over a wireless interface.
    For this device, it can be beneficial to filter a certain amount of multicast
    messages such as the Router Advertisement while preserving the functionality expected
    in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol.</p>"
