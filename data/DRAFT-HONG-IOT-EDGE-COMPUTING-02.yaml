abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes new challenges such as strict latency,\n
    \  constrained network bandwidth and devices, intermittent connectivity,\n   privacy
    and security, for IoT services originated from the IoT\n   environmental changes.
    \ In order to address those new challenges, the\n   integration of Edge computing
    and IoT has been emerged as a promising\n   solution.  This document discribes
    the concept of IoT integrated with\n   Edge computing as well as its use cases.
    \ It also discusses benefits\n   and challenges of Edge computing.  The direction
    of Edge computing\n   for IoT should be discussed in the IETF/IRTF.\n\n\t </p>\n
