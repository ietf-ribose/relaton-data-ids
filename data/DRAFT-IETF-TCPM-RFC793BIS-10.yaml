abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Internet's Transmission Control
    Protocol\n   (TCP).  TCP is an important transport layer protocol in the Internet\n
    \  stack, and has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of\n   the
    Internet.  Over this time, a number of changes have been made to\n   TCP as it
    was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been\n   documented in a piecemeal
    fashion.  This document collects and brings\n   those changes together with the
    protocol specification from RFC 793.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well
    as 879, 2873, 6093, 6429,\n   6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793.  It
    updates RFC 1122,\n   and should be considered as a replacement for the portions
    of that\n   document dealing with TCP requirements.  It updates RFC 5961 due to
    a\n   small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED\n   state.\n\n
    \  RFC EDITOR NOTE: If approved for publication as an RFC, this should\n   be
    marked additionally as \"STD: 7\" and replace RFC 793 in that role.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
