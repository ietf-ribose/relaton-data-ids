abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Spam, defined as sending unsolicited messages to someone in bulk,
    is\nlikely to become a problem on SIP open-wide deployed networks.  A\nnumber
    of solutions have been proposed for dealing with Spam for\nInternet Telephony
    (SPIT) and unwanted communication, such as content\nfiltering, black lists, white
    lists, consent-based communication,\nreputation systems, address obfuscation,
    limited use addresses,\nturing tests, computational puzzles, payments at risk,
    circles of\ntrust, and many others.\n\nThis document describes the big picture
    that illustrates how the\ndifferent building blocks fit together and can be deployed\nincrementally.\n\t
