abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft describes a profile for compressing RTP/IP using theRobust
    Header Compression Formal Notation.The RObust Header Compression [1] scheme is
    designed to compresspacket headers over error prone channels. It is built around
    anextensible core framework that can be tailored to compress newprotocol stacks
    by adding additional ROHC profiles.This draft describes a modification of previously
    published RTPprofiles for ROHC to conform to ROHC-FN [2] and Prolog.</p>"
