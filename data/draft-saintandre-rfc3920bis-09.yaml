abstract:
  content: <p>This document defines the core features of the Extensible Messagingand
    Presence Protocol (XMPP), a technology for streaming ExtensibleMarkup Language
    (XML) elements for the purpose of exchangingstructured information in close to
    real time between any two or morenetwork-aware entities. XMPP provides a generalized,
    extensibleframework for incrementally exchanging XML data, upon which a varietyof
    applications can be built. The framework includes methods forstream setup and
    teardown, channel encryption, authentication of aclient to a server and of one
    server to another server, andprimitives for push-style messages, publication of
    networkavailability information ("presence"), and request-responseinteractions.
    This document also specifies the format for XMPPaddresses, which are fully internationalizable.This
    document obsoletes RFC 3920.</p>
