abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses policy concepts for management of Quality
    of \n   Services (QoS) of applications in heterogeneous Internet environment.
    \n   A framework is given for definitions of policies for configuration \n   and
    automated adaptation of network resources, application \n   transport parameters
    and QoS measurement scenarios dependent on the\n   capabilities of heterogeneous
    access networks.\n   Currently, the IETF QoS policy work is aimed at \"specifying\n
    \  and representing policies that administer, manage and control access to \n
    \  network QoS resources\" based on DiffServ and  IntServ technologies \n   [5].\n
    \  To enhance this model, policies for management of QoS of \n   heterogeneous
    network infrastructures are proposed in this document.\n   Based on the capabilities
    of heterogeneous access networks, \n   the QoS policies for heterogeneous environment
    allow dynamic \n   configuration and adaptation of network resource reservations,
    \n   application transport parameters and QoS measurement scenarios. \n   The
    policies are defined for different actors, such as users, \n   application service
    providers and network operators. \n   The hierarchical policy management is based
    on rules specifying \n   adaptation of parameters of policies of actors with hierarchical
    \n   relationships. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
