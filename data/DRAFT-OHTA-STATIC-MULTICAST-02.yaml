abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The current IP Multicast model appears to achieve a level of\nsimplicity
    by extending the IP unicast addressing model (historically\nthe classful A,B,
    and C net numbers) from the mask and longest match\nschemes of CIDR, with a new
    classful address space, class D. The\nrouting systems have been also built in
    a deceptively simple way in\none of three manners - either broadcast and prune
    (DVMRP, Dense Mode\nPIM), destination list  based tree computation (MOSPF) or
    single\ncentered trees (current sparse mode PIM and CBT). The multicast\nservice
    creates the illusion of a spectrum that one can 'tune in to',\nas an application
    writer. Due to this view, many have seen the\nmulticast pilot service, the Mbone,
    as a worldwide Ethernet, where\nsimple distributed algorithms can be used to allocate
    'wavelengths'\nand advertise them through 'broadcast' on a channel (the session\ndirectory),
    associated with a spectrum.\n\t </p>\n      "
