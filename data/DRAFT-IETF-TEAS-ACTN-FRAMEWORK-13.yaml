abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traffic Engineered networks have a variety of mechanisms to\n
    \  facilitate the separation of the data plane and control plane. They\n   also
    have a range of management and provisioning protocols to\n   configure and activate
    network resources. These mechanisms represent\n   key technologies for enabling
    flexible and dynamic networking. The\n   term \"Traffic Engineered network\" refers
    to a network that uses any\n   connection-oriented technology under the control
    of a distributed or\n   centralized control plane to support dynamic provisioning
    of end-to-\n   end connectivity.\n\n   Abstraction of network resources is a technique
    that can be applied\n   to a single network domain or across multiple domains
    to create a\n   single virtualized network that is under the control of a network\n
    \  operator or the customer of the operator that actually owns\n   the network
    resources.\n\n   This document provides a framework for Abstraction and Control
    of\n   Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) to support virtual network\n   services
    and connectivity services.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
