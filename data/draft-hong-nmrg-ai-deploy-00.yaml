abstract:
- content: "<p>As the development of AI technology matured and AI technology began
    to be applied in various fields, AI technology is changed from running only on
    very high-performance servers with small hardware, including microcontrollers,
    low-performance CPUs and AI chipsets. In this document, we consider how to configure
    the system in terms of AI inference service to provide AI service in a distributed
    approach. Also, we describe the points to be considered in the environment where
    a client connects to a cloud server and an edge device and requests an AI service.</p>"
