abstract:
- content: "<p>There are use cases, specifically in Internet of Things (IoT) and constrained
    environments that do not require confidentiality, though message integrity for
    all communications and at least server, if not mutual authentication during tunnel
    establishment, are both still mandated. This document gives examples of such use
    cases, although a threat model is necessary to determine whether or not a given
    situation falls into this category of use cases. In order to serve these use cases,
    this document defines the use of HMAC-only cipher suites for TLS 1.3, which provides
    server and optionally mutual authentication and data authenticity, but not data
    confidentiality. The approach described in this document is not endorsed by the
    IETF and does not have IETF consensus, but is presented here to enable interoperable
    implementation of a reduced security mechanism that provides authentication and
    message integrity without supporting confidentiality.</p>"
