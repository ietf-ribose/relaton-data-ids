abstract:
- content: "<p>Group communication for CoAP can be secured using Group Object Security
    for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE). A Group Manager is responsible
    to handle the joining of new group members, as well as to manage and distribute
    the group keying material. This document defines a RESTful admin interface at
    the Group Manager, that allows an Administrator entity to create and delete OSCORE
    groups, as well as to retrieve and update their configuration. The ACE framework
    for Authentication and Authorization is used to enforce authentication and authorization
    of the Administrator at the Group Manager. Protocol-specific transport profiles
    of ACE are used to achieve communication security, proof-of- possession and server
    authentication.</p>"
