abstract:
  content: <p>National Bibliography Numbers, NBNs, are widely used by the nationallibraries
    and other organizations in order to identify variousresources such as monographs
    pre-dating the emergence of the ISBNsystem or still images. As a rule, NBNs are
    applied to all kinds ofresources that do not have an established identifier system
    of theirown.Since 2001, there has been a URN (Uniform Resource Names) namespacefor
    NBNs, and during 2001-2009 millions of URN-based unique andpersistent NBNs have
    been assigned. The namespace registration wasperformed in RFC 3188 and applied
    to the NBNs known at that point.No URN:NBN resolution services existed at the
    time when the RFC waswritten. Since then several countries have started using
    URN:NBNs toidentify electronic resources and to provide persistent links tothem.
    To this end, many countries have established URN:NBNresolution services that supply
    URN - URL linking.This document replaces RFC 3188 and defines how NBNs can be
    supportedwithin the URN framework. An updated namespace registration (version4)
    is included.DiscussionThis document is an outcome of work performed in 2009-2010
    as a partof the project PersID (http://www.persid.org) revising the basic URNRFCs,
    in order to bring them in alignment with the current URIStandard (STD 63, RFC
    3986), ABNF, and IANA guidelines, and toestablish a modern URN resolution system
    for bibliographicidentifiers. This work is being brought to the IETF, and the
    intentis to establish a "URNbis" (or similar) working group in theApplications
    Area as soon as possible, which will then target thisand related work.Comments
    are welcome on the urn@ietf.org or the urn-nid@ietf.orgmailing list (or sent to
    the authors). Interested parties are alsoinvited to contribute to the WG formation
    process being discussed onthe former list.Status of This MemoThis Internet-Draft
