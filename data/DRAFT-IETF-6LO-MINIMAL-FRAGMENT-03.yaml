abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a simple method to forwarding 6LoWPAN\n
    \  fragments.  When employing adaptation layer fragmentation in 6LoWPAN,\n   it
    may be beneficial for a forwarder not to have to reassemble each\n   packet in
    its entirety before forwarding it.  This has always been\n   possible with the
    original fragmentation design of RFC4944.  This\n   method reduces the latency
    and increases end-to-end reliability in\n   route-over forwarding.  It is the
    companion to the virtual Reassembly\n   Buffer which is a pure implementation
    technique.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
