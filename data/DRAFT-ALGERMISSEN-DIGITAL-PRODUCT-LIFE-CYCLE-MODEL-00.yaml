abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines an abstract model for Digital Products
    and\n   their relationships with each other in order to establish a basic\n   abstraction
    on which the lifecycle of Digital Products and\n   collaborations around them
    can be expressed.  In addition, this\n   specification defines a number of message
    formats and hypermedia\n   controls, to enable the creation of tools and application
    in the\n   space of Digital Product Life Cycle Management.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
