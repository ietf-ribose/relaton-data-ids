abstract:
- content: "<p>There are several scenarios involving multi-hop heterogeneous wireless
    networks requiring reliable and available features combined with multi-access
    edge computing, such as Industry 4.0. This document discusses mechanisms to allow
    a terminal influencing the selection of a MEC host for instantiation of the terminal-targeted
    MEC applications and functions, and (re)configuring the RAW network lying in between
    the terminal and the selected MEC host. This document assumes IETF RAW and ETSI
    MEC integration, fostering discussion about extensions at both IETF and ETSI MEC
    to better support these scenarios.</p>"
