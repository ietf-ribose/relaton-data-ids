abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Discussion of the problem of multicast transition has brought
    out a\n   number of scenarios that are the most likely to be encountered in\n
    \  practice.  In some of these scenarios the IP version supported by the\n   multicast
    receiver differs from that supported by the provider\n   network to which it is
    attached.  In such cases an adaptation\n   function is required between the receiver
    and the network, to mediate\n   the signalling and data flows between them.  This
    memo uses the term\n   \"Type 1 Adaptation Function\" (AF1) for such a function.
    \ It is\n   written for the purpose of specifying the functions performed by an\n
    \  AF1.\n\n   The scope of this memo is limited to the case where flows are\n
    \  unidirectional, from a designated set of sources to a designated (and\n   normally
    much more numerous) set of receivers.  The IP television\n   (IPTV) case falls
    within this scope.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
