abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Authenticated denial of existence allows a resolver to validate
    that\n   a certain domain name does not exist.  It is also used to signal that\n
    \  a domain name exists, but does not have the specific RR type you were\n   asking
    for.  When returning a negative DNSSEC response, a name server\n   usually includes
    up to two NSEC records.  With NSEC3 this amount is\n   three.  This document provides
    additional background commentary and\n   some context for the NSEC and NSEC3 mechanisms
    used by DNSSEC to\n   provide authenticated denial of existence responses\n\t
    </p>\n      "
