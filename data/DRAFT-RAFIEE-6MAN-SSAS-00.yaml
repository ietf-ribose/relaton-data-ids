abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The default method for IPv6 address generation uses two unique\n
    \  manufacturer IDs that are assigned by the IEEE Standards Association\n   [1]
    (section 2.5.1 RFC-4291) [RFC4291]. This means that a node will\n   always have
    the same Interface ID (IID) whenever it connects to a new\n   network. Because
    the node's IP address does not change, the node is\n   vulnerable to privacy related
    attacks. To address this issue, there\n   are currently two mechanisms in use
    to randomize the IID,\n   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972]
    and Privacy\n   Extension [RFC4941]. The problem with the former approach is the\n
    \  computational cost involved for the IID generation. The problem with\n   the
    latter approach is that it lacks security. This document offers a\n   new algorithm
    for use in the generation of the IID while, at the same\n   time, securing the
    node against some types of attack, such as IP\n   spoofing. These attacks are
    prevented with the addition of a\n   signature to the Neighbor Discovery messages
    (NDP).\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
