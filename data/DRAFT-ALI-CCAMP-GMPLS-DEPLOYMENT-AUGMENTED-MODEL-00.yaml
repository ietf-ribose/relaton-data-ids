abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the biggest challenges faced by GMPLS technology is
    “how it \n   can be deployed” in a manner least impacting to existing IP/ MPLS
    \n   networks. GMPLS architecture document lists [RFC3945] three different \n
    \  scenarios in which GMPLS technology can be deployed: overlay, \n   augmented
    and integrated. Reference [GMPLS-mig] addresses the problem \n   of migration
    from MPLS to GMPLS networks using the integrated model. \n   This draft addresses
    the same problem space for augmented model and \n   illustrates the applicability
    of augmented model in deploying GMPLS \n   technology in existing IP/ MPLS networks.
