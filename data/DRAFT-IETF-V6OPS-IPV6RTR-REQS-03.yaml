abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet is not one network, but rather a collection of
    networks.\n   The interconnected nature of these networks, and the nature of the\n
    \  interconnected systems that make up these networks, is often more\n   fragile
    than it appears.  Perhaps \"robust but fragile\" is an\n   overstatement, but
    the actions of each vendor, implementor, and\n   operator in such an interconnected
    environment can have a major\n   impact on the stability of the overall Internet
    (as a system).  The\n   widespread adoption of IPv6 could, particularly, disrupt
    network\n   operations, in a way that impacts the entire system.\n\n   This time
    of transition is an opportune time to take stock of lessons\n   learned through
    the operation of large scale networks on IPv4, and\n   consider how to apply these
    lessons to IPv6.  This document provides\n   an overview of the design and architectural
    decisions that attend\n   IPv6 deployment, and a set of IPv6 requirements for
    routers,\n   switches, and middleboxes deployed in IPv6 networks.  The hope of
    the\n   editors and contributors is to provide the necessary background to\n   guide
    equipment manufacturers, protocol implementors, and network\n   operators in effective
    IPv6 deployment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
