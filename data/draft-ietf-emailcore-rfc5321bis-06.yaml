abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a specification of the basic protocol for Internet
    electronic mail transport. It consolidates, updates, and clarifies several previous
    documents, making all or parts of most of them obsolete. It covers the SMTP extension
    mechanisms and best practices for the contemporary Internet, but does not provide
    details about particular extensions. The document also provides information about
    use of SMTP for other than strict mail transport and delivery. This document replaces
    RFC 5321, the earlier version with the same title. // JcK 20211029 Note in Draft:
    Adjusted in version -06. Decided the // details belong in either the Introduction
    or the A/S, not the // Abstract. And it makes the Abstract a tad shorter, which
    is good.</p>"
