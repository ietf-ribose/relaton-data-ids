abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This presents security-related requirements for the I2RS protocol\n
    \  which provides a new interface to the routing system described in the\n   I2RS
    architecture document (RFC7921).  The I2RS protocol is a re-use\n   protocol implemented
    by re-using portions of existing IETF protocols\n   and adding new features to
    these protocols.  The I2RS protocol re-\n   uses security features of a secure
    transport (E.g.  TLS, SSH, DTLS)\n   such as encryption, message integrity, mutual
    peer authentication,\n   and replay protection.  The new security features I2RS
    adds are: a\n   priority mechanism to handle multi-headed write transactions,
    an\n   opaque secondary identifier which identifies an application using the\n
    \  I2RS client, and an extremely constrained read-only non-secure\n   transport.
    \ This document provides the detailed requirements for\n   these security features.\n\n\t
