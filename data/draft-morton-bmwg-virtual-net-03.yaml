abstract:
- content: "<p>Benchmarking Methodology Working Group has traditionally conducted
    laboratory characterization of dedicated physical implementations of internetworking
    functions. This memo investigates additional considerations when network functions
    are virtualized and performed in commodity off-the-shelf hardware. NOTES: 3.4
    Added inter-actions/dependencies within resource domains 4.3 Added new metrics
    for characterization: PDV, reordering, mean delay, etc. 4.4 Resolved the question
    of capacity and the 3x3 Matrix</p>"
