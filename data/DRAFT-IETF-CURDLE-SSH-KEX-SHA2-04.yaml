abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document adds recommendations for adoption of ssh-curves
    from\n   the [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-curves], adds some new Modular Exponential\n
    \  (MODP) Groups, and deprecates some previously specified Key Exchange\n   Method
    algorithm names for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.  It also\n   updates [RFC4253],
    [RFC4419], [RFC4462], and [RFC5656] by specifying\n   the set key exchange algorithms
    that currently exist and which ones\n   MUST, SHOULD, MAY, and SHOULD NOT be implemented.
    \ New key exchange\n   methods use the SHA-2 family of hashes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
