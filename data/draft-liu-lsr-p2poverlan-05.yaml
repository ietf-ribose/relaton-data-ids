abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC5309] defines the P2P circuit type is one of the mainly used circuit
    types in the link state routing protocol, and highlights it is important to identify
    the correct circuit type when forming adjacencies, flooding link state database
    packets, and monitoring the link state. The P2P interface over LAN ifType value
    is assigned by IANA experts review. This document provides advice to the ifStack
    for the P2P interface over LAN ifType to facilitate operational control, maintenance
    and statistics.</p>"
