abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism that enables unlinkable session
    resumption for TLS 1.3 without server-side state. In contrast to existing ticket-based
    resumption in TLS 1.3, wherein servers construct and issue tickets to clients,
    this document specifies a mechanism by which clients request "anonymous tickets"
    from servers. When a session is resumed using an anonymous ticket, a server only
    learns that it previously engaged in a session with some client, rather than linking
    it to a specific client. Anonymous tickets are only useful for clients with idempotent
    early data to send.</p>
