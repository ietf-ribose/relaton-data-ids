abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Service Function Chain (SFC) goes through a list of ordered
    service\n   functions.  One assumption of this document is that legacy service\n
    \  function can participate in the service function chain, but they are\n   not
    aware of the SFC header, nor interpret it.  This document\n   provides a mechanism
    between an SFC proxy and an SFC-unaware Service\n   Function (i.e.  legacy SF),
    to identify the SFC header associated\n   with a packet that is returned from
    a legacy SF, without SFC header\n   being explicitly carried in the wired protocol
    between SFC Proxy and\n   legacy SF.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
