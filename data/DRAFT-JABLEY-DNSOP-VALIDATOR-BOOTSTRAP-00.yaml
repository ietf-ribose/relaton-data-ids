abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) allow cryptographic\nsignatures
    to be used to validate responses received from the Domain\nName System (DNS).
    \ A DNS client which validates such signatures is\nknown as a validator.\n\nThe
    choice of appropriate root zone trust anchor for a validator is\nexpected to vary
    over time as the corresponding cryptographic keys\nused in DNSSEC are changed.\n\nThis
    document provides guidance on how validators might determine an\nappropriate trust
    anchor for the root zone to use at start-up, or\nwhen other mechanisms intended
    to allow key rollover to be tolerated\ngracefully are not available.\n\t </p>\n
