abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of this memo is to create a new IANA registry (called the
    MPLS First Nibble registry) for the first nibble (4-bit field) immediately following
    an MPLS label stack. The memo offers a rationale for such a registry, describes
    how the registry should be managed, and provides some initial entries. Furthermore,
    this memo sets out some documentation requirements for registering new values.
    Finally, it provides some recommendations that makes processing MPLS packets easier
    and more robust. There is an important caveat on the use of this registry versus
    the IP version number registry. This memo, if published, would update [RFC4928]
    and [RFC8469].</p>"
