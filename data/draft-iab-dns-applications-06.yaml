abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of Internet applications rely on the Domain Name System (DNS)
    to support their operations. Many applications use the DNS to locate services
    for a domain. For example, some applications transform identifiers other than
    domain names into formats that the DNS can process and then fetch application
    data or service location data from the DNS. Proposals to incorporate more sophisticated
    application behavior into the DNS, however, have raised questions about the applicability
    and extensibility of the DNS. This document explores the architectural consequences
    of using the DNS for storing and retrieving certain application features, and
    provides guidance to future application designers as to the sorts of ways that
    applications can make use of the DNS.</p>"
