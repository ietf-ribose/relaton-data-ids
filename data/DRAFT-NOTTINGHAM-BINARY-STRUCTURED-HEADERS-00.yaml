abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a binary serialisation of Structured\n
    \  Headers for HTTP, along with a negotiation mechanism for its use in\n   HTTP/2.
    \ It also defines how to use Structured Headers for many\n   existing headers
    - thereby \"backporting\" them - when supported by two\n   peers.\n\n\t </p>\n
