abstract:
- content: <p>The Multicast Ping Protocol specified in this document allows for checking
    whether an endpoint can receive multicast -- both Source-Specific Multicast (SSM)
    and Any-Source Multicast (ASM). It can also be used to obtain additional multicast-related
    information, such as multicast tree setup time. This protocol is based on an implementation
    of tools called "ssmping" and "asmping". [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
