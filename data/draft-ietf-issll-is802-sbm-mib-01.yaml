abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo includes a list of manageable parameters for RSVP/SBM
    serverimplementations. These are in addition to those already described in RFC2206
    and RFC 2213. Specifically, it describes parameters for control ofthe base signaling
    protocols themselves, as well as some of theadmission control decisions. These
    definitions are not intended to beexhaustive but they have been identified as
    useful for practicalimplementations.</p>"
