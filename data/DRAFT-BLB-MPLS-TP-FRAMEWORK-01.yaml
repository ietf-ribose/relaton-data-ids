abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an archiectectural framework for the\napplication
    of MPLS in transport networks.  It describes a profile of\nMPLS that enables operational
    models typical in transport networks\nnetworks, while providing additional OAM,
    survivability and other\nmaintenance functions not currently supported by MPLS.\n\t
