abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IETF has been developing IPv6 based standards for Low-power
    and Lossy\n   Networks (LLNs) to meet requirements of constrained applications,\n
    \  such as field monitoring, inventory control and so on. IPv6 Routing\n   Protocol
    for LLNs (RPL) has been published in [RFC6550]. Based on\n   routing metrics and
    constraints [RFC6551], RPL builds Directed\n   Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to
    establish bidirectional routes for\n   LLNs for traffic types of multipoint-to-point,
    point-to-multipoint,\n   and point-to-point. RPL routes are optimized for traffic
    to or from\n   one or more roots that act as sinks. As a result, a DAG is\n   partitioned
    into one or more Destination Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), one\n   DODAG per sink. RPL
    is widely considered as a feasible routing\n   protocol for LLNs. However, DODAG
    loops caused by local DODAG repair\n   mechanism is an issues to be addressed.
    This draft introduces a loop\n   free local DODAG repair mechanism. This draft
    also introduces a\n   piggybacked data option for transferring delay sensitive
    data during\n   route repair process. The piggybacked data can be included in
    DODAG\n   Repair Request (DRQ) message or DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS)\n
    \  message.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
