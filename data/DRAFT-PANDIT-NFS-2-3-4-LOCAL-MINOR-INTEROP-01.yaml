abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>NFS (Network File System) version 4 is a major rewrite of NFS.
    NFS\n    version 4 has lot of new features added into the protocol and the \n
    \   behavior is changed a lot from the predecessors.\n\n    This Draft considers
    the interoperability problems of all versions \n    of NFS and local filesystem.
    Yet, access to any one file system \n    through the NFS v2 or NFS v3 or NFS v4
    protocol requires that a \n    single server be accessed.  \n\n    This draft
    tries to suggest the behavior that could be expected \n    when NFS version 4
    is used in multi-protocol environment with NFS \n    version 2 and version 3.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
