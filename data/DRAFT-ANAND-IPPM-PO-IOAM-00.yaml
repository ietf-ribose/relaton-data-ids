abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a way to extend in-situ OAM techniques
    to\n   include operational data from multiple network layers with a view to\n
    \  create an integrated record of OAM information as the data flows\n   between
    two network entities. An instance of this technique that is\n   elaborated here
    focuses on packet-optical networks that are\n   traditionally transport centric.
    The mechanisms described are general\n   enough to allow future extensibility
    of in-situ OAM techniques into\n   other non-packet domains.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
