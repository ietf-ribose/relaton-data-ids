abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This proposal extends the PIM-DM [1] protocol specification by
    intro-\nducing the PIM State-Refresh control message.\nWhen an (S,G) entry is
    created in a router for a directly connected\nsource, if the interface directly
    connected to the source is the\nincoming interface for the entry, a new timer
    is started: the State-\nRefresh-Timer [SRT(S,G)]. The State-Refresh-Timer controls
    periodic\ntransmission of the PIM State-Refresh message, which is propagated\nhop-by-hop
    down the (S,G) RPF tree. When received by a router on the\nRPF interface, the
    State-Refresh message causes existing prune state\nto be refreshed.\nAddition
    of this heartbeat message solves many of the current prob-\nlems with PIM-DM.
    It prevents the periodic timeout of prune state in\nrouters, greatly reducing
    the re-flooding of multicast traffic down\nthe pruned branches that expire periodically.
    It also causes topology\nchanges to be realised quicker than the traditional 3
    minute timeout.\n\t </p>\n      "
