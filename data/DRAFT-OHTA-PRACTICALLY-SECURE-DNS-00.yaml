abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Plain DNS without PKI is secure, if a chain of query/response\n
    \  communications between a client and an authoritative server relayed\n   by
    zero or more intermediate resolvers and the authoritative server\n   and all the
    resolvers are secure.\n\n   However, because of short (16bit) message ID, the
    communications\n   composing the chain are not very secure without, or even with
    (port\n   exhaustion attack is possible), source port randomization.\n\n   Still,
    plain DNS can be made practically secure, if the client makes\n   two queries
    with independent message IDs to an address of a server (a\n   resolver or a name
    server) and confirm that two replies are\n   identical.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
