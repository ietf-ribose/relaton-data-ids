abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Both Nagle mode and delayed ACKs attempt to conserve network and
    host\nmachine resources by delaying transmissions in the expectation that\nthe
    current material can be piggybacked onto a future transmission.\nUnfortunately
    when both mechanisms are active at the same time on\neither end of a connection
    a deadlock can exist, which is broken by\narrival of new data for transmission
    or firing of the delayed ACK\ntimer. This produces classical timer based ACKing,
    which for the\ncommon 200ms ACK delay yields five exchanges per second.\n\t </p>\n
