abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an algorithm for the detection and quantification
    of packet reordering for TCP. In the absence of explicit congestion notification
    from the network, TCP uses only packet loss as an indication of congestion. One
    of the signals TCP uses to determine loss is the arrival of three duplicate acknowledgments.
    However, this heuristic is not always correct, notably in the case when paths
    reorder packets. This results in degraded performance. The algorithm for the detection
    and quantification of reordering in this document uses information gathered from
    the TCP Timestamps Option, the TCP SACK Option and its DSACK extension. When a
    reordering event is detected, the algorithm calculates a reordering extent by
    determining the number of segments the reordered segment was late with respect
    to its position in the sequence number space. Additionally, the algorithm computes
    a second reordering extent that is relative to the amount of outstanding data
    and thus provides a better estimation of the reordering delay when other sender
    state changes.</p>"
