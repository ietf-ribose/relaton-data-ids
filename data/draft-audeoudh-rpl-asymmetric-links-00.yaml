abstract:
- content: "<p>This document summarizes our observations of the behavior of RPL on
    a testbed composed of tens of IEEE 802.15.4 nodes. Our first observation is that
    the continuous task of estimating the link metric to all candidate neighbors causes
    a significant background load. This traffic is persistent, even in a stable network
    where DIO transmissions are eventually widely spaced. Next, this document focuses
    on the case of the presence of an asymmetric link, due to either a muted or a
    deaf node. In these circumstances, the standard RPL mechanisms may well generate
    hundreds of routing messages per node and per hour.</p>"
