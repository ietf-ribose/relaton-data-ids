abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes mechanisms to optimize the Address Resolution
    Protocol (ARP) and Neighbor Discovery (ND) traffic in a Transparent Interconnection
    of Lots of Links (TRILL) campus. TRILL switches maintain a cache of IP / Media
    Access Control (MAC) address / Data Label bindings that are learned from ARP/ND
    requests and responses that pass through them. In many cases, this cache allows
    an edge Routing Bridge (RBridge) to avoid flooding an ARP/ND request by either
    responding to it directly or encapsulating it and unicasting it. Such optimization
    reduces packet flooding over a TRILL campus.</p>"
