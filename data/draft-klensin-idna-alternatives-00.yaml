abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Internet protocol for internationalized domain names (IDNs)
    isdocumented in RFC 3490 and associated documents and commonly known asIDNA. While
    that protocol was being developed (and more recently),there were a number of alternate
    proposals and suggestions fordifferent ways to do IDNs. IDNA was favored over
    those alternatives,but variations on them seem to keep reappearing with the suggestionthat
    they are novel ideas. This memo describes some of thosesuggested alternatives
    and summarizes the reasons why they were notfavored over IDNA.</p>"
