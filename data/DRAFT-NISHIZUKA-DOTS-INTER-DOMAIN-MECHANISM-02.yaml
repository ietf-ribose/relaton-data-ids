abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As DDoS attacks evolve rapidly in the aspect of volume and\n
    \  sophistication, cooperation among operators has become very necessary\n   because
    it gives us quicker and more sophisticated protection to cope\n   with the varius
    DDoS attacks.  This document describes possible\n   mechanisms which implement
    the cooperative inter-organization DDoS\n   protection by DOTS protocol.  The
    described data models are intended\n   to cover intra-organization and inter-organization
    solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
