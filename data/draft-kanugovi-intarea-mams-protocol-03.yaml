abstract:
- content: "<p>A communication network includes an access network segment that delivers
    data to/from the users and an associated core network segment providing connectivity
    with the application servers. Multiconnectivity scenarios are common where an
    end-user device can simultaneously connect to multiple communication networks
    based on different technology implementations and network architectures like WiFi,
    LTE, DSL. A smart selection and combination of access and core network paths that
    can dynamically adapt to changing network conditions can improve quality of experience
    for a user in such a Multiconnectivity scenario and improve overall network utilization
    and efficiency. This document presents the problem statement and proposes solution
    principles. It specifies the requirements and reference architecture for a multi-access
    management services framework that can be used to flexibly select the best combination
    of access and core network paths for uplink and downlink, as well as the flexible
    usage of uplink and downlink, ensuring better network efficiency and enhanced
    application performance.</p>"
