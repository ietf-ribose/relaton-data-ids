abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       This document defines a hybrid naming scheme for unifying
    all kinds\n       of information. As many proposals of novel network architectures\n
    \      emerge, such as DONA, ICN, NDN, the location-based routing starts to\n
    \      transfer to the content-based ones. Currently, it is incompatible\n       that
    many different information naming schemes are adopted in\n       different network
    proposals, respectively, i.e. flat names in DONA,\n       hierarchical names in
    NDN. The naming format defined is to identify\n       different routing information
    uniformly. The format adopts a hybrid\n       structure including hierarchical
    component, flat component and\n       attribute component, providing great compatibility
    and advantages.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
