abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo documents a GRE fragmentation strategy upon which
    many\n   vendors have converged.  Specifically, it defines procedures to be\n
    \  executed by GRE ingress routers.  It is published so that those\n   building
    new implementations will be aware of best common practice.\n   It is also published
    so that those building applications over GRE\n   will understand how GRE works.\n\n\n\t
