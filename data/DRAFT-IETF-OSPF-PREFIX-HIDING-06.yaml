abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A transit-only network is defined as a network connecting routers\n
    \  only.  In OSPF, transit-only networks are usually configured with\n   routable
    IP addresses, which are advertised in Link State\n   Advertisements (LSAs) but
    not needed for data traffic.  In addition,\n   remote attacks can be launched
    against routers by sending packets to\n   these transit-only networks.  This document
    presents a mechanism to\n   hide transit-only networks to speed up network convergence
    and reduce\n   remote attack vulnerability.\n\n   In the context of this document,
    'hiding' implies that the prefixes\n   are not installed in the routing tables
    on OSPF routers. In some\n   cases, IP addresses may still be visible when using
    OSPFv2.\n\n   This document updates RFC 2328 and RFC 5340.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
