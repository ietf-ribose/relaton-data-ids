abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is an authentication\n
    \  framework which supports multiple authentication methods.  This\n   document
    defines an authentication method for EAP called EAP-IBAKE,\n   which is based
    on the Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange\n   (IBAKE) protocol.  The IBAKE
    method provides mutual authentication\n   through the use of identity-based encryption.
    \ In addition to mutual\n   authentication this method also provides perfect forward
    and\n   backwards secrecy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
