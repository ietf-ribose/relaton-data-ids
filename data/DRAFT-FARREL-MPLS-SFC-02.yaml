abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service Function Chaining (SFC) is the process of directing
    packets\n   through a network so that they can be acted on by an ordered set of\n
    \  abstract service functions before being delivered to the intended\n   destination.
    \ An architecture for SFC is defined in RFC7665.\n\n   The Network Service Header
    (NSH) can be inserted into packets to\n   steer them along a specific path to
    realize a Service Function Chain.\n\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is
    a widely deployed forwarding\n   technology that uses labels to identify the forwarding
    actions to be\n   taken at each hop through a network.  Segment Routing is a mechanism\n
    \  that provides a source routing paradigm for steering packets in an\n   MPLS
    network.\n\n   This document describes how Service Function Chaining can be achieved\n
    \  in an MPLS network by means of a logical representation of the NSH in\n   an
    MPLS label stack.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
