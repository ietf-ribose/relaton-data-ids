abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an ALTO protocol extension for overlay\n
    \  routing.  It considers three different methods to route traffic from\n   a
    data source to a data receiver, which are direct Internet routing,\n   VPN tunnel,
    and overlay routing via intermediate/relay node(s),\n   analyze their use cases
    in real world and then proposes an extension\n   to ALTO protocol so as to support
    a ALTO client to get cost value\n   between hosts via these different routing
    methods.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
