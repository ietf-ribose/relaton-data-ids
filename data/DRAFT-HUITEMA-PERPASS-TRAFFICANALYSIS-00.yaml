abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traffic analysis is used by various entities to derive \"meta
    data\"\n   about Internet communications, such as who communicates with whom or\n
    \  what, and when.  We analyze how meta-data can be extracted by\n   monitoring
    IP headers, DNS traffic, and clear-text headers of\n   commonly used protocols.
    \ We then propose a series of actions that\n   would make traffic analysis more
    difficult.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
