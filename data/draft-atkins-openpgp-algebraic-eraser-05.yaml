abstract:
- content: "<p>The Algebraic Eraser(TM) is an encryption engine that supports, among
    other configurations, a Diffie-Hellman-like key agreement protocol. This draft
    specifies how to encode, store, share, and use Algebraic Eraser Key Agreement
    Protocol (AEKAP, also called AEDH) keys in OpenPGP.</p>"
