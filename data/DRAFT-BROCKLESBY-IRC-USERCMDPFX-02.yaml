abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo presents a method for a client to prefix commands sent
    to\nan IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server with a label, in order to match\nserver
    replies against commands previously sent, without having to\nkeep excessive state
    on the server connection.  It is a primary\ngoal to implement this in a way which
    is completely backwards-\ncompatible with existing IRC servers.\nThis documents
    describes an extention to the Internet Relay Chat\nprotocol as described in RFC
    1459 [1].\n\t </p>\n      "
