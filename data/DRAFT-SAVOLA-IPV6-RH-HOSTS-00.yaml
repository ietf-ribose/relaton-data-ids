abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>[IPV6] specifies routing header processing for nodes.  The text
    is\nsufficiently ambiguous where the behaviour of hosts is concerned.\nThis draft
    clarifies the issue by referring to IPv4 Host Requirements\ndocument and requiring
    hosts must not, by default, forward routing\nheaders outside of the node.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
