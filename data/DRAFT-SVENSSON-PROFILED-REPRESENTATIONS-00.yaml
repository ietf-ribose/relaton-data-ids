abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document details approaches for enriching HTTP interactions
    with\n   information pertaining to the profiles to which resource\n   representations
    conform.  It surveys approaches that were recently\n   introduced to indicate
    the profile of a resource representation, and\n   to make representations that
    conform to a profile discoverable.  It\n   introduces a generally applicable approach
    to negotiate for a\n   resource representation that conforms to a profile preferred
    by a\n   user agent.  That approach leverages the existing content negotiation\n
    \  mechanism but applies it to the profile dimension to which it was\n   previously
    not applied.  The document also shows how a server can\n   convey which profiled
    representations it is able to accept from a\n   user agent.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
