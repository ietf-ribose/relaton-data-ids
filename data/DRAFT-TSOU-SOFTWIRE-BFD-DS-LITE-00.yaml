abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In DS-Lite, there is no state information of the tunnel, which
    make\n   it difficult to mange and diagnose.  BFD can be used in this case to\n
    \  detect the state of the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel by creating BFD session\n   between
    CPE and AFTR.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
