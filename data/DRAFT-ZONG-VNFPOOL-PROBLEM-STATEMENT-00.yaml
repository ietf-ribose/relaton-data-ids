abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Function Virtualization (NFV), conceptualized by the
    European\n   Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) NFV Industry\n   Specification
    Group (ISG) , is gaining significant momentum within\n   the the telecoms industry.
    \ A key area currently being discussed\n   within the ETSI NFV ISG is the reliability
    and availability of the\n   network service implemented by a set of Virtualized
    Network Functions\n   (VNFs) building on top of the virtualization infrastructure.\n\n
    \  This document mainly focus on problem statement and gap analysis.  It\n   provides
    an overview of the problem space related to NFV reliability,\n   it then briefly
    reviews an applicable architecture to scope potential\n   solution space.  Finally
    it identifies the gaps of several existing\n   approaches to NFV reliability for
    potential reuse and extension.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
