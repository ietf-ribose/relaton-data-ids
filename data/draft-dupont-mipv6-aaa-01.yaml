abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IPv6 mobility [5] has many security requirements which can beroughly
    divided into security of signaling with commoncorrespondent nodes [6] and security
    between the mobile node andits home agent. If IPsec [1] is not so usable in the
    first caseit remains the solution of choice in the second. UnfortunatelyIPsec
    does not allow reasonable performance in some commonsituations. One of the main
    problems is the lack of integrationwith a modern network access service security
    like the one providedby AAA [7].</p>"
