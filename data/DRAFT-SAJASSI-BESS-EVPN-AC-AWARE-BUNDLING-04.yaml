abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EVPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution\n
    \  over an MPLS/IP network for intra-subnet connectivity among Tenant\n   Systems
    and End Devices that can be physical or virtual.\n\n   EVPN multihoming with IRB
    is one of the common deployment scenarios.\n   There are deployments which requires
    capability to have multiple\n   subnets designated with multiple VLAN IDs in single
    Broadcast Domain.\n\n   EVPN technology defines three different types of service
    interface\n   which serve different requirements but none of them address the\n
    \  requirement of supporting multiple subnets within single Broadcast\n   Domain.
    \ In this draft we define new service interface type to\n   support multiple subnets
    in single Broadcast Domain.  Service\n   interface proposed in this draft will
    be applicable to multihoming\n   case only.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
