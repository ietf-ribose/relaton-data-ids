abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an architecture for the source address\nvalidation
    with help of Host Identity Protocol (HIP), SAVAH.  The\narchitecture utilizes
    the properties of cryptographically strong\nprotocol to authenticate an originator
    of a network communication.\nIn addition this architecture offers network access
    control, data\nprotection, host mobilty and multihoming features and is suitable
    for\nthe wireless networks.  The proposed, architecture is the first-hop\nrouter
    solution, meaning that it should be deployed on the router\nplaced on the edge
    of a local network topology.\n\t </p>\n      "
