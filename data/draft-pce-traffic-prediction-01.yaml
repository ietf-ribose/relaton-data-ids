abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. It is helpful for PCEs to
    calculate more reasonable path if PCCs can provide information of traffic prediction.
    This memo specifies extensions to PCEP that allow PCE to request prediction-related
    information.</p>"
