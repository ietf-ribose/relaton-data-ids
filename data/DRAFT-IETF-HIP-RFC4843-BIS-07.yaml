abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an updated Overlay Routable Cryptographic\n
    \  Hash Identifiers format that obsoletes RFC4843.  These identifiers\n   are
    intended to be used as endpoint identifiers at applications and\n   Application
    Programming Interfaces (API) and not as identifiers for\n   network location at
    the IP layer, i.e., locators.  They are designed\n   to appear as application
    layer entities and at the existing IPv6\n   APIs, but they should not appear in
    actual IPv6 headers.  To make\n   them more like regular IPv6 addresses, they
    are expected to be\n   routable at an overlay level.  Consequently, while they
    are\n   considered non-routable addresses from the IPv6 layer point-of-view,\n
    \  all existing IPv6 applications are expected to be able to use them in\n   a
    manner compatible with current IPv6 addresses.\n\n   The Overlay Routable Cryptographic
    Hash Identifiers originally\n   defined in RFC4843 lacked a mechanism for cryptographic
    algorithm\n   agility.  The updated ORCHID format specified in this document\n
    \  removes this limitation by encoding in the identifier itself an index\n   to
    the suite of cryptographic algorithms in use.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
