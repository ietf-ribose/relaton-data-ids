abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This document specifies version 4+ of the Internet Protocol\n
    \   (IPv4+). IPv4 is very successful,simple and elegant.\n    continuation and
    expansion of the IPv4 is necessary. Existing\n    systems, devices only need to
    upgrade the software to support\n    IPv4+, without the need to update new hardwares,saving\n
    \   investment costs. Ipv4+ is also an interstellar Protocol,\n    so the Internet
    will evolve into a star Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
