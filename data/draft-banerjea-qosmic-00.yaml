abstract:
  content: "<p>We present, QoSMIC, a multicast protocol for the Internet thatsupports
    QoS-sensitive routing, and minimizes the importance of a prioriconfiguration decisions
    (such as core selection). The protocol isresource-efficient, robust, flexible,
    and scalable. In addition, ourprotocol is provably loop-free. Our protocol starts
    with a resources-saving tree (Shared Tree) andindividual receivers switch to a
    QoS-competitive tree (Source-BasedTree) when necessary. In both trees, the new
    destination is able tochoose the most promising among several paths. An innovation
    is that weuse dynamic routing information without relying on a link state exchangeprotocol
    to provide it. Our protocol limits the effect of pre-configuration decisions drastically,
    by separating the management fromthe data transfer functions; administrative routers
    are not necessarilypart of the tree. This separation increases the robustness,
    andflexibility of the protocol. Furthermore, QoSMIC is able to adaptdynamically
    to the conditions of the network. The QoSMIC protocol introduces several new ideas
    that make it moreflexible than other protocols proposed to date. In fact, many
    of theother protocols, (such as YAM, PIM-SM, BGMP, CBT) can be seen as specialcases
    of QoSMIC. The goal of this document is to present the motivationbehind, and the
    design of QoSMIC, and to provide both analytical andexperimental results to support
    our claims. NOTE: The text version of the draft is missing several figures, thatfacilitate
    the understanding of the work. For this, the authors suggestthe postscript version.</p>"
