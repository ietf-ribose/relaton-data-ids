abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes issues associated with providing multi-\n
    \  tenancy in large data center networks that require an overlay-based\n   network
    virtualization approach to addressing them.  A key multi-\n   tenancy requirement
    is traffic isolation, so that a tenant's traffic\n   is not visible to any other
    tenant.  This isolation can be achieved\n   by assigning one or more virtual networks
    to each tenant such that\n   traffic within a virtual network is isolated from
    traffic in other\n   virtual networks.  The primary functionality required is
    provisioning\n   virtual networks, associating a virtual machine's virtual network\n
    \  interface(s) with the appropriate virtual network, and maintaining\n   that
    association as the virtual machine is activated, migrated and/or\n   deactivated.
    \ Use of an overlay-based approach enables scalable\n   deployment on large network
    infrastructures.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
