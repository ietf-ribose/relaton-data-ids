abstract:
- content: "<p>This document emphasizes the convergence of thinking regarding Internet
    naming in the industry and the technical community. There is strong consensus
    for establishing a layer above the current DNS to address some of its current
    limitations. At the same time, the community stresses the necessity for the new
    layer to go beyond the sole needs of the domain name system to realize an architecture
    capable of accommodating diverse services, with separate ownerships, different
    scopes and distinct operating models. In that context, interoperability is critical.</p>"
