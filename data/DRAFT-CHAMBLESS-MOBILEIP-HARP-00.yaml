abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents a protocol called the Home Agent Redundancy\n
    \  Protocol or HARP.  HARP is an optional extension to Mobile-IP [RFC-\n   2002].
    \ Mobile-IP includes the notion of a Home Agent which is\n   a host located on
    the home IP subnet for Mobile Nodes.  Home Agents\n   forward packets to Mobile
    Nodes that are away from home.  Since Mobile\n   Nodes are dependent on the Home
    Agent for connectivity when away from\n   home, the Home Agent represents a possible
    single source of failure for\n   the Mobile IP system.\n \n   HARP is a protocol
    which allows a pair (or set) of Home Agents\n   to cooperate and share Mobile-IP
    Mobile Node registration\n   information.  If one of the HARP peers should fail,
    the Mobile-IP\n   system will not necessarily fail, hence HARP introduces Home\n
    \  Agent redundancy into the Mobile-IP system.  Mobile Nodes are\n   not aware
    that HARP exists, so HARP requires no changes to\n   Mobile-IP as a protocol.
    \ In this document, we present the HARP\n   architecture and protocol.\n\t </p>\n
