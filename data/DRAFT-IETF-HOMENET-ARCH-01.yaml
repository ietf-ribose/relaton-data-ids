abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This text describes evolving networking technology within small\n
    \  \"residential home\" networks.  The goal of this memo is to define the\n   architecture
    for IPv6-based home networking and the associated\n   principles, considerations
    and requirements.  The text highlights the\n   impact of IPv6 on home networking,
    illustrates topology scenarios,\n   and shows how standard IPv6 mechanisms and
    addressing can be employed\n   in home networking.  The architecture describes
    the need for specific\n   protocol extensions for certain additional functionality.
    \ It is\n   assumed that the IPv6 home network is not actively managed, and runs\n
    \  as an IPv6-only or dual-stack network.  There are no recommendations\n   in
    this text for the IPv4 part of the network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
