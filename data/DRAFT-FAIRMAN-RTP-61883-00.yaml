abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a payload format for transporting IEC
    61883-1[2]\n(CIP) compliant IEEE1394 isochronous transport data using RTP. A 1394[3]\nCIP
    isochronous transport may carry a stream format, such as DV[4],\nAM824[5] or MPEG[6],
    that has been packetized for isochronous transport\nby the source. The format
    is opaque to the transport mechanism. The\nisochronous transport clock is derived
    from the 1394 cycle timer clock.\nThis protocol may be used to transport 1394
    61883 streams between 1394\nbuses by IP, specifically Ethernet/IP.\n\n\t </p>\n
