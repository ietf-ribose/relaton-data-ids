abstract:
  content: <p>This document defines an Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) service
    extension called "CLIENTID" which provides a method for clients to indicate an
    identity to the server. This identity is an additional token that may be used
    for security and/or informational purposes, and with it a server may optionally
    apply heuristics using this token.</p>
