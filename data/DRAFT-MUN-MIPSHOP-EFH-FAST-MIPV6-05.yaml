abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In MIPv6 [1], whenever a mobile node changes its attached point,\n
    \  handover process should be followed to inform its home agent and\n   correspondent
    of a MN's current location. The handover process is\n   decomposed into layer
    2 and layer 3 handovers again, and these two\n   handovers are accomplished sequentially,
    which causes long latency\n   problem. This problem is a critical issue in MIPv6.
    To make up for\n   this, we propose an enhanced Fast Handover scheme to reduce
    the\n   overall latency on handover, revising the Fast Handover [2].\n   Especially,
    several messages in layer 3 are sent in one frame during\n   layer 2 handover.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
