abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) as [RFC5213].PMIPv6
    enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roamacross gateways without
    changing the IP address. PMIPv6 alsoprovides limited multi-homing support to multi-mode
    mobile devices.Proxy mobility is based on the assumption that changes in host
    IPstacks are undesirable. Link layer implementations can hide theactually used
    physical interfaces from the IP stack. Thesetechniques can be used to achieve
    inter-access technology handoversor flow mobility, i.e., the movement of selected
    flows from oneaccess technology to another. It is assumed that an IP layerinterface
    can simultaneously and/or sequentially attach to multipleMAGs (possibly over multiple
    media). This document provides aninformational applicability statement that analyzes
    the issuesinvolved with this approach (i.e. hiding access technology changesfrom
    host IP layer) and characterizes the contexts in which such useis or is not appropriate
    to achieve inter-access handovers or flowmobility.</p>"
