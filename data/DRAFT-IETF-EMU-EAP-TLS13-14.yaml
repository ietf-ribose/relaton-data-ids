abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC
    3748,\n   provides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication\n
    \  methods.  This document specifies the use of EAP-Transport Layer\n   Security
    (EAP-TLS) with TLS 1.3 while remaining backwards compatible\n   with existing
    implementations of EAP-TLS.  TLS 1.3 provides\n   significantly improved security,
    privacy, and reduced latency when\n   compared to earlier versions of TLS.  EAP-TLS
    with TLS 1.3 further\n   improves security and privacy by always providing forward
    secrecy,\n   never disclosing the peer identity, and by mandating use of\n   revocation
    checking.  This document also provides guidance on\n   authorization and resumption
    for EAP-TLS in general (regardless of\n   the underlying TLS version used).  This
    document updates RFC 5216.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
