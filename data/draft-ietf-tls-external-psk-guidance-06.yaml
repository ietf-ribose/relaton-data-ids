abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides usage guidance for external Pre-Shared Keys
    (PSKs) in Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 as defined in RFC 8446. It lists
    TLS security properties provided by PSKs under certain assumptions, and then demonstrates
    how violations of these assumptions lead to attacks. Advice for applications to
    help meet these assumptions is provided. This document also discusses PSK use
    cases and provisioning processes. Finally, it lists the privacy and security properties
    that are not provided by TLS 1.3 when external PSKs are used.</p>"
