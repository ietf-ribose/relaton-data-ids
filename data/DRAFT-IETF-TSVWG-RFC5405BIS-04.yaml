abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing\n
    \  transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms.  This\n   document
    provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of\n   applications, tunnels
    and other protocols that use UDP.  Congestion\n   control guidelines are a primary
    focus, but the document also\n   provides guidance on other topics, including
    message sizes,\n   reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of ECN,
    DSCPs,\n   and ports.\n\n   Because congestion control is critical to the stable
    operation of the\n   Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to
    use UDP as\n   an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion\n
    \  collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent\n   traffic.
    \ They may also need to implement additional mechanisms,\n   depending on how
    they use UDP.\n\n   Some guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols\n
    \  (e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels),\n   especially
    when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion\n   control.\n\n   If
    published as an RFC, this document will obsolete RFC5405.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
