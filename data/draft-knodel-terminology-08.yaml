abstract:
- content: "<p>This document argues for more inclusive language conventions sometimes
    used by RFC authors and the RFC Production Centre in Internet-Drafts that are
    work in progress, and in new RFCs that may be published in any of the RFC series,
    in order to foster greater knowledge transfer and improve diversity of participation
    in the IETF. This document represents the opinion of the authors and does not
    have IETF consensus.</p>"
