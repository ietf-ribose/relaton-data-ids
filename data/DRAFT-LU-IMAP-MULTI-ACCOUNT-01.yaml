abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Simultaneous authentication of multiple mail accounts belonging
    to a\n   single user is an attractive feature but is not supported in the\n   current
    Internet Message Access Protocol [RFC3501]. This document\n   introduces an extension
    of the Internet Message Access Protocol,\n   Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1). With this
    extension, when a client is\n   authenticated with one of its user identifiers,
    all the other\n   associated user identifiers (if present) are also regarded as\n
    \  authenticated ones. Furthermore, this document specifies the syntax\n   of
    LISTA and SELECTA commands for the IMAP4rev1 protocol. With LISTA\n   command,
    a client can obtain a list of all the identifiers\n   authenticated for the user.
    With SELECTA command, a client can select\n   one of the user's authenticated
    identifiers and then gain access to\n   all the mailboxes belonging to that identifier,
    without having to log\n   out and re-log in with that identifier.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n
