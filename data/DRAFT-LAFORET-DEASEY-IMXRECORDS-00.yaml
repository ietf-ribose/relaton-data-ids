abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Unwanted Email ('SPAM') is a constantly growing scourge of the
    \nInternet.  SPAM takes full advantage of the open system that was \ncreated in
    the spirit of cooperation that represents the original \nunderpinnings of the
    Internet.\n\nUnderstanding that making airtight mail systems without completely
    \ndestroying old software, the authors of this proposal considered the \ncontinued
    operation of these legacy systems while tightening up the \ncurrent standards.
    \ This new proposal calls for a new DNS resource \nrecord type and a new standard
    of operation for organization mail-\nexchangers.  Using this new resource record
    along with other standard \nDNS resources provides system operators to minimize
    exploitable inbound \nSPAM pathways into their systems.\n\t </p>\n      "
