abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The OAuth 2.1 authorization framework enables a third-party\n
    \  application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on\n   behalf
    of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction\n   between the resource
    owner and an authorization service, or by\n   allowing the third-party application
    to obtain access on its own\n   behalf.  This specification replaces and obsoletes
    the OAuth 2.0\n   Authorization Framework described in RFC 6749.\n\n\t </p>\n
