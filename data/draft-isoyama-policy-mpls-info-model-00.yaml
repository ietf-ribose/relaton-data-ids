abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an information model for representing QoS policies
    for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). The model is based on the Policy Framework
    QoS Information Model (QPIM) and the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM). These
    models are extended with new classes for controlling and managing the life-cycle
    of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and for mapping of traffic onto existing LSPs.
    The control and management of LSP life-cycles includes mainly the creation, update,
    and deletion of LSPs and the assignment of QoS properties to LSPs. Even if this
    document is primarily intended to cover the QoS related MPLS areas, it also covers
    traffic engineering related policies.</p>"
