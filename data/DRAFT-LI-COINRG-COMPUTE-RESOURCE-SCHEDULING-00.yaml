abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With massive data growing in the internet, how to effectively
    use the\n   compute resources has become a quite hot topic.  In order to cool\n
    \  down the pressure in today's large data centers, some compute\n   resources
    have been moved towards the edge, gradually forming a\n   distributed Compute
    Force Network.  Force is a physical cause which\n   can change the state of a
    motion or an object.  We refer the\n   definition from physics and extend its
    philosophy to network that in\n   future, the network can be a compute force which
    can facilitate the\n   integration of different kinds of compute resources, no
    matter\n   hardware or software, making the computation fast and effective.  In\n
    \  this draft, we present a compute resources oriented scheduling\n   mechanism
    based on dataplane programmability, which can effectively\n   schedule and manage
    compute resources in the network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
