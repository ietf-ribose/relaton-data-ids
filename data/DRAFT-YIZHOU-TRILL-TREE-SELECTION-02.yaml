abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL uses the distribution trees to deliver multi-destination
    frames.\n   Multiple trees can be used by an ingress RBridge for different flow\n
    \  based on VLAN and/or multicast group. Different ingress RBridges may\n   choose
    different distribution trees for the same VLAN and/or\n   multicast group traffic.
    Distribution trees are normally pruned based\n   on VLAN.\n\n   For any RBridge
    RBn, if RBn has downstream receivers of VLAN x in a\n   distribution tree t, there
    will be an entry of (t, x, port list) in\n   the multicast forwarding table on
    RBn. If there are n trees and m\n   VLANs, the multicast forwarding table size
    on RBn is typically n*m\n   entries. The value of m is up to 4096 and n is the
    total number of\n   distribution trees in the campus. If fine grained labeling
    is\n   implemented or finer granularity filtering such as VLAN plus L2/L3\n   multicast
    address is used for pruning, the multicast forwarding table\n   size further increases
    dramatically. TRILL multicast forwarding table\n   size is limited by hardware
    and L3 multicasting may share the same\n   table with it in hardware implementations.
    Therefore multicast table\n   entry is a precious resource. This document specifies
    a VLAN based\n   tree selection mechanism to reduce the TRILL multicast forwarding\n
    \  table size on RBridge.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
