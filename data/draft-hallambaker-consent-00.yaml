abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose a mechanism Proof of Consent that allows an email recipient
    to provide verifiable proof of ‘opt-in’ consent to receive email. Proof of Consent
    may be used to automatically whitelist email from mailing lists and email forwarded
    from another email server. Proof of Consent is designed to require minimal state
    maintenance by both the email sender and the recipient and to be deployable with
    minimal impact on existing email infrastructure.</p>"
