abstract:
- content: "<p>This document captures requirements for Client-Facing interface to
    the Security Controller as defined by [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-framework]. The interface
    is expressed using objects and constructs understood by Security Admin as opposed
    to vendor or device specific expressions associated with individual product and
    feature. This document identifies a broad set of requirements needed to express
    Security Policies based on User-constructs which are well understood by the User
    Community. This gives ability to decouple policy definition from policy enforcement
    on a specific security functional element, be it a physical or virtual.</p>"
