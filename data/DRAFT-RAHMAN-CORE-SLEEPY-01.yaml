abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained devices.\n
    \  These devices typically have some combination of limited battery\n   power,
    small memory footprint and low throughput links.  It is\n   expected that in CoAP
    networks there will be a certain portion of\n   devices that are \"sleepy\" and
    which may occasionally go into a sleep\n   mode (i.e. go into a low power state
    to conserve power) and\n   temporarily suspend CoAP protocol communication.  This
    document\n   proposes a minimal and efficient mechanism building on the Resource\n
    \  Directory concept to enhance sleepy node support in CoAP networks.\n\n\t </p>\n
