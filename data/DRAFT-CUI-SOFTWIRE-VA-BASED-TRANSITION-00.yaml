abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>With the increasing deployment of IPv6 networks, IPv6 transition
    has\nbecome one of the key problems in developing IPv6 networks.  Among\nvarious
    transition scenarios, one is common where connectivity\nbetween IPv4 networks
    is desired across IPv6-only backbone network.\nIn such case, ISP operating the
    IPv6 backbone will accommodate\nconnectivity and offer transit services for attached
    IPv4 networks.\nSoftwire WG defined softwire mesh mechanism for both of the IPv4-\nover-IPv6
    scenario and the opposite scenario of IPv6-over-IPv4.\nSoftwire mesh uses automatic
    softwire tunnels employing multi-\nprotocol BGP extensions for distributing IPv4
    routes, where BGP and\ntunnuls should be configured or setup as a full-mesh architecture.\nThis
    draft, however, proposed an aggregated, centralized mechanism\nsimilar to Virtual
    Aggregation (VA) mechanism, which can\nsignificantly shrink the forwarding information
    base (FIB) size of\nAddress Family Border Routers (AFBRs), reduce the total amount
    of\nrouting activity, and provide the IPv6 ISP with an easy way to\nmanage the
    transit service.\n\t </p>\n      "
