abstract:
- content: "<p>This document evaluates the performance of a header compression protocol
    for RTP, CRTP [RFC-2509], over links built on cellular radio access technology.
    The key characteristics affecting CRTP performance over such links are the high
    error rates and the relatively long roundtrip time over the link. Bandwidth is
    typically expensive in cellular radio access networks, saving a single octet per
    voice packet can be equivalent to saving many billion dollars in deployment since
    fewer base-stations are needed. This is beneficial for operators as well as end-users
    who can get cheaper wireless IP telephony service. CRTP performance is evaluated
    for two kinds of link layers operating over a realistic radio channel with high
    bit-error rates. Two main conclusions are drawn. The first is that CRTP does not
    perform well for this type of link. The second is that in high-error environments
    it is very beneficial to have a checksum covering the compressed header only,
    not the payload, so that the decompressor sees all non- damaged headers. When
    a strong checksum covers the entire link layer frame, header compression performs
    badly since too many headers are discarded due to damaged payloads.</p>"
