abstract:
  content: "<p>This document evaluates the performance of a header compressionprotocol
    for RTP, CRTP [RFC-2509], over links built on cellular radioaccess technology.
    The key characteristics affecting CRTP performanceover such links are the high
    error rates and the relatively longroundtrip time over the link.Bandwidth is typically
    expensive in cellular radio access networks,saving a single octet per voice packet
    can be equivalent to savingmany billion dollars in deployment since fewer base-stations
    areneeded. This is beneficial for operators as well as end-users who canget cheaper
    wireless IP telephony service.CRTP performance is evaluated for two kinds of link
    layers operatingover a realistic radio channel with high bit-error rates. Two
    mainconclusions are drawn. The first is that CRTP does not perform wellfor this
    type of link. The second is that in high-error environmentsit is very beneficial
    to have a checksum covering the compressedheader only, not the payload, so that
    the decompressor sees all non-damaged headers. When a strong checksum covers the
    entire link layerframe, header compression performs badly since too many headers
    arediscarded due to damaged payloads.</p>"
