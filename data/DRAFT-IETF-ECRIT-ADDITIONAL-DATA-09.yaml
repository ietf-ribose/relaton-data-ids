abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering
    Point\n   (PSAP), the device that sends it, as well as any application service\n
    \  provider in the path of the call, or access network provider through\n   which
    the call originated may have information about the call or the\n   caller which
    the PSAP may be able to use.  This document describes\n   data structures and
    a mechanism to convey such data to the PSAP.  The\n   mechanism uses a Uniform
    Resource Identifier (URI), which may point\n   to either an external resource
    or an object in the body of the SIP\n   message.  The mechanism thus allows the
    data to be passed by\n   reference (when the URI points to an external resource)
    or by value\n   (when it points into the body of the message).  This follows the\n
    \  tradition of prior emergency services standardization work where data\n   can
    be conveyed by value within the call signaling (i.e., in body of\n   the SIP message)
    and also by reference.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
