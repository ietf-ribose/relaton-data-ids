abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    After sun-setting of IPv4, many devices are connected to IPv6
    single\n   stack network. In this document we describe a workaround of IPv6\n
    \  enabled network configuration. At this moment, the condition of IPv6\n   adoption
    on the consumer devices such as PC, tablet, mobile terminal\n   and entertainment
    devices are various. For example, some devices are\n   fully support IPv6 client
    but some are not. It is very hard to\n   provide IPv6 network service with these
    various conditioned devices.\n   To solve this problem, we tried to verify some
    configurations to\n   connect these devices into IPv6 enabled consumer network
    for\n   termination of IPv4 network services.\n\t </p>\n      "
