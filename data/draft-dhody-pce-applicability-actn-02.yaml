abstract:
- content: "<p>Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) refers to the set of
    virtual network operations needed to orchestrate, control and manage large-scale
    multi-domain TE networks so as to facilitate network programmability, automation,
    efficient resource sharing, and end-to- end virtual service aware connectivity
    and network function virtualization services. The Path Computation Element Communication
    Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform
    path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. This
    document examines the applicability of PCE to the ACTN framework.</p>"
