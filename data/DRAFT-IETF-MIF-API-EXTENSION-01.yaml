abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an abstract API that provides the minimal\n
    \  functionality required for a program to communicate effectively with\n   peers
    and services on the network while running on a host that has\n   more than one
    active network interface.  This API is abstract: we\n   describe the functionality
    that must be provided, not the bindings\n   that should be used to provide that
    functionality.  The functionality\n   described here provides the building blocks
    from which higher-level\n   APIs might be built, and is not intended to be used
    directly by\n   typical applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
