abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   FSP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol that
    provides\n   mobility, multihoming and multipath support by introducing the\n
    \  concept of 'upper layer thread ID', which was firstly suggested in\n   [Gao2002].\n\n
    \  Authencity of an FSP packet is protected by some algorithm that\n   requires
    a shared key. The upper layer thread ID is assigned roughly\n   the same semantics
    as the Security Parameter Index (SPI) in MOBIKE\n   [RFC4555] to index the key.
    The key is either a weak one agreed by\n   the FSP participants, or cryptographically
    established and installed\n   by the upper layer application.\n\n   FSP facilitates
    such key installation by introducing the concept of\n   transmit transaction,
    which makes it flexible for the application\n   layer protocols to adopt new establishment
    algorithm.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
