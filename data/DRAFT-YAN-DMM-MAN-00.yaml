abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Based on IPv6, multiple mobility management protocols have
    been\n   developed and generally they can be classified into two types:\n   network-based
    and host-based.  Different protocols have different\n   functional requirements
    on the network element or the terminal and\n   then a scheme should be used in
    order to support the negotiation and\n   selection of adopted mobility management
    protocol when a terminal\n   accesses to a new network.  In this draft, this issue
    is considered\n   and analyzed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
