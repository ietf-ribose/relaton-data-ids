abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When a large number of clients register with a SIP registrar server\nat
    approximately the same time, the server may become overloaded.\nNear-simultaneous
    floods of SIP SUBSCRIBE and PUBLISH requests may\nhave similar effects.  Such
    request avalanches can occur, for\nexample, after a power failure and recovery
    in a metropolitan area.\nThis document describes how to avoid such overload situations.
    \ Under\nthis mechanism, a server estimates an avalanche restart backoff\ninterval
    during its normal operation and conveys this interval to its\nclients through
    a new Restart-Timer header in normal response\nmessages.  Once an avalanche restart
    actually occurs, the clients\nperform backoff based on the previously received
    Restart-Timer header\nvalue before sending out the first request attempt.  Thus,
    the\nmechanism spreads all the initial client requests and prevents them\nfrom
    overloading the server.\n\t </p>\n      "
