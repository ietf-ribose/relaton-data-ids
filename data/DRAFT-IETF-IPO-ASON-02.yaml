abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes the main architectural principles of the
    \nautomatic switched optical networks (ASON) work that has recently \nbeen approved
    by the ITU-T [2,3]. ASON architecture defines a set of \nreference points (interfaces)
    that allows ASON clients to request \nnetwork services across those reference
    points.\n\t </p>\n      "
