abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Several Link-type sub-TLVs have been defined for OSPF and ISIS
    in the\ncontext of MPLS Traffic Engineering in order to convery some link\ncharacteristics
    such as the available bandwidth, traffic enginering\nmetric, adminstrative group
    and so on.  There are various\ncircumstances where it would be useful to also
    know the number of\nunconstrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path(s) (TE
    LSP).\nThis document specifies a new Link-type Traffic Engineering sub-TLV\nused
    to advertise the number of unconstrained TE LSP(s) signalled\nacross a specific
    link.\n\t </p>\n      "
