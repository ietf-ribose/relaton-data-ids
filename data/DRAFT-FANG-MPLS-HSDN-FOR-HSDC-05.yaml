abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes Hierarchical SDN (HSDN), an architectural\n
    \  solution to scale the Data Center (DC) and Data Center Interconnect\n   (DCI)
    networks to support tens of millions of physical underlay\n   endpoints, while
    efficiently handling both Equal Cost Multi Path\n   (ECMP) load-balanced traffic
    and any-to-any end-to-end Traffic\n   Engineered (TE) traffic. HSDN achieves massive
    scale using\n   surprisingly small forwarding tables in the network nodes. HSDN\n
    \  introduces a new paradigm for both forwarding and control planes, in\n   that
    all paths in the network are pre-established in the forwarding\n   tables and
    the labels can identify entire paths rather than simply\n   destinations.  The
    HSDN forwarding architecture is based on four main\n   concepts: 1. Dividing the
    DC and DCI in a hierarchically-partitioned\n   structure; 2. Assigning groups
    of Underlay Border Nodes in charge of\n   forwarding within each partition; 3.
    Constructing HSDN MPLS label\n   stacks to identify endpoints and paths according
    to the HSDN\n   structure; and 4. Forwarding using the HSDN MPLS labels.\n\n\t
