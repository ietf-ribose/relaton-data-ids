abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using the electric-power
    lines\n   for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to\n
    \  support Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially smart\n   meters
    for electricity.  The inherent advantage of existing\n   electricity infrastructure
    facilitates the expansion of PLC\n   deployments, and moreover, a wide variety
    of accessible devices\n   raises the potential demand of IPv6 for future applications.
    \ This\n   document describes how IPv6 packets are transported over constrained\n
    \  PLC networks, such as ITU-T G.9903, IEEE 1901.1 and IEEE 1901.2.\n\n\t </p>\n
