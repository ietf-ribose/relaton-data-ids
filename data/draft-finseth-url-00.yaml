abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines a new URL scheme, 'eid'. This scheme providesa
    mechanism by which the local application can reference data thathas been obtained
    by other, non-URL scheme means. The scheme isintended to provide a general escape
    mechanism to allow access toinformation for applications that are too specialized
    to justifytheir own schemes.</p>"
