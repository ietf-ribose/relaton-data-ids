abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Several approaches to transporting the ITU-T Q.931 User to User\nInformation
    Element (UU IE) data in SIP have been proposed.  As\nnetworks move to SIP it is
    important that applications requiring this\ndata can continue to function in SIP
    networks as well as the ability\nto interwork with this ISDN service for end-to-
    end transparency.\nThis document discusses three mechanisms to meet the requirements\ndefined
    in the Requirements for SIP Call Control UUI document.  A new\nSIP header field
    which bests meets these requirements is proposed.\n\t </p>\n      "
