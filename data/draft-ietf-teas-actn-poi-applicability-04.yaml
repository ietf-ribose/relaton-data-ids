abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers the applicability of Abstraction and Control
    of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture to Packet Optical Integration (POI)in the context
    of IP/MPLS and Optical internetworking. It identifies the YANG data models being
    defined by the IETF to support this deployment architecture and specific scenarios
    relevant for Service Providers. Existing IETF protocols and data models are identified
    for each multi-layer (packet over optical) scenario with a specific focus on the
    MPI (Multi-Domain Service Coordinator to Provisioning Network Controllers Interface)in
    the ACTN architecture.</p>"
