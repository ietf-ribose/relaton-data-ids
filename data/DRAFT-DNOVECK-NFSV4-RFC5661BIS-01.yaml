abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version
    4 minor\n   version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS\n
    \  version 4 minor version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and\n   protocol
    extensions made subsequently.  The later minor version has\n   no dependencies
    on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and was, until\n   recently, documented as a
    comletely separate protocol.\n\n   This document will give rise to a suite of
    documents which\n   collectively obsolete RFC 8881.  In addition to many corrections
    and\n   clarifications, it will rely on NFSv4-wide documents to substantially\n
    \  revise the treatment of protocol extension, internationalization, and\n   security,
    superseding the descriptions of those aspects of the\n   protocol appearing in
    RFCs 5661 and 8881.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
