abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the minimal framework required for a new device,
    called "pledge", to securely join a 6TiSCH (IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e)
    network. The framework requires that the pledge and the JRC (join registrar/coordinator,
    a central entity), share a symmetric key. How this key is provisioned is out of
    scope of this document. Through a single CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)
    request-response exchange secured by OSCORE (Object Security for Constrained RESTful
    Environments), the pledge requests admission into the network and the JRC configures
    it with link-layer keying material and other parameters. The JRC may at any time
    update the parameters through another request-response exchange secured by OSCORE.
    This specification defines the Constrained Join Protocol and its CBOR (Concise
    Binary Object Representation) data structures, and describes how to configure
    the rest of the 6TiSCH communication stack for this join process to occur in a
    secure manner. Additional security mechanisms may be added on top of this minimal
    framework.</p>
