abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Pre-Congestion Notification described in\n[I-D.eardley-pcn-architecture]
    and earlier in\n[I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] approach proposes the use
    of an\nAdmission Control mechanism to limit the amount of real-time PCN\ntraffic
    to a configured level during the normal operating conditions,\nand the use of
    a Flow Termination mechanism to tear-down some of the\nflows to bring the PCN
    traffic level down to a desirable amount\nduring unexpected events such as network
    failures, with the goal of\nmaintaining the QoS assurances to the remaining flows.
    \ In\n[I-D.eardley-pcn-architecture], Admission and Flow Termination use\ntwo
    different markings and two different metering mechanisms in the\ninternal nodes
    of the PCN region.  This draft proposes a mechanism\nusing a single marking and
    metering for both Admission and Flow\nTermination, and presents an analysis of
    the tradeoffs.  A side-\neffect of this proposal is that a different marking and
    metering\nAdmission mechanism than that proposed in\n[I-D.eardley-pcn-architecture]
    may be also feasible, and may result\nin a number of benefits.  In addition, this
    draft proposes a\nmigration path for incremental deployment of this approach as
    an\nintermediate step to the dual-marking approach.\n\t </p>\n      "
