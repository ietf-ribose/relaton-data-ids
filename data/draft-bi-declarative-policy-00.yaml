abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a declarative model for traffic steering policies
    in Distributed Data Center (DDC) scenarios. The policy model is a specific data
    model for traffic steering using VPN technology. It helps the service management
    in Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) to model the policy (a set of
    constraints and rules) that defines how a VPN service is monitored by bandwidth
    and managed during its lifecycle.</p>"
