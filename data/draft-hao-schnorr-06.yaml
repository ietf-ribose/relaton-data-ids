abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Schnorr non-interactive zero-knowledge
    (NIZK) proof, a non-interactive variant of the three-pass Schnorr identification
    scheme. The Schnorr NIZK proof allows one to prove the knowledge of a discrete
    logarithm without leaking any information about its value. It can serve as a useful
    building block for many cryptographic protocols to ensure that participants follow
    the protocol specification honestly. This document specifies the Schnorr NIZK
    proof in both the finite field and the elliptic curve settings.</p>"
