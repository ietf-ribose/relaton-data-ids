abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an approach for integrating the functionality\n
    \  currently contained in [47]SDP (Session Announcement Protocol) into\n   [48]SMIL
    (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language). The\n   motivation is to make
    it easier for SMIL authors to interface with the\n   existing RTP/MBone infrastructure.
    Currently, this requires\n   maintaining two different sets of files, each of
    which use a different\n   text format. Another motivation is to save one network
    round-trip per\n   RTSP URL in the SMIL file, since the information contained
    in the SDP\n   file is now directly included in the SMIL file.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
