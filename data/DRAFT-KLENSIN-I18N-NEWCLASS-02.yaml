abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Several mechanisms have been proposed for placing multilingual
    names\n(more properly, names normally written in non-ASCII character sets)\ninto
    the DNS or addressing the need for multilingual access to the\nInternet in other
    ways.  Most of them involve, to one extent or\nanother, workarounds to the current
    system.  This document proposes a\n'go back and fix it' approach, replacing the
    'IN' Class in the DNS with\none that is not limited to ASCII from its initial
    definitions.  Some of\nthe deployment issues, politics, and other drawbacks are
    also briefly\ndiscussed.\n\t </p>\n      "
