abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) provides \"RESTful\"
    web\n   services to retrieve registration metadata from domain name and\n   regional
    internet registries.  RDAP allows a server to make access\n   control decisions
    based on client identity, and as such it includes\n   support for client identification
    features provided by the Hypertext\n   Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  Identification
    methods that require\n   clients to obtain and manage credentials from every RDAP
    server\n   operator present management challenges for both clients and servers,\n
    \  whereas a federated authentication system would make it easier to\n   operate
    and use RDAP without the need to maintain server-specific\n   client credentials.
    \ This document describes a federated\n   authentication system for RDAP based
    on OpenID Connect.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
