abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The migration from Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) to \nGeneralized
    MPLS (GMPLS) is the process of evolving an MPLS traffic \nengineered (TE) control
    plane to a GMPLS control plane. An \nappropriate migration strategy can be selected
    based on various \nfactors including the service provider's network deployment
    plan, \ncustomer demand, available network equipment implementation, \noperational
    policy, etc. \nIn the course of migration, several interworking cases may exist
    \nwhere MPLS and GMPLS devices or networks must coexist. During the \nmigration
    process, standard interworking functions are needed to \nallow graceful deployment
    of GMPLS technologies while keeping \nexisting IP/MPLS networks unaffected. \nSince
    GMPLS signaling and routing protocols are different from the \nMPLS control protocols,
    in order for MPLS and GMPLS to interwork, we \nneed mechanisms to compensate for
    the differences between MPLS and \nGMPLS. This document provides a landscape of
    techniques, practices \nand an overview of interworking between MPLS and GMPLS
    in support of \nIP/MPLS to GMPLS migration, which is also beneficial for graceful
    \ndeployment of GMPLS technologies into existing IP/MPLS networks. We \ndiscuss
    issues, models, migration scenarios, operation, and \nrequirements.\n\t </p>\n
