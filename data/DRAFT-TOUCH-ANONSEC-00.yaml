abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent attacks on core Internet infrastructure indicate an
    increased\n   vulnerability of TCP connections to spurious resets (RSTs).  TCP
    has\n   always been susceptible to such RST spoof attacks, which were\n   indirectly
    protected by checking that the RST sequence number was\n   inside the current
    receive window, as well as via the obfuscation of\n   TCP endpoint and port numbers.
    For pairs of well-known endpoints\n   often over predictable port pairs, such
    as BGP, increases in the path\n   bandwidth-delay product of a connection have
    sufficiently increased\n   the receive window space that off-path third parties
    can guess a\n   viable RST sequence number. This document addresses this\n   vulnerability,
    discussing proposed solutions at the transport level\n   and their inherent challenges,
    as well as existing network level\n   solutions and the feasibility of their deployment.
    Finally, it\n   proposes an extension to IPsec configuration called ANONsec that\n
    \  intends to efficiently and scalably secure any transport protocol\n   from
    such off-path third-party spoofing attacks.\n\t </p>\n      "
