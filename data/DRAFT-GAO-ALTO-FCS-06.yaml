abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ALTO cost maps and endpoint cost services map a source-destination\n
    \  pair into a cost value.  However, current filter specifications,\n   which
    define the set of source-destination pairs in an ALTO query,\n   have two limitations:
    1) Only very limited address types are\n   supported (IPv4 and IPv6), which is
    not sufficient to uniquely\n   identify a flow in networks with fine-grained routing,
    such as the\n   emerging Software Defined Networks; 2) The base ALTO protocol
    only\n   defines filters enumerating all sources and all destinations, leading\n
    \  to redundant information in the response; 3) Cannot distinguish\n   transmission
    types of flows in the query, which makes the server hard\n   to respond the accurate
    resource consumption.  To address these three\n   issues, this document extends
    the base ALTO protocol with a more\n   fine-grained filter type which allows ALTO
    clients to select only the\n   concerned source-destination pairs and announce
    the flow-specific\n   information like data transmission type, and a more expressive\n
    \  address space which allows ALTO clients to make queries beyond the\n   limited
    IP addresses.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
