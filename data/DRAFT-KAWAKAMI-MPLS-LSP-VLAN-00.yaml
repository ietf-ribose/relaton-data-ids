abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a method to setup a Layer 2 tunnel over
    \nnetworks based on Ethernet technology. For this purpose, the ports of \nan Ethernet
    switch are configured to forward VLAN tag-labeled packets \nincoming from a certain
    port to another unambiguous port by using \nVLAN tag information. The Ethernet
    switches themselves are a part of \nthe Label Switching Routers (LSRs), which
    distribute the VLAN tags \nusing Label Distribution Protocol (LDP). To enable
    LDP to fulfil this \nfunction, an LDP extension is proposed. The introduced method
    \nsimplifies the transport of Ethernet frames over wide area Ethernet \nnetworks.
