abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes several mechanisms which can be employed by
    iterative caching DNS resolvers to improve resiliency, robustness, and responsiveness.
    These improvements are optional and they require no changes to the protocol, or
    to authority servers, or to DNS stub resolver clients.</p>"
