abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node to connect to the same Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 domain through different interfaces. However, the ability of movement
    of selected flows from one access technology to another is missing in the basic
    Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol. This document describes extensions to the Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 protocol that are required to support network based flow mobility over multiple
    physical interfaces. This document assumes that the mobile node implements the
    logical interface model, therefore allowing the support of traffic flows on different
    physical interfaces regardless of the assigned prefixes on these physical interfaces.</p>"
