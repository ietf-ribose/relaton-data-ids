abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Session Initiation Protocol is the Internet Engineering Task Force's\nstandard
    for multimedia communications in an IP network.\nAuthentication in SIP has been
    a major concern and most of the\nexisting authentication mechanisms in SIP are
    dependent on public key\ninfrastructure (PKI) or shared secrets (passwords).This
    document\nproposes new authentication schemes in SIP using identity-based\nsignature
    and signcryption schemes.  This approach provides security\ncomparable to that
    of certificate-based authentication while\npreserving the operational simplicity
    of shared-secret techniques.\n\t </p>\n      "
