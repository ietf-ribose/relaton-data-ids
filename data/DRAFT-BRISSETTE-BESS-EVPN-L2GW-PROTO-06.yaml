abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The existing EVPN multi-homing load-balancing modes defined
    are\n   Single-Active and All-Active.  Neither of these multi-homing\n   mechanisms
    adequately ethernet-segments facing access networks with\n   Layer-2 Gateway protocols
    such as G.8032, (M)STP, REP, MPLS-TP, etc.\n   These loop-preventing Layer-2 protocols
    require a new multi-homing\n   mechanism defined in this draft.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
