abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n
    \  In particular, it describes objects for configuring parameters of the\n   Lightweight
    On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next\n   Generation (LOADng)
    process on a router.  The MIB module defined in\n   this memo, denoted LOADng-MIB,
    also reports state.  While LOADng is\n   layer agnostic and can be run with different
    address families (e.g.,\n   on L2 using MAC addresses, or on L3 using IP address),
    this MIB\n   module assumes that LOADng is used on L3, and uses only IPv4/IPv6\n
    \  addresses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
