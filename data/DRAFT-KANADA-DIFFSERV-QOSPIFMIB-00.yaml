abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a QoS PIF MIB (Quality-of-Service\nProgramming-Interface
    Management-Information-Base) to be used as an\nSNMP-based programming interface
    for routers.  This MIB is intended\nto be a programming interface for router QoS
    functions, especially\nDiffServ-related [RFC2475] functions including packet scheduling\n(queuing),
    dropping, and metering that must be modular and concisely\ndescribed.  Traffic-conditioning
    rules and metering rules for\nDiffServ-related functions are defined modularly
    by using 'virtual\nflow labels' and exclusive conditions in rules, and new\nclassifications
    for packet-scheduling and packet-dropping functions\nare introduced.  This document
    focuses on satisfying the requirements\non programming interfaces or programming
    languages for router\ncontrol.  Thus, the focus is different from that of DiffServ
    MIB\n[DSMIB] or QoS PIB [QoSPIB].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
