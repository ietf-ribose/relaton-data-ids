abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As time and frequency distribution protocols are becoming\n
    \  increasingly common and widely deployed, concern about their exposure\n   to
    various security threats is increasing. This document defines a\n   set of security
    requirements for time protocols, focusing on the\n   Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
    and the Network Time Protocol (NTP).\n   This document also discusses the security
    impacts of time protocol\n   practices, the performance implications of external
    security\n   practices on time protocols and the dependencies between other\n
    \  security services and time synchronization.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
