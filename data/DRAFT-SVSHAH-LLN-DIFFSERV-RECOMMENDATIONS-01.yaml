abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Differentiated services architecture is widely deployed in\n
    \  traditional networks.  There exist well defined recommendations for\n   the
    use of appropriate differentiated service classes for different\n   types of traffic
    (eg. audio, video) in these networks.  Per-Hop\n   Behaviors are typically defined
    based on this recommendations.  With\n   emerging Low-power and Lossy Networks
    (LLNs), it is important to have\n   similar defined differentiated services recommendations
    for LLN\n   traffic.  Defined recommendations are for LLN class of traffic\n   exiting
    out of LLNs towards high-speed backbones, converged campus\n   network and for
    the traffic in the reverse direction.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
