abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A number of enhancements to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)\n
    \  have been proposed.  Some have been implemented, and some are\n   advancing
    toward standardization.  It is likely that additional\n   enhancements will be
    proposed in the future.  At present LDP has no\n   guidelines for advertising
    such enhancements at LDP session\n   initialization time.  There is also no mechanism
    to enable and\n   disable enhancements after the session is established.  This
    document\n   provides guidelines for advertising LDP enhancements at session\n
    \  initialization time.  It also defines a mechanism to enable and\n   disable
    enhancements after LDP session establishment.\n\t </p>\n      "
