abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RBridges provide the ability to have an entire domain, with multiple
    \nphysical links, look to IP like a single subnet. The design allows \nfor zero
    configuration of switches within an RBridge domain, optimal \npair-wise routing,
    safe forwarding even during periods of temporary \nloops, and potential additional
    advantages as well.  The design also\nsupports VLANs, allows forwarding tables
    to be based on destinations \nwithin the RBridge domain (rather than endnode destinations,
    allowing \ninternal forwarding tables to be smaller than in conventional bridge
    \nsystems).\n\nThe intent is to re-uses one or more existing routing protocols
    to\naccomplish these goals.\n\nThis document lays out the background and specific
    requirements of\npotential routing protocols to be considered for use in this
    design.\nIn particular, this document defines what is needed to accomodate\nthis
    design using IS-IS (or OSPF) as a basis for RBridge protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
