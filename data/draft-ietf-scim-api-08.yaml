abstract:
- content: "<p>The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
    is designed to make managing user identity in multi-domain based applications
    and services easier using HTTP Protocol. Examples include but are not limited
    to enterprise to cloud service providers, and inter-cloud based scenarios. The
    specification suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments,
    placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while
    applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. It's intent
    is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing
    a common user schema and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide
    patterns for exchanging this schema using standard protocols. In essence, make
    it fast, cheap, and easy to move users in to, out of, and around the cloud.</p>"
