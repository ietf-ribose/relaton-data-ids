abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The first step in creating a secure Internet is to build a model
    of\nthe security requirements of the real world entities involved and\nhow those
    real world entities act on the Internet through the agency\nof networked computers.
    This document presents a minimal model as a\nstarting point for discussion. In
    this model: \no  The real world is composed of entities, each being: (a) an\nindependent
    legal entity; or (b) a sub-entity of another entity\n(creating a multi-level hierarchy).\no
    \ Running code is characterized by: (a) the entity that it acts on\nbehalf of;
    and (b) the entity that controls the environment in\nwhich the code executes.\no
    \ The environment can run on a bare unmanaged machine or it can be\na virtual
    environment which is code controlled by another entity.\no  We can model communication
    between machines as a sequence of\nrequests and assertions. The security question
    becomes: which\nrequests to honour. What is known about the provenance of the\nrequests
    and assertions is typically crucial.\no  Security can take place at different
    network layers and security\ninformation must be passed between the layers along
    with the data.\n\t </p>\n      "
