abstract:
- content: "<p>On-path network performance measurements methods currently deployed
    contribute to the ossification of the Internet because they are expensive to deploy
    and to maintain. This draft motivates the exposure of QUIC header fields for on-path
    network measurements and their specification in the QUIC core protocol as a solution
    to avoid on-path network performance measurements to ossify the IP stack in the
    future.</p>"
