abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo defines a threat model for access networks with AAAproxies.
    Use cases of current and future applications in which AAAproxies are employed
    are described and it is discussed how proxiescould launch attacks in the defined
    use cases. The risk associatedwith these attacks in each use case is analyzed.
    In addition,mitigation techniques used in current AAA deployments are discussedand
    best practices for mitigating the identified attacks areidentified. As a result,
    this draft can serve as a guideline forrisk assessments and problem mitigation
    by providers, implementersand protocol designers of systems with proxies.</p>"
