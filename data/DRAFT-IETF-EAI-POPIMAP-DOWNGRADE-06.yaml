abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Email Address Internationalization (SMTPUTF8) extension
    allows\n   UTF-8 characters in mail header fields.  Upgraded POP and IMAP\n   servers
    support internationalized Email messages.  If a POP/IMAP\n   client does not support
    Email Address Internationalization, POP/IMAP\n   servers cannot send Internationalized
    Email Headers to the client and\n   cannot remove the message.  To avoid the situation,
    this document\n   describes a conversion mechanism for internationalized Email
    messages\n   to be in traditional message format.  In the process, message\n   elements
    requiring internationalized treatment are recoded or removed\n   and receivers
    are able to know that they received messages containing\n   such elements even
    if they cannot treat the internationalized\n   elements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
