abstract:
- content: "<p>Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies covering
    different Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The common characteristics for
    LPWANs are large coverage, low bandwidth, small packet and application layer data
    sizes and long battery life operation. One of these technologies is LoRaWAN developed
    by the LoRa Alliance. LoRaWAN targets key requirements of the Internet of things
    such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility and localization services.
    This memo is an informational overview of LoRaWAN and gives the principal characteristics
    of this technology in order to help with the IETF work for providing IPv6 connectivity
    over LoRaWAN along with other LPWANs.</p>"
