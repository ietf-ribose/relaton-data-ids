abstract:
  content: "\t <t>SPAN-A (pronounced 'spanner') is a candidate for the pre-midcom
    SPANprotocol. The scope of SPAN (Simple Protocol for Augmenting NATs) isto enable
    protocols involving multiple associated sessions to operateacross NATs. Such protocols
    typically use transport addresses toidentify associated sessions. This works well
    for environments whereend-to-end addressing is in force, but is broken by the
    introductionof NATs. SPAN is intended to operate with symmetric NATs by using
    arelay outside the NAT. It complements STUN [STUN] which operateswith various
    kinds of cone NAT.</p>"
