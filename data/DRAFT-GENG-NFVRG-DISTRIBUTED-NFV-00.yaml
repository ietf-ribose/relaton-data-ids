abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces the distributed NFV (D-NFV) concept
    based on\n   potential implementation in scattered locations including customer\n
    \  edge devices and transport network equipments.  The motivation of\n   pushing
    NFV entities from conventional centralized infrastructures to\n   distributed
    promises is discussed, which are driven by the\n   requirements of high flexibility,
    low end-to-end latency and faster\n   time-to-market in future network.  To better
    understand the D-NFV\n   concept, examples of D-NFV implementation is introduced.
    \ Potential\n   use cases are also described as references for readers.  Gaps
    have\n   also been recognized in the documents in terms of the investigation\n
    \  of appropriate virtualization technologies used in the D-NFV and\n   corresponding
    management and orchestration challenges.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
