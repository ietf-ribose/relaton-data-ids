abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a proposal for providing a database
    service\n   for authentication information for Caller-ID E.164 numbers,\n   nationally-specific
    number codes, and email-style names used in\n   communication requests (such as
    call setup, instant messages). The\n   model proposed uses a DNS service as a
    Registry for cryptographic\n   public-keys.  The database service solution is
    called CIDER.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
