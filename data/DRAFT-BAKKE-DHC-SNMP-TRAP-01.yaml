abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [RFC1531] provides a method\nfor
    a host to retrieve common configuration parameters at boot time.\nThese include
    the host's IP address, default gateway, subnet mask,\nDNS server, and other useful
    things.\nWhen a host is booted from the network, it does not have access to\nthese
    configuration parameters from its local or network disk right\naway; it relies
    instead on DHCP to provide them.  One such parameter\nthat is not yet provided
    is a list of IP hosts to which to send SNMP\nnotifications [RFC1448] during the
    boot process, particularly if the\nboot fails.  As the host is already gleaning
    similar information from\nDHCP, a new option to specify these SNMP 'trap' hosts
    appears to be\nthe simplest method to gain this information.  Hosts not booting
    from\nthe network benefit as well, since SNMP notification hosts can now be\nconfigured
    centrally through DHCP.\nThis document describes a proposed DHCP option that specifies
    a list\nof SNMP notification hosts to which SNMP notifications should be\nsent.\n\t
