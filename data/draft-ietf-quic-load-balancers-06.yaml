abstract:
- content: "<p>The QUIC protocol design is resistant to transparent packet inspection,
    injection, and modification by intermediaries. However, the server can explicitly
    cooperate with network services by agreeing to certain conventions and/or sharing
    state with those services. This specification provides a standardized means of
    solving three problems: (1) maintaining routability to servers via a low-state
    load balancer even when the connection IDs in use change; (2) explicit encoding
    of the connection ID length in all packets to assist hardware accelerators; and
    (3) injection of QUIC Retry packets by an anti-Denial-of-Service agent on behalf
    of the server.</p>"
