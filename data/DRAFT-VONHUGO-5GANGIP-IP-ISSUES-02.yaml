abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents considerations related to open and upcoming\n
    \  issues with upcoming new communication systems denoted as 5G aiming\n   to
    set a basis for documenting problem space, use-cases, and\n   potential solutions
    related to next-generation network\n   infrastructure.  The draft reviews currently
    investigated topics,\n   including both inputs from IETF and from other SDOs as
    well as\n   research activities.  Further the outcome of recent discussions at\n
    \  side sessions during IETF meetings are recaptured to help identifying\n   a
    starting point for future thoughts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
