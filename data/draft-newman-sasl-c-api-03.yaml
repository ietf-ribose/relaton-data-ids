abstract:
  content: "<p>Almost every protocol needs authentication. However, there does notexist
    an authentication mechanism suitable for all organizations, noris it likely that
    a small fixed set of authentication mechanisms willremain suitable. SASL [SASL]
    provides the on-the-wire framework forauthentication (and a security layer) which
    separates the design ofauthentication mechanisms from the protocols in which they're
    used.The SASL protocol model suggests a software architecture whereapplication
    protocols call a generic API to authenticate which inturn calls a generic plug-in
    interface for extensible authenticationmodules. This memo documents the API used
    in one implementation ofthis architecture in the hope that it will be useful to
    others. Anassociated memo documenting the plug-in interface is forthcoming.</p>"
