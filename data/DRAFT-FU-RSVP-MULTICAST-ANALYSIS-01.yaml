abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RSVP version 1 has been designed for optimum support multicast.\nHowever,
    in reality multicast is being used much less frequently than\nanticipated.  Still,
    even for unicast (one sender, one receiver)\nfull-fledged multicast-enabled RSVP
    signaling must be used.  As\npointed out in the NSIS requirement draft, multicast
    would not be\nnecessarily required for an NSIS signaling protocol.  This draft\nanalyses
    ingredients of RSVP Version 1 which are affected by\nmulticast, and derives how
    these ingredients may look like if\nmulticast is not supported in the generic
    RSVP signaling protocol and\nadapt related functionalities accordingly - we call
    the resulting\nfeature set 'RSVP Lite', a potentially more light-weight version
    of\nRSVP.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
