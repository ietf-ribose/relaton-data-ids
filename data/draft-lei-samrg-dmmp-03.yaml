abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a Dynamic Mesh-based overlay MulticastProtocol
    (DMMP) framework to support multicast data deliveryapplications without relying
    on classic IP multicast, includingmulticast group management, overlay hierarchy
    establishment,multicast tree construction and data forwarding scheme from a sourceto
    a number of receivers. The DMMP framework builds on control planefunctions which
    dynamically manage an overlay core and a multicasttree. The key idea is a number
    of end hosts self-organize into anoverlay mesh, and dynamically maintain such
    a mesh. Based on theconstructed mesh, some core-based clusters are formed with
    capacity-aware trees inside. Then, a multicast tree consisting of DMMP-awareend
    hosts (and/or specific routers) is built on the top of theoverlay core for the
    efficient delivery of the multicast data.</p>"
