abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the requirements for Drone Remote Identification
    Protocol (DRIP) Working Group protocols and services to support Unmanned Aircraft
    System Remote Identification (UAS RID). Objectives include: complementing external
    technical standards as regulator-accepted means of compliance with UAS RID regulations;
    facilitating use of existing Internet resources to support UAS RID and to enable
    enhanced related services; and enabling verification that UAS RID information
    is trustworthy (to some extent, even in the absence of Internet connectivity at
    the receiving node).</p>"
