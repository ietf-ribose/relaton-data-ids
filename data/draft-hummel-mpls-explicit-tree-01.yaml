abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft proposes the TREE ROUTE TLV that encodes a tree structuredroute
    which can be used to carry explicit routing information. Italso specifies the
    progression of the TLV from the root of the treeto the leaf nodes. Every node
    that the TLV traversed has todecode/process the TLV in such a way that the correct
    child link/nodes are determined as well as the respective subtree routeinformation.
    Individual Information targetted for any specific nodecan also be packed into
    this TREE ROUTE TLV. The draft also presents the benefits of using TREE ROUTE
    TLV in MPLS. The applications include constrain based routing, traffic engineering,
    VPN installations and static multicast tree. The capability of carrying targetted
    information for individual node in the tree is very powerful in MPLS. This allows
    different nodes in the tree route to use the same tree route for different FECs.
    The application of this TLV is not mpls-specific. Other Working Groups may consider
    the proposed TLV as well.</p>"
