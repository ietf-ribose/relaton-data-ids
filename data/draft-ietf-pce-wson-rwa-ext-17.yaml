abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) extensions for the support of Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) in
    Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs). Path provisioning in WSONs requires
    an RWA process. From a path computation perspective, wavelength assignment is
    the process of determining which wavelength can be used on each hop of a path
    and forms an additional routing constraint to optical path computation.</p>"
