abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo proposes a profile of the ACME protocol that allows
    the\n   owner of an identifier (e.g., a domain name) to delegate to a third\n
    \  party access to a certificate associated with said identifier.  A\n   primary
    use case is that of a CDN (the third party) terminating TLS\n   sessions on behalf
    of a content provider (the owner of a domain\n   name).  The presented mechanism
    allows the owner of the identifier to\n   retain control over the delegation and
    revoke it at any time by\n   cancelling the associated STAR certificate renewal
    with the ACME CA.\n   Another key property of this mechanism is it does not require
    any\n   modification to the deployed TLS ecosystem.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
