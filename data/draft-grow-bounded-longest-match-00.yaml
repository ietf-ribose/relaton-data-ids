abstract:
  content: "<p>Some ASes currently use length-based filters to manage the size ofthe
    routing table they use and propagate. This draft explores analternative to length-based
    filters which allows for more automaticconfiguration and which provides for better
    redundancy.Rather than use a filter, this draft proposes a method of modifyingthe
    BGP longest match algorithm by setting a bound on the prefixlengths eligible for
    preference. A bound would operate on longprefixes when covering route announcements
    are available; in certaincircumstances it would cause a router to prefer an aggregate
    over amore specific route announcement.</p>"
