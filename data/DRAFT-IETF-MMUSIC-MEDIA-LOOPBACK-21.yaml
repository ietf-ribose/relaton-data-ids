abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    The wide deployment of Voice over IP (VoIP), Text and Video
    over IP\n    services has introduced new challenges in managing and maintaining\n
    \   real-time voice/text/video quality, reliability, and overall\n    performance.
    \ In particular, media delivery is an area that needs\n    attention.  One method
    of meeting these challenges is monitoring\n    the media delivery performance
    by looping media back to the\n    transmitter.  This is typically referred to
    as \"active monitoring\"\n    of services.   Media loopback is especially popular
    in ensuring the\n    quality of transport to the edge of a given VoIP, Real-time
    Text or\n    Video over IP service.  Today in networks that deliver real-time\n
    \   media, short of running 'ping' and 'traceroute' to the edge,\n    administrators
    are left without the necessary tools to actively\n    monitor, manage, and diagnose
    quality issues with their service.\n    The extension defined herein adds new
    SDP media types and\n    attributes, which enable establishment of media sessions
    where the\n    media is looped back to the transmitter. Such media sessions will\n
    \   serve as monitoring and troubleshooting tools by providing the\n    means
    for measurement of more advanced VoIP, Real-time Text and\n    Video over IP performance
    metrics.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
