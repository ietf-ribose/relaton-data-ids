abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many of today's Web security problems have their root in the\n
    \  widespread usage of weak authentication mechanisms bundled with the\n   usage
    of password based credentials.  Dealing with both of these\n   problems is the
    basis of this publication.\n\n   This document extends the Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) protocol\n   with a flexible and widely deployed authentication framework,
    namely\n   the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), to improve security of\n
    \  Web- as well as non-Web-based applications.  The EAP framework allows\n   so-called
    EAP methods, i.e. authentication and key exchange\n   protocols, to be plugged
    into EAP without having to re-design the\n   underlying protocol.  The benefit
    of such an easy integration is the\n   ability to run authentication protocols
    that fit a specific\n   deployment environment, both from a credential choice
    as well as from\n   the security and performance characteristics of the actual
    protocol.\n\n   This work follows the example of IKEv2, where EAP has been added
    to\n   allow clients to seamlessly use different forms of authentication\n   credentials,
    such as passwords, token cards, and shared secrets.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
