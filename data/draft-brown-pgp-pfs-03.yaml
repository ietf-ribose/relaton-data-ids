abstract:
  content: "<p>The confidentiality of encrypted data depends on the secrecy of thekey
    needed to decrypt it. If one key is able to decrypt largequantities of data, its
    compromise will be disastrous. This memodescribes three methods for limiting this
    vulnerability for OpenPGPmessages: reducing the lifetime of confidentiality keys;
    one-timekeys; and the additional use of lower-layer security services.</p>"
