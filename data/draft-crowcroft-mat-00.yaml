    of address re-assignment. It can also lead to a reductionin the routing state
    in the core.This draft is about using the technique for the same reasons formulticast.
    The approach is complementary to IP-in-IP tunnels formulticast, but avoids the
    overhead of encapsulation. It has the samestate setup requirements at the edges,
