abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document deals with session recording, specifically for
    what\n   concerns recording of multimedia conferences, both centralized and\n
    \  distributed.  Each involved media is recorded separately, and is then\n   properly
    tagged.  A SMIL [W3C.CR-SMIL3-20080115] metadata is used to\n   put all the separate
    recordings together and handle their\n   synchronization, as well as the possibly
    asynchronous opening and\n   closure of media within the context of a conference.
    \ This SMIL\n   metadata can subsequently be used by an interested user by means
    of a\n   compliant player in order to passively receive a playout of the whole\n
    \  multimedia conference session.  The motivation for this document\n   comes
    from our experience with our conferencing framework, Meetecho,\n   for which we
    implemented a recording functionality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
