abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides an extensible and flexible multihoming
    VPN solution over an MPLS/IP network for intra-subnet connectivity among Tenant
    Systems and end devices that can be physical or virtual.  However, there are scenarios
    for which there is a need for a dynamic and efficient inter-subnet connectivity
    among these Tenant Systems and end devices while maintaining the multihoming capabilities
    of EVPN.  This document describes an Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) solution
    based on EVPN to address such requirements.\n\t </p>\n      "
