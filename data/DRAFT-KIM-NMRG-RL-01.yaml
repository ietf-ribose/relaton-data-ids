abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an intelligent reinforcement learning
    agent\n   system to autonomously manage agent path-planning over a\n   communication
    network.  The main centralized node called by the\n   global environment should
    not only manage all agents workflow in a\n   hybrid peer-to-peer networking architecture
    and, but transfer and\n   share information in distributed nodes.  All agents
    in distributed\n   nodes are able to be provided with a cumulative reward for
    each\n   action that a given agent takes with respect to an optimized\n   knowledge
    based on a to-be-learned policy over the learning process.\n   The optimized knowledge
    would be involved with a large state\n   information by the control action.  A
    reward from the global\n   environment is reflected to the next optimized control
    action for\n   autonomous path management in distributed networking nodes.  The\n
    \  reinforcement learning process (RLP) have developed and expanded to\n   deep
    reinforcement learning (DRL) with a data-driven approach\n   technique for learning
    process.  The trendy technique has been widely\n   to attempt and apply to networking
    fields since DRL can be used in\n   practice, since networking areas have the
    dynamics and heterogeneous\n   environment disturbances, so that in the technique
    is able to be\n   intelligently learned in the effective strategy.\n\n\t </p>\n
