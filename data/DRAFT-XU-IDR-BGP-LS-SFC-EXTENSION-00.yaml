abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Segment Routing mechanism can be leveraged to realize the
    service\n   path layer functionality of the Service Function Chaining (i.e,\n
    \  steering traffic through the service function path).  The link-state\n   IGPs
    (i.e., IS-IS and OSPF) have been extended to advertise service\n   information
    including services and the corrresponding service segment\n   identifiers.  For
    the purpose of building service function paths\n   which span across IGP areas,
    or even across ASes, this draft defines\n   extensions to the BGP Link-state address-family
    to carry service\n   information including services and the corrresponding service
    segment\n   identifiers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
