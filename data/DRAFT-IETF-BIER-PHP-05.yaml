abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) can be used as provider
    tunnel\n   for Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN) [RFC6514], Global\n   Table
    Multicast [RFC7716] or Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN)\n   [RFC7432].
    \ It is possible that not all routers in the provider\n   network support BIER
    and there are various methods to handle BIER\n   incapable transit routers.  However
    those methods assume the MVPN/\n   EVPN Provider Edges (PEs) are BIER capable.
    \ This document specifies\n   a method to allow BIER incapable routers to act
    as MVPN/EVPN PEs with\n   BIER as the transport, by having the upstream BIER Forwarding
    Router\n   (BFR) that is connected directly or indirectly via a tunnel to a BIER\n
    \  incapable PE remove the BIER header and send the payload to the PE.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
