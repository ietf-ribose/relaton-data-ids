abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an overview of source address dependent routing
    from the host perspective. Multihomed hosts and hosts with multiple interfaces
    are considered. Different architectures are introduced and with their help, why
    source address selection and next hop resolution in view of source address dependent
    routing is needed is explained. The document concludes with a discussion on the
    standardization work that is needed.</p>"
