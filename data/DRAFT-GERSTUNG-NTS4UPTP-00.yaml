abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies the application of Network Time Security,
    a\n   mechanism for using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Authenticated\n   Encryption
    with Associated Data (AEAD) to provide cryptographic\n   security for the unicast
    mode of the Precision Time Protocol.\n\n   It is based on the 'Network Time Security
    for the Network Time\n   Protocol' document [RFC8915] and re-uses most of its
    mechanisms for\n   providing a secure and robust key exchange solution for unicast
    PTP.\n   Due to the different modes of operation, additional steps are\n   required
    to secure unicast PTP communication between the PTP clients\n   and unicast PTP
    servers.  In addition to defining the new record\n   types and other required
    values to allow the utilization of the NTS\n   key exchange sub protocol, there
    are a number of additional protocol\n   enhancements and server-side requirements
    which are defined in this\n   memo.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
