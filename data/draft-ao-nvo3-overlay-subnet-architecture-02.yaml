abstract:
- content: "<p>An virtualized overlay network may be divided into several subnets
    for the reasons of geographical location, management, or using different technologies
    being used. For example, different customer have their own preference. But all
    these subnets need to work together to provide an end-to-end connectionif in a
    virtual network, An extended architecture of the NVO3 and propose a new component
    to provide the connection fucntion are introduced in this document.</p>"
