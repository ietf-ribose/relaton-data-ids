abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes requirements of compensation control of optical
    impairments such as chromatic dispersion for dynamic optical paths, as well as
    automatic discovery of fiber-related impairments over links by collaboration of
    a pair of adjacent nodes upon installation. It is intended as a supplement to
    the wavelength switched optical networks (WSON) framework with impairments, because
    GMPLS-based automatic adjustment of impairment compensation and automatic discovery
    of link impairments will improve usability of WSON.</p>"
