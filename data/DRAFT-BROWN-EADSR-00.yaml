abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The energy aware dynamic source routing (EADSR) protocol is an\nextension
    to the dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol for mobile ad\nhoc networks. It retains
    the features and benefits of DSR while it\nincorporates new features for energy
    limited nodes. The EADSR\nfeatures include (1) a DSR header option so that link
    power costs\ncan be passed with source routes; (2) an extended route discovery\nprotocol
    to find lower energy routes than minimum hop routes; and\n(3) an additional route
    maintenance mechanism that allows the source\nnode to respond to link changes
    without route disruption. The\nprotocol is able to find routes with minimum total
    transmit power\ncost. It is able to track changes in link power on a route, choose\nbetween
    routes based on cost, and notify the source of new lower\ncost routes as they
    become available. This document specifies the\nEADSR header option and operation
    changes to DSR.\n\t </p>\n      "
