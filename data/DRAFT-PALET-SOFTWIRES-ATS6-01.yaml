abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents the basis for a procedure that enables
    a host\n   or router to automatically setup an IPvX in IPvY tunnel.  Basically,\n
    \  the document considers several scenarios, from the most common today\n   \"dominant
    IPv4\" networks to new \"dominant IPv6\" networks, which can\n   even support
    the use of multicast.\n\n   A basic requirement is that the host or router is
    a dual stack node\n   and it will have either native IPv4-only access (dominant
    IPv4\n   network) or native IPv6-only access (dominant IPv6 network).\n   Consequently,
    either IPv6 will be transported in the existing IPv4-\n   only infrastructure,
    or IPv4 will be transported in the existing\n   IPv6-only infrastructure.  Other
    combinations are possible, such as\n   IPv6 in IPv6 (for example to support IPv6
    multicast in an IPv6-\n   unicast-only infrastructure).\n\n   The procedure follows
    the work from [1], [2], [3], [4] and mainly\n   [5], trying to be compliant with
    the requirements enumerated in those\n   documents.\n\t </p>\n      "
