abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a BGP-based method to communicate source
    IP\n   reverse-path reachability for sources of multicast IP traffic which\n   is
    available via AMT (RFC 7450).  This document defines a new SAFI\n   (Subsequent
    Address Family Identifier) Parameter type for MBGP which\n   declares the next
    hop for RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) of a source\n   IP to be the AMT tunnel
    discovered via an explicitly provided anycast\n   IP address for AMT Relay Discovery.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
