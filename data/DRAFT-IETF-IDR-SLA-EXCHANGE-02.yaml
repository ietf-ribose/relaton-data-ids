abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network administrators typically enforce Quality of Service
    (QoS)\n   policies according to Service Level Agreement (SLA) with their\n   providers.
    \ The enforcement of such policies often relies upon\n   vendor-specific configuration
    language.  Both learning of SLA, either\n   thru SLA documents or via some other
    out-of-band method, and\n   translating them to vendor specific configuration
    language is a\n   complex, many times manual, process and prone to errors.  This\n
    \  document proposes an in-band method of SLA signaling which can help\n   to
    simplify some of the complexities.\n\n   This document defines an optional transitive
    attribute to signal SLA\n   details in-band, across administrative boundaries
    (considered as\n   Autonomous Systems (AS)), thus simplifying and facilitating
    some of\n   the complex provisioning tasks.\n\n   Though the use case with the
    proposed BGP attribute is explicitly\n   defined in this document, purpose of
    this attribute is not limited to\n   this use case only.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
