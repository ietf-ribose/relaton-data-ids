abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo expands on RFC 1209 by describing how to do discovery and
    routing, both for private (intra-domain) and public (inter-domain) applications,
    over the SDMS service. As such,this memo considers cases where a private network
    is spread over multiple LISs. In particular, this memo allows hosts or routers
    in different LISs to exchange packets directly--without going through an intervening
    router.</p>"
