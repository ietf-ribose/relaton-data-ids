abstract:
- content: "<p>The SCIM 2.0 Core API defines a simple profile for searching for specific
    resource types using filters and qualifiers in combination with the HTTP GET verb.
    The Extended Search specification defines the following additional features: o
    Specification of search terms within an HTTP POST verb to avoid accidental leakage
    of confidential information via HTTP GET URLs, o An optional result set representation
    enabling clients to page through results in a state consistent fashion, and o
    The ability to search across multiple resource types (endpoints) and return one
    or more resource types.</p>"
