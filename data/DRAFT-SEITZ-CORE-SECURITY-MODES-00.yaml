abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CoAP draft defines how to use DTLS as security mechanism.
    \ In\n   order to establish which nodes are trusted to initiate a DTLS session\n
    \  with a device, the following security modes are defined: NoSec,\n   PreSharedKey,
    RawPublicKey, and Certificate.  These modes require\n   either to provision a
    list of keys of trusted clients, or to handle\n   heavyweight certificates.  This
    memo proposes two intermediate\n   security modes involving a trusted third party
    that are very similar\n   to PreSharedKey and RawPublicKey respectively, but which
    do not\n   require out-of-band provisioning of client keys to the device.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
