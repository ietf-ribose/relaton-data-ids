abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the requirements which individual pNFS
    layout\n   types need to meet in order to work within the parallel NFS (pNFS)\n
    \  framework as defined in RFC5661.  In so doing, it aims to clearly\n   distinguish
    between requirements for pNFS as a whole and those\n   specifically directed to
    the pNFS File Layout.  The lack of a clear\n   separation between the two set
    of requirements has been troublesome\n   for those specifying and evaluating new
    Layout Types.  In this\n   regard, this document updates RFC5661.\n\n\t </p>\n
