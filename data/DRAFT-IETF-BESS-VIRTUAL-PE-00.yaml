abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the architecture solutions for BGP/MPLS
    L3\n   and L2 Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) with virtual Provider Edge\n   (vPE)
    routers. It provides a functional description of the vPE\n   control, forwarding,
    and management. The proposed vPE solutions\n   support both the Software Defined
    Networks (SDN) approach which\n   allows physical decoupling of the control and
    the forwarding, and the\n   traditional distributed routing approach. A vPE can
    reside in any\n   network or compute devices, such as a server as co-resident
    with the\n   application virtual machines (VMs), or a Top-of-Rack (ToR) switch
    in\n   a Data Center (DC) network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
