abstract:
- content: "<p>User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is commonly used as a volumetric attack
    transport on the internet. Some network operators experience surges of UDP attack
    traffic that are multiple orders of magnitude above the baseline traffic rate
    for UDP. Application developers should be advised that UDP is being rate-limited
    on a bits-per-second and packet-per-second basis by network operators to enforce
    known good baseline traffic levels for UDP. UDP has been abused to such an extent
    that legitimate use may become collateral damage and application and protocol
    developers should avoid using UDP as a transport when possible.</p>"
