abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document outlines Socket Intents, a concept that allows\n
    \  applications to share their knowledge about upcoming communication\n   and
    express their performance preferences in a generic, intuitive\n   and, portable
    way.  Using Socket Intents, an application can express\n   what it knows, assumes,
    expects, or wants regarding its network\n   communication.  The information provided
    by Socket Intents can be\n   used by the network stack to optimize communication
    in a best-effort\n   way.\n\n   Socket Intent can be used to stem against the
    complexity of\n   exploiting transport diversity, e.g., to automate the choice
    among\n   multiple paths, provisioning domains or protocols.  By shifting this\n
    \  complexity from the application developer to the operating system, it\n   enables
    the use of these transport features to a wider range of\n   applications.\n\n\t
