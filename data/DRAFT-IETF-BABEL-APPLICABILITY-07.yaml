abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Babel is a routing protocol based on the distance-vector algorithm\n
    \  augmented with mechanisms for loop avoidance and starvation\n   avoidance.
    \ In this document, we describe a number of niches where\n   Babel has been found
    to be useful and that are arguably not\n   adequately served by more mature protocols.\n\n\t
