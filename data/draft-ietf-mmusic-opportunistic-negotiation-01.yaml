abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the use of the Secure Real-time transport
    protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711]. can be negotiated using the RTP/AVP (Audio Video Profile)
    defined in [RFC3551]. Such a mechanism is used to provide a means for encrypted
    media to be used in environments where support for encryption is not known in
    advance, and not required. The same mechanism is also applied to negotiation of
    the Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol Based Feedback
    (RTP/ AVPF) [RFC4585].</p>"
