abstract:
- content: <p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that provides
    optimal multicast forwarding through a "BIER domain" without requiring intermediate
    routers to maintain multicast-related, per- flow state. BIER also does not require
    an explicit tree-building protocol for its operation. A multicast data packet
    enters a BIER domain at a Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router (BFIR) and leaves the
    BIER domain at one or more Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers (BFERs). The BFIR adds
    a BIER packet header to the packet. The BIER packet header contains a BitString
    in which each bit represents exactly one BFER to forward the packet to. The set
    of BFERs to which the multicast packet needs to be forwarded is expressed by the
    set of bits in the BIER packet header. This document describes the OSPF protocol
    extension (from RFC 2328) that is required for BIER with MPLS encapsulation (which
    is defined in RFC 8296). Support for other encapsulation types and the use of
    multiple encapsulation types are outside the scope of this document.</p>
