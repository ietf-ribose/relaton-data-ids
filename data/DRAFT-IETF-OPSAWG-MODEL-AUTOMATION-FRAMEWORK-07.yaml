abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data models provide a programmatic approach to represent services
    and\n   networks.  Concretely, they can be used to derive configuration\n   information
    for network and service components, and state information\n   that will be monitored
    and tracked.  Data models can be used during\n   the service and network management
    life cycle, such as service\n   instantiation, provisioning, optimization, monitoring,
    diagnostic,\n   and assurance.  Data models are also instrumental in the automation\n
    \  of network management, and they can provide closed-loop control for\n   adaptive
    and deterministic service creation, delivery, and\n   maintenance.\n\n   This
    document describes an architecture for service and network\n   management automation
    that takes advantage of YANG modeling\n   technologies.  This architecture is
    drawn from a network operator\n   perspective irrespective of the origin of a
    data model; it can thus\n   accommodate modules that are developed outside the
    IETF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
