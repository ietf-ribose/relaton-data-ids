abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When establishing new RSVP-TE LSPs, it is permissible that
    LSRs along\n   the LSP path to forward the RSVP Resv message upstream before\n
    \  installing the forwarding state.  In practise, this is done to\n   parallelize
    the forwarding state installation.  While the ingress can\n   start to use the
    LSP as soon as the RSVP Resv message arrives, doing\n   so may lead to traffic
    drops at intermediate LSRs that may not have\n   completed the installation of
    forwarding state for the new LSP.\n\n   This document describes procedures and
    provides extensions to RSVP-TE\n   protocol to allow an ingress LSR to immediately
    install and forward\n   traffic on a newly signalled LSP as soon as the RSVP reservation\n
    \  state is received.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
