abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a solution for BGP route reflectors to allow
    them to choose the best path for their clients that the clients themselves would
    have chosen under the same conditions, without requiring further state or any
    new features to be placed on the clients. This facilitates, for example, best
    exit point policy (hot potato routing). This solution is primarily applicable
    in deployments using centralized route reflectors. The solution relies upon all
    route reflectors learning all paths which are eligible for consideration. Best
    path selection is performed in each route reflector based on a configured virtual
    location in the IGP. The location can be the same for all clients or different
    per peer/update group or per peer. Best path selection can also be performed based
    on user configured policies in each route reflector.</p>"
