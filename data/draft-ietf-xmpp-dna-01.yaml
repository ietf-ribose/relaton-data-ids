abstract:
- content: "<p>The current authentication process in XMPP requires the XMPP server
    for a domain to present a certificate that contains that domain's name. This requirement
    causes several problems in scenarios where XMPP services have been delegated from
    one domain to another, especially when one domain provides XMPP services for many
    domains. This document describes an extension to the XMPP authentication process
    that allows domains to be securely delegated, simplifying authorization in delegation
    scenarios.</p>"
