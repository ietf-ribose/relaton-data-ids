abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>AAA-HK [1] provides a method for a MN and an AR to establish a
    shared\nkey using a AAA server.  To ensure that the round trip to the AAA\nserver
    does not delay handoff, the handover key must be derived\nindependent of and well
    ahead of the actual handoff, preferably\nimmediately after moving to a new access
    router.  This document\ndescribes one such method of optimizing the handover key
    derivation\nby using an AR as an authenticating server, once the MN and AR have\nestablished
    a security association.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
