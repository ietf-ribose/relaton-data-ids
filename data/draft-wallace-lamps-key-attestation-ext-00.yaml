abstract:
- content: "<p>Certification Authorities (CAs) issue certificates for public keys
    conveyed to the CA via a certificate management message or protocol. In some cases,
    a CA may wish to tailor certificate contents based on whether the corresponding
    private key is secured by hardware in non- exportable form. This document describes
    extensions that may be included in any of several widely used certificate management
    protocols to convey attestations about the private key to the CA to support this
    determination.</p>"
