abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the requirements for a set of open IP based
    protocols enabling seamless mobility across diverse radio access networks. This
    document begins by stating some architectural tenets upon which the requirements
    for the OBAST protocol set are based. Furthermore, what the authors currently
    believe to be the eventual desirable wireless Internet architecture is described.
    This architecture is shown to enable a common protocol set that we refer to as
    open base station transport (OBAST).</p>"
