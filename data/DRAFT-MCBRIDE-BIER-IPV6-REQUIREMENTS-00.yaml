abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BIER WG has a charter item to work on mechanisms which
    use BIER\n   natively in IPv6.  This document is intended to help the WG with
    this\n   effort by describing the problem space of transporting packets, with\n
    \  Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) headers, in an IPv6\n   environment.
    \ There will be a need to send IPv6 payloads, to multiple\n   IPv6 destinations,
    using BIER.  There have been several proposed\n   solutions in this area.  But
    there hasn't been a document which\n   describes the problem and why this may
    be necessary.  The goal of\n   this document is to describe the BIER IPv6 problem
    space, basic use\n   cases, why new solutions may be needed and briefly summarize
    some of\n   the proposed solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
