abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The shim6 protocol defines a header that contains a \"context
    tag\" that\nidentifies packets as belonging to a certain shim6 context that exists\nbetween
    two hosts. It has been suggested that this shim6 header is\ninserted between the
    IPv6 header and the upper layer protocol such as\nTCP in all packets where the
    shim layer has rewritten the source and/or\ndestination address. This document
    considers the suppression of this\nheader in situations where packets can be successfully
    demultiplexed by\nthe receiver without it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
