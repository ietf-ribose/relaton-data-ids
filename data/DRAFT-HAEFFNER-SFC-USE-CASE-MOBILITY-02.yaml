abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides some exemplary use cases for service
    function\n   chaining in mobile service provider networks.  The objective of this\n
    \  draft is not to cover all conceivable service chains in detail.\n   Rather,
    the intention is to localize and explain the application\n   domain of service
    chaining within mobile networks as far as it is\n   required to complement the
    problem statement and framework statements\n   of the working group.\n\n   Service
    function chains typically reside in a LAN segment which links\n   the mobile access
    network to the actual application platforms located\n   in the carrier's datacenters
    or somewhere else in the Internet.\n   Service function chains ensure a fair distribution
    of network\n   resources according to agreed service policies, enhance the\n   performance
    of service delivery, take care of security and privacy or\n   support application
    and business support platforms.  General\n   considerations and specific use cases
    are presented in this document\n   to demonstrate the different technical requirements
    of these goals\n   for service function chaining in mobile service provider networks.\n\n
    \  The specification of service function chaining for mobile networks\n   must
    take into account an interaction between service function chains\n   and the 3GPP
    Policy and Charging Control (PCC) environment.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
