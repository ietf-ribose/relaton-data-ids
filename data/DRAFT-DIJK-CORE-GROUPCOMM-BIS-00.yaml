abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the use of the Constrained Application\n
    \  Protocol (CoAP) for group communication, using UDP/IP multicast as\n   the
    underlying data transport.  Both unsecured and secured CoAP group\n   communication
    are specified.  Security is achieved by the Group\n   Object Security for Constrained
    RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE)\n   protocol.  The target application area
    of this specification is any\n   group communication use cases that involve resource-constrained\n
    \  network nodes.  The most common of such use cases are listed in this\n   document.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
