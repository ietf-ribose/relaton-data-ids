abstract:
- content: "<p>Different documents [savi-fcfs] [savi-dhcp] [savi-send] propose different
    preference schemes to resolve binding entry collisions (same L3 address, different
    binding anchors) based of the address- assignment method that they cover. For
    instance [fcfs] keeps the first entry and rejects others. However, in heterogeneous
    deployments, all address-assignment methods co-exist, and there is a need for
    defining an algorithm that compare colliding entries across these different methods
    (and any other method not covered) to pick up a preferred one. This document describes
    one such algorithum.</p>"
