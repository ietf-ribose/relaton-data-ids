abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Different documents [savi-fcfs] [savi-dhcp] [savi-send] proposedifferent
    preference schemes to resolve binding entry collisions(same L3 address, different
    binding anchors) based of the address-assignment method that they cover. For instance
    [fcfs] keeps thefirst entry and rejects others. However, in heterogeneousdeployments,
    all address-assignment methods co-exist, and there is aneed for defining an algorithm
    that compare colliding entries acrossthese different methods (and any other method
    not covered) to pick upa preferred one. This document describes one such algorithum.</p>"
