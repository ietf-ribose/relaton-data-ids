abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Whois servers are used to locate administrative, technical and
    \nsecurity contacts for given IP addresses, domain names or other \nnetwork objects
    associated with an organisation, e.g. AS numbers. \nWhile usually Top Level Domain
    (TLD) registries run a whois server, \nthere is no generic name for it and it
    may not even be obvious that \nthe TLD registry's whois server is the right one
    to ask, since there \nare TLDs where registration takes place under specialised
    second \nlevel domains (e.g. UK, AT). The Regional Internet Registries (RIR) \nalso
    provide whois service as part of their coordination task. \nAll this can be solved
    by central 'master' or 'meta' whois servers, \nwhich keep track of all new and
    changing servers and refer to the DNS \nregistries' or RIRs' whois servers. \nThis
    document proposes a DNS-based approach which eliminates the need \nfor a central
    master repository and works down to lower levels in the \nhierarchy. It is the
    intent to locate a whois server as close to the \ntarget (in terms of hierarchy)
    as possible, while preserving the \nopportunity to locate higher level servers
    for escalation purposes.\n\t </p>\n      "
