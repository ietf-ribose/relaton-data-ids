abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The terms on-path attacker and Man-in-the-Middle Attack have
    been\n   used in a variety of ways, sometimes interchangeably, and sometimes\n
    \  meaning different things.\n\n   This document offers an update on terminology
    for network attacks.  A\n   consistent set of terminology is important in describing
    what kinds\n   of attacks a particular protocol defends against, and which kinds
    the\n   protocol does not.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
