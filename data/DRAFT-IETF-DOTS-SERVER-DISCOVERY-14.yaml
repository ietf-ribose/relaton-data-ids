abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies mechanisms to configure Distributed
    Denial of\n   Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) clients with their DOTS servers.\n
    \  The discovery procedure also covers the DOTS Signal Channel Call\n   Home.
    \ Knowing the appropriate DOTS server for a given location can\n   be useful to
    engage mitigation actions even in cases where the DOTS\n   client cannot localize
    the attack, but only knows that some resources\n   are under attack and that help
    is needed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
