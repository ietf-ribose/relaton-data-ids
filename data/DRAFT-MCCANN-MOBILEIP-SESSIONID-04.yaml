abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Network Access Identifier can be added to a Mobile IP\nregistration
    request to identify the user and to allow the\nassignment of a dynamic home address.
    \ However, users may want to\nopen several simultaneous sessions using the same
    NAI from the same\nor different devices and to obtain a unique IP address for
    each\nsession.  The Mobile IP Session Identifier Extension defined in this\ndraft
    can be used to distinguish registration requests belonging to\nthese various sessions.
    \ This draft also clarifies how a dynamic\naddress is to be managed when and if
    the user returns to the home\nnetwork that assigned the address.\n\t </p>\n      "
