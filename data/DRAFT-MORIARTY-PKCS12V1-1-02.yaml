  content: "\n\t <p>   This document represents a republication of PKCS #12 v1.1\n
    \  (Republication) From RSA Laboratories' Public Key Cryptography\n   Standard
    (PKCS) series.  Change control is transferred to the IETF,\n   and generally all
    rights in the copyright are hereby assigned from\n   RSA to IETF, except that
    RSA reserves the internal right to continue\n   publishing, with the right to
    modify, and distributing the\n   Republication and its predecessors internally
    to RSA and its parent\n   company EMC, including the right to make modifications
    to the\n   Republication and its predecessors (the \"RSA Internal Right\").  For\n
    \  avoidance of doubt, RSA's Internal Right includes the right to post\n   on
    its public website for use by other parties.  The body of this\n   document, except
    for the security considerations section, is taken\n   directly from the PKCS #12
    v1.1 specification\n\n   PKCS #12 v1.1 describes a transfer syntax for personal
    identity\n   information, including private keys, certificates, miscellaneous\n
    \  secrets, and extensions.  Machines, applications, browsers, Internet\n   kiosks,
    and so on, that support this standard will allow a user to\n   import, export,
    and exercise a single set of personal identity\n   information.  This standard
    supports direct transfer of personal\n   information under several privacy and
    integrity modes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
