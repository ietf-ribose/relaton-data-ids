abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>BGP is the routing protocol used to tie the Autonomous Systems
    (ASes)\n   of the Internet together.  The ongoing stability of BGP in the face\n
    \  of arbitrary inputs, both malicious and unintentional, is of primary\n   importance
    to the overall stability of the Internet.  The overall\n   issue is not a new
    one.  Previously, one aspect of stability, known\n   as route flap damping was
    originally discussed in RFC 2439.  In the\n   intervening years, a great deal
    of experience with flap damping and\n\n   other stability concerns has been accumulated.
    \ Most recently, the\n   issue of BGP stability has been highlighted in RAWS.
    \ This document\n   describes the experience that has been gained concerning stability
    in\n   the intervening years, hypotheses about remaining problems,\n   suggestions
    for experiments to be performed, and proposals for\n   possible alternatives.\n\t
