abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document propose a scheme to support MIP6 deployment based
    on\n   Wireless LAN by extending HMIPv6.  The HCF (Handover Control\n   Function)
    described in this document should record all APs's MAC\n   address, backend AR's
    address and network prefix of those APs.  All\n   MNs will periodically report
    all AP's MAC address and signal strength\n   information to HCF which MN can probe,
    then HCF should decide whether\n   or which AP MN shall associate with and notify
    MN about the new AP/\n   AR's information, meanwhile, a bi-cast mechanism shall
    be applied to\n   further improve handover performance by reducing the packet
    loss\n   during handover.  This mechanism can be used in the nationwide\n   university
    Wireless LAN based MIP6 network deployment to support VoIP\n   and Video Telephony.\n\t
