abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths at
    the end-\n   systems typically provided through different IP addresses obtained
    by\n   different ISPs.  While this scenario is certainly becoming\n   increasingly
    a reality (e.g. mobile devices), currently most end-\n   systems are single-homed
    (e.g. residential broadband customers).\n   This memo describes mechanisms to
    make multiple paths available to\n   multipath TCP via autoconfiguration that
    are not available at the\n   end-systems but somewhere within the network.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
