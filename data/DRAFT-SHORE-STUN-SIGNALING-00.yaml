abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   STUN has proven to be a popular mechanism for providing basic
    NAT\n   traversal capabilities for UDP traffic.  As it has matured it has\n   become
    an attractive target for extensions that move away from STUN's\n   discovery function
    towards explicit communication with middleboxes --\n   in other words, as an on-path
    signaling protocol.  This document\n   describes a more generalized framework
    for using STUN for solving on-\n   path signaling problems.\n\t </p>\n      "
