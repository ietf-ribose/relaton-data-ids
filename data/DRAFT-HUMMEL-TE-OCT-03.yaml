abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes to engineer traffic such that we can speak
    of an\nOrchestrally Conducted Traffic (OCT): Any traffic stream (given by\nits
    source and destination nodes and by a priority class) may use\nseveral differently
    routed LSPs.  Each, traffic stream ingress\nreports, periodically, the currently
    measured traffic load (in\nbitrate) to a common TE Conductor (TEC) who evaluates
    them as to\nforecast what traffic load change might occur in the immediate time\nahead.
    Accordingly the TEC  computes well synchronized likelihood\nvalues by which to
    take which route/LSP. These values will be such\nthat any traffic stream will
    be served as good as possible, as often\nas possible, while equally ranked traffic
    streams are treated fair,\nhigher ranked streams are prioritized  and  the network
    thruput is\nmaximized. The TEC sends the likelihood values to the respective\ningress
    node, who will  distribute the received packets of the\ntraffic stream to the
    pertaining LSPs accordingly.\n\t </p>\n      "
