abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a secure and highly-efficient augmented\n
    \  password-authenticated key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user\n   remembers
    a low-entropy password and its verifier is registered in\n   the intended server.
    \ In general, the user's password is chosen from\n   a small set of dictionary,
    making the password susceptible to offline\n   dictionary attacks.  The AugPAKE
    protocol described here is secure\n   against passive attacks, active attacks
    and offline dictionary\n   attacks (on the obtained messages with passive/active
    attacks).\n   Also, this protocol provides resistance to server compromise in
    the\n   context that an attacker, who obtained the password verifier from the\n
    \  server, must at least perform offline dictionary attacks to gain any\n   advantage
    in impersonating the user.  The AugPAKE protocol is not\n   only provably secure
    in the random oracle model but also the most\n   efficient over the previous augmented
    PAKE protocols (SRP and AMP).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
