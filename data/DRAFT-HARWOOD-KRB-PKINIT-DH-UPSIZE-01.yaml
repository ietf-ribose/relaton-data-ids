abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos\n
    \  (PKINIT) permits a client and a Kerberos Domain Controller (KDC) to\n   use
    a Diffie-Hellman (DH) exchange to derive an encryption key.  The\n   group with
    minimum modulus size permitted for this exchange is 1024\n   bits, which recent
    security research has shown to provide\n   insufficient protection against organizations
    with sufficient\n   computing resources, such as state-sponsored actors.  This
    document\n   updates RFC 4556 to increase the minimum group size to 2048 bits
    and\n   define permitted groups of size larger than 4096-bits.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
