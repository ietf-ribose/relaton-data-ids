abstract:
- content: "<p>Deterministic elliptic-curve signatures such as deterministic ECDSA
    and EdDSA have gained popularity over randomized ECDSA as their security do not
    depend on a source of high-quality randomness. Recent research has however found
    that implementations of these signature algorithms may be vulnerable to certain
    side-channel and fault injection attacks due to their determinism. One countermeasure
    to such attacks is to add noise to the otherwise deterministic calculation of
    the per-message secret number. This document updates RFC 6979 and RFC 8032 to
    recommend constructions with noise for deployments where side-channel attacks
    and fault injection attacks are a concern.</p>"
