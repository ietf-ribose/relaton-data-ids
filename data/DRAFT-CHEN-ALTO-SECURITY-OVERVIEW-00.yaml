abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides an overview of the security mechanisms
    that\nare probably fit for ALTO. Specifically it discusses those mechanisms\nfor
    authentication, encryption and attack-preventing. The goal\nof this draft is to
    list and analyze the existing security \nmechanisms, and to explore suitable solutions
    to guarantee the \nsecurity of ALTO protocol. This draft is a very early draft
    to \noutline the possible security mechanisms and leaves considerable \ncontents
    and details to be added later.\n\t </p>\n      "
