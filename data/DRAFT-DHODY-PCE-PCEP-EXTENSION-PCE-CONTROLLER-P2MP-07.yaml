abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-\n
    \  Defined Networking (SDN) systems.\n\n   The PCE has been identified as an appropriate
    technology for the\n   determination of the paths of point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
    TE Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs).\n\n   A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC)
    can simplify the processing of\n   a distributed control plane by blending it
    with elements of SDN and\n   without necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus,
    the P2MP LSP can\n   be calculated/set up/initiated and the label-forwarding entries
    can\n   also be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network\n
    \  device along the P2MP path, while leveraging the existing PCE\n   technologies
    as much as possible.\n\n   This document specifies the procedures and Path Computation
    Element\n   Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions for using the PCE as the\n
    \  central controller for provisioning labels along the path of the\n   static
    P2MP LSP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
