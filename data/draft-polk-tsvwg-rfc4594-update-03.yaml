abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes service classes configured with DiffServ and
    identifies how they are used and how to construct them using Differentiated Services
    Code Points (DSCPs), traffic conditioners, Per-Hop Behaviors (PHBs), and Active
    Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms. There is no intrinsic requirement that particular
    DSCPs, traffic conditioners, PHBs, and AQM be used for a certain service class,
    but for consistent behavior under the same network conditions, configuring networks
    as described here is appropriate.</p>"
