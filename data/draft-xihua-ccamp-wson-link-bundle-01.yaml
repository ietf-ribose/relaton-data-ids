abstract:
  content: "\t <t>[RFC4201] provides a link bundle mechanism to improve routingscalability
    by reducing the amount of information that has to behandled by IGP (OSPF and/or
    IS-IS). This reduction is accomplishedby performing information aggregation/abstraction.As
    with any other information aggregation/abstraction, this resultsin losing some
    of important information. In WSON and MRN, this lostinformation is very important
    for the path computation entity tocalculate an accurate path. This document discusses
    somerequirements of link bundle for the new GMPLS networks (e.g., WSONand MRN).
    The draft gives some routing and signaling analysis forthis issue.</p>"
