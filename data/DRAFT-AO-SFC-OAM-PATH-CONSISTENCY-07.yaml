abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service Function Chain (SFC) defines an ordered set of service\n
    \  functions (SFs) to be applied to packets and/or frames and/or flows\n   selected
    as a result of classification.  SFC Operation,\n   Administration and Maintenance
    can monitor the continuity of the SFC,\n   i.e., that all elements of the SFC
    are reachable to each other in the\n   downstream direction.  But SFC OAM must
    support verification that the\n   order of traversing these SFs corresponds to
    the state defined by the\n   SFC control plane or orchestrator, the metric referred
    in this\n   document as the path consistency of the SFC.  This document defines
    a\n   new SFC active OAM method to support SFC consistency check, i.e.\n   verification
    that all elements of the given SFC are being traversed\n   in the expected order.\n\n\t
