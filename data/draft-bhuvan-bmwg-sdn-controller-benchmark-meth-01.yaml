abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the methodologies for benchmarking performance
    of SDN controllers. Terminology related to benchmarking SDN controllers is described
    in the companion terminology document. SDN controllers have been implemented with
    many varying designs in order to achieve their intended network functionality.
    Hence, the authors have taken the approach of considering an SDN controller as
    a black box, defining the methodology in a manner that is agnostic to protocols
    and network services supported by controllers. The intent of this document is
    to provide a standard mechanism to measure the performance of all controller implementations.</p>"
