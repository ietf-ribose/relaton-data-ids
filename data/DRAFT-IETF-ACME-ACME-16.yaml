abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX) certificates are used
    for a\n   number of purposes, the most significant of which is the\n   authentication
    of domain names.  Thus, certification authorities\n   (CAs) in the Web PKI are
    trusted to verify that an applicant for a\n   certificate legitimately represents
    the domain name(s) in the\n   certificate.  Today, this verification is done through
    a collection\n   of ad hoc mechanisms.  This document describes a protocol that
    a CA\n   and an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and\n
    \  certificate issuance.  The protocol also provides facilities for\n   other
    certificate management functions, such as certificate\n   revocation.\n\n   RFC
