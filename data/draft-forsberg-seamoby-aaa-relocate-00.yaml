abstract:
- content: "<p>Network access authentication and authorization is used for providing
    unabused access to users and for billing and accounting purposes. AAA has been
    proposed as an infrastructure that could provide such support. With AAA, an access
    router can be configured with packet filtering rules to allow controlled access.</p>"
