abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949) is
    a data\n   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small\n
    \  code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the\n   need
    for version negotiation.\n\n   CBOR does not provide any forms of data compression.
    \ CBOR data\n   items, in particular when generated from legacy data models often\n
    \  allow considerable gains in compactness when applying data\n   compression.
    \ While traditional data compression techniques such as\n   DEFLATE (RFC 1951)
    can work well for CBOR encoded data items, their\n   disadvantage is that the
    receiver needs to unpack the compressed form\n   to make use of data.\n\n   This
    specification describes Packed CBOR, a simple transformation of\n   a CBOR data
    item into another CBOR data item that is almost as easy\n   to consume as the
    original CBOR data item.  A separate decompression\n   step is therefore often
    not required at the receiver.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
