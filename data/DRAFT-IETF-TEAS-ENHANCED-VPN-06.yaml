abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the framework for Enhanced Virtual
    Private\n   Network (VPN+) service.  The purpose is to support the needs of new\n
    \  applications, particularly applications that are associated with 5G\n   services,
    by utilizing an approach that is based on existing VPN and\n   Traffic Engineering
    (TE) technologies and adds features that specific\n   services require over and
    above traditional VPNs.\n\n   Typically, VPN+ will be used to form the underpinning
    of network\n   slicing, but could also be of use in its own right providing enhanced\n
    \  connectivity services between customer sites.\n\n   It is envisaged that enhanced
    VPNs will be delivered using a\n   combination of existing, modified, and new
    networking technologies.\n   This document provides an overview of relevant technologies
    and\n   identifies some areas for potential new work.\n\n   Comparing to traditional
    VPNs, It is not envisaged that quite large\n   numbers of VPN+ services will be
    deployed in a network.  In other\n   word, it is not intended that all existing
    VPNs supported by a\n   network will use VPN+ related techniques.\n\n\t </p>\n
