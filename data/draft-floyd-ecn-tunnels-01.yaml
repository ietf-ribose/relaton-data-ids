abstract:
  content: "<p>The encapsulation of IP packet headers in tunnels is used in manyplaces,
    including IPsec and IP in IP [RFC2003]. Explicit CongestionNotification (ECN)
    is an experimental addition to the IP architecturethat uses the ECN field in the
    IP header to provide an indication ofthe onset of congestion to applications.
    ECN provides thiscongestion indication to enable end-node adaptation to networkconditions
    without the use of dropped packets [RFC 2481]. Currently,the ECN specification
    does not accommodate the constraints imposed bywith some of these pre-existing
    specifications for tunnels. Thisdocument considers issues related to interactions
    between ECN and IPtunnels, and proposes two alternative solutions.</p>"
