    Streaming technology is designed and gradually\nplays an important role in recent

    a series of\ntechnical specifications to define streaming over HTTP.  Moreover,\nseveral
    companies have devoted to developing private HTTP-based media\ndelivery platform
    to provide high quality, adaptive viewing\nexperience to customers.  Following
    a brief survey of existing HTTP\nstreaming standards and implementations, this
    document gives a brief\nsummary on these related work, analyzes the potential
    challenges\nespecially from the network point of view, and lists the gap between\nexisting
