abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format\n(IDMEF)
    is to define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing\ninformation of
    interest to intrusion detection and response systems,\nand to the management systems
    which may need to interact with them.\nThe goals and requirements of the IDMEF
    are described in [2].\nTwo implementations of the IDMEF data format have been
    proposed: one\nusing the Structure of Management Information (SMI) to describe
    a\nMIB, and the other using a Document Type Definition (DTD) to describe\nXML
    documents.  Both representations appear to have their good and\nbad traits, and
    deciding between them is difficult.\nTo arrive at an informed decision, the working
    group tasked the\nauthors to identify and analyze the pros and cons of both approaches,\nand
    to present the results in the form of an Internet-Draft.\nThe initial version
    of this draft was reviewed by the IDWG at the\nFebruary, 2000 interim meeting
    where it was tentatively decided that\nthe XML/DTD solution was best at fulfilling
    the IDWG requirements.\nThis decision was finalized at the March, 2000 IETF IDWG
    meeting.\n\t </p>\n      "
