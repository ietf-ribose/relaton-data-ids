abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes and describes a new IP multicast routing\nprotocol,
    called 'Hierarchical Level-based IP Multicast' (HLIM). It\nis designed for a hierarchical
    IP network and leverages the\nhierarchical structure to provide efficient IP multicasting.
    It is\noriginally designed for tactical networks in battlefields but some of\nits
    functions could be applied to commercial networks as well.\n\t </p>\n      "
