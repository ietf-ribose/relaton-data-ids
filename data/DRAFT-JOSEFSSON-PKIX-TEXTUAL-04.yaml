abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes and discuss the text encodings of Public-Key\n
    \  Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates, PKIX Certificate\n   Revocation
    Lists (CRLs), PKCS #10 Certification Request Syntax, PKCS\n   #7 structures, Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS), PKCS #8 Private-\n   Key Information Syntax, and Attribute
    Certificates.  The text\n   encodings are well-known, are implemented by several
    applications and\n   libraries, and are widely deployed.  This document is intended
    to\n   articulate the de-facto rules that existing implementations operate\n   by,
    and to give recommendations that will promote interoperability\n   going forward.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
