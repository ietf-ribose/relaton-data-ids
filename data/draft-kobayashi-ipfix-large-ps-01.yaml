abstract:
- content: "<p>Flow measurement techniques have been developed in order to cope with
    increasing bandwiths. Flow measurement is currently being used as a popular method
    for monitoring large networks, e.g. at Internet Service Providers or multinational
    corporations, for accounting, management, and security purposes. To construct
    the measurement system for such networks, the biggest challenge is scalability.
    Whereas packet sampling functions in current flow measurement solutions such as
    NetFlow/sFlow/IPFIX help to approach this issue, some problems still remain. This
    document describes such open issues, which a flow-based measurement system might
    encounter in large-scale networks. The results are intended to be used to define
    and to develop an IPFIX Mediator device.</p>"
