abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a hybrid naming scheme for unifying all
    kinds\n   of information including resources, services and data. With many\n   proposals
    of novel network architectures emerging, such as DONA, ICN\n   NDN, the location-based
    routing starts to transfer to the content-\n   based ones. Currently, it is incompatible
    that many different\n   information naming schemes are adopted in  different network\n
    \  proposals, respectively, i.e. flat names in DONA, hierarchical names\n   in
    NDN. The proposed naming scheme adopts a hybrid naming structure,\n   which includes
    hierarchical component, flat component and attribute\n   component. The hybrid
    naming (hn) scheme enables to identify\n   different routing information uniformly,
    and provides many great\n   advantages, such as high aggregation, limited length,
    suffix holes\n   remission, fuzzy matching support, high security and good\n   compatibility
    with IPv4/IPv6, DONA, CCN/NDN and so on.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
