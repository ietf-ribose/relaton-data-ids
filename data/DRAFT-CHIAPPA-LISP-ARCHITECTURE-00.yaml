abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   LISP upgrades the architecture of the IPvN internetworking
    system by\n   separating location and identity, current intermingled in IPvN\n
    \  addresses.  This is a change which has been identified by the IRTF as\n   a
    critically necessary evolutionary architectural step for the\n   Internet.  In
    LISP, nodes have both a 'locator' (a name which says\n   _where_ in the network's
    connectivity structure the node is) and an\n   'identifier' (a name which serves
    only to provide a persistent handle\n   for the node).  A node may have more than
    one locator, or its locator\n   may change over time (e.g. if the node is mobile),
    but it keeps the\n   same identifier.\n\n   One of the chief novelties of LISP,
    compared to other proposals for\n   the separation of location and identity, is
    its approach to deploying\n   this upgrade.  In general, it is comparatively easy
    to conceive of\n   new network designs, but much harder to devise approaches which
    will\n   actually get deployed throughout the global network.  LISP aims to\n
    \  achieve the near-ubiquitous deployment necessary for maximum\n   exploitation
    of an architectural upgrade by i) minimizing the amount\n   of change needed (existing
    hosts and routers can operate unmodified);\n   and ii) by providing significant
    benefits to early adopters.\n\n   This document gives additional architectural
    insight into LISP, and\n   analyzes a number of aspects of LISP from a long-term
    perspective.\n\n   NOTE: This is an initial rough draft, a much better version
    will be\n   out shortly.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
