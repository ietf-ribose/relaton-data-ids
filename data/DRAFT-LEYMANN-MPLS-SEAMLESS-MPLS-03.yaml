abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This documents describes an architecture which can be used to
    extend\nMPLS networks to integrate access and aggregation networks into a\nsingle
    MPLS domain (\"Seamless MPLS\").  The Seamless MPLS approach is\nbased on existing
    and well known protocols.  It provides a highly\nflexible and a scalable architecture
    and the possibility to integrate\n100.000 of nodes.  The separation of the service
    and transport plane\nis one of the key elements; Seamless MPLS provides end to
    end service\nindependent transport.  Therefore it removes the need for service\nspecific
    configurations in network transport nodes (without end to\nend transport MPLS,
    some additional services nodes/configurations\nwould be required to glue each
    transport domain).  This draft defines\na routing architecture using existing
    standardized protocols.  It\ndoes not invent any new protocols or defines extensions
    to existing\nprotocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
