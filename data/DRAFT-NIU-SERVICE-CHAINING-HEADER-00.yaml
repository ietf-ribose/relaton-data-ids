abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a service chaining mechanism, which
    is used\n   to indicate the data packets going through multiple Service\n   Processing
    Entities and processed by those Service Processing\n   Entities with preset order.
    This document also provides a new service\n   chaining header encapsulation for
    packets in a service chain. The\n   system can get the information of the next
    Service Processing Entity\n   where the data packet should go by checking the
    service chaining\n   header.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
