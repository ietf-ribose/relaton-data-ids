abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides the ability to classify
    and\n   steer a flow via some network service(s). Some traffic flows require\n
    \  re-classification to a new service chain. This may be, for example,\n   the
    result of further analysis of initial packets, or detection of\n   multiple types
    of media. This document discusses re-classification\n   scenarios in SFC, and
    several deployment models for the re-classifier\n   and relevant analysis are
    provided. The proposal will recommend some\n   architectural constraints for the
    SFC design.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
