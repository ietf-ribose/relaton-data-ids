abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides a method for protecting a router's control plane
    from undesired or malicious traffic. In this approach, all legitimate router control
    plane traffic is identified. Once legitimate traffic has been identified, a filter
    is deployed in the router's forwarding plane. That filter prevents traffic not
    specifically identified as legitimate from reaching the router's control plane,
    or rate-limits such traffic to an acceptable level. Note that the filters described
    in this memo are applied only to traffic that is destined for the router, and
    not to all traffic that is passing through the router. This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
