abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft proposes a solution for Basic Network Support. Itproposes
    Mobile IPv6 extensions as advocated by the NEMO workinggroup. Our solution differs
    from Prefix Scope Binding Update (PSBU)which was originally proposed before the
    NEMO working group was setup. Our draft however uses mechanisms similar to those
    of PSBU, suchas 'Prefix binding' and 'Searching mechanism of prefix binding'.The
    main difference relies on the management of the permanent addressof the MR, which
    is assigned to the ingress interface, and not to theegress interface.</p>"
