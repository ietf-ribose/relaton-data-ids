abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a Generalized Object Encoding (GOE)
    approach\n   for the protection of one or multiple objects, using one or several\n
    \  FEC schemes, in the context of a Content Delivery Protocol (CDP) like\n   FLUTE/ALC,
    FCAST/ALC or FCAST/NORM.  In RFC5052, the encoding process\n   is determined by
    the object (e.g., file) boundaries, i.e., the same\n   code is applied to the
    whole object that has been submitted to the\n   CDP by the user.  The GOE approach
    instead decouples the definition\n   of source blocks that are FEC encoded from
    the natural object\n   boundaries.  More precisely, either different portions
    of a given\n   object can be protected with different FEC codes (i.e., portions
    of\n   different nature and/or with different code rates), with a possible\n   overlapping,
    or at the opposite, different consecutive objects can be\n   protected globally
    through a single FEC encoding.  If a GOE FEC\n   Scheme defines how to create
    and process repair packets using the GOE\n   approach, source objects must be
    encoded with a standard No-Code FEC\n   Scheme.  Therefore the same flow of source
    packets can be shared by\n   different flows of repair packets, using different
    systematic GOE FEC\n   schemes.  An additional benefit is that the GOE approach
    is backward\n   compliant since the source packets can be processed by receivers
    that\n   do not support any GOE FEC scheme by simply discarding the repair\n   packets.
    \ The present document first of all introduces the GOE\n   approach.  It then
    defines the GOE Reed-Solomon FEC Scheme for the\n   particular case of Reed-Solomon
    codes over GF(2^^8) and no encoding\n   symbol group, the GOE equivalent to FEC
    Encoding ID 5 defined in\n   RFC5510.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
