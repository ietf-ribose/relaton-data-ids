abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a method of algorithmic load balancing for IPv6
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) traffic. It enables multiple, cooperating
    servers to decide which one should service a client, without exchanging any information
    beyond initial configuration. The server selection is based on the servers hashing
    client DHCP Unique Identifiers (DUIDs) when multiple DHCPv6 (DHCPv6) servers are
    available to service DHCPv6 clients. The proposed technique provides for efficient
    server selection when multiple DHCPv6 servers offer services on a network without
    requiring any changes to existing DHCPv6 clients. The same method is proposed
    to select the target server of a DHCPv6 relay.</p>"
