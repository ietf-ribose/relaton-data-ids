abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RFC6844] defines the Certification Authority Authorization
    (CAA) DNS\n   Resource Record type to specify one or more Certification Authorities\n
    \  (CAs) authorized to issue certificates for that domain name.  With\n   large
    domains covering multiple web properties, defining all possible\n   certificate
    authorities for the domain has security implications.  It\n   would be beneficial
    to define a CAA for individual host names.  This\n   will allow CAA records that
    can be managed with fine grain control.\n\n   This document provides an alternative
    CAA record using a _caa prefix\n   label that will take precedent on a per Fully
    Qualified Domain Name\n   (FQDN), if it exists.  It will override any CAA record
    at the zone\n   apex.  This will not change current CAA record behavior, but will
    be\n   an additional option.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
