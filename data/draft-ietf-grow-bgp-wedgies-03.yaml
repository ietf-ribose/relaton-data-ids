abstract:
- content: <p>It has commonly been assumed that the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
    is a tool for distributing reachability information in a manner that creates forwarding
    paths in a deterministic manner. In this memo we will describe a class of BGP
    configurations for which there is more than one potential outcome, and where forwarding
    states other than the intended state are equally stable. Also, the stable state
    where BGP converges may be selected by BGP in a non-deterministic manner. These
    stable, but unintended, BGP states are termed here "BGP Wedgies". This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>
