abstract:
  content: "<p>CoAP has been standardised as an application-level REST-based protocol.
    When multiple transport protocols exist for exchanging CoAP resource representations,
    this document introduces a way forward for CoAP endpoints as well as intermediaries
    to agree upon alternate transport and protocol configurations as well as URIs
    for CoAP messaging. Several mechanisms are proposed: Extending the CoRE Resource
    Directory with new parameter types, introducing a new CoAP Option with which clients
    can interact directly with servers without needing the Resource Directory, and
    finally a new CoRE Link Attribute allowing exposing alternate locations on a per-resource
    basis.</p>"
