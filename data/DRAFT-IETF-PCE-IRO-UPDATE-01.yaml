abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   During discussions of a document to provide a standard representation\n
    \  and encoding of Domain-Sequence within the Path Computation Element\n   (PCE)
    communication Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path\n   Computation
    Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between two PCEs.  It was\n   determined that there
    was a need for clarification with respect to\n   the ordered nature of the Include
    Route Object (IRO).\n\n   An informal survey was conducted to determine the state
    of current\n   and planned implementation with respect to IRO ordering and handling\n
    \  of Loose bit (L bit).\n\n   This document updates the IRO specification based
    on the survey\n   conclusion and recommendation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
