abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Although BGP implementations have extensive path selection\nalgorithms,
    in practice operators have trouble performing\nsatisfactory traffic engineering
    of incoming traffic based on BGP\nattributes that are taken into account in the
    path selection\nalgorithm alone.  For this reason, many ASes deaggregate their\naddress
    range(s) into smaller blocks and announce these blocks\ndifferently to different
    neighboring ASes in order to arrive at the\ndesired traffic flow.  This practice
    contributes to the growth of the\nglobal routing table, which drives up capital
    expenditures for\nnetworks engaging in inter-domain routing.  This memo introduces
    a\nnew inter-domain metric that supports finer-grained traffic\nengineering than
    current BGP attributes.\n\t </p>\n      "
