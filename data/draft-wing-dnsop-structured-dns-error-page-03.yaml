abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS filtering is widely deployed for network security, but filtered
    DNS responses lack information for the end user to understand the reason for the
    filtering. Existing mechanisms to provide detail to end users cause harm especially
    if the blocked DNS response is to an HTTPS website. This document updates RFC8914's
    EXTRA-TEXT field to provide information on DNS filtering. This information can
    be parsed by the client and displayed, logged, or used for other purposes.</p>"
