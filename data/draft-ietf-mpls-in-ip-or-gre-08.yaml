abstract:
  content: "<p>Various applications of MPLS make use of label stacks with multiple
    entries. In some cases, it is possible to replace the top label of the stack with
    an IP-based encapsulation, thereby enabling the application to run over networks
    that do not have MPLS enabled in their core routers. This document specifies two
    IP-based encapsulations: MPLS-in-IP and MPLS-in-GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation).
    Each of these is applicable in some circumstances. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
