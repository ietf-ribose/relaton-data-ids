abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).The
    overall description of protocol and the underlying architecturalthinking is available
    in the separate HIP architecture specification.The Host Identity Protocol is used
    to establish a rapidauthentication between two hosts and to provide continuity
    ofcommunications between those hosts independent of the networkinglayer.The various
    forms of the Host Identity (HI), Host Identity Tag (HIT),and Local Scope Identifier
    (LSI), are covered in detail. It isdescribed how they are used to support authentication
    and theestablishment of keying material, which is then used by IPsecEncapsulated
    Security payload (ESP) to establish a two-way securedcommunication channel between
    the hosts. The basic state machine forHIP provides a HIP compliant host with the
    resiliency to avoid manydenial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The basic HIP exchange
    for twopublic hosts shows the actual packet flow. Other HIP exchanges,including
    those that work across NATs are covered elsewhere.</p>"
