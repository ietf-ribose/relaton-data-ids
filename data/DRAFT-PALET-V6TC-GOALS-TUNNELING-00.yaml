abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes the set of goals for a tunneling setup
    protocol\n   that could be used in several network cases to jumpstart its IPv6\n
    \  offering to its customers by providing them IPv6 connectivity through\n   a
    simplistic tunneling mechanism.\n\n   The basic network cases, which may have
    different sets of goals, are\n   also introduced, including 3GPP and other Service
    Providers.  Two\n   cases are analyzed in the Service Provider scenario, one which
    apply\n   to simplistic mechanism where the user is already authenticated by\n
    \  other network existing means, and another which also takes care of\n   the
    user authentication.\n\t </p>\n      "
