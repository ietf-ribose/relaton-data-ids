abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces extensions to Mobile IPv6 [1] and Nemo Basic
    Support [2] that allow nodes to bind one or more flows to a care-of address. These
    extensions allow multihomed nodes to take full advantage of the different properties
    associated with each of their interfaces.</p>"
