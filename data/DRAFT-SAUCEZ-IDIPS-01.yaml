abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a simple network-based protocol to facilitate\nPath
    Selection and to improve traffic engineering capabilities in\nmultihomed corporate
    networks.  With the protocol, any network device\nthat requires to select a path
    among a list of different paths asks a\nTraffic Engineering service called IDIPS
    (ISP-Driven Informed Path\nSelection) to obtain an ordered list of the possible
    paths.  The\nordering is constructed according to the policies and performances\nrequirements
    of both the host and network provider.\n\t </p>\n      "
