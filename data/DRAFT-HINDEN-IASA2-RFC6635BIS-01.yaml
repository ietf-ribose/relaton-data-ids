abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The RFC Editor model described in this document divides the\n
    \  responsibilities for the RFC Series into three functions: the RFC\n   Series
    Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher.\n   Internet Architecture
    Board (IAB) oversight via the RFC Series\n   Oversight Committee (RSOC) is described,
    as is the relationship\n   between the IETF Administration Limited Liability Corporation
    Board\n   and the RSOC.  This document reflects the experience gained with \"RFC\n
    \  Editor Model (Version 1)\", documented in RFC 5620; and obsoletes RFC\n   6635
    to replace all references to the IASA and related structures\n   with those defined
    by the IASA 2.0 Model.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
