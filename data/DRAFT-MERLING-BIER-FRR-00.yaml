abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BIER is a scalable multicast overlay [RFC8279] that utilizes
    some\n   routing underlay, e.g., IP, to build up its Bit Index Forwarding\n   Tables
    (BIFTs).  This document proposes a Fast Reroute Extension for\n   BIER (BIER-FRR).
    \ In case of a link or node failure, the routing\n   underlay may first utilize
    FRR techniques to restore connectivity and\n   then its forwarding tables converge.
    \ After that, BIER can update its\n   BIFTs, which requires time.  BIER packets
    may not be delivered until\n   the last procedure has finished.  With BIER-FRR,
    a BIER Forwarding\n   Router (BFR) can deliver BIER packets again after a link
    or node\n   failures as soon as the connectivity within the routing underlay is\n
    \  restored and the BFR is informed about a next-hop (NH) that is\n   unreachable
    on a lower layer.  BIER-FRR provides a mode for link\n   protection and node protection.
    \ For link protection, it tunnels\n   traffic to the next-hop using the underlying
    routing.  For node\n   protection, it forwards BIER packets to their specific
    next-hop and\n   next-next-hops using tunnels in the underlying routing after
    applying\n   a suitable backup bitmask to the bitstring in the BIER header of
    each\n   packet.  This procedure prevents duplicates.  If topology allows,\n   BIER-FRR
    achieves full protection against any single component\n   failure.  For link protection,
    BIER-FRR requires only a minor change\n   to the forwarding logic.  For node protection,
    BIER-FRR also requires\n   backup entries in the BIFT.\n\n   This document describes
    the concept and operating principles of BIER-\n   FRR.  It defines the necessary
    modifications to the BIER forwarding\n   Procedure and the BIFT, and explains
    how backup entries are computed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
