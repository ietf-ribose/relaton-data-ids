abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a Split Network Virtualization Edge (Split-NVE) architecture,
    the\n   functions of the NVE (Network Virtualization Edge) are split across a\n
    \  server and an external network equipment which is called an external\n   NVE.
    \ The server-resident control plane functionality resides in\n   control software,
    which may be part of hypervisor or container\n   management software; for simplicity,
    this document refers to the\n   hypervisor as the location of this software.\n\n
    \  Control plane protocol(s) between a hypervisor and its associated\n   external
    NVE(s) are used by the hypervisor to distribute its virtual\n   machine networking
    state to the external NVE(s) for further handling.\n   This document illustrates
    the functionality required by this type of\n   control plane signaling protocol
    and outlines the high level\n   requirements. Virtual machine states as well as
    state transitioning\n   are summarized to help clarify the protocol requirements.\n\n\n\n\t
