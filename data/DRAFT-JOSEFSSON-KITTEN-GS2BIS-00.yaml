abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to use a Generic Security Service\n
    \  Application Program Interface (GSS-API) mechanism in the Simple\n   Authentication
    and Security Layer (SASL) framework.  This is done by\n   defining a new SASL
    mechanism family, called GS2.  This mechanism\n   family offers a number of improvements
    over the previous \"SASL/\n   GSSAPI\" mechanism: it is more general, uses fewer
    messages for the\n   authentication phase in some cases, and supports negotiable
    use of\n   channel binding.  This is an update of RFC 5801 that relaxes the\n
    \  requirement for channel binding support and mutual authentication in\n   the
    underlying GSS-API mechanism.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
