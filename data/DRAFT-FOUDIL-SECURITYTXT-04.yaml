abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When security risks are discovered by independent security\n
    \  researchers, they often lack the channels to disclose them properly.\n   As
    a result, security issues may be left unreported.  This document\n   defines a
    standard (\"security.txt\") to help organizations describe\n   the process for
    security researchers to follow in order to disclose\n   security vulnerabilities
    securely.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
