abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft discusses some BGP features for ASN migration that,
    while\n   commonly used, are not formally part of the BGP4 protocol\n   specification
    and may be vendor-specific in exact implementation.  It\n   is necessary to document
    these de facto standards to ensure that they\n   are properly supported in future
    BGP protocol work such as BGPSec.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
