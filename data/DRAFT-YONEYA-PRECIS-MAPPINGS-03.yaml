abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Preparation and comparison of internationalized strings (\"precis\")\n
    \  framework [I-D.ietf-precis-framework] is defining several classes of\n   strings
    for preparation and comparison.  In the document, case\n   mapping is defined
    because many of protocols handle case sensitive or\n   case insensitive string
    comparison and therefore preparation of\n   string is mandatory.  As described
    in IDNA mapping [RFC5895] and\n   precis problem statement [I-D.ietf-precis-problem-statement],\n
    \  mappings in internationalized strings are not limited to case, but\n   also
    width, delimiters and/or other specials are taken into\n   consideration.  This
    document is a guideline for authors of protocol\n   profiles of precis framework
    and describes the mappings that must be\n   considered between receiving user
    input and passing permitted code\n   points to internationalized protocols.\n\n\t
