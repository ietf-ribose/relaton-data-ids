abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the INFO usage examples for network based
    \nmid-call service. Mid-call based services are for example, Call \nTransfer,
    Call Waiting, and Three-Way Calling. Other possible mid-\ncall services are useful
    and important, even more in IP multimedia \nnetwork. The cases described in SIP
    service examples (draft-ietf-\nsipping-service-examples-05) are Terminal-basis.
    Since the service \nprocedures are fixed in the Terminal, the features are not
    extensible. \nThis document propose network-based mid-call control mechanism with
    \nINFO and show examples that simple mid-call request (INFO) from the \nTerminal,
    the network application server provide various mid-call \nservices by prompting
    user through the Media Server, according to the \nsubscription information of
    the user. \n                   \n\t </p>\n      "
