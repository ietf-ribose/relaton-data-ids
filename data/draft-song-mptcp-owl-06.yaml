abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the use of One Way Latency (OWL) for enhancing
    multipath TCP (MPTCP). Several usages of OWL, such as retransmission policy and
    crucial data scheduling are analyzed. Two kinds of OWL measurement approaches
    are also provided and compared. More explorations related with OWL will be contribute
    to the performance of MPTCP.</p>"
