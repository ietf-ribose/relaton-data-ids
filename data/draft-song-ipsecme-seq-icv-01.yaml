abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an IPsec AH and ESP sequence number validation
    scheme, which is complementary to the existing ICV mechanism and anti-replay mechanism
    of AH and ESP in defense against DOS attack. It is an optional feature negotiable
    through IKE, for this feature to be negotiated, both sender and receiver must
    implement it. If any party doesn't support it, then this feature should be excluded
    from negotiation. The rationale for such a scheme is discussed first; then requirements
    and guidelines for design of the scheme are laid out. There can be various ways
    to implement the scheme, some reference designs are discussed to set the base
    for effort of identifying best practice and eventually establishing a standard
    on the subject.</p>"
