abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The number of mobile users and their traffic demand is expected
    to be\n   ever-increasing in future years, and this growth can represent a\n   limitation
    for deploying current mobility management schemes that are\n   intrinsically centralized,
    e.g., Mobile IPv6 and Proxy MIPv6.  This\n   evolution in user traffic demand
    is tackled by a different approach\n   for IP mobility, called Distributed Mobility
    Management, which is\n   focusing on moving the mobility anchors from the core
    network and\n   pushing them closer to the users, at the edge of the network.\n\n
    \  The work presented here copes with the distributed approach,\n   describing
    a novel solution for distributed mobility management\n   support in a flat architecture
    without central mobility anchors.\n   This document strictly abides by the two
    principles:\n\n   (a)The movement of MN is transparent to CN.\n\n   (b)MN doesn't
    participate in any mobility-related signaling.MAAR and\n   AAA are responsible
    for managing IP mobility on behalf of the host.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
