abstract:
- content: <p>This document introduces a new way to provide returned location information
    in LoST responses that is either of a completed or similar form to the original
    input civic location, based on whether a valid or invalid location is returned
    within the findServiceResponse message. This document defines a new extension
    to the findServiceResponse message within the LoST protocol [RFC5222] that enables
    the LoST protocol to return a completed civic location element set for a valid
    response, and one or more suggested sets of civic location information for invalid
    LoST responses. These two types of civic addresses are referred to as either "complete"
    or "similar" locations, and are included as compilation of ca type xml elements
    within the existing response message structure.</p>
