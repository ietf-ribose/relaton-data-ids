abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability to compute constrained shortest Traffic Engineering (TE)
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement.
    This document specifies a procedure for an inter-AS PCE to locate boundary node
    within its domain dynamically, which is used for path computation.</p>"
