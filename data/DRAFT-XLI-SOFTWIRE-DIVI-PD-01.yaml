abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents the address specifications and deployment\n
    \  considerations of address-sharing dual stateless IPv4/IPv6\n   translation
    with prefix delegation (dIVI-pd).  The dIVI-pd keeps the\n   features of stateless,
    end-to-end address transparency and\n   bidirectional-initiated communications
    of the original stateless\n   IPv4/IPv6 translation, while it can utilize the
    IPv4 addresses more\n   effectively.  In addition, it does not require the DNS64
    and ALG, and\n   can be used with prefix delegation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
