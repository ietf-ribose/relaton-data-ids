abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an IP/TCP mechanism where
    network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate congestion
    to the end-points. An ECN-capable receiver will feedback this information to the
    sender. ECN is specified for TCP in such a way that only one feedback signal can
    be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT). Recently new TCP mechanisms like ConEx
    or DCTCP need more accurate feedback information in the case where more than one
    marking is received in one RTT.</p>"
