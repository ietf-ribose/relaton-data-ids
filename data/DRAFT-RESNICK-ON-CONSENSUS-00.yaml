abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work
    through\n   a consensus process, taking into account the different views among\n
    \  IETF participants and coming to (at least rough) consensus on\n   technical
    matters.  In particular, the IETF is supposed not to be run\n   by a \"majority
    rules\" philosophy.  This is why we engage in rituals\n   like \"humming\" instead
    of voting.  However, more and more of our\n   actions are now indistinguishable
    from voting, and quite often we are\n   letting the majority win the day.  This
    document is a collection of\n   thoughts on what rough consensus is, how we have
    gotten away from it,\n   and the things we can do in order to really achieve rough
    consensus.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
