abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TrustChain is a protocol for a networked datastructure, designed
    to\n   act as a trust ledger.  This protocol acts as a decentral alternative\n
    \  to platforms like eBay, Airbnb, and Uber.  It is specifically\n   designed
    to record transactions among strangers without central\n   control, support high
    transaction volumes, be application neutral,\n   and avoid vendor lock-in.  The
    protocol defines recording\n   transactions in an ordered list using an append-only
    datastructure, a\n   new communication overlay, and a horizontally scalable consensus\n
    \  protocol based on checkpoint consensus, called CHECO.  Trustchain has\n   resistance
    to traditional blockchain attacks, such as the 51 percent\n   majority attack.
    \ This is achieved by using a graph-based append-only\n   datastructure combined
    with a personal blockchain for each\n   participant with their own genesis block.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
