abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a long-standing protocol for real-time\n
    \  chatting.  The basic client-server protocol is a very simple\n   text-based
    protocol with no explicit mechanism for introducing or\n   negotiating backwards-incompatible
    extensions.  This memo presents a\n   mechanism for negotiation of such extensions.\n\t
