abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents the main results from a recent Internet\n
    \  routing dynamics measurement and discusses their impact on NSIS\n   protocol
    design.  It also provides an evaluation of the simple, low\n   cost packet TTL
    monitoring route change detection mechanism in the\n   context of different NSIS
    deployment models.\n\t </p>\n      "
