abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS SRV RRs of a domain implicitly specify servers and port
    numbers\n   corresponding to the domain.\n\n   By combining URLs and SRV RRs,
    no port numbers have to be specified\n   explicitly in URLs, even if non-default
    port numbers are used, which\n   makes URLs more concise for port based virtual
    and real hosting,\n   where port based real hosting means that multiple servers
    sharing an\n   IP address are distinguished by port numbers to give service for\n
    \  different URLs, which is the case for port forwarded servers behind\n   NAT
    and servers with realm specific IP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
