abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document outlines a new approach, called NGISec, for end-to-endsecure
    communication system that is compatible with other networkingprotocols. Such a
    solution is needed because IPSec is incompatiblewith network address translation
    (NAT), ICMP, and QoS protocols suchas differentiated services, RSVP, RED, and
    ECN. Most of the proposedsolutions to mitigate or remove the incompatibility problems
    ofIPSec only address a small sub-section of the problems, and proposedsolutions
    have severe drawbacks. By using our proposed approach, onecan achieve end-to-end
    secure communication in LANs, VPNs, andnetwork-to-network connections. This approach
    can be viewed as analternative to IPSec that solves the severe problems faced
    by IPSecand paves the way for simultaneous use of security and QoS services.While
    it is aimed to be an alternative to IPSec, it re-uses criticalcomponents of the
    IPSec infrastructure such as the Internet keyexchange (IKE). An interesting aspect
    of the proposed protocol isthat it also allows the use of SSL/TLS to build VPNs.</p>"
