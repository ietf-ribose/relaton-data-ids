abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a control protocol to setup tunnels between
    a\nclient and a tunnel server or broker.  It provides a framework for\nthe negociation
    of tunnel parameters between the two entities.  It is\na generic TCP protocol
    based on simple XML messaging.  This framework\nprotocol enables the negociation
    of any kind of tunnel, and is\nextensible to support new parameters or extensions.
    \ The first target\napplication is to setup IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels which is one
    of the\ntransition mechanism identified by the ngtrans and ipv6 working\ngroups.
    \ This IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel setup application of the generic\nTSP protocol is
    defined by a profile of the TSP protocol, in a\ncompanion document.\n\t </p>\n
