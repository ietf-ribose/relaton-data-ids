abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes mechanisms for methods for damping the
    \noscillations of BGP-4 [1] peers by increasing the time between \nautomatic start
    functions of the BGP peers.  The increase of time \nbetween automatic start functions
    will be denoted as a backoff of \nthe automatic start functions by this draft.
    \nThis draft is an informational RFC which provides a description of \nmechanisms
    for back-off of the automatic start function in bgp-4 \npeer reconnections. This
    Informational RFC includes descriptions \nabout the back-off mechanisms and how
    this information is recorded \nin the BGP-4 MIB version 2 [2]. \nThe expontential
    back-off mechanism contained in this draft was \nfirst recorded in a draft of
    the bgp-4 specification.  The author \nrequests that anyone with information regarding
    the original authors \nof that work contact the author.  The lack of credit for
    those\nauthors is based on the author's lack of knowledge the originators\nof
    the expotential back-off.\n\t </p>\n      "
