abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo introduces MIN_STREAM_DATA and EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA
    frames\n   to enable partial reliability for QUIC streams.  The\n   EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA
    frame allows a sender to give up on\n   retransmitting older parts of a stream
    and to notify the receiver\n   about this decision.  The MIN_STREAM_DATA frame
    allows a receiver to\n   express its disinterest in older parts of a stream.  The
    content of\n   this draft is intended for merging into QUIC transport, recovery,
    and\n   applicability drafts as a negotiable extension and/or QUIC Version 2\n
    \  transport feature.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
