abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many people have expressed a desire to extract material from
    IETF\n   RFCs for use in documentation, textbooks, on-line help systems, and\n
    \  for similar uses. In addition, some IETF RFCs contain MIBs and other\n   types
    of program code that could be compiled. This document proposes\n   an update to
    RFC RFC3978 to explicitly permit extracting material for\n   a wide range of uses.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
