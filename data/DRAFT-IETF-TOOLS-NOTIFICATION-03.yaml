abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The output of the IETF consists of documents.  The IETF process
    is\n   largely related to changing the status of documents.  Active\n   participation
    in the work of the IETF often consists of writing or\n   editing documents or
    providing input to the process of changing the\n   documents' status.  Passive
    participation often consists of reading\n   documents and observing the changes
    of their status.  This document\n   describes the requirements for an automated
    service that helps the\n   IETF participants to learn about the existence and
    follow the changes\n   of status of any particular document.\n\t </p>\n      "
