abstract:
- content: <p>The query/response transactions of the Domain Name System (DNS) can
    disclose valuable meta-data about the online activities of DNS' users. The DNS
    Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provide object-level security, but do not attempt
    to secure the DNS transaction itself. For example, DNSSEC does not protect against
    information leakage, and only protects DNS data until the last validating recursive
    resolver. Stub resolvers are vulnerable to adversaries in the network between
    themselves and their validating resolver ("the last mile"). This document details
    a new DANE-like DNS Resource Record (RR) type called IPSECA, and explains how
    to use it to bootstrap DNS transactions through informing entries in IPsec Security
    Policy Databases (SPDs) and to subsequently verifying Security Associations (SAs)
    for OE IPsec tunnels.</p>
