abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the issues, possible solutions, and\n
    \  opportunities in Data Center (DC) migration from IPv4 to IPv6.  It\n   focuses
    on the DC infrastructure itself, its operation, and the\n   aspects related to
    DC interconnection through IPv6.  It does not\n   consider the particular mechanisms
    for making Internet services\n   provided by applications hosted in the DC available
    through IPv6\n   beyond the specific aspects related to how their deployed on
    the DC\n   infrastructure.\n\n   Apart from facilitating the migration procedure
    itself, the\n   mechanisms outlined here are intended to make this migration as\n
    \  transparent as possible (if not completely transparent) to\n   applications
    and services running on the DC infrastructure, as well\n   as to take advantage
    of IPv6 features to simplify DC operations,\n   internally and across the Internet.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
