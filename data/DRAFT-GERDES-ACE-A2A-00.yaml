abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Constrained nodes are devices which are limited in terms of\n
    \  processing power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission\n   capacity.
    \ Due to these constraints, commonly used security protocols\n   are not easily
    applicable.  Nevertheless, an authentication and\n   authorization solution is
    needed to ensure the security of these\n   devices.\n\n   During the lifecycle
    of a constrained device, responsibility for\n   managing authorization policies
    for the constrained device may change\n   several times.  To ensure the security
    of the constrained devices,\n   the authorization to authorize must be transferred
    to the new\n   principal in a secure way.\n\n   The Delegated CoAP Authorization
    Framework (DCAF) specifies how\n   resource-constrained nodes can delegate defined
    authentication- and\n   authorization-related tasks to less-constrained devices
    called\n   Authorization Managers, thus limiting the hardware requirements of\n
    \  the security solution for the constrained devices.\n\n   This document defines
    how DCAF can be used to manage the\n   Authorization Manager of a constrained
    device and introduces a\n   flexible authorization solution for the whole lifecycle
    of a\n   constrained device.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
