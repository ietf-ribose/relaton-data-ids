abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Slicing (NS) is an integral part of Service Provider networks.
    The IETF has produced several YANG data models to support the Software-Defined
    Networking and network slice architecture and YANG-based service models for network
    slice (NS) instantiation. This document describes the relationship between IETF
    Network Slice models for requesting the IETF Network Slices and (e.g., Layer-3
    Service Model, Layer-2 Service Model) and Network Models (e.g., Layer-3 Network
    Model, Layer-2 Network Model) used during their realizations. In addition, this
    document describes the communication between the IETF Network Slice Controller
    and the network controllers for the realization of IETF network slices. The IETF
    Network Slice YANG model provides the customer-oriented view of the network slice.
    Thus, once the IETF Network Slice controller (NSC) receives a request, it needs
    to map it to accomplish the specific parameters expected by the network controllers.
    The network models are analyzed to satisfy the IETF Network Slice requirements,
    and the gaps in existing models are reported. The document also provides operational
    and security considerations when deploying network slices in Service Provider
    networks.</p>"
