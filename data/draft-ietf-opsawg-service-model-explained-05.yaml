abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has produced many modules in the YANG modeling language. The
    majority of these modules are used to construct data models to model devices or
    monolithic functions. A small number of YANG modules have been defined to model
    services (for example, the Layer 3 Virtual Private Network Service Model (L3SM)
    produced by the L3SM working group and documented in RFC 8049). This document
    describes service models as used within the IETF and also shows where a service
    model might fit into a software-defined networking architecture. Note that service
    models do not make any assumption of how a service is actually engineered and
    delivered for a customer; details of how network protocols and devices are engineered
    to deliver a service are captured in other modules that are not exposed through
    the interface between the customer and the provider.</p>"
