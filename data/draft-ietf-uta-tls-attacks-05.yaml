abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the last few years, there have been several serious attacks on
    Transport Layer Security (TLS), including attacks on its most commonly used ciphers
    and modes of operation. This document summarizes these attacks, with the goal
    of motivating generic and protocol-specific recommendations on the usage of TLS
    and Datagram TLS (DTLS).</p>"
