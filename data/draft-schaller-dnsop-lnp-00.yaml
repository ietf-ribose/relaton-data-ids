abstract:
- content: "<p>The Local (or Lightweight) Naming Protocol (LNP) is an application-
    level protocol for local area networks. It is a distributed, stateless protocol
    which intents in resolving hostnames to ip addresses without the need of any Domain
    Name Server. In private local area networks, ip addressses are often dynamically
    allocated through DHCP. The LNP can be seen as a DNS extension, which uses broadcast
    udp messages (similar to ARP on IP-MAC-level) to request ip addresses for hosts
    with a given host- or domain-name. Thus it will be possible in dynamic local area
    networks to access ip-based services on hosts by their hostnames, without further
    management. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's
    mailing list at dnsop@ietf.org and/or the author(s).</p>"
