abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes IP-SVC that is another ATM signaling protocol for
    implementing IP protocols. IP-SVC restricts the range of signaling to an IP subnet,
    and this restriction makes the IP-SVC structure simple. IP-SVC provides easy implementation
    of the mechanism of ARP and IP multicasting without any servers. IP-SVC can not
    establish VCs across IP subnet boundaries by itself. However, adapting CSRs (Cell
    Switching Routers) with RSVP (Resource ReSerVation Protocol) enables end-to-end
    VC establishment across IP subnet boundaries in IP/ATM LANs based on IP-SVC. This
    method also shows one solution of RSVP over ATM.</p>"
