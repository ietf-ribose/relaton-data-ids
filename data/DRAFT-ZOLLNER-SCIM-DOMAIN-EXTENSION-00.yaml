abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol\n
    \  supports creation and management of identity resources such as users\n   between
    a client and a service provider.  In some instances, a SCIM\n   service provider
    may maintain a list of DNS domains that an\n   organization using that service
    has registered for their exclusive\n   use with the service.  This registration
    of domains is frequently\n   tied to some form of ownership verification for each
    domain.  This\n   document defines an extension to the SCIM protocol introducing
    a new\n   'VerifiedDomains' resource type in order to allow a SCIM client to\n
    \  confirm what domains have had ownership verified by the SCIM service\n   provider,
    as well as some information about whether the User\n   resource's userName and
    emails attributes require domain verification\n   in order for a value to possess
    that domain suffix.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
