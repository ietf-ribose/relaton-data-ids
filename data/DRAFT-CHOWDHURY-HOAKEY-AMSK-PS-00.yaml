abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network operators offer multiple services ranging from basic
    network\n   access level service to application level service.  Each of these\n
    \  services require independent authentication and authorization steps.\n   Depending
    on the number of services and the scale of these networks,\n   the need for multiple
    levels of authentication and authorization\n   phases not only makes the operation
    complex, but it increases network\n   load and session setup latency.  This document
    summarizes the related\n   problem scenarios.  The goal is to address these problem
    scenarios\n   with a solution based on the EAP keying framework.\n\t </p>\n      "
