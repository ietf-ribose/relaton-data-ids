abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies TRILL active/active edge which allows multiple
    RBridges concurrently forward data frames of the same VLAN on links bundled by
    Link Aggregation. With this kind of connection, end nodes may increase the bandwidth
    and reliability of the access at the edge of TRILL campuses. It's required that
    no loop or duplication is caused by this new connection type. Besides this basic
    requirement, this document outlines other potential issues associated with TRILL
    active/active edge and investigates how these issues may be addressed.</p>"
