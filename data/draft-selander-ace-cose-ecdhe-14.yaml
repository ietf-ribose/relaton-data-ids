abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC),
    a very compact, and lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange with
    ephemeral keys. EDHOC provides mutual authentication, perfect forward secrecy,
    and identity protection. EDHOC is intended for usage in constrained scenarios
    and a main use case is to establish an OSCORE security context. By reusing COSE
    for cryptography, CBOR for encoding, and CoAP for transport, the additional code
    footprint can be kept very low.</p>"
