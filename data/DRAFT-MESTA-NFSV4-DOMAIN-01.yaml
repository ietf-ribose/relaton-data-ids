abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of this document is to elicit discussion on configuration\n
    \  schemes for determining the domain name to be used by NFSv4\n   implementations
    that do not natively support users and groups from\n   multiple domains.\n\n   This
    document also describes a method by which NFSv4 clients and\n   servers can discover
    a domain name value appropriate for qualifying\n   NFSv4 user and group names,
    by leveraging DNS TXT resource records.\n\t </p>\n      "
