abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document introduces an extension to Mobile IPv6 to provide\nsupport
    for Localized Mobility Management. This proposed Hop-by-Hop\nLocal Mobility Agents
    Probing scheme specifies the Local Mobility\nAgents Discovery, Selection and Failure
    Detection architecture and\nprocedures for deploying the localized mobility management,
    whereby\nthe Local Mobility Agents are distributed. It reduces the amount of\nsignalling
    to the home agent and correspondent nodes when mobile node\nmoves among the subnets
    of the visited domain\n\t </p>\n      "
