abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IKEv2 supports mutual authentication of the peers but does not\nsupport
    platform integrity validation of the peers nor does it\nsupport the exchange of
    data related to the platform integrity\nvalidation.  This extension allows platform
    integrity validation\ndata to be exchanged from one peer (initiator) to another\n(respondent),
    allowing the other peer to either use the data for\nstatistical analysis, pass
    it along to a validation entity for\nvalidation or pass it along to a Fraud Information
    Gathering System\nfor fraud detection or analysis.\n\t </p>\n      "
