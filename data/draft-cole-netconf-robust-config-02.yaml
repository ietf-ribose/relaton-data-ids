abstract:
  content: "<p>This document extends the capabilities of the NETCONF configurationmanagement
    protocol in order to standardize mechanisms to performsets of active tests (i.e.,
    verification) against servers' runningconfiguration over a period of time to afford
    the client and server amore robust and resilient configuration management capability.
    Thisis of value to commercial enterprise and public networks as well aswireless
    emergency and military networks. We accomplish this throughthe definition of the
    new verify.yang module. Servers supportingthis module will advertise this capability
    according to the YANGspecification. We also explore the future alternatives fordeveloping
    these capabilities within the context of the existingNETCONF protocol, the YANG
    modeling language and existing relatedIETF, IEEE and ITU-T standards.</p>"
