abstract:
- content: "<p>There are applications that require bi-directional, co-routed and guaranteed
    communication from a root node to several leaf nodes in a hub and spoke fashion.
    To meet such application requirements in a Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    network this draft defines a Hub and Spoke Multipoint Traffic Engineered Label
    Switched Path (HSMP TE LSP) with resource reservations for guaranteed communication.
    This draft also defines a protocol to setup such LSPs by re-using and extending
    P2MP RSVP-TE.</p>"
