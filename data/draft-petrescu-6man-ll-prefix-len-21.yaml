abstract:
- content: <p>A rejected Erratum to RFC4291 "IPv6 Addr Archi" on the topic of link-
    local addresses 'would need' a draft. This draft is an answer to that need. The
    length of the prefix of an IPv6 link-local address is variable. The minimal value
    is 10 decimal. The maximum value is 127 decimal.</p>
