abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Label switched path (LSP) backtrace is a method to backtrack the
    \npaths followed by packets in a particular multi protocol label \nswitching (MPLS)
    forwarding equivalence class (FEC). This document \ndescribes encoding and procedures
    for new label distribution protocol \n(LDP) messages, backtrace message and backtrace
    reply message used \nfor performing LSP backtrace. Backtrace message is sent upstream
    for \nan established LSP. Backtrace message can be used for LDP LSPs as \nwell
    as for constraint based label switched paths (CR-LSPs). Data \nrequested through
    backtrace message is encoded into backtrace reply \nmessage. Backtrace reply message
    is sent in downstream direction. It\nalways travels towards the tail end of an
    LSP. Backtrace mechanism \ndescribed in this document can also be used for obtaining
    additional \nattributes of LSPs.   \n\t </p>\n      "
