abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In an environment where multiple PCEs are responsible for computing\n
    \  paths in a domain, there is a greater possibility of race conditions\n   compared
    to traditional methods. Fast convergence of network state,\n   e.g. TED, LSPs,
    is more important for PCEs. Furthermore, load\n   balancing of computation should
    be considered among these PCEs.\n   \n   This document is not intended to provide
    a detailed description of\n   all the architectural components of the PCE communication
    protocol.\n   Rather, it specifies the Global Computing Table (GCT) along with\n
    \  corresponding mechanisms and procedures to resolve some predictable\n   problems
    in PCEs, especially in situations where multiple PCEs are\n   responsible for
    computing TE LSPs path in a domain. It is hoped that\n   these mechanisms can
    cooperate with the PCE communication protocol to\n   improve the abilities of
    the protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
