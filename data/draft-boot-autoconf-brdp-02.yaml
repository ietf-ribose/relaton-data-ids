abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) may be attached to a fixed infrastructure
    network, like the Internet. This document specifies a mechanism for Border Router
    discovery and utilization in such a subordinate, possibly multi-homed, MANET.
    It provides facilities for choosing preferred Border Router(s) and configuring
    IP address(es) needed for communication between MANET nodes and nodes on the Internet
    via the selected Border Router. Autonomous MANETs do not have Border Routers;
    a self-sufficient Address Autoconfiguration mechanism for Autonomous MANETs is
    defined as well.</p>"
