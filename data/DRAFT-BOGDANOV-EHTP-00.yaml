abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>End-by-Hop Transmission Protocol (EHTP) is the connection-oriented\ntransport
    service for the reliable or unreliable delivery of data\npackets with possible
    violation of a sequence.  It has the own\naddress space compatible with Unified
    Memory Space Protocol (UMSP,\nRFC3018 [5]).  EHTP includes the gateway protocol,
    which supports\nlabels and dynamic resources deallocating.  Networks with non-\noverlapping
    or incompatible addresses space may be united at EHTP\nlayer with end-to-end interaction
    and with preservation of a\ntransparency.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
