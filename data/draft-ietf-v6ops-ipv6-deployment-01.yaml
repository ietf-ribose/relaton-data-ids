abstract:
- content: "<p>Looking globally, IPv6 is growing faster than IPv4. This means that
    the networking industry is selecting IPv6 for the future. This document provides
    an overview of IPv6 transition deployment status and a view on how the transition
    to IPv6 is progressing among network operators and enterprises that are introducing
    IPv6 or have already adopted an IPv6-only solution. It also aims to analyze the
    transition challenges and therefore encourage actions and more investigations
    on some areas that are still under discussion. The overall IPv6 incentives are
    also examined.</p>"
