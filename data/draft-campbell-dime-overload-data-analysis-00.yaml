abstract:
- content: "<p>When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be
    able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to reduce sending
    traffic for some period of time. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for transporting
    overload and load information. While these proposals differ in many ways, they
    share similar data requirements. This document analyzes the data requirements
    of each proposal with a view towards proposing a common set of of Diameter Attribute-Value
    Pairs (AVPs).</p>"
