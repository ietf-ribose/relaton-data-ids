abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document illustrates a way to integrate a new class of
    nodes and\n   links in segment routing to represent networks in an opaque way
    for\n   further extensibility of the link-state protocols that help with\n   segment
    routing.  An instance of the opaque definition would be\n   optical networks that
    are typically transport centric.  In the IP\n   centric network, this will help
    in defining a common control protocol\n   for packet optical integration that
    will include optical paths as\n   opaque 'segments' or sub-paths as an augmentation
    to the defined\n   extensions of segment routing. This opaque option defines a
    general\n   mechanism to allow for future extensibility of segment routing.\n\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
