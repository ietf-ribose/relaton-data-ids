abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the Dynamic Virtual Network Engine (DVNE)\nprotocol.
    \ The DVNE protocol is a signaling protocol between a\nvirtual network node (the
    DVNE Client) and a configuration server\n(the DVNE Mediator).  The DVNE protocol
    is used to authenticate the\nnodes in a Virtual Network and assist them to setup
    and release VPN\nconnections directly among themselves.\n\nA DVNE clients can
    be located anywhere in a private or public\nnetwork, directly connected or behind
    one or more levels of NAT.  The\nDVNE protocol performs client authentication,
    peer discovery, virtual\nnetwork address management, and provides all parameters
    necessary to\nenable the clients setup a secure VPN connection.  The protocol
    does\nnot explicitly setup the VPN connection itself.  It only enables the\nclients
    to be able to directly setup the VPN connection themselves.\n\t </p>\n      "
