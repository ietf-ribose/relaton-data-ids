abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Administrative groups (commonly referred to as \"colors\" or
    \"link\n   colors\") are link attributes that are advertised by link state\n   protocols
    like IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) and\n   OSPF (Open Shortest
    Path First) and used for traffic engineering.\n   These administrative groups
    have initially been defined as a fixed-\n   length 32-bit bitmask.  As networks
    grew and more use-cases were\n   introduced, the 32-bit length was found to be
    constraining and hence\n   extended administrative groups were introduced in the
    link state\n   protocols.  The 32-bit administrative groups are already advertised\n
    \  as link attributes in BGP-LS.  This document introduces extensions to\n   BGP-LS
    (Border Gateway Protocol Link-State) for advertisement of the\n   extended administrative
    groups.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
