abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SYSLOG is the most prevalent mechanism for delivering event\n
    \  notification data off networking devices.  NETCONF is intended to\n   provide
    a standard mechanism for performing configuration operations\n   on networking
    devices.  The two areas will overlap, giving rise to a\n   need for receiving
    notification data over NETCONF.\n\n   This document presents a simple mechanism
    for accessing SYSLOG data\n   over NETCONF, implemented using the existing NETCONF
    RPC\n   infrastructure.\n\t </p>\n      "
