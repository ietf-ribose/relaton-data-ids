abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes our experiences from designing and\n
    \  implementing a large-scale local area network management system using\n   mainly
    NETCONF.  We designed the data models for device\n   configurations and implemented
    NETCONF client to centrally control\n   multiple devices of various vendors.  The
    document provides insight\n   on strong and weak points of current NETCONF approach.
    \ The document\n   also makes some recommendations about NETCONF and future network\n
    \  management protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
