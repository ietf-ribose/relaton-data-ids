abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims at simple, interoperable, and automated PKI management
    operations covering typical use cases of industrial and IoT scenarios. This is
    achieved by profiling the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP), the related Certificate
    Request Message Format (CRMF), and HTTP-based or CoAP-based transfer in a succinct
    but sufficiently detailed and self-contained way. To make secure certificate management
    for simple scenarios and constrained devices as lightweight as possible, only
    the most crucial types of operations and options are specified as mandatory. More
    special and complex use cases are supported as well, by features specified as
    recommended or optional.</p>"
