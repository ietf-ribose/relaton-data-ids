abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Elliptic curves with pairings are useful tools for constructing\n
    \  cryptographic primitives.  In this memo, we specify domain parameters\n   of
    Barreto-Naehrig curves (BN-curves) [8].  The BN-curve is an\n   elliptic curve
    suitable for pairings and allows us to achieve high\n   security and efficiency
    of cryptographic schemes.  This memo\n   specifies domain parameters of four 254-bit
    BN-curves [1] [2] [5]\n   which allow us to obtain efficient implementations.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
