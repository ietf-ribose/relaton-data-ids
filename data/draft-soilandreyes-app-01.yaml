abstract:
- content: <p>This Internet-Draft proposes the Archive and Packaging Pointer system
    with the URI scheme "app". app URIs can be used to consume or reference hypermedia
    resources bundled inside a file archive or a mobile application package, as well
    as to resolve URIs for archive resources within a programmatic framework. This
    URI scheme provides mechanisms to generate a unique base URI to represent the
    root of the archive, so that relative URI references in a bundled resource can
    be resolved within the archive without having to extract the archive content on
    the local file system. An app URI can be used for purposes of isolation (e.g.
    when consuming multiple archives), security constraints (avoiding "climb out"
    from the archive), or for externally identiyfing sub-resources in other hypermedia
    formats.</p>
