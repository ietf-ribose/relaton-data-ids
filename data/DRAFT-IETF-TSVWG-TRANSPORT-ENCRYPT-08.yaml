abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes some implications of applying end-to-end\n
    \  encryption at the transport layer.  It first identifies in-network\n   uses
    of transport layer header information.  Then, it reviews some\n   implications
    of developing end-to-end transport protocols that use\n   encryption to provide
    confidentiality of the transport protocol\n   headers, or that use authentication
    to protect the integrity of\n   transport header information.  Since measurement
    and analysis of the\n   impact of network characteristics on transport protocols
    has been\n   important to the design of current transports, it also considers
    the\n   impact of transport encryption on transport and application\n   evolution.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
