abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification describes how to declare in a CBOR Web Token
    (CWT)\n   that the presenter of the CWT possesses a particular proof-of-\n   possession
    key and how the recipient can cryptographically confirm\n   proof of possession
    of the key by the presenter.  Being able to prove\n   possession of a key is also
    sometimes described as the presenter\n   being a holder-of-key.  This specification
    is a profile of \"Proof-of-\n   Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)\"
    (RFC 7800), but\n   using CBOR and CWTs rather than JSON and JWTs.\n\n\t </p>\n
