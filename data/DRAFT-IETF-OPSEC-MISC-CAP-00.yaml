abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Framework for Operational Security Capabilities [11] outlines
    the\nproposed effort of the IETF OPSEC working group.  This includes\nproducing
    a series of drafts to codify knowledge gained through\noperational experience
    about feature sets that are needed to securely\ndeploy and operate managed network
    elements providing transit\nservices at the data link and IP layers.  Current
    plans include\nseparate capabilities documents for Packet Filtering; Event Logging;\nIn-Band
    and Out-of-Band Management; Configuration and Management\nInterfaces; AAA; and
    Documentation and Assurance.  This document\ndescribes some additional miscellaneous
    capabilities which do not fit\ninto any of these specific catagories, and whose
    descriptions are\nbrief enough that it does not seem appropriate to create a separate\ndocument
    for each.\n\nOperational Security Current Practices [12] lists current operator\npractices
    related to securing networks.  This document lists\nmiscellaneous capabilities
    needed to support those practices.\n\nCapabilities are defined without reference
    to specific technologies.\nThis is done to leave room for deployment of new technologies
    that\nimplement the capability.  Each capability cites the practices it\nsupports.
    \ Current implementations that support the capability may be\ncited.  Special
    considerations are discussed as appropriate listing\noperational and resource
    constraints, limitations of current\nimplementations, tradeoffs, etc.\n\n\n\t
