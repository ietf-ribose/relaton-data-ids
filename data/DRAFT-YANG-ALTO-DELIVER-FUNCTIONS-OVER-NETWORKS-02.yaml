abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the rapid development of internet, massive data are produced.\n
    \  Service providers typically need to deploy services near the edge\n   networks
    to better satisfy user_s demand.  In order to obtain better\n   quality of the
    networks, computing functions and user traffic need to\n   be scheduled properly.
    \ However, it is challenging to efficiently\n   schedule resources among the distributed
    edge servers because of the\n   lack of network information, such as network topology,
    traffic\n   distribution, link delay/bandwidth and utilization/capability of\n
    \  computing servers.  In this standard, we employed the ALTO protocol\n   to
    help deliver functions and schedule traffic at the edge computing\n   platform.
    \ This protocol supplied information of multiple resources\n   for the distributed
    edge computing platform, thus enhancing the\n   efficiency of function delivery
    in edge computing platform.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
