abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides a terminology for benchmarking the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) performance of devices. Methodology related to benchmarking SIP
    devices is described in the companion methodology document. Using these two documents,
    benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different types of devices such as
    SIP Proxy Servers, Registrars and Session Border Controllers. The term "performance"
    in this context means the capacity of the device-under- test (DUT) to process
    SIP messages. Media streams are used only to study how they impact the signaling
    behavior. The intent of the two documents is to provide a normalized set of tests
    that will enable an objective comparison of the capacity of SIP devices. Test
    setup parameters and a methodology is necessary because SIP allows a wide range
    of configuration and operational conditions that can influence performance benchmark
    measurements. A standard terminology and methodology will ensure that benchmarks
    have consistent definition and were obtained following the same procedures.</p>
