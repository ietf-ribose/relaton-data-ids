abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of SIP between the dual mode handset
    (DMH) and the mobility SIP proxy to enable network controlled handovers across
    voice over IP (VoIP) and cellular networks. The mobility SIP proxy has a peering
    relationship with the cellular network. Mobile assisted and network controlled
    handovers require the exchange of cellular radio parameters between the DMH and
    the mobility SIP proxy. The set of cellular related parameters is collectively
    called Session Handover Protocol (SHP). The SHP is a residual protocol of SIP,
    where all of its messages are transported as MIME attachment to SIP messages.
    This document describes the requirements, various SIP message flows for cross-domain
    roaming and bidirectional handovers between VoIP and cellular domains, and detailed
    specification of the residual SHP protocol.</p>"
