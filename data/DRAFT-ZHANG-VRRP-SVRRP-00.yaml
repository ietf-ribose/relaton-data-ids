    Internet-Draft Management Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol October 2009 \n  \n\n
    In this document, we propose a simplified VRRP protocol called the \n Slave Virtual
    Router Redundancy Protocol (SVRRP).The design \n objective of SVRRP is to specify
    an election protocol that \n dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual
    router to one of \n the SVRRP routers on a LAN, which is exactly as same as that
    of VRRP. \n However, SVRRP executions do not exchange signaling packets and need
    \n the assistance of VRRP to perform their functionality appropriately. \n This
    approach can be used to improve the efficiency of VRRP routers \n in certain scenarios.
    \ \n\n Conventions used in this document \n\n The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
