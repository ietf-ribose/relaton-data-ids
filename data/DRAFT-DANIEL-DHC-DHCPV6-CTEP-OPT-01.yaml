abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>For the newly deployed IPv6 networks to interoperate with vastly
    \ \ndeployed IPv4 networks, various transition mechanisms had been \nproposed.
    \ One such mechanism is configured tunnels.  This document \nprovides a mechanism
    by which the DHCPv6 servers can provide \ninformation about the various configured
    tunnel end points to reach \nthe IPv6 nodes which are separated by IPv4 networks.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
