abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This documentation presents a use case of Application-Layer
    Traffic\n   Optimization (ALTO) with the emergence of Network Function\n   Virtualization
    (NFV).  The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization\n   (ALTO) Service provides
    network information (e.g., basic network\n   location structure and preferences
    of network paths) with the goal of\n   modifying network resource consumption
    patterns while maintaining or\n   improving application performance.  The emerging
    NFV, which is\n   currently being in progress in ETSI NFV, leverages standard
    IT\n   virtualisation technology to consolidate many network equipment types\n
    \  onto industry standard high-volume servers, switches, and storage.\n   The
    use case presented in this document discusses the impact of\n   virtualization
    on the ALTO protocol.  An architecture is proposed for\n   the interface between
    NFV MANO and ALTO server.  And possible end\n   point property extention is also
    discussed for such usecase.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
