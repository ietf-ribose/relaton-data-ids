abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The tunnel MTU on 6rd Provider Edge (PE) and Consumer Edge
    (CE)\n   routers is currently recommended to be set to 1480.  This is to avoid\n
    \  IPv4 fragmentation within the tunnel, but requires the tunnel ingress\n   to
    drop any IPv6 packet larger than 1480 bytes and return an ICMPv6\n   Packet Too
    Big (PTB) message.  Concerns for operational issues with\n   both IPv4 and IPv6
    Path MTU Discovery point to the possibility of\n   MTU-related black holes when
    a packet is dropped due to an MTU\n   restriction somewhere in the Internet.  Fortunately,
    the \"Internet\n   cell size\" is 1500 bytes (i.e., the minimum MTU configured
    by the\n   vast majority of links in the Internet) so if the 6rd PE router can\n
    \  set a tunnel MTU of at least 1500 bytes the MTU issues are\n   alleviated.
    \ This document specifies methods that can be employed to\n   support these larger
    sizes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
