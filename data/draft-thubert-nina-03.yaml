abstract:
  content: "<p>The Internet is evolving to become a more ubiquitous network, drivenby
    the low prices of wireless routers and access points and by theusers' requirements
    of connectivity anytime and anywhere. For thatreason, a cloud of nodes connected
    by wireless technology is beingcreated at the edge of the Internet. We refer to
    this cloud as aFringe Stub (FS). It is expected that networking in the FS will
    behighly unmanaged and ad-hoc, but at the same time will need to offerexcellent
    service availability. The NEMO Basic Support protocolcould be used to provide
    global reachability for a mobile accessnetwork within the FS and the Tree-Discovery
    mechanism could be usedto avoid the formation of loops in this highly unmanaged
    structure.Since Internet connectivity in mobile scenarios can be costly,limited
    or unavailable, there is a need to enable local routingbetween the Mobile Routers
    within a portion of the FS. This form oflocal routing is useful for Route Optimization
    (RO) between MobileRouters that are communicating directly in a portion of the
    FS.Network In Node Advertisement (NINA) is the second of a 2-passesrouting protocol;
    a first pass, Tree Discovery, builds a loop-lessstructure -- a tree --, and the
    second pass, NINA, exposes the MobileNetwork Prefixes (MNPs) up the tree. The
    protocol operates as amulti-hop extension of Neighbor Discovery (ND), to populate
    TD-basedtrees with prefixes, and establish routes towards the MNPs down thetree,
    from the root-MR towards the MR that owns the prefix, whereasthe default route
    is oriented towards the root-MR.The NINA protocol introduces a new option in the
    ND NeighborAdvertisement (NA), the Network In Node Option (NINO). An NA withNINO(s)
    is called a NINA (Network In Node Advertisement). NINA isdesigned for a hierarchical
    model, and by using this NA basedapproach it abstracts the embedded network of
    a Mobile Router as ahost to the upper level of network abstraction. With NINA,
    a MobileRouter presents its sub-tree to its parent as an embedded network andhides
    the inner topology and movements.</p>"
