abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IPv6 specification allows packets to contain a Fragment
    Header\n   without the packet being actually fragmented into multiple pieces (we\n
    \  refer to these packets as \"atomic fragments\").  Such packets\n   typically
    result from hosts that have received an ICMPv6 \"Packet Too\n   Big\" error message
    that advertises a \"Next-Hop MTU\" smaller than 1280\n   bytes, and are currently
    processed by some implementations as\n   \"fragmented traffic\".  Thus, by forging
    ICMPv6 \"Packet Too Big\" error\n   messages an attacker can cause hosts to employ
    \"atomic fragments\",\n   and then launch any fragmentation-based attacks against
    such traffic.\n   This document discusses the generation of the aforementioned
    \"atomic\n   fragments\", the corresponding security implications, and formally\n
    \  updates RFC 2460 and RFC 5722 such that fragmentation-based attack\n   vectors
    against traffic employing \"atomic fragments\" are completely\n   eliminated.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
