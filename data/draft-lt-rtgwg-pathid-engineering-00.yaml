abstract:
- content: "<p>With the deployment of centralized control, the traffic scheduling
    can be easier to accomplish with PathID carried in the data plane. A PathID used
    to indicate a flow through a forwarding path which is not the default shortest
    path. It is encapsulated in the packet at the ingress node, carried to indicate
    the forwarding at the transit node and decapsulated at the egress node. This document
    describes how to accomplish flexible forwarding with PathID in traffic scheduling.</p>"
