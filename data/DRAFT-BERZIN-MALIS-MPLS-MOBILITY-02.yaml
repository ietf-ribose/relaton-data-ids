abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a new approach to handling user mobility
    at\nthe network layer in the context of Multi-Protocol Label Switched\nNetworks
    (MPLS).  This approach does not rely on the existing IP\nmobility management protocols
    such as Mobile IP, and is instead based\non the combination of Multi-Protocol
    BGP (MP-BGP) and MPLS.  This\ndocument proposes to introduce new protocol elements
    to MP-BGP to\nachieve Mobility Label distribution at the network control plane
    and\nthe optimal packet delivery to the mobile node by the network\nforwarding
    plane using MPLS.\n\t </p>\n      "
