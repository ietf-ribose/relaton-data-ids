abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests another way of reforming IETF standards process
    by formalizing the mechanism for interoperability reporting, as a way of facilitating
    standards development. It establishes two kinds of reports: a 'Protocol Feature
    Set', which lays out the set of features from IETF specifications that constitute
    a protocol, and a 'Protocol Implementation Report', which is submitted by an individual
    or group to report on implementation and interoperability testing.</p>"
