abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data Centers may be spread across different locations for a\n
    \  particular enterprise. Different locations may mean within the same\n   country
    but across different geographical locations, or outside the\n   country even in
    a different continent. These data centers may be\n   serving the enterprise or
    multiple enterprises / tenants wherein the\n   regular enterprise site may request
    data from a data center site\n   which could be one of the data center sites proximal
    to the\n   enterprise site. Proximity is usually calculated based on a metric\n
    \  that is bandwidth driven or in terms with regard to the number of\n   hops
    to reach that data center site hence bringing into play delay\n   characteristics.
    Assume a topology where the data center sites and\n   the enterprise sites are
    MPLS based L3VPN sites that are being\n   provided connectivity through a Service
    Provider deploying Layer 3\n   VPNs. Given such a topology it is possible that
    replication of data\n   happens across the data centers in a timely manner to
    keep the data\n   active and refreshed across all data center sites. Suitable\n
    \  mechanisms for such replication will come into play for this purpose.\n   Thus
    any of the data centers can cater to the request from a user\n   site.\n\n   It
    is possible that power consumption in each data center may vary\n   according
    to the load on each data center. It would be prudent to\n   introduce a scheme
    where the power metric coupled with other metrics\n   such as bandwidth and delay
    be used by a Provider Edge router in a\n   L3VPN scenario to direct the packets
    or requests from regular user\n   sites to such data centers with the least such
    metric. This is in\n   line with the follow-the-moon strategy of directing requests
    for data\n   and compute to data centers which are power-wise more efficient\n
    \  during the night or during the day. This draft document lays out one\n   such
    proposal.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
