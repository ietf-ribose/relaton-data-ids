abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     In this document we consider and analyze various environments
    for\n     applying Detecting Network Attachment (DNA) schemes. Although DNA\n
    \    schemes are typically run for each interface and a host separately\n     checks
    for link changes on each interface when the host has\n     multiple interfaces,
    DNA schemes in the host must be considered to\n     check the multiple interfaces
    at the same time for a seamless\n     service. In addition, DNA schemes in the
    host must be capable of\n     managing together each DNA scheme on each interface.
    Current DNA\n     schemes only rely on 'Break before Make' L2 technology such
    as\n     802.11. But now and in future, there will be other 'Make before\n     break'
    L2 technologies such as CDMA. In these L2 technologies, DNA\n     schemes must
    be operated differently in order to make use of their\n     characteristics.\n\t
