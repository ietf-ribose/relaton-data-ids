abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a token format for verifying with non-\n
    \  repudiation the sender of and authorization to send information\n   related
    to the originator of personal communications.  A\n   cryptographic signature is
    defined to protect the integrity of the\n   information used to identify the originator
    of a personal\n   communications session toward a terminating entity.  The\n   cryptographic
    signature is defined with the intention that it can\n   confidently verify the
    originating persona even when the signature is\n   sent to the terminating party
    over a potentially unsecure channel.\n   The Persona Assertion Token (PASSporT)
    is particularly useful for\n   many personal communications applications over
    IP networks and other\n   multi-hop interconnection scenarios where the originating
    and\n   terminating parties may not have a direct trusted relationship.\n\n\t
