abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The HTML format for RFCs, described in [I-D.hildebrand-html-rfc]\n
    \  assigns style guidance to an RFC Editor-defined Cascading Style Sheet\n   (CSS).
    \ The embedded, default CSS as included by the RFC Editor is\n   expected to take
    into account accessibility needs and be built along\n   a responsive design model.
    \ This document describes the requirements\n   for the default CSS used by the
    RFC Editor.  The class names are\n   based on the classes defined in draft-hildebrand-html-rfc.\n\n
    \  Discussion of this draft takes place on the rfc-interest mailing list\n   (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org),
    which has its home page at\n   https://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest.\n\n\t
