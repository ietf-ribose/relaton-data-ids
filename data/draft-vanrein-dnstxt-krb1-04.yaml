abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines methods to determine Kerberos realm descriptive
    information for services that are known by their DNS name. Currently, finding
    such information is done through static mappings or educated guessing. DNS can
    make this process more dynamic, provided that DNSSEC is used to ensure authenticity
    of resource records.</p>"
