abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes the separation of service forwarding function\n
    \  and service delivery function abstractions, along with the mechanics\n   of
    NSH encapsulated packet forwarding with such separation, in SFC\n   deployments.\n\n
    \  This separation frees the service functions from making forwarding\n   decisions
    and the necessary control plane integration, thereby\n   keeping the service functions
    simple and focused on service delivery.\n   Further, this separation fully contains
    the forwarding decisions in\n   forwarding functions, thereby allowing implementations
    to enforce\n   integrity of the forwarding state carried in NSH which in turn
    is\n   required for correctly forwarding NSH encapsulated packets.\n\n\t </p>\n
