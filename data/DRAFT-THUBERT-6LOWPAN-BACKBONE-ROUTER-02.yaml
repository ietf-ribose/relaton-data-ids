abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Some LLN subnets are expected to scale up to the thousands of
    nodes\nand hundreds of routers.  This paper proposes an IPv6 version of the\nBackbone
    Router concept that enables such a degree of scalability\nusing a high speed network
    as a backbone to the subnet.\n\t </p>\n      "
