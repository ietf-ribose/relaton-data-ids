abstract:
- content: "<p>A policy architecture and framework is discussed to support NFV and
    Cloud environments, where policies are used to enforce business rules and to specify
    resource constraints in a number of subsystems. This document approaches the policy
    framework and architecture from the perspective of overall orchestration requirements
    for services involving multiple subsystems. The analysis extends beyond compute,
    network, and storage subsystems to also include energy conservation. This document
    also analyses policy scope, global versus local policies, policy actions and translations,
    policy conflict detection and resolution, interactions among policies engines,
    and a hierarchical policy architecture/framework to address the demanding and
    growing requirements of NFV and Cloud environments.</p>"
