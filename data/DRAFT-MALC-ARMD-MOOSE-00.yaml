abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Ethernet does not scale well to large networks.  The flat MAC
    address\nspace, whilst having obvious benefits for the user and administrator,\nis
    the primary cause of this poor scalability; other recent efforts\nto improve upon
    Ethernet's scalability have addressed symptoms,\nrather than this underlying cause.
    \ MOOSE, Multi-level Origin-\nOrganised Scalable Ethernet, is an Ethernet switch
    architecture that\nperforms in-place rewriting of MAC addresses in order to impose
    a\nhierarchy upon the address space without reconfiguration or\nmodification of
    connected devices.  This removes the need for\nswitches to maintain large forwarding
    databases, is of direct use in\nimplementing improved routing, and allows for
    a variety of other\nscalability and security innovations.  MOOSE also includes
    a\nglobally-scalable, distributed and resilient protocol for the\nautomatic assignment
    of addresses to switches, and for detecting and\ncheaply resolving addressing
    conflicts.\n\t </p>\n      "
