abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to include CBOR Web Token (CWT) claims
    in the header parameters of any COSE structure. This functionality helps to facilitate
    applications that wish to make use of CBOR Web Token (CWT) claims in encrypted
    COSE structures and/or COSE structures featuring detached signatures, while having
    some of those claims be available before decryption and/or without inspecting
    the detached payload.</p>"
