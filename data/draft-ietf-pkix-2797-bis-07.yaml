abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the base syntax for CMC, a Certificate Management
    protocol using the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). This protocol addresses
    two immediate needs within the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) community:
    1. The need for an interface to public key certification products and services
    based on CMS and PKCS #10 (Public Key Cryptography Standard), and 2. The need
    for a PKI enrollment protocol for encryption only keys due to algorithm or hardware
    design. CMC also requires the use of the transport document and the requirements
    usage document along with this document for a full definition. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
