abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an IMAP4 extension, which gives an IMAP client
    the ability to quickly resynchronize any previously opened mailbox as part of
    the SELECT command, without the need for server-side state or additional client
    round-trips. This extension also introduces a new response that allows for a more
    compact representation of a list of expunged messages (and always includes the
    Unique Identifiers (UIDs) expunged).</p>"
