abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses a number of differences between the Intermediate
    System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol used to route IP traffic as described
    in RFC 1195 and the protocol as it is deployed today. These differences are discussed
    as a service to those implementing, testing, and deploying the IS-IS Protocol
    to route IP traffic. A companion document describes the differences between the
    protocol described in ISO 10589 and current practice. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
