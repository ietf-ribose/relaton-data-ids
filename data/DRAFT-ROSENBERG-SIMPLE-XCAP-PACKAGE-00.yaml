abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    event\npackage for finding out about changes to documents managed by the\nExtensible
    Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol\n(XCAP). XCAP allows a client
    to manipulate XML documents on a server\nwhich contain configuration information
    for application protocols.\nMultiple clients can potentially access the same document,
    in which\ncase the other clients would like to be notified of a change in the\ndocument
    made by another. This event package allows a client to do\nthat.\n\t </p>\n      "
