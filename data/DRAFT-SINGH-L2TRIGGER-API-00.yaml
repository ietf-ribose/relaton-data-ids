abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To enable seamless L3 handover of a MN from one subnet to other,
    the \nMN or the AR is required to anticipate the identity of the target AR \nprior
    to initiation of the L3 handoff.  To anticipate the identity of \ntarget AR, the
    L3 is required to receive a notification from L2 about \nthe appropriate identity
    of target AP as soon as the L2 handoff is \ndetected.  To further optimize the
    L3 handoff, L3 is also required to \nreceive indications about Link Up and Link
    Down events as soon as \nsuch events are detected by L2. The Link Down event is
    detected by L2 \nas soon as the MN loses connection with current AP. Similarly,
    the \nLink Up event is detected as soon as the MN re-connects with new AP. \nDepending
    upon the nature of access technologies, some of the various \ntriggers can be
    available at MN, AR or both. \n \n\t </p>\n      "
