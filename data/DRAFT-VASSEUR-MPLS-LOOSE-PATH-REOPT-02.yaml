abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The aim of this document is to propose a mechanism for the \nreoptimization
    of MPLS Traffic Engineering loosely routed explicit LSP \npaths. A loosely routed
    explicit LSP path is  a path specified as a \ncombination of strict and loose
    hop(s) that contains at least one loose \nhop and zero or more strict hop(s).
    The path calculation (which implies \nERO expansion) to reach a loose hop is made
    on the previous hop defined \nin the TE LSP path. This draft proposes a mechanism
    that allows: \n- The TE LSP Head-end LSR to trigger a new ERO expansion on every
    \nhop having a next hop defined as a loose hop,   \n- An LSR to signal to the
    TE LSP head-end that a better path exists \nto reach a loose hop (than the current
    path in use). A better path \nis defined as a path with a lower cost, where the
    cost is determined \nby the metric used to compute the path.  \nThis primarily
    applies to inter-area TE LSPs and inter-AS TE LSPs when \nthe path is defined
    as a list of loose hops (generally the loose hops \nare the ABRs/ASBRs) but the
    following mechanism is also applicable to \nany loosely routed explicit path within
    a single routing domain. \n \n\t </p>\n      "
