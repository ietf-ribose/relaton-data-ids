abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains registries\n
    \  to track codepoints used by protocols defined by the IETF and\n   documented
    in RFCs developed on the IETF Stream.\n\n   The Independent Submissions Stream
    is another source of documents\n   that can be published as RFCs.  This stream
    is under the care of the\n   Independent Submissions Editor (ISE).\n\n   This
    document updates RFC 4846 by describing how the current ISE will\n   handle documents
    in the Independent Submissions Stream that request\n   actions from the IANA.
    \ Nothing in this document changes existing\n   IANA registries and their allocation
    policies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
