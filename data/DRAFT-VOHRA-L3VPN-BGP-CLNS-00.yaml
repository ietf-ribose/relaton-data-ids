abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method by which a Service Provider
    may use\n   its packet switched backbone to provide Virtual Private Network\n
    \  services for its ISO/CLNS customers. These customers may be islands\n   of
    ISO/CLNS networks which are part of the Service Provider network\n   itself and
    are interconnected by the Service Provider's IP core. This\n   method reuses the
    2547 style BGP-MPLS VPN model. This document\n   defines an ISO/CLNS VPN address
    family and describes the\n   corresponding ISO/CLNS VPN route distribution mechanism
    using\n   \"Multiprotocol BGP\".\n\t </p>\n      "
