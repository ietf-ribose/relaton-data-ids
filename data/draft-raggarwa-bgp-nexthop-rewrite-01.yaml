abstract:
- content: "<p>A BGP speaker uses the NEXT_HOP attribute or the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute
    to advertise the IP address that should be used as the next hop to the destinations
    listed in the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI). This next hop may
    be rewritten by other BGP speakers when the NLRI is re-advertised. Some applications
    depend on the original BGP next hop. This document proposes a mechanism to preserve
    the original BGP next hop.</p>"
