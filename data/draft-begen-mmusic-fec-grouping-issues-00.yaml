abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) currently supports groupingmedia
    lines. SDP also has semantics defined for grouping theassociated source and Forward
    Error Correction (FEC)-based repairflows. However, the existing specifications
    have strict requirementsthat severely limit the use of the new features that are
    currentlyunder development in the FECFRAME WG. These new features will allowapplications
    to use FEC in a more flexible way but they requirechanges in the current specifications.
    This document provides a listof the required changes and discusses potential approaches
    to makethese changes.</p>"
