abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Technology Adoption and Transition (ITAT) Workshop
    took\n   place on December 4th and 5th of 2013.  The focus of the workshop was\n
    \  on models to facilitate adoption of Internet protocols, with\n   particular
    emphasis at the waist of the hourglass.  This report\n   summarizes contributions
    and discussions.  As the topics were wide\n   ranging, there is no single set
    of recommendations for IETF\n   participants to pursue at this time.  Instead,
    in the classic sense\n   of early research, we note areas that deserve further
    exploration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
