abstract:
  content: "<p>Firewalls are used to get controlled and secure connection betweennetworks,
    e.g. a company's internal network and the Internet. Preferably the firewall is
    the only link between the networks to beable to guarantee a certain level of security.
    The firewall is a critical node in the network and if it would fail the result
    is lost connection between the networks.To ensure reliability and connectivity
    we add redundancy, i.e. anumber of parallel firewalls are installed which will
    act as backupsfor each other.</p>"
