abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a rapidly configurable
    multi-hop \n   wireless network without an infrastructure and originally proposed
    \n   for the military use. In order to make the MANET a more commonly used \n
    \  network in our daily lives, it may be necessary to connect the MANET \n   to
    the global Internet. A MANET node can communicate with an Internet \n   node via
    the Internet gateway. To support fault tolerance and \n   increase the bandwidth,
    multiple Internet gateways can be deployed \n   within a MANET and, in this case,
    the network performance can be \n   improved by balancing the load among Internet
    gateways. In this draft, \n   we propose load-balancing Internet gateway selection
    mechanisms for \n   the MANET with multiple stationary Internet gateways. In addition
    to \n   this, we propose a scheme that reduces the routing control message \n
    \  overhead in the MANET when a MANET node sets up the route to Internet \n   gateway
    using global address. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
