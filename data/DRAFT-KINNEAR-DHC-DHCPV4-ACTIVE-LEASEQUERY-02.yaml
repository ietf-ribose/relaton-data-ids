abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has
    been\n   extended with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to request\n
    \  information about DHCPv4 bindings.  That mechanism is limited to\n   queries
    for individual bindings.  In some situations individual\n   binding queries may
    not be efficient, or even possible.  In addition,\n   continuous update of an
    external client with Leasequery data is\n   sometimes desired. This document expands
    on the DHCPv4 Leasequery\n   protocol, and allows for active transfer of near
    real-time DHCPv4\n   address binding information data via TCP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
