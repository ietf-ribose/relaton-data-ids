abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The currently existing iCalendar standard (RFC 2445) provides
    only a\n   simple text field (\"LOCATION\" property) for specifying the location\n
    \  where an event (or \"TODO\" item) will occur.  While this may be\n   adequate
    for human readers, it is difficult for automated systems to\n   make use of.  With
    the recent advent of tools and services (event\n   aggregators, for example) which
    would benefit greatly from structured\n   location data, the need to specify detailed
    venue information has\n   become apparent.  This document describes a proposed
    method for\n   addressing this need.\n\n   Comments are solicited and should be
    addressed to\n   ietf-calsify@osafoundation.org and/or the authors.\n\n   Note:
    This document depends on RFC2445bis, currently in draft status,\n   and should
    not proceed without RFC2445bis.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
