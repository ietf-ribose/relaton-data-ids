abstract:
- content: "<p>The Position Aware Secure and Efficient Mesh Routing Protocol (PASER)
    aims to efficiently establish accurate routes in terms of metric and legitimated
    mesh nodes in wireless mesh networks in presence of external attackers. For this
    end, it achieves the following goals: Node authentication, message freshness and
    integrity, and neighbor transmissions authentication. The novelty of PASER lies
    essentially in combining asymmetric cryptography with Merkle tree (a lightweight
    cryptographic primitive) and a keyed-hash function to secure the routing messages.
    Another key feature of PASER is integrating (virtual) geographical positions of
    nodes in its hierarchical reactive routing process to enable an advanced network
    management while mitigating the wormhole attack. Apart from that, to address the
    problem of node compromise, PASER endorses a key revocation scheme to efficiently
    exclude those nodes.</p>"
