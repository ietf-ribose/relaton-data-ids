abstract:
- content: <p>There are a variety of BGP-enabled services in which the originator
    of a BGP route may attach one or more "Route Targets" to the route. By means of
    a procedure known as "RT Constrained Distribution" (RTC), a given BGP speaker
    (call it "B") can announce the set of RTs in which it has interest. The implication
    is that if a particular route (call it "R") carries any RTs at all, BGP speaker
    B wants to receive route R if and only if B has announced interest in one of the
    RTs carried by R. However, if route R does not carry any RTs at all, prior specifications
    do not make it clear whether B's use of RTC implies that it does not want to receive
    route R. This has caused interoperability problems in the field, as some implementations
    of RTC do not allow B to receive R, but some services presuppose that B will receive
    R. This document updates RFC 4684 by clarifying the effect of the RTC mechanism
    on routes that do not have any RTs.</p>
