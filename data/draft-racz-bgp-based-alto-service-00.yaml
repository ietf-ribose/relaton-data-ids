abstract:
  content: "<p>Overlay applications, like Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing and videostreaming,
    attract a lot of users and generate a huge amount of data.Most overlay applications
    do not take into account the underlyingnetwork topology in their routing decisions
    and connectionestablishment in general. Due to this fact and the large amount
    ofP2P traffic, overlay applications waste network resources, causeproblems in
    network management, and result in high costs for ISPs,especially because of the
    expensive interconnection links betweenISPs. Therefore, the objective of the ALTO
    Working Group Charter[ALTO-charter] is to design and specify an Application-Layer
    TrafficOptimization (ALTO) service that will assist P2P applications intheir peer
    selection process in order to achieve a more efficientusage of network resources,
    to reduce operational costs of ISPs, andto increase the overlay application performance
    at the same time.This draft proposes a possible ALTO service that uses BGP routinginformation
    in order to calculate a rating value for peers providinga certain resource (resource
    providers). The service is operated bythe ISP. Since BGP routing information is
    available in any ISPnetwork and the service accesses the routing information from
    thelocal ISP network, the deployment of the service does not requirechanges in
    the network and the ALTO server can retrieve routinginformation automatically.</p>"
