abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing architecture leverages the paradigm of source routing.
    It can be realized in a network data plane by prepending the packet with a list
    of instructions, a.k.a. segments. A segment can be encoded as a Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) label, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address. Segment Routing can
    be applied in MPLS data plane by encoding segments in the MPLS label stack. It
    also can be applied to IPv6 data plane by encoding a list of segment identifiers
    in IPv6 Segment Routing Extension Header (SRH). This document extends the use
    of the SRH to unified segment identifiers encoded, for example, as MPLS label
    or IPv4 address, to compress the SRH, and support more detailed network programming
    and interworking between SR-MPLS and SRv6 domains.</p>"
