abstract:
- content: "<p>PIM is widely deployed multicast protocol. PIM protocol is defined
    in [RFC7761]. As deployment for PIM protocol is growing day by day, user expects
    lower traffic loss and faster convergence in case of any network failure. This
    document provides extension to the existing protocol which would improve stability
    of PIM protocol with respect to traffic loss and convergence time when the PIM
    DR is down.</p>"
