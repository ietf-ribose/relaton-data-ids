abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides methods and settings for using IPv6 to communicate
    among nodes within range of one another over a single IEEE 802.11-OCB link. Support
    for these methods and settings require minimal changes to existing stacks. This
    document also describes limitations associated with using these methods. Optimizations
    and usage of IPv6 over more complex scenarios are not covered in this specification
    and are a subject for future work.</p>"
