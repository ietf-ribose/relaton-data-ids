abstract:
  content: "<p>A holistic directory system is described which translates a standardE.164
    telephone number into the Internet address informationrequired to support IP-enabled
    communications applications such asreal-time voice, voice-messaging, fax or unified-messaging.
    Theproposed system utilizes two logical control tiers to implement thetranslation.The
    first logical control tier is patterned after a Top Level Domain(TLD) of the Internet
    Domain Name System (DNS). This first-tierprovides a mechanism for locating the
    appropriate directory withinthe second logical tier of the Internet-Telephony
    directory systemwhere authoritative Internet address information is stored for
    agiven E.164 number. This first-tier is expected to conform to theregulatory and
    operational standards defined by the InternetCorporation for the Assignment of
    Names and Numbers (ICANN) for theoperation of top-level domains.The second logical
    control tier provides a mechanism for accessingand managing authoritative Internet
    address information associatedwith an E.164 number. This tier consists of widely
    distributed DNSservers controlled by service providers, and corporate networkoperators.
    Distributed ownership of the second tier directoriesallows organizations to control
    the Internet address informationassociated with the E.164 numbers under their
    day-to-day control.</p>"
