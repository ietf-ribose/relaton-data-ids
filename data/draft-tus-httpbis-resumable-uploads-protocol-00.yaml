abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP clients often encounter interrupted data transfers as a result
    of canceled requests or dropped connections. Prior to interruption, part of a
    representation may have been exchanged. To complete the data transfer of the entire
    representation, it is often desirable to issue subsequent requests that transfer
    only the remainder of the representation. HTTP range requests support this concept
    of resumable downloads from server to client. This document describes a mechanism
    that supports resumable uploads from client to server using HTTP.</p>"
