abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In [EVPN], DF election process on each PE connecting to same
    ESI is\n   triggered by independent timer expiring, DF and non-DF PEs can't\n
    \  ensure that unblocking and blocking action take effect at the same\n   time,
    sometimes long time traffic disruption will occur. Handshaking\n   mechanism for
    DF election is introduced in this draft, it can\n   effectively reduce traffic
    disruption and avoid potential issues of\n   packet duplication and loop in all-active
    access scenario.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
