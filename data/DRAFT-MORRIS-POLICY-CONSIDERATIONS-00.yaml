abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document suggests public policy questions that the IETF should
    \nconsider and possibly address when developing new standards and \nprotocols,
    and modifying or enhancing old standards and protocols.  \nThis document contains
    questions to be considered, as opposed to \nguidelines or rules that should in
    all cases be followed.  This first \ndraft provides a framework for identifying
    and discussing questions \nof public policy concern, and invites members of the
    IETF community \nto contribute to the questions and discussions raised here. \n\t
    </p>\n      "
