abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers
    which\n   then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks.\n
    \  This document considers the case when the requesting router is a node\n   that
    acts as a host on behalf of its local applications and as a\n   router on behalf
    of any downstream networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
