abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document will describe an approach for how a distributed\n
    \  identity registry model might look.  It will consider both public\n   registry
    components of the data model necessary for routing calls\n   from one globally
    routable identity to another.  It will also\n   consider part of the private registry
    components a provider may need\n   to manage associations with users or customers.
    \ Other topics include\n   provider associations, application or service association,
    and the\n   ability to support multiple identities associated with a user/\n   subscriber
    (e.g. telephone number and e-mail identity).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
