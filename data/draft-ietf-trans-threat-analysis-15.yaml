abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an attack model and discusses threats for the
    Web PKI context for which security mechanisms to detect mis-issuance of web site
    certificates are being developed. The model provides an analysis of detection
    and remediation mechanisms for both syntactic and semantic mis-issuance. The model
    introduces an outline of attacks to organize the discussion. The model also describes
    the roles played by the elements of the Certificate Transparency (CT) system,
    to establish a context for the model.</p>"
