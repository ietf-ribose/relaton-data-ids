abstract:
- content: "<p>This document tries to propose an architectural framework of the internet
    in the real IP world. It describes how a three-tier mesh structured hierarchy
    can be established in a large address space based on fragmenting it into some
    regions and some sub regions inside each of them. It shows how to make a transition
    from private IP to real IP without making significant changes with the existing
    network. With the useful works done through IPv6, it provides all necessary inputs
    based on which a specification of IP with 64 bit address space may be emerged.</p>"
