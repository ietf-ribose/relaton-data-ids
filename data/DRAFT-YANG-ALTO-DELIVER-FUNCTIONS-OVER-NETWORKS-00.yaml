abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With development of Internet of Thing (IoT), artificial intelligence,\n
    \  huge amount of data are generated and need to be processed.  To\n   satisfy
    the user demands, service providers are deploying edge\n   computing across lots
    of data centers, which are closer to users.  In\n   order to achieve better performances,
    computing functions need to be\n   scheduled properly over networks.  However,
    it is challenging to\n   deploy functions to the distributed edge servers efficiently
    due to\n   the lack of network traffic information.  [RFC5693] and [RFC7285]\n
    \  introduce and define the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization, or\n   ALTO,
    to compute and provide the network information for the\n   distributed applications
    using the ALTO protocol.  In this document,\n   we employ the ALTO protocol to
    deliver functions in edge computing\n   platform, where the protocol will provide
    the network information for\n   the distributed edge computing servers and guide
    the delivery\n   process.  The usage of ALTO will improve the efficiency of function\n
    \  delivering in edge computing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
