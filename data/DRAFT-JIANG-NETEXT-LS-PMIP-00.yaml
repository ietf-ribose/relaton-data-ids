abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply
    mobility\n   management for mobile nodes (MN) in a local small area. When the\n
    \  numbers of MNs which attaching to the same MAG is very large, it will\n   cause
    the problem that the arrival rate of data traffic is far\n   surpass the process
    capacity of the MAG. So the MAG will suffer from\n   process bottleneck. The IETF
    is working on optimization for PMIPv6.\n   This document proposes a load sharing
    solution for MAGs by migrating\n   the Picked Mobile Node (PMN) to some MAGs without
    overload to sharing\n   the traffic load, which can relieve stress of the overloaded
    MAG and\n   improve the performance of PMIPv6 network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
