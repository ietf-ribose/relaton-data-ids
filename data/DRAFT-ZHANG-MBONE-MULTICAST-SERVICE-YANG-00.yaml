abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of this document defines a general multicast YANG
    service\n   model.  This document intent to provide a general and all-round\n
    \  multicast service model, and guides the deployment of multicast\n   technology.
    \ This model includes many of the existed multicast\n   technology.  But this
    document does not define any specifically and\n   detailed YANG model of multicast
    protocol.  The multicast model can\n   be used with YANG models of specifically
    multicast technologies, such\n   as PIM, MLD, and BIER and so on.\n\n   This document
    proposes a general and all-round multicast service YANG\n   model, which provides
    explanations and guidelines for the deployment\n   of multicast service in all
    kinds of multicast scenarios.  The\n   multicast technologies include BIER multicast,
    PIM multicast, MPLS\n   multicast and so on.  And also, there defines several
    possible RPCs\n   about how to interact between multicast service model and multicast\n
    \  device model.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
