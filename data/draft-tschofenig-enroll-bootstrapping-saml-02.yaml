abstract:
- content: "<p>Bootstrapping refers to the process of creating state (typically security
    associations) between two or more entities based on a trust relationship between
    these two or more parties AND a trusted third party. Some work has been done in
    the area of bootstrapping in the IETF recently. So far, the focus was on creating
    security associations. This document aims to attach authorization information
    to the bootstrapping process.</p>"
