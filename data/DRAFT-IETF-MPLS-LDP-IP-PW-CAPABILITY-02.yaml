abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, no LDP capability is exchanged for LDP applications
    like\n   IP label switching and L2VPN P2P PW signaling. When an LDP session\n
    \  comes up, an LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state\n   for
    such LDP applications even when the peer session may be\n   established for some
    other applications like ICCP. This document\n   proposes a solution by which an
    LDP speaker announces its disinterest\n   in such non-negotiated application.
    This, in turn, disables the\n   advertisement of corresponding application state,
    which would have\n   otherwise be advertised by default, over the established
    LDP session.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
