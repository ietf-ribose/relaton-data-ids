abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document states a traffic distribution problem in today's
    IP/MPLS\nnetwork when multiple links are configured between two routers. The\ndocument
    presents motivation, a framework and requirements. It defines a\ncomposite link
    as a group of parallel links that can be considered as a\nsingle traffic engineering
    link or as an IP link, and used for MPLS.\nThe document primarily focuses on MPLS
    traffic controlled through\ncontrol plane protocols, the advertisement of composite
    link parameter\nin routing protocols, and the use of composite links in the RSVP-TE
    and\nLDP signaling protocols. Interactions with the data and management plane\nare
    also addressed.  Applicability can be between a single pair of MPLS-\ncapable
    nodes, a sequence of MPLS-capable nodes, or a multi-layer\nnetwork connecting
    MPLS-capable nodes.\n\t </p>\n      "
