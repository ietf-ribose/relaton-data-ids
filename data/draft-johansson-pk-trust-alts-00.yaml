abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes often used patterns for establishing technical
    trust for public key-based security architectures other than traditional PKIX-based
    public key infrastructure. The intent is that this document be useful as a reference
    for protocol specification authors who use technology like PKIX, PGP or S/MIME
    as part of their protocols.</p>"
