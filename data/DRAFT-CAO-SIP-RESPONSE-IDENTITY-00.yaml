abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The mechanism for securely providing responder's identity in
    response\n   message is missing in the current Session Initiation Protocol.  Due\n
    \  to different call scenarios, the exact response identity is hard to\n   guess
    through the existing response message.  This draft describes\n   some extensions
    for providing SIP response identity and two security\n   mechanisms for verifying
    the integrity of response identity.  It does\n   so by defining new header fields
    as well as one new response code.\n   Furthermore, the issue of how to require
    the presence of response\n   identity in one SIP dialog is also discussed with
    one solution.\n\t </p>\n      "
