abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Benchmarking Methodologies have always relied on test conditions
    with\n   constant packet sizes, with the goal of understanding what network\n
    \  device capability has been tested.  Tests with constant packet size\n   reveal
    device capabilities but differ significantly from the\n   conditions encountered
    in operational deployment, and so additional\n   tests are sometimes conducted
    with a mixture of packet sizes, or\n   \"IMIX\".  The mixture of sizes a networking
    device will encounter is\n   highly variable and depends on many factors.  An
    IMIX suited for one\n   networking device and deployment will not be appropriate
    for another.\n   However, the mix of sizes may be known and the tester may be
    asked to\n   augment the fixed size tests.  To address this need, and the\n   perpetual
    goal of specifying repeatable test conditions, this draft\n   defines a way to
    specify the exact repeating sequence of packet sizes\n   from the usual set of
    fixed sizes, and other forms of mixed size\n   specification.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
