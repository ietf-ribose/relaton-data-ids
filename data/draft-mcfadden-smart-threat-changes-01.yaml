abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC3552/BCP72 describes an Internet Threat model that has been used
    in Internet protocol design. More than sixteen years have passed since RFC3552
    was written and the structure and topology of the Internet has changed. With those
    changes comes a question: has the Internet Threat Model changed? Or, is the model
    described in RFC3552 still largely accurate? This draft attempts to describe an
    non- exhaustive list of changes in the current threat environment. It finds that
    there are both qualitative and quantitative differences from the environment described
    in RFC3552 and is intended as input to the IAB program on the Internet threat
    model started in 2020.</p>"
