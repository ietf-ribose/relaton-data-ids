abstract:
  content: "<p>The DTNRG research group has defined the experimental Licklider Transmission
    Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326] and the Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) [RFC6260]
    mechanism for the InterPlanetary Network (ipn URI scheme). Moreover, RFC5050 [RFC5050]
    defines values for the Bundle Administrative Record Type. All of these fields
    are subject to a registry. For the purpose of its research work, the group has
    created ad-hoc registries. As the specifications are stable and have multiple
    interoperable implementations, the group would like to hand off the registries
    to IANA for official custody. This document describes the actions needed to be
    executed by IANA.</p>"
