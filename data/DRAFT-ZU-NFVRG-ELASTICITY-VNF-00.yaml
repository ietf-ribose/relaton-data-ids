abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft is an analytic of NFV applications based on the
    NFV\n   architecture, use cases and requirements. The purpose of this\n   analytic
    is to identify any NFV characteristics related issues. The\n   analytic is focusing
    on elasticity VNF with predicable performance,\n   reliability and security. Only
    the issues which are unique to NFV\n   are discussed in this document.\n\n\n\n\t
