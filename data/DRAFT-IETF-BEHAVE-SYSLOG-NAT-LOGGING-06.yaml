abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NAT devices are required to log events like creation and deletion
    of\n   translations and information about the resources the NAT is managing.\n
    \  The logs are required to identify an attacker or a host that was used\n   to
    launch malicious attacks, and for various other purposes of\n   accounting and
    management.  Since there is no standard way of logging\n   this information, different
    NAT devices behave differently.  The lack\n   of a consistent way makes it difficult
    to write the collector\n   applications that would receive this data and process
    it to present\n   useful information.\n\n   This document describes the information
    that is required to be logged\n   by the NAT devices.  It goes on to standardize
    formats for reporting\n   these events and parameters using SYSLOG (RFC 5424).
    \ A companion\n   document specifies formats for reporting the same events and\n
    \  parameters using IPFIX (RFC 7011).  Applicability statements are\n   provided
    in this document and its companion to guide operators and\n   implementors in
    their choice of which technology to use for logging.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
