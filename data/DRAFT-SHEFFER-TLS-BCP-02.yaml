abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Security
    Layer\n   (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application\n
    \  protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP.  Over the\n   last
    few years, several serious attacks on TLS have emerged,\n   including attacks
    on its most commonly used cipher suites and modes\n   of operation.  This document
    provides recommendations for improving\n   the security of both software implementations
    and deployed services\n   that use TLS and DTLS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
