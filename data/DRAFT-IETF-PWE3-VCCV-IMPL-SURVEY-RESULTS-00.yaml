abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Most Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations
    mandate\n   the use of the Control Word (CW) in order to better emulate the\n
    \  services for which the encapsulations have been defined.  However,\n   some
    encapulations treat the Control Word as optional.  As a result,\n   implementations
    of the CW, for encapsulations for which it is\n   optional, vary by equipment
    manufacturer, equipment model and service\n   provider network.  Similarly, Virtual
    Circuit Connectivity\n   Verification (VCCV) supports three Control Channel (CC)
    types and\n   multiple Connectivity Verification (CV) Types.  This flexibility
    has\n   led to reports of interoperability issues within deployed networks\n   and
    associated drafts to attempt to remedy the situation.  This\n   survey of the
    PW/VCCV user community was conducted to determine\n   implementation trends.  The
    survey and results is presented herein.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
