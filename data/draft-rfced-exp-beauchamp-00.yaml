abstract:
- content: "<p>As in RFC-1235, our implementation uses UDP [2] as the transport protocol
    but this is not a requirement of the protocol. Any broadcast datagram protocol
    could be employed. The satellite broadcast implementation assumes that there is
    only a single, unidirectional link (the satellite channel) between the source
    and recipient and that acknowledgment information from the recipient to the source
    is carried on a separate and independent media.</p>"
