abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The standardization of RPSL (Routing Policy Specification Language)
    is\nimminent, and there is a user community eager to make use of the power-\nful
    features it offers in the Routing Registry (IRR). Thus, a plan of\naction is needed
    to assure a successful transition from the RIPE-181\nlanguage currently employed
    to describe routing policies in the IRR to\nthe more expressive RPSL.  This document
    describes such a plan, which\nthe authors believe can be used to bring about a
    successful transition\nin a timely fashion with a minimum of disruption to the
    IRR and its cur-\nrent role in Internet routing.  This document will be modified
    to\nreflect the progress of the transition if appropriate.\n\t </p>\n      "
