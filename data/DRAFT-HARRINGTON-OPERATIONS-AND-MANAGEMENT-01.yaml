abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   New protocols or protocol extensions are best designed with
    due\n   consideration of operations and management issues related to the\n   protocol.
    \ Retrofitting operations and management recommendations to\n   protocols is sub-optimal.
    \ The purpose of this document is to provide\n   guidance to authors of protocol
    documents about aspects to consider\n   related to the operations and management
    that should be considered\n   for inclusion in documents defining requirements
    or functionality of\n   new protocols or protocol extensions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
