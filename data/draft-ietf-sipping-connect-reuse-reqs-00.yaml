abstract:
  content: "\t <t>When SIP entities use a connection oriented protocol to send arequest,
    they typically originate their connections from an ephemeralport. The SIP protocol
    includes mechanisms which insure thatresponses to a request, and new requests
    sent in the originaldirection reuse an existing connection. However, new requests
    sentin the opposite direction are unlikely to reuse the existingconnection. This
    frequently causes a pair of SIP entities to use oneconnection for requests sent
    in each direction, and can result inpotential scaling and performance problems.
    This document presentsrequirements for addressing this shortcoming, and separately
    proposesan example mechanism which addresses this deficiency.</p>"
