abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We detail the implementation of a network scheduler that aims
    at\n   isolating time constrained and elastic traffic flows from best-effort\n
    \  traffic.  This scheduler inherits from the priority scheduler (PS)\n   but
    dynamically changes the priority of one or several queues.  Usual\n   implementations
    of rate scheduler schemes (such as WRR, DRR, ...) do\n   not allow to efficiently
    guarantee the capacity dedicated to both AF\n   and BE classes as they mostly
    provide soft bounds.  This means\n   excessive margin is used to ensure the capacity
    requested and this\n   impacts the number of additional users that could be accepted
    in the\n   network.  To cope with this issue, this memo presents a credit based\n
    \  scheduler mechanism called Priority Switching Scheduler (PSS) that\n   allows
    a more predictable output rate per traffic class.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
