abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document \"A Framework for Centralized Conferencing\" defines
    a\n   centralized conference as both signaling and protocol agnostic.  The\n   primary
    examples within this framework focus on audio and video as\n   the media types
    for the session.  This document provides an overview\n   of the mechanisms defined
    in the centralized conferencing framework\n   that can be used to support multi-user
    chat.  In addition, the\n   document describes additional functionality and requirements\n
    \  necessary to provide feature rich functionality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
