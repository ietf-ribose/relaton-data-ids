abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Internet Standards Process [RFC2026] requires that all IETF\nStandards
    Track specifications must have 'multiple, independent, and\ninteroperable implementations'
    before they can be advanced beyond\nProposed Standard status. This document specifies
    the test which the\nIESG will use to determine if an Application Programming Interface\n(API)
    specification document meets these requirements.  It also\ndiscusses the rationale
    for this process.\n\t </p>\n      "
