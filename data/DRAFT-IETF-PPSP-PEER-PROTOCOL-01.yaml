abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol (PPSPP) is a peer-to-peer\n
    \  based transport protocol for content dissemination. It can be used\n   for
    streaming on-demand and live video content, as well as\n   conventional downloading.
    In PPSPP, the clients consuming the content\n   participate in the dissemination
    by forwarding the content to other\n   clients via a mesh-like structure.  It
    is a generic protocol which\n   can run directly on top of UDP, TCP, or as a RTP
    profile. Features of\n   PPSPP are short time-till-playback and extensibility.
    Hence, it can\n   use different mechanisms to prevent freeriding, and work with\n
    \  different peer discovery schemes (centralized trackers or Distributed\n   Hash
    Tables). Depending on the underlying transport protocol, PPSPP\n   can also use
    different congestion control algorithms, such as LEDBAT,\n   and offer transparent
    NAT traversal. Finally, PPSPP maintains only a\n   small amount of state per peer
    and detects malicious modification of\n   content. This documents describes PPSPP
    and how it satisfies the\n   requirements for the IETF Peer-to-Peer Streaming
    Protocol (PPSP)\n   Working Group's peer protocol.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
