abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a solution to engineer paths for IP multicasttraffic
    in a network, by directing the control messages to setupmulticast trees on engineered
    paths. This enables the networkoperator to have control over the topology of multicast
    trees.This proposal partitions the multicast traffic engineering problemsuch that
    multicast routing protocols do not have to be modified toallocate resources for
    multicast traffic nor do resource allocationprotocols such as RSVP or CR-LDP have
    to be able to setup forwardingstates (in this case labels) like multicast routing
    protocols.Resources are allocated on the same trip that paths are selected andsetup.
    This prevent the problem of data being forwarded on branchesof the tree where
    resources have not being allocated yet. Animportant aspect of this proposal is
    that it enables multicast pathsto be engineered in an aggregatable manner, allowing
    this solution toscale in the backbone.</p>"
