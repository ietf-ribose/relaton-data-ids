abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The specified IETF emergency services architecture puts a strongemphasis
    on emergency call and emergency messaging via the VoiceService Provider (VSP)
    / Application Service Provider (ASP). Thereare two reasons for this design decision:
    The call routing via theVSP/ASP is more natural as it follows the standard communicationpattern
    and transition deployments assume non-updated end hosts.As the deployment of the
    Location-to-Service Translation protocolprogresses there are possibilities for
    upgraded end devices todirectly communicate with the IP-based emergency services
    networkwithout the need to interact with a VSP/ASP, which simplifies thetask of
    regulators as the involved parties are within the samejurisdiction.This memo describes
    the procedures and operations of a genericemergency calling client utilizing the
    available building blocks.</p>"
