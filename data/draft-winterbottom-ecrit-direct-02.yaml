abstract:
- content: "<p>The specified IETF emergency services architecture puts a strong emphasis
    on emergency call and emergency messaging via the Voice Service Provider (VSP)
    / Application Service Provider (ASP). There are two reasons for this design decision:
    The call routing via the VSP/ASP is more natural as it follows the standard communication
    pattern and transition deployments assume non-updated end hosts. As the deployment
    of the Location-to-Service Translation protocol progresses there are possibilities
    for upgraded end devices to directly communicate with the IP-based emergency services
    network without the need to interact with a VSP/ASP, which simplifies the task
    of regulators as the involved parties are within the same jurisdiction. This memo
    describes the procedures and operations of a generic emergency calling client
    utilizing the available building blocks.</p>"
