abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a functional model of a gateway between
    the\nPublic Switched Telephony Network (PSTN) and a SIP-based IP network\nproviding
    telephony service.  In this document, the SIP-based IP\nnetwork will be referred
    to as Telephony over IP Service (TIPS).\n \nThe primary function of the gateway
    is to handle connections involving\none or more PSTN phones (i.e.; PSTN black
    phones) as if those\nPSTN phones are SIP clients.  The goal of this approach is
    to ensure\nthat SIP-based TIPS service logic applies to both native Internet-\nbased
    SIP clients and PSTN phones without modification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
