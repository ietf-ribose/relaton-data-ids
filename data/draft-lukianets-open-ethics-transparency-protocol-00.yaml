abstract:
- content: <p>The Open Ethics Transparency Protocol (OETP) is an application-level
    protocol for publishing and accessing ethical Disclosures of IT Products and their
    Components. The Protocol is based on HTTP exchange of information about the ethical
    "postures", provided in an open and standardized format. The scope of the Protocol
    covers Disclosures for systems such as Software as a Service (SaaS) Applications,
    Software Applications, Software Components, Application Programming Interfaces
    (API), Automated Decision-Making (ADM) systems, and systems using Artificial Intelligence
    (AI). OETP aims to bring more transparent, predictable, and safe environments
    for the end-users. The OETP Disclosure Format is an extensible JSON-based format.</p>
