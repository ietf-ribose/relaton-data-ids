abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines standards that enable autoconfiguration
    of\n   fundamental centralized or decentralized network infrastructure\n   services
    on ACP network nodes via GRASP.  These are primarily the\n   services required
    for initial bootstrapping of a network but will\n   persist through the lifecycles
    of the network.  These services\n   include secure remote access to zero-touch
    bootstrapped ANI devices\n   via SSH/Netconf with Radius/Diameter authentication
    and authorization\n   and provides lifecycle autoconfiguration for other crucial
    services\n   such as syslog, NTP (clock synchronization) and DNS for operational\n
    \  purposes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
