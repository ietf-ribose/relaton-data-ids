abstract:
- content: "<p>This document lists a set of functional requirements that served as
    input to the design of Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) extensions for setting
    up point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSP), in order to deliver
    point-to-multipoint applications over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) infrastructure.
    This work was overtaken by the protocol solution developed by the MPLS working
    group, but that solution did not closely follow the requirements documented here.
    This document is published as a historic record of the ideas and requirements
    that shaped the protocol work. This document defines a Historic Document for the
    Internet community.</p>"
