abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The default method for IPv6 address generation uses a organitionally\n
    \  unique identifier assigned by the IEEE Standards Association and the\n   extension
    identifier by the hardware manufacturer [1] (section 2.5.1\n   RFC-4291) [RFC4291].
    This means that a node will always have the same\n   Interface ID (IID) whenever
    it connects to a new network. Because the\n   node's IP address does not change,
    the node is vulnerable to privacy\n   related attacks. To address this issue,
    there are currently two\n   mechanisms in use to randomize the IID, Cryptographically
    Generated\n   Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] and Privacy Extension [RFC4941]. The\n
    \  problem with the former approach is the computational cost involved\n   for
    the IID generation and verification. The problem with the latter\n   approach
    is that it lacks security and offers only partial protection\n   to the node against
    privacy related attacks. This document offers a\n   new algorithm for use in the
    generation of the IID while, at the same\n   time, securing the node against some
    types of attack, like IP\n   spoofing. These attacks are prevented by the addition
    of a signature\n   to the messages sent over the network and by directly using
    a public\n   key in the IP address.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
