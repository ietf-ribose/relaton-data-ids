abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a mechanism for a CDN to trigger activity in
    an interconnected CDN that is configured to deliver content on its behalf. The
    upstream CDN can use this mechanism to request that the downstream CDN pre-positions
    metadata or content, or that it re- validate or purge metadata or content. The
    upstream CDN can monitor the status of activity that it has triggered in the downstream
    CDN.</p>"
