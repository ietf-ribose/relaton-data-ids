abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use case of providing IPsec-based
    flow\n   protection by means of a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller\n
    \  (aka.  Security Controller) and establishes the requirements to\n   support
    this service.  It considers two main well-known scenarios in\n   IPsec: (i) gateway-to-gateway
    and (ii) host-to-host.  This document\n   describes a mechanism based on the SDN
    paradigm to support the\n   distribution and monitoring of IPsec information from
    a SDN\n   controller to one or several flow-based Network Security Function\n
    \  (NSF).  The NSFs implement IPsec to protect data traffic between\n   network
    resources with IPsec.\n\n   The document focuses in the NSF Facing Interface by
    providing models\n   for Configuration and State data model required to allow
    the Security\n   Controller to configure the IPsec databases (SPD, SAD, PAD) and
    IKE\n   to establish security associations with a reduced intervention of the\n
    \  network administrator.  NOTE: State data model will be developed as\n   part
    of this work but it is still TBD.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
