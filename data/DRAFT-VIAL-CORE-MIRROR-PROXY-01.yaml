abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) working group aims
    at\n   realizing the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) architecture in\n
    \  a suitable form for the most constrained nodes.  Thanks to the\n   Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP), REST is now applicable to\n   constrained networks.
    \ However the most energy-constrained devices\n   may enter sleep mode and disconnect
    their network link during several\n   minutes to save energy, hence preventing
    them from acting as\n   traditional web servers.  This document describes how
    a sleeping\n   device can store resource representations in an entity called Mirror\n
    \  Server and participate in a constrained RESTful environment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
