abstract:
  content: "\t <t>During the development of Internationalized Domain Name (IDN), it
    isdiscovered that there is a substantial lack of information andmisunderstanding
    on Han ideographs and its folding mechanism.This document attempts to address
    some of the issues on doing hanfolding with respect to IDN. Hopefully, this will
    dispel some of thecommon misunderstanding of this problem and to discuss some
    of theissues with han ideograph and its folding mechanism.This document addresses
    very specific problem to IDN and thus is notmeant as a reference for generic Han
    folding. Generic Han folding aremuch more complicated and certainly beyond this
    document. However, theuse of this document may be applicable to other areas that
    are relatedwith names, e.g. Common Name Resolution Protocol [CNRP].</p>"
