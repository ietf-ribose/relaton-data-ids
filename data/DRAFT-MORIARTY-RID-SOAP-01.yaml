abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    Documents intended to be shared among multiple constituencies
    must\n    share a common format and transport mechanism.  The Incident Object\n
    \   Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a common XML format for\n    document
    exchange.  This draft outlines the SOAP wrapper for all\n    IODEF documents and
    extensions to facilitate an inter-operable and\n    secure communication of documents.
    \ The SOAP wrapper allows for\n    flexibility in the selection of a transport
    protocol.  The\n    transport protocols will be provided through existing standards
    and\n    SOAP binding, such as SOAP over HTTP(S) and SOAP over BEEP.\n\t </p>\n
