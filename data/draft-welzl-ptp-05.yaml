abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Endpoint congestion avoidance and control mechanisms typically relyon
    measured network performance parameters such as the round-trip-time and packet
    loss seen by the receiver, without any explicit helpfrom the network. Packet loss
    being the primary congestion indicator,these approaches first need to exceed the
    available network capacityto obtain the information needed to react. Additionally,
    relying onpacket loss leads to misinterpretation of transmission errors as asign
    of congestion.</p>"
