abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document analyzes actions by or against a Certification\n
    \  Authority (CA) or an independent repository manager in the RPKI that\n   can
    adversely affect the Internet Number Resources (INRs) associated\n   with that
    CA or its subordinate CAs.  The analysis is done from the\n   perspective of an
    affected INR holder.  The analysis is based on\n   examination of the data items
    in the RPKI repository, as controlled\n   by a CA (or an independent repository
    manager) and fetched by Relying\n   Parties (RPs).  The analysis does not purport
    to be comprehensive; it\n   does represent an orderly way to analyze a number
    of ways that errors\n   by or attacks against a CA or repository manager can affect
    the RPKI\n   and routing decisions based on RPKI data.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
