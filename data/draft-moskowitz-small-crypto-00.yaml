abstract:
- content: <p>This memo proposes to leverage the Keccak algorithm at a function "width"
    of b=400 to provide a set of "small" cryptographic functions well suited to the
    IOT constrained environment. As such, only 128 bit security level is provided
    here. The full set of NIST approved Keccak derived functions that can work within
    the b=400 constraint, plus the 3rd round candidate in the CAESAR competition,
    Ketje, are defined.</p>
