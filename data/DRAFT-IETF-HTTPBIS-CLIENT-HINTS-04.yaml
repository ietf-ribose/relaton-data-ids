abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An increasing diversity of Web-connected devices and software\n
    \  capabilities has created a need to deliver optimized content for each\n   device.\n\n
    \  This specification defines a set of HTTP request header fields,\n   colloquially
    known as Client Hints, to address this.  They are\n   intended to be used as input
    to proactive content negotiation; just\n   as the Accept header field allows user
    agents to indicate what\n   formats they prefer, Client Hints allow user agents
    to indicate\n   device and agent specific preferences.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
