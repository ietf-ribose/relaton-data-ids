abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The guiding principles in the design of IP network management
    were \nsimplicity and no centralized control.  The best effort service \nparadigm
    was a result of the original management principles and the \nother way around.
    \ New methods to distinguish the service given to \none set of packets or flows
    relative to another are well underway. \nHowever, as IP networks evolve the management
    approach of the past \nmay not apply to the QoS-capable network envisioned by
    some for the \nfuture.  We examine some of the areas of impact that QoS is likely
    \nto have on management and look at some questions that remain to be \naddressed.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
