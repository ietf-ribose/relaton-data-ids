abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In network protocol exchanges it is often useful for one end
    of a\n   communication to know whether the other end is in an intended\n   operating
    state.  This document provides an architectural overview of\n   the entities involved
    that make such tests possible through the\n   process of generating, conveying,
    and evaluating evidentiary claims.\n   An attempt is made to provide for a model
    that is neutral toward\n   processor architectures, the content of claims, and
    protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
