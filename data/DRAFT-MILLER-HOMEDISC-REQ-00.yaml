abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n  Networks in the home and similar environments typically do
    not\n  have, and should not be expected to have a full range of network\n  services
    such as DHCP servers, DNS and the like.  Further,\n  networks in the home and
    similar environments may have only\n  occasional connectivity to a larger network
    such as the Internet\n  where these types of services may exist.  Typical users
    of\n  home networks may not have the skills or desire to install,\n  configure,
    administer and maintain a sophisticated home network.\n \n  To enable the effective
    use of networks in the home and similar\n  environments, methods for discovering
    devices and services in\n  the network are needed.  These methods need to work
    for\n  occasionally connected and often resource-poor networks such as\n  are
    typically found in the home.  These methods also need to\n  be self-configuring,
    requiring only minimal involvement of users\n  of a home or similar network to
    configure and maintain that\n  network.\n \n  This document presents requirements
    for the discovery of devices\n  and services in a home network or similar environment.
    \ These\n  requirements are intended to form a basis that enables further\n  work
    toward solutions in this area.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
