abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the motivation and requirements for
    including\n   specific operational and telemetry information into data packets\n
    \  while the data packet traverses a path between two points in the\n   network.
    \ This method is referred to as \"in-situ\" Operations,\n   Administration, and
    Maintenance (OAM), given that the OAM information\n   is carried with the data
    packets as opposed to in \"out-of-band\"\n   packets dedicated to OAM.  In situ
    OAM complements other OAM\n   mechanisms which use dedicated probe packets to
    convey OAM\n   information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
