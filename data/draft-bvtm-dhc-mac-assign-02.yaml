abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain environments, e.g. large scale virtualization deployments,
    new devices are created in an automated manner. Such devices typically have their
    link-layer (MAC) addresses randomized. With sufficient scale, the likelihood of
    collision is not acceptable. Therefore an allocation mechanism is required. This
    draft proposes an extension to DHCPv6 that allows a scalable approach to link-layer
    address assignments.</p>"
