abstract:
- content: "<p>OAuth 2.0 authorization requests from apps running entirely in a browser
    are unable to use a Client Secret during the process, since they have no way to
    keep a secret confidential. This specification details the security considerations
    that must be taken into account when developing browser-based applications, as
    well as best practices for how they can securely implement OAuth 2.0.</p>"
