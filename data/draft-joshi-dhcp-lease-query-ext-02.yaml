abstract:
  content: "<p>As per industry trends, Access Networks have been migrating fromtraditional
    ATM based networks to Ethernet networks. In Ethernetbased access networks, Access
    Concentrators are typically configuredto act as traditional bridge. These Access
    Concentrators also act asrelay agents and relay DHCP messages between hosts and
    DHCP servers.It also maintains and updates lease/location information whilerelaying
    the DHCP messages. Access Concentrators may use the lease/location information
    for anti-spoofing, data forwarding etc. Thislease/location information is lost
    if an Access Concentrator getsrebooted. RFC 4388 [5] has defined a new message
    type DHCPLEASEQUERYto address similar limitation in Routed Access Networks.This
    document initially gives an overview of the functioning of theAccess Concentrator
    acting as a relay agent in a Layer 2 aggregationnetwork. The limitation[as mentioned
    above] in a typical switched/bridged[layer 2] is then discussed followed by the
    proposal to extendthe DHCPLEASEQUERY message to address this limitation.</p>"
