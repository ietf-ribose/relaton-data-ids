abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  In Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), the PE devices provide
    a \n  logical interconnect such that CE devices belonging to a specific \n  VPLS
    instance appear to be connected by a single LAN.  A VPLS \n  solution performs
    replication for multicast traffic at the ingress PE \n  devices.  When replicated
    at the ingress PE, multicast traffic wastes \n  bandwidth when 1. Multicast traffic
    is sent to sites with no members, \n  and 2. Pseudo wires to different sites go
    through a shared path.  \n  This document is addressing the former by IGMP and
    PIM snooping.  \n\t </p>\n      "
