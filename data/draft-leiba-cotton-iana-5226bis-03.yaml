abstract:
- content: "<p>Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants
    to identify various protocol parameters. To ensure that the values used in these
    fields do not have conflicting uses, and to promote interoperability, their allocation
    is often coordinated by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is
    filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). To make assignments
    in a given namespace prudently, IANA needs guidance describing the conditions
    under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications
    to existing values can be made. This document defines a framework for the documentation
    of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the guidance
    given to IANA is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the
    operation of a registry. This is the third edition, and obsoletes RFC 5226.</p>"
