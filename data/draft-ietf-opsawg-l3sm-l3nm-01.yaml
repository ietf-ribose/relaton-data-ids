abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC8299 defines a L3VPN Service YANG data Model (L3SM) that can be
    used for communication between customers and VPN service providers. That data
    model plays the role of a Customer Service Model, according to the terminology
    defined in RFC8309, and is as such adequate for service negotiation and order
    handling matters. There is a need for a more network-centric YANG data model to
    be used in the communication between the entity that interacts directly with the
    customer, the service orchestrator, (either fully automated or a human operator)
    and the entity in charge of network orchestration and control (a.k.a., network
    controller/orchestrator). This document specifies a L3VPN Network YANG Model (L3NM)
    to facilitate communication between a service orchestrator and a network controller/orchestrator.
    Such data model provides a network-centric view of the L3VPN services. The Yang
    model proposed is limited to BGP PE-based VPNs as described in RFCs 4026, 4110,
    and 4364.</p>"
