abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a rate adaptation algorithm for conversational
    media services such as interactive video. The solution conforms to the packet
    conservation principle and uses a hybrid loss-and-delay- based congestion control
    algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated over both simulated Internet bottleneck
    scenarios as well as in a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system simulator and is shown
    to achieve both low latency and high video throughput in these scenarios.</p>"
