abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an extension to DNS Over HTTPS (DoH)
    that\n   allows hiding client IP addresses via proxying encrypted DNS\n   transactions.
    \ This improves privacy of DNS operations by not\n   allowing any one server entity
    to be aware of both the client IP\n   address and the content of DNS queries and
    answers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
