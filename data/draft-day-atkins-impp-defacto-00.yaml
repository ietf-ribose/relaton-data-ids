abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This is a 'de facto IMPP charter' to accompany the IMPP submissions
    tothe IESG. Such an arrangement is not ordinarily part of the IETFprocess, but
    appears to be the most effective means of providingnecessary context to the IESG
    as it considers the IMPP documents. Thefirst part of this document describes the
    circumstances that have ledto this unusual de facto charter. The second part describes
    the IMPPcharter as it has been understood by the current chairs.</p>"
