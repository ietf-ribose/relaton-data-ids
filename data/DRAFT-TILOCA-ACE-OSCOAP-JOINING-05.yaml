abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to request and provision keying\n
    \  material in group communication scenarios where communications are\n   based
    on CoAP and secured with Object Security for Constrained\n   RESTful Environments
    (OSCORE).  The proposed method delegates the\n   authentication and authorization
    of new client nodes that join an\n   OSCORE group through a Group Manager server.
    \ This approach builds on\n   the ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization,
    and leverages\n   protocol-specific profiles of ACE to achieve communication security,\n
    \  proof-of-possession and server authentication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
