abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the format of an electronic signature
    that can\n   remain valid over long periods.  This includes evidence as to its\n
    \  validity even if the signer or verifying party later attempts to deny\n   (i.e.,
    repudiates the validity of the signature). The format can be\n   considered as
    an extension to RFC 3369 and RFC 2634, where, when\n   appropriate additional
    signed and unsigned attributes have been\n   defined.  The contents of this Informational
    RFC amounts to a \n   transposition of the ETSI TS 101 733 V.1.6.3 (CMS Advanced
    \n   Electronic Signatures - CAdES) and is technically equivalent to it.\n\t </p>\n
