abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP networks use signalling monitoring tools to diagnose user reported
    problem and for regression testing if network or client software is upgraded.
    As networks grow and become interconnected, including connection via transit networks,
    it becomes impractical to predict the path that SIP signalling will take between
    clients, and therefore impractical to monitor SIP signalling end-to-end. This
    draft describes requirements for adding an indicator to the SIP protocol which
    can be used to mark signalling as of interest to logging. Such marking will typically
    be applied as part of network testing controlled by the network operator and not
    used in regular client signalling. However, such marking can be carried end-to-end
    including the SIP terminals, even if a session originates and terminates in different
    networks.</p>"
