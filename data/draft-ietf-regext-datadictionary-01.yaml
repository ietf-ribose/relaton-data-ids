abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiple applications related to the registration of names and other
    identifiers are built around a list of data elements. There is currently no unified
    public list of these data elements, nor is there an organized and independent
    change control process. This document codifies the multiple similar but not quite
    identical lists of data elements into a neutral Data Dictionary to be maintained
    as an independent IANA Registry. The Data Dictionary defines data elements but
    does not specify which ones are to be used in any particular application; the
    Data Dictionary is policy-neutral.</p>"
