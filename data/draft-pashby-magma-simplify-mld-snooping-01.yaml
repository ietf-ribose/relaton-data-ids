abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this draft is to simplify the design of MLD Snooping
    switches and provide a method for Solicited Node multicast addresses to be sent
    to every port to improve network robustment and management. IPv6 Addressing Architecture
    requires that all nodes must join the associated Solicited-Node multicast addresses
    for every unicast and anycast address it is assigned. This causes MLD snooping
    switches to create potentially huge multicast forwarding tables just to handle
    Neighbor Discovery. A simple change to alleviate this would be to allow switches
    to forward a range of addresses that include the Solicited-Node multicast addresses
    to every port. This also could help in network discovery. Similarly the same allowance
    could be made for Local Network Control Block (LNCB) addresses.</p>"
