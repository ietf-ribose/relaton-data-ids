abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The purpose of this draft is to simplify the design of MLD Snoopingswitches
    and provide a method for Solicited Node multicast addressesto be sent to every
    port to improve network robustment andmanagement.IPv6 Addressing Architecture
    requires that all nodes must join theassociated Solicited-Node multicast addresses
    for every unicast andanycast address it is assigned. This causes MLD snooping
    switches tocreate potentially huge multicast forwarding tables just to handleNeighbor
    Discovery. A simple change to alleviate this would be toallow switches to forward
    a range of addresses that include theSolicited-Node multicast addresses to every
    port. This also couldhelp in network discovery. Similarly the same allowance could
    bemade for Local Network Control Block (LNCB) addresses.</p>"
