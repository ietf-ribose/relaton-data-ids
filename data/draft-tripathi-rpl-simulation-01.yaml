abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a performance evaluation of RPL in a single
    DAG scenario, and comparison of the same with shortest path routing in a LLN.
    Metrics to capture the significant performance aspects are identified and detailed
    simulations are carried out on a set of real- life scenarios.</p>"
