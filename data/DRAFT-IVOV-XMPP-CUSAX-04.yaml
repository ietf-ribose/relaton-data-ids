abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes suggested practices for combined use
    of the\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and\n
    \  Presence Protocol (XMPP).  Such practices aim to provide a single\n   fully
    featured real-time communication service by using complementary\n   subsets of
    features from each of the protocols.  Typically such\n   subsets would include
    telephony capabilities from SIP and instant\n   messaging and presence capabilities
    from XMPP.  This specification\n   does not define any new protocols or syntax
    for either SIP or XMPP.\n   However, implementing it may require modifying or
    at least\n   reconfiguring existing client and server-side software.  Also, it
    is\n   not the purpose of this document to make recommendations as to\n   whether
    or not such combined use should be preferred to the\n   mechanisms provided natively
    by each protocol (for example, SIP's\n   SIMPLE or XMPP's Jingle).  It merely
    aims to provide guidance to\n   those who are interested in such a combined use.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
