abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo presents a technique for using the hostname acquired
    from a\n   DHCPv4 client request to publish AAAA records on that domain name for\n
    \  public IPv6 addresses acquired by the same dual-stack host using\n   SLAAC.\n\n
    \  On dual-stack networks, there is a need to automatically publish\n   entries
    in the DNS for the public IPv6 addresses of an IPv6 host when\n   it does not
    use DHCPv6.  IPv6 hosts can acquire IPv6 addresses using\n   SLAAC, but there
    is no mechanism allowing them to register a name in\n   the DNS database other
    than a DNS update, which would create a very\n   difficult key management problem.
    \ By combining the DHCPv4 hostname\n   or client FQDN option with information
    acquired using ICMPv6, a\n   lightweight DHCPv4 server on a home gateway or SOHO
    gateway can\n   automatically publish AAAA records for such hosts.\n\n\t </p>\n
