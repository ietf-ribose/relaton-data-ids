abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>ISAKMP and PKIX both provide frameworks that must be profiled
    for use\nin a given application. This document provides a profile of ISAKMP\nand
    PKIX that defines the requirements for using PKI technology in\nthe context of
    IPsec. The document compliments protocol\nspecifications such as IKE, which assume
    the existence of public key\ncertificates and related keying materials, but which
    do not address\nPKI issues explicitly. This document addresses those issues.\n\t
