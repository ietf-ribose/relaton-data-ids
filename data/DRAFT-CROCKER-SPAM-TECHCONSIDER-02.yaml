abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internet mail has operated as an open and unfettered\nchannel
    between originator and recipient. This invites\nsome abuses, called spam, such
    as burdening recipients\nwith unwanted commercial email. Spam has become an\nextremely
    serious problem, is getting much worse and is\nproving difficult (or impossible)
    to eliminate. The\nmost practical goal is to bring spam under control; it\nwill
    require an on-going, adaptive effort, with\nstochastic rather than complete results.
    This note\ndiscusses available points of control in the Internet\nmail architecture,
    considerations in using any of those\npoints, and opportunities for creating Internet\nstandards
    to aid in spam control efforts.  It offers\nguidance about likely trade-offs,
    benefits and\nlimitations.\n\t </p>\n      "
