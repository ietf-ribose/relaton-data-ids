abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines how to use the Authentication and Authorization\n
    \  for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework to distribute keying\n   material
    and configuration parameters for secure group communication.\n   Candidate group
    members acting as Clients and authorized to join a\n   group can do so by interacting
    with a Key Distribution Center (KDC)\n   acting as Resource Server, from which
    they obtain the keying material\n   to communicate with other group members.  While
    defining general\n   message formats as well as the interface and operations available
    at\n   the KDC, this document supports different approaches and protocols\n   for
    secure group communication.  Therefore, details are delegated to\n   separate
    application profiles of this document, as specialized\n   instances that target
    a particular group communication approach and\n   define how communications in
    the group are protected.  Compliance\n   requirements for such application profiles
    are also specified.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
