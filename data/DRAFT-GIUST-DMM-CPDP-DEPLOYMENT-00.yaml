abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DMM working group is currently looking at solutions for
    mobility\n   management based on control and data plane separation.  In this\n
    \  context, the network entities in charge for the mobility control\n   function
    are separated from the data plane nodes, responsible mainly\n   for, but not limited
    to, data packet forwarding.  This vision allows\n   for the design of different
    interaction methods between the mobility\n   control function and the data plane
    nodes.  One of such mechanisms\n   being currently discussed devises an SDN-based
    abstraction layer\n   between control and data planes, embodied by an SDN Network\n
    \  Controller.  This latter interfaces to the mobility control function\n   through
    a north-bound interface (NBI), and programs the underneath\n   infrastructure
    through a south-bound interface (SBI), e.g., OpenFlow.\n\n   This draft describes
    multiple deployment scenarios for NBI and SBI\n   interworking, given that multiple
    network controllers could be\n   deployed in order to meet performance requirements
    e.g., related to\n   latency.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
