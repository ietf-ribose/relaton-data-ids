abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft technical proposal describes how MPEG DMIF (DeliveryMultimedia
    Integration Framework) can be used with RTSP for settingMPEG-4 service sessions
    and subsequently detaching the service. DMIFcreates an instance of DMIF RTSP augmented
    with QoS appropriate foreach MPEG-4 stream and also makes use of the FlexMux to
    carry multiplestreams on a single UDP or TCP IP flow. The stream control play/pauseetc.
    using RTSP is executed directly by the MPEG-4 Systems Sync Layer. Comments are
    solicited and should be addressed to the working group'smailing list at confctrl@isi.edu
    and/or the authors.</p>"
