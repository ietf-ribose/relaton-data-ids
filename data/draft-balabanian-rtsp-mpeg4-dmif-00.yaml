abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft technical proposal describes how MPEG DMIF (Delivery Multimedia
    Integration Framework) can be used with RTSP for setting MPEG-4 service sessions
    and subsequently detaching the service. DMIF creates an instance of DMIF RTSP
    augmented with QoS appropriate for each MPEG-4 stream and also makes use of the
    FlexMux to carry multiple streams on a single UDP or TCP IP flow. The stream control
    play/pause etc. using RTSP is executed directly by the MPEG-4 Systems Sync Layer.
    Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing
    list at confctrl@isi.edu and/or the authors.</p>"
