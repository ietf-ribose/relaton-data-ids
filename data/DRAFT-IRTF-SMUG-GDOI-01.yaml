abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents an ISAKMP Domain of Interpretation (DOI)
    for \nsecure group communications.  The 'GDOI,' or 'Group ISAKMP,' borrows \ndefinitions
    from GSAKMP [HH], incorporates the Phase 1 SA of the \nInternet DOI [RFC2407,
    RFC2409], and proposes new payloads and \nexchanges according to the ISAKMP standard
    [RFC2408, p.14].  Group \nISAKMP manages group security associations, which are
    used by security \nprotocols running at the IP [RFC2406] or application layers
    [AMESP].  \nThese security associations protect one or more key-encrypting keys,
    \ntraffic-encrypting keys, or data shared by group members.\n\nComments on this
    document should be addressed to smug@cs.umass.edu.\n\t </p>\n      "
