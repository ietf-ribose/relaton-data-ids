abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Although the Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions
    has been\n   implemented, cache poisoning is still a big issue.  \"ID Guessing
    and\n   Query Prediction\" type cache poisoning is detectable on a full\n   resolver.
    \ TCP transport has strong resistance to cache poisoning\n   attacks.  This document
    proposes an improvement of full resolvers\n   about the detection and the measure
    against forged response cache\n   poisoning attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
