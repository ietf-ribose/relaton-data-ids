abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Complexity is a widely used parameter in network design, yet
    there is\n   no generally accepted definition of the term.  Complexity metrics\n
    \  exist in a wide range of research papers, but most of these address\n   only
    a particular aspect of a network, for example the complexity of\n   a graph or
    software.  There is a desire to define the complexity of a\n   network as a whole,
    as deployed today to provide Internet services.\n   This document provides a framework
    to guide research on the topic of\n   network complexity.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
