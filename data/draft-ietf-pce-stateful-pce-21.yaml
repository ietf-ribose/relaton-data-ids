abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Client (PCC) requests. Although PCEP explicitly makes
    no assumptions regarding the information available to the PCE, it also makes no
    provisions for PCE control of timing and sequence of path computations within
    and across PCEP sessions. This document describes a set of extensions to PCEP
    to enable stateful control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) via
    PCEP.</p>"
