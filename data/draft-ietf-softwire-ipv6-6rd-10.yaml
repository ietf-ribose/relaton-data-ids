abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an automatic tunneling mechanism tailored to
    advance deployment of IPv6 to end users via a service provider's IPv4 network
    infrastructure. Key aspects include automatic IPv6 prefix delegation to sites,
    stateless operation, simple provisioning, and service, which is equivalent to
    native IPv6 at the sites that are served by the mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
