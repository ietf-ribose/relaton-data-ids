abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Disruptions in end-to-end path connectivity which last longer
    than\none retransmission timeout cause suboptimal TCP performance.  The\nreason
    for the performance degradation is that TCP interprets segment\nloss induced by
    connectivity disruptions as a sign of congestion,\nresulting in repeated backoffs
    of the retransmission timer.  This\nleads in turn to a deferred detection of the
    re-establishment of the\nconnection since TCP waits until the next retransmission
    timeout\noccurs before attempting the retransmission.\n\nThis document describes
    how standard ICMP messages can be exploited\nto disambiguate true congestion loss
    from non-congestion loss caused\nby long connectivity disruptions.  Moreover,
    a revert strategy of the\nretransmission timer is specified that enables a more
    prompt\ndetection of whether the connectivity to a previously disconnected\npeer
    node has been restored or not.  The specified algorithm is a TCP\nsender-only
    modification that effectively improves TCP performance in\npresence of connectivity
    disruptions.\n\t </p>\n      "
