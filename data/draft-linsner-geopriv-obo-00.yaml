abstract:
- content: "<p>There is proposed solution submitted to the GeoPriv work group that
    outlines the need for a location recipient to obtain the location of a target
    without the target's knowledge. The scenario is described as supporting a legacy
    device (a device lacking support for location) for the purposes of utilizing location
    when the legacy device summons emergency help (by dialing 911/112, etc.). Below
    is a discussion of the of the general topic of discovering location via 'On Behalf
    Of' or OBO.</p>"
