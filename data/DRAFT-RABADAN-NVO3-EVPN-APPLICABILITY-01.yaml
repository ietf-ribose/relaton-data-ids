abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In NVO3 networks, Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) devices
    sit at\n   the edge of the underlay network and provide Layer-2 and Layer-3\n
    \  connectivity among Tenant Systems (TSes) of the same tenant. The NVEs\n   need
    to build and maintain mapping tables so that they can deliver\n   encapsulated
    packets to their intended destination NVE(s). While\n   there are different options
    to create and disseminate the mapping\n   table entries, NVEs may exchange that
    information directly among\n   themselves via a control-plane protocol, such as
    EVPN. EVPN provides\n   an efficient, flexible and unified control-plane option
    that can be\n   used for Layer-2 and Layer-3 Virtual Network (VN) service\n   connectivity.
    This document describes the applicability of EVPN to\n   NVO3 networks and how
    EVPN solves the challenges in those networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
