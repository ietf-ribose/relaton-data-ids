abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In large network deployments, a single Diameter node can support
    over\n   a million concurrent Diameter sessions.  Recent use cases have\n   revealed
    the need for Diameter nodes to apply the same operation to a\n   large group of
    Diameter sessions concurrently.  The Diameter base\n   protocol commands operate
    on a single session so these use cases\n   could result in many thousands of command
    exchanges to enforce the\n   same operation on each session in the group.  In
    order to reduce\n   signaling, it would be desirable to enable bulk operations
    on all (or\n   part of) the sessions managed by a Diameter node using a single
    or a\n   few command exchanges.  This document specifies the Diameter protocol\n
    \  extensions to achieve this signaling optimization.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
