abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document outlines the requirements for a set of open IP based\nprotocols
    enabling seamless mobility across diverse radio access\nnetworks.  This document
    begins by stating some architectural tenets\nupon which the requirements for the
    OBAST protocol set are based.\nFurthermore, what the authors currently believe
    to be the eventual\ndesirable wireless Internet architecture is described. This\narchitecture
    is shown to enable a common protocol set that we refer\nto as open base station
    transport (OBAST).\n\t </p>\n      "
