abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Software Defined Network (SDN) is an overlay architecture that\n
    \  presents the underlying transport network to the applications and\n   services
    for monitoring, and provisioning at abstraction level.\n\n   In this memo, we
    outline some of the problems, and present an\n   architecture outline.  We will
    present a few applications to validate\n   the problems and the architecture framework.\n\t
