abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SOAR-ity is intended to allow for \"reliable\" (this term is
    almost\n   always a misnomer) messaging over HTTP.  It achieves this goal by\n
    \  introducing two new request headers, Message-ID which provides a\n   unique
    ID for a message and MsgCreate which contains the date and\n   time on which the
    first instance of the message with the associated\n   Message-ID was sent.  The
    purpose of the Message-ID/MsgCreate pair is\n   to allow any HTTP request (e.g.
    any HTTP method can be used) to be\n   repeated multiple times with a guarantee
    that the message will be\n   processed no more than one time.  In essence it makes
    any HTTP method\n   call idempotent.\n\t </p>\n      "
