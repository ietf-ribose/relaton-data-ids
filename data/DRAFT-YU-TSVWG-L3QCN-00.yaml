abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The more demands for the lossless and low latency network in
    the\n   modern datacenter appear because the proliferation of demanding\n   applications.
    Some congestion control schemes such as CN, PFC, ETS\n   which is introduced by
    IEEE 802.1 focus on the L2 network domain.\n   While current TCP/IP stacks can't
    meet these requirement on L3 or\n   above networks. This draft introduces the
    L3QCN(Layer 3 Quantized\n   Congestion Notification), an end to end congestion
    control scheme\n   which adopt QCN and DCQCN on L2 network. It specifies protocols,\n
    \  procedures, and managed objects to support congestion control on the\n   datacenter
    network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
