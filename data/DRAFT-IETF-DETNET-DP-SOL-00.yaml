abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies Deterministic Networking data plane\n
    \  encapsulation solutions.  The described data plane solutions can be\n   applied
    over either IP or MPLS Packet Switched Networks.\n\n   Comment #1:  SB&gt; An
    overarching comment is that the early part of the\n     document is really fundamental
    architecture and perhaps belongs in\n     the arch draft, leaving this draft to
    be more specific about\n     solutions.  Indeed if we cannot find a single solution
    that maps to\n     both IP and MPLS underlays I wonder if we should publish two\n
    \    specialist RFCs?\n\n   Discussion:  One document at the beginning, split
    into two if/when\n     needed.  Would be post adoption in any case.\n\n   Comment
    #2:  SB&gt; Whilst I think we should look for a common solution\n     to IP and
    MPLS I do not think that this is where the DT ended up.\n\n   Discussion:  Agree.\n\n\t
