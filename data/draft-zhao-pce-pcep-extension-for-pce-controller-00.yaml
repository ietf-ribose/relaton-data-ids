abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks deployment scenarios, service providers would like
    to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in both MPLS and GMPLS while removing
    the complexity of existing signaling protocols such as LDP and RSVP-TE. In [I-D.draft-zhao-pce-central-controller-user-cases],
    we propose to use the PCE as a central controller so that LSP can be calculated/
    signaled/initiated and label forwarding entries are downloaded through a centralized
    PCE server to each network devices along the LSP path while leveraging the existing
    PCE technologies as much as possible. This draft specify the procedures and PCEP
    protocol extensions for using the PCE as the central controller and user cases
    where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated and label forwarding entries are downloaded
    through extending the existing PCE architectures and PCEP.</p>"
