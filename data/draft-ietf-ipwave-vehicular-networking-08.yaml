abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of IP-
    based vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The main
    scenarios of vehicular communications are vehicle- to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I), and vehicle-to- everything (V2X) communications. First, this document surveys
    use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking. Second, it analyzes proposed protocols
    for IP-based vehicular networking and highlights the limitations and difficulties
    found on those protocols. Third, it presents a problem exploration for key aspects
    in IP-based vehicular networking, such as IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management,
    and Security &amp; Privacy. For each key aspect, this document discusses a problem
    statement to evaluate the gap between the state-of-the-art techniques and requirements
    in IP-based vehicular networking.</p>"
