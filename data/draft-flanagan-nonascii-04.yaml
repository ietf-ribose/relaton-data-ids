abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to support the internationalization of protocols and a more
    diverse Internet community, the RFC Series must evolve to allow for the use of
    non-ASCII characters in RFCs. While English remains the required language of the
    Series, the encoding of future RFCs will be in UTF-8, allowing for a broader range
    of characters than typically used in the English language. This document describes
    the RFC Editor requirements and guidance regarding the use of non-ASCII characters
    in RFCs. This document updates RFC 7322.</p>"
