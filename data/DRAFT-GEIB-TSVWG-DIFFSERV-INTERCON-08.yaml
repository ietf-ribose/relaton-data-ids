abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a limited and well defined set of DiffServ\n
    \  PHBs and codepoints to be applied at (inter)connections of two\n   separately
    administered and operated networks.  Many network\n   providers operate MPLS using
    Treatment Aggregates for traffic marked\n   with different DiffServ PHBs, and
    use MPLS for interconnection with\n   other networks.  This document offers a
    simple interconnection\n   approach that may simplify operation of DiffServ for
    network\n   interconnection among providers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
