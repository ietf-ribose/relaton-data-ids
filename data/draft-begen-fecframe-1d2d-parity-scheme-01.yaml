abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward ErrorCorrection
    (FEC) that is generated by the non-interleaved andinterleaved parity codes from
    a source media encapsulated in RTP.These parity codes are systematic codes, where
    a number of repairsymbols are generated from a set of source symbols and sent
    in arepair flow separate from the source flow that carries the sourcesymbols.
    The non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes offer agood protection against
    random and bursty packet losses,respectively, at a cost of decent complexity.
    The RTP payloadformats that are defined in this document address the scalabilityissues
    experienced with the earlier specifications including RFC2733, RFC 5109 and SMPTE
    2022-1, and offer several improvements. Dueto these changes, the new payload formats
    are not backward compatiblewith the earlier specifications.</p>"
