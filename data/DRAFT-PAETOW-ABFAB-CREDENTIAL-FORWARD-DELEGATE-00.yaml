abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A core use case of ABFAB-based authentication is access to
    remote\n   systems.  In this and other use cases it is preferable that the same\n
    \  identity initially used to gain access to the remote system is used\n   for
    further authentication sessions from the initial system onwards.\n   The current
    architecture and UI considerations require the use of\n   secure storage local
    to the system for any identities from that\n   system onwards.  This document
    aims to explore alternate proposals\n   for the reuse of an identity configured
    on the initial ABFAB-enabled\n   client device by the use of credential forwarding
    or delegation in a\n   similar fashion to those used by other GSS-API mechanisms.\n\n\t
