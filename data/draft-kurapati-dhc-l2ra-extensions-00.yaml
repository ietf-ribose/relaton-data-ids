abstract:
- content: "<p>As per industry trends, Access Networks have been migrating from traditional
    ATM based networks to Ethernet networks. In Ethernet based access networks, Access
    Concentrators are typically configured to act as a transparent bridge in Layer
    2 mode. These Access Concentrators also act as Layer 2 relay agents. Layer 2 Relay
    Agent functionality does not provide means to avoid flooding of DHCP messages
    and also needs to be extended to support DHCP LeaseQuery This draft discusses
    these issues and provides solutions for the same.</p>"
