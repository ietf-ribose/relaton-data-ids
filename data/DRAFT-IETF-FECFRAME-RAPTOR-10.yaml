abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction\n
    \  (FEC) Schemes for the Raptor and RaptorQ codes and their application\n   to
    reliable delivery of media streams in the context of FEC\n   Framework.  The Raptor
    and RaptorQ codes are systematic codes, where\n   a number of repair symbols are
    generated from a set of source symbols\n   and sent in one or more repair flows
    in addition to the source\n   symbols that are sent to the receiver(s) within
    a source flow.  The\n   Raptor and RaptorQ codes offer close to optimal protection
    against\n   arbitrary packet losses at a low computational complexity.  Six FEC\n
    \  Schemes are defined, two for protection of arbitrary packet flows,\n   two
    that are optimised for small source blocks and another two for\n   protection
    of a single flow that already contains a sequence number.\n   Repair data may
    be sent over arbitrary datagram transport (e.g.  UDP)\n   or using RTP.\n\n\t
