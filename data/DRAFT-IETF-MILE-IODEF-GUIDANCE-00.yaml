abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format [RFC5070] defines
    a\n   data representation that provides a framework for sharing information\n
    \  commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams\n   (CSIRTs)
    about computer security incidents.  Since the IODEF model\n   includes a wealth
    of available options that can be used to describe a\n   security incident or issue,
    it can be challenging for implementers to\n   develop tools that can Leverage
    IODEF for incident sharing.  This\n   document provides guidelines for IODEF users
    and implementers.  It\n   will also address how common security indicators can
    be represented\n   in IODEF.  The goal of this document is to make IODEF's adoption
    by\n   vendors easier and encourage faster and wider adoption of the model\n   by
    Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) around the\n   world.\n\n\t
