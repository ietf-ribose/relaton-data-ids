abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document complements [RFC-4031] and defines requirements
    that \n   are specific to the delivery of BGP/MPLS-based [RFC-4364] VPN \n   services
    across multiple administrative domains. These requirements \n   are independent
    of underlying technologies or the number of \n   Autonomous Systems such VPNs
    may span. It lists the requirements of \n   the different parties that are involved
    in the administration of \n   these Autonomous Systems and may therefore be involved
    in the \n   delivery of the VPN service offerings.  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
