abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a generic associated channel header (GE-ACH)
    \nthat provides a control channel associated with an MPLS LSP, \npseudowire or
    MPLS section. The VCCV ACH defined for PWs in RFC 5085 \nis generalized to allow
    a larger set of control channel and OAM \nfunctions to be used to meet the requirements
    of packet transport and \nother applications of MPLS.\n\n\nConventions used in
    this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].\n\t </p>\n
