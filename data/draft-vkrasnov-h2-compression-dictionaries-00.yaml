abstract:
- content: <p>The HTTP/2 [RFC7540] protocol encourages the use of many small assets
    for CSS/JS/HTML, due to its multiplexed nature. Prior to HTTP/2, asset inlining
    was encouraged, resulting in fewer, larger assets per website. The nature of the
    compression algorithms, such as DEFLATE [RFC1951] and Brotli [BROTLI], used with
    HTTP in practice, require a certain "window" of data to perform backward matching.
    Therefore, larger files have much better compression ratio. These algorithms also
    allow the use of custom compression dictionaries which can be used as the initial
    window for backward matches. This document specifies a new HTTP/2 frame type and
    a new HTTP/2 setting value that would allow a compression algorithm to use previously
    sent data as a compression dictionary, resulting in an improved compression ratio.</p>
