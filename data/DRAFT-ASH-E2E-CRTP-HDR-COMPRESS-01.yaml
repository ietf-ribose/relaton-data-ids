abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP, wherein
    the \npacket header is at least 40 bytes, while the voice payload is typically
    \nno more than 30 bytes.  VoIP header compression can significantly reduce \nthe
    VoIP overhead through various compression mechanisms.  This is \nimportant on
    access links where bandwidth is scarce, and can be \nimportant on backbone facilities,
    especially where costs are high (e.g., \nsome global cross-sections).  In this
    draft we propose to re-use the \nmethods in cRTP to determine the header compression
    context and to use \nthe cRTP session context ID to route a compressed packet
    between the \ningress and egress routers.\n\t </p>\n      "
