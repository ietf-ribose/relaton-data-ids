abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes Layered TCP (LTCP for short), a simple\n
    \  layering technique for the congestion window response of TCP to make\n   it
    more scalable in highspeed networks. LTCP is a two dimensional\n   congestion
    control framework - the macroscopic control uses the\n   concept of layering to
    quickly and efficiently make use of the\n   available bandwidth whereas microscopic
    control extends the existing\n   AIMD algorithms of TCP to determine the per-ack
    behavior. This\n   document provides the general intuition and framework for the
    LTCP\n   protocol modifications. Using a simple design, the effectiveness of\n
    \  using layering for improving the efficiency without sacrificing the\n   convergence
    properties of TCP, is illustrated. The chosen design is\n   evaluated using mathematical
    analysis, ns-2 based simulations and\n   emulation on a Linux testbed. The results
    show that LTCP has\n   promising convergence properties, is about an order of
    magnitude\n   faster than TCP in utilizing high bandwidth links, employs few\n
    \  parameters and is easy to understand. The flexible framework opens a\n   whole
    class of design options for improving the performance of TCP in\n   highspeed
    networks. This document is an effort to solicit more\n   experimentation and feedback
    from the broader networking community.\n\t </p>\n      "
