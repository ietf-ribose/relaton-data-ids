abstract:
- content: "<p>Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for network
    diagnostics by providers and users, as well for as public policy. To conduct such
    measurements, user networks gather data, either on their own initiative or instructed
    by a measurement controller, and then upload the measurement results to a designated
    measurement server. Understanding the various scenarios and users of measuring
    broadband performance is essential to development of the system requirements.
    The details of the measurement metrics themselves are beyond the scope of this
    document.</p>"
