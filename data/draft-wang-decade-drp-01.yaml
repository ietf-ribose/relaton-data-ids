abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explorers the design of an HTTP-based DECADE Resource
    Protocol (DRP), which can be used for content and resource management between
    a DECADE Client and a DECADE Server, or between two DECADE Servers. We identify
    the function entities, and present initial protocol message flow and syntax design.
    The purpose of this document is to get design discussion started, not to provide
    a complete solution.</p>"
