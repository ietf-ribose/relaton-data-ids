abstract:
- content: <p>The RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] has limited support for authentication
    and encryption of RADIUS packets. The protocol transports data "in the clear",
    although some parts of the packets can have "obfuscated" content. Packets may
    be replayed verbatim by an attacker, and client-server authentication is based
    on fixed shared secrets. This document specifies how the Datagram Transport Layer
    Security (DTLS) protocol may be used as a fix for these problems. It also describes
    how implementations of this proposal can co-exist with current RADIUS systems.</p>
