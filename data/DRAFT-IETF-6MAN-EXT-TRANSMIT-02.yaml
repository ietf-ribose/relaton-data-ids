abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Various IPv6 extension headers have been standardised since
    the IPv6\n   standard was first published.  This document updates RFC 2460 to\n
    \  clarify how intermediate nodes should deal with such extension\n   headers
    and with any that are defined in future.  It also specifies\n   how extension
    headers should be registered by IANA, with a\n   corresponding minor update to
    RFC 2780.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
