abstract:
- content: "<p>With the development of the Internet, game industry has risen rapidly,
    from handheld game consoles to PC games and mobile games. The types of games are
    diversified, while the number of game users is increasing year by year. The game
    market is maturing quickly. Nowadays, the scale of game users is large and they
    belong to the easy-to-consume groups. Among all the games, those require frequent
    interactions and involve video streaming usually have highly demanding requirements
    on the network in terms of guaranteed network latency and reliability. Therefore,
    from the aspect of ensuring better gaming experience, it is desirable of differentiating
    the particular gaming application flows and providing high-priority network services
    for those demanding gamers. This document describes the game acceleration scenarios
    using Application-aware Networking (APN) technology. In these scenarios, APN can
    identify the specific requirements of particular gaming applications, steer the
    flows to the game processors close to the users, and provide SLA guaranteed network
    services such as low latency and high reliability.</p>"
