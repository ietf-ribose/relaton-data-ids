abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A recurrent theme in WebRTC has been the need to handle very
    large\n   numbers of media flows.  Unfortunately, naive uses of SDP do not\n   handle
    this case particularly well.  This document describes a modest\n   set of extensions
    to SDP which allow it to cleanly handle arbitrary\n   numbers of flows while still
    retaining a large degree of backward\n   compatibility with existing and non-RTCWEB
    endpoints.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
