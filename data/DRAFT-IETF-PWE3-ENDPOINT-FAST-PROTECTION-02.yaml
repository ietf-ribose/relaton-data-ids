abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a fast mechanism for protecting pseudowires\n
    \  against egress endpoint failures, including egress attachment circuit\n   failure,
    egress PE failure, multi-segment PW terminating PE failure,\n   and multi-segment
    PW switching PE failure.  Designed on the basis of\n   multi-homed CE, PW redundancy,
    upstream label assignment and context\n   specific label switching, the mechanism
    enables local repair to be\n   performed by the router upstream adjacent to a
    failure.  In\n   particular, the router can restore PW traffic in the order of
    tens of\n   milliseconds, by transmitting the traffic to a protector through a\n
    \  pre-established bypass tunnel.  Therefore, the mechanism can reduce\n   traffic
    loss before global repair reacts to the failure and the\n   network converges
    on the topology changes due to the failure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
