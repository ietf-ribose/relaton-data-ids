abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for DNS
    names of\n   Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as appliances and sensors.
    \ By\n   this scheme, the DNS name of an IoT device can be autoconfigured with\n
    \  the device's category and model in wired and wireless networks (e.g.,\n   home,
    office, shopping mall, smart grid, and road network).  This DNS\n   name lets
    IoT users (e.g., home residents and customers) easily\n   identify each device
    for monitoring and remote-controlling it in a\n   target network.\n\n\t </p>\n
