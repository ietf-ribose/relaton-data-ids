abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n(LDAP)
    to support server side current time matching.\n\nMatching of time-stamp attribute
    values against an LDAP server's\ncurrent time offers advantages for example in
    case third party\nproducts' LDAP client configuration directives (e.g.  LDAP filter\nstatements)
    do not offer support to dynamically rewrite/replace a\nfilter's assertion value
    for each request.  Using the matching rules\ndefined in this document the client
    is able to provide a constant\nmatching rule assertion value to trigger the server
    side comparison\nof the given/stored 'Generalized Time' syntax based attribute
    value\nagainst the LDAP server's current time.\n\nTherefore this document specifies
    four matching rules and two\ndedicated assertion syntaxes to be used in conjuntion
    with the well\nknown 'Generalized Time' syntax based attribute values.\n\t </p>\n
