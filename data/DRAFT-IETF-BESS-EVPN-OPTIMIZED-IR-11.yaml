abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Virtualization Overlay networks using Ethernet VPN
    (EVPN) as\n   control plane may use Ingress Replication or PIM (Protocol\n   Independent
    Multicast)-based trees to convey the overlay Broadcast,\n   Unknown unicast and
    Multicast (BUM) traffic.  PIM provides an\n   efficient solution to avoid sending
    multiple copies of the same\n   packet over the same physical link, however it
    may not always be\n   deployed in the Network Virtualization Overlay core network.
    \ Ingress\n   Replication avoids the dependency on PIM in the Network\n   Virtualization
    Overlay network core.  While Ingress Replication\n   provides a simple multicast
    transport, some Network Virtualization\n   Overlay networks with demanding multicast
    applications require a more\n   efficient solution without PIM in the core.  This
    document describes\n   a solution to optimize the efficiency of Ingress Replication
    trees.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
