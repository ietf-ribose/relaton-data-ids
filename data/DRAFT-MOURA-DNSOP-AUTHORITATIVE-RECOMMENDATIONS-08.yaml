abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent research work has explored the deployment characteristics
    and\n   configuration of the Domain Name System (DNS).  This document\n   summarizes
    the conclusions from these research efforts and offers\n   specific, tangible
    advice to operators when configuring authoritative\n   DNS servers.\n\n   It is
    possible that the results presented in this document could be\n   applicable in
    a wider context than just the DNS protocol, as some of\n   the results may generically
    apply to any stateless/short-duration,\n   anycasted service.\n\n   This document
    is not an IETF consensus document: it is published for\n   informational purposes.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
