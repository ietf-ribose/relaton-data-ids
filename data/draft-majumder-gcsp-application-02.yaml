abstract:
- content: "<p>Generic Client Server Protocol is a simple generic Application level
    protocol to standardize communication between a pair of generic Client and Server.
    It also tries to show some way to develop a tool that will build automatically
    the generic Client/Server pair at application layer. However, the main objective
    of this memo is to standardize an application layer protocol stack for Client/Server
    communication.</p>"
