abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traditional finite-field-based Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange\n
    \  during the TLS handshake suffers from a number of security,\n   interoperability,
    and efficiency shortcomings.  These shortcomings\n   arise from lack of clarity
    about which DH group parameters TLS\n   servers should offer and clients should
    accept.  This document offers\n   a solution to these shortcomings for compatible
    peers by using a\n   section of the TLS \"EC Named Curve Registry\" to establish
    common\n   finite-field DH parameters with known structure and a mechanism for\n
    \  peers to negotiate support for these groups.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
