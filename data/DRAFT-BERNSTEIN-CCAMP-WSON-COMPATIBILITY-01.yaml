abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>While the current GMPLS WSON framework can deal with many types
    of\nwavelength switching systems there is a desire to extend the control\nplane
    to networks that include a combination of transparent optical\nand hybrid electro
    optical systems such as OEO switches,\nregenerators, and wavelength converters.
    Such networks are frequently\nreferred to as translucent optical networks in the
    literature. Some\nof the systems use in such networks can be limited to processing
    WSON\nsignals with specific characteristics or attributes. In addition,\nsome
    of the network elements may be able to perform important\noptional processing
    functions such as regeneration on a signal and\nwould need to be provisioned as
    part of optical path establishment.\n\nThis document provides a WSON signal definition
    and attributes\ncharacterization based on ITU-T interface and signal class standards\nand
    describes the signal compatibility constraints of this extended\nset of network
    elements. The signal characterization, network element\ncompatibility constraints
    and enhanced provisioning support enable\nGMPLS routing and signaling to control
    these devices and PCE to\ncompute optical light-paths subject to signal compatibility\nattributes.\n\t
