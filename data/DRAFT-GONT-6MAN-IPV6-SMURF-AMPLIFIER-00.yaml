abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When an IPv6 node processing an IPv6 packet does not support
    an IPv6\n   option whose two-highest-order bits of the Option Type are '10', it\n
    \  is required to respond with an ICMPv6 Parameter Problem error\n   message,
    even if the Destination Address of the packet was a\n   multicast address.  This
    feature provides an amplification vector,\n   opening the door to an IPv6 version
    of the 'Smurf' Denial-of-Service\n   (DoS) attack found in IPv4 networks.  This
    document discusses the\n   security implications of the aforementioned options,
    and formally\n   updates RFC 2460 such that this attack vector is eliminated.\n
    \  Additionally, it describes a number of operational mitigations that\n   could
    be deployed against this attack vector.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
