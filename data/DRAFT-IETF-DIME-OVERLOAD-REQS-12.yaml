abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs
    to be\n   able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to\n
    \  reduce sending traffic for some period of time.  Otherwise, it must\n   continue
    to expend resources parsing and responding to Diameter\n   messages, possibly
    resulting in congestion collapse.  The existing\n   Diameter mechanisms are not
    sufficient for this purpose.  This\n   document describes the limitations of the
    existing mechanisms.\n   Requirements for new overload management mechanisms are
    also\n   provided.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
