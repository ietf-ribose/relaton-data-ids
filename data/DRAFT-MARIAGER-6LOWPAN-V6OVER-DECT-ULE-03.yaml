abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DECT Ultra Low Energy is a low power air interface technology
    that is\n   defined by the DECT Forum and specified by ETSI.\n\n   The DECT air
    interface technology has been used world-wide in\n   communication devices for
    more than 15 years, primarily carrying\n   voice for cordless telephony but has
    also been deployed for data\n   centric services.\n\n   The DECT Ultra Low Energy
    is a recent addition to the DECT interface\n   primarily intended for low-bandwidth,
    low-power applications such as\n   sensor devices, smart meters, home automation
    etc.  As the DECT Ultra\n   Low Energy interface inherits many of the capabilities
    from DECT, it\n   benefits from long range, interference free operation, world
    wide\n   reserved frequency band, low silicon prices and maturity.  There is\n
    \  an added value in the ability to communicate with IPv6 over DECT ULE\n   such
    as for Internet of Things applications.\n\n   This document describes how IPv6
    is transported over DECT ULE using\n   6LoWPAN techniques.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
