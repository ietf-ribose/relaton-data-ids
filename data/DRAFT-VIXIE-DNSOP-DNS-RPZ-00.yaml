abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method for expressing DNS response
    policy\n   inside a specially constructed DNS zone, and for recursive name\n   servers
    to use such policy to return modified results to DNS clients.\n   The modified
    DNS results can stop access to selected HTTP servers,\n   redirect users to \"walled
    gardens\", block objectionable email, and\n   otherwise defend against attack.
    \ These \"DNS Firewalls\" are widely\n   used in fighting Internet crime and abuse.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
