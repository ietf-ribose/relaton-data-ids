abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies the use of a reserved IANA IPv4 addressallocation
    to support the deployment of IPv6 transition technologiesand IPv4 address sharing
    technologies post IPv4 exhaustion. Serviceproviders are in the process of implementing
    IPv6 support byproviding dual-stack IPv4 and IPv6 services to their end-users.
    Onemethod for continued support of the IPv4 Internet post IANA IPv4depletion is
    through the use of a carrier-provided NAT444infrastructure. Another mechanism
    used to transition to IPv6 is anIPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel such as IPv6 Rapid Deployment
    (6RD). Thisdocument details the use of an IANA reserved address block for thesepurposes.</p>"
