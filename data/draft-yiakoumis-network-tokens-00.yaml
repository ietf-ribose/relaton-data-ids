abstract:
- content: "<p>Network tokens is a method for endpoints to explicitly and securely
    coordinate with networks about how their traffic is treated. They are inserted
    by endpoints in existing protocols, interpreted by trusted networks, and may be
    signed or encrypted to meet security and privacy requirements. Network tokens
    provide a means for network operators to expose datapath services (such as a zero-rating
    service, a user-driven QoS service, or a firewall whitelist), and for end users
    and application providers to access such services. Network tokens are inspired
    and derived by existing security tokens (like JWT and CWT), and borrow several
    of their core ideas along with security and privacy properties.</p>"
