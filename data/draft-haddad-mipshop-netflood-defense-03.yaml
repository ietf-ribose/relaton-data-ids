abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a simple defense mechanism against a specific type
    of network flooding attacks. The suggested mechanism requires a mobile node to
    establish a 'symbiotic relationship' with the infrastructure, in order to empower
    it to repel such attack while giving enough insurance to the source(s) of the
    traffic about the need to cease sending traffic to the targeted network.</p>"
