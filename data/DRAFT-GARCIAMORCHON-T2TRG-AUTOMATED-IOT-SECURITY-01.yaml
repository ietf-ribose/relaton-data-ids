abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of
    standard\n   Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing\n
    \  communication.  The security needs are well-recognized but the design\n   space
    of IoT applications and systems is complex and exposed to\n   multiple types of
    threats.  In particular, threats keep evolving at a\n   fast pace while many IoT
    systems are rarely updated and still remain\n   operational for decades.\n\n   This
    document describes a comprehensive agile security framework to\n   integrate existing
    security processes such as risk assessment or\n   vulnerability assessment in
    the lifecycle of a smart object in an IoT\n   application.  The core of our agile
    security approach relies on two\n   protocols: the Protocol for Automatic Security
    Configuration (PASC)\n   and the Protocol for Automatic Vulnerability Assessment
    (PAVA).  PASC\n   is executed during the onboarding phase of a smart object in
    an IoT\n   system and is in charge of automatically performing a risk assessment\n
    \  and assigning a security configuration - applicable to the device or\n   the
    system - to defeat the identified risks.  The assigned security\n   configuration
    fits the specific environment and threat model of the\n   application in which
    the device has been deployed.  PAVA is executed\n   during the operation of the
    IoT object and ensures that\n   vulnerabilities in the smart object and IoT system
    are discovered in\n   a proactive way.\n\n   These two protocols can benefit users,
    manufactures and operators by\n   automating IoT security.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
