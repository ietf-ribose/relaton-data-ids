abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Segment Routing (SR) path is identified by an SR segment
    list.\n   Only the full segment list identifies the full end-to-end path, and\n
    \  one segment or a partial set of segments from the list cannot\n   identify
    the SR path and distinguish it from other SR paths that may\n   be partially congruent.
    \ But path identification is a pre-requisite\n   for various use-cases such as
    performance measurement (PM) of an SR\n   path.\n\n   In SR for MPLS (SR-MPLS)
    the segment identifiers are stripped from\n   the packet through label popping
    as the packet transits the network.\n   This means that when a packet reaches
    the egress of the SR path, it\n   is not possible to determine on which SR path
    it traversed the\n   network.\n\n   This document defines a new type of segment
    that is referred to as\n   Path Segment, which is used to identify an SR path
    in an SR-MPLS\n   network.  When used, it is inserted at the ingress node of the
    SR\n   path and immediately follows the last segment identifier in the\n   segment
    list of the SR path.  The Path Segment will not be popped off\n   until it reaches
    the egress node of the SR path.\n\n   A Path Segment can be used by the egress
    node to implement path\n   identification hence to support various use-cases including
    SR path\n   PM, end-to-end 1+1 SR path protection, and bidirectional SR paths\n
    \  correlation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
