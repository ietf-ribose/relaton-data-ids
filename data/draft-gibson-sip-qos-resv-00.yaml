abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft defines a modification of the use of the SIP protocol
    toperform route reservation. These modifications are applied to two ofthe existing
    SIP Methods: INVITE and REGISTER. The modificationsallow the INVITE method to
    be used to find the best path across aparticular network based on QoS metrics.
    The route choice is able tobe restricted at the network edge. The proposed modifications
    alsoallow the REGISTER method to be used as a means of disseminatinginformation
    necessary to determine these QoS metrics. Thisinformation can be used to route
    INVITEs away from known areas ofcongestion.</p>"
