abstract:
- content: "<p>The Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) WG is defining
    a set of protocols to inter-connect CDNs, to achieve multiple goals such as extending
    the reach of a given CDN to areas that are not covered by that particular CDN.
    One componet that is needed to achieve the goal of CDNI is the CDNI Request Routing
    Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI) [RFC7336]. [RFC8008]
    has defined precisely the semantics of FCI and provided guidelines on the FCI
    protocol, but the exact protocol is explicitly outside the scope of that document.
    In this document, we define an FCI protocol using the Application Layer Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) protocol.</p>"
