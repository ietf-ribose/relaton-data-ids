abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a speech codec suitable for robust voice
    \ncommunication over IP. The codec is developed by Global IP Sound \n(GIPS) and
    is designed for narrow band speech and results in a \npayload bit rate of 13.867
    kbit/s with an encoding frame length of \n30 ms. The codec enables graceful speech
    quality degradation in the \ncase of lost frames, which occurs in connection with
    lost or delayed \nIP packets.\n\t </p>\n      "
