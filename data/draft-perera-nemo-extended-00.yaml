abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft proposes a solution for extended network mobility support,that
    is a mechanism to enable optimal routing between mobile networknodes and its correspondent
    nodes. The proposed scheme not onlyprovides optimal routing for the mobility aware
    nodes but alsomaintains the benefits of mobility transparency. Our solutionachieves
    route optimization by expecting the Mobile Router to takethe role of an Access
    Router thereby reducing the number of externalsignaling messages a node behind
    the Mobile Router needs to perform.In order to further reduce the number of signaling
    messages beyondthe scope of the mobile network we further propose the Mobile Routerto
    play the role of an Home Agent for NEMO-enabled nodes.</p>"
