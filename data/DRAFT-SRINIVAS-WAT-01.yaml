abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft specifies Web Address Translation (WAT) mechanism.
    The\nscheme allows user to hide or rewrite the backend (and internal)\ndomain
    addresses. The scheme is based on a suite of URL translation\nschemes without
    requiring any of the backend application servers to be \nreconfigured This allows
    to host multiple applications on different \nvirtual servers via a single domain.
    The analogy is similar to NAT \nexcept that the proposed implementation scheme
    operates at the web \napplication layer and brings the value of web address translation
    \nmechanism up into the network than doing the functions only in the \nweb servers
    at the end point.\n\t </p>\n      "
