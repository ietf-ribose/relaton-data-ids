abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Used in a Massive Data Center (MDC), BGP-LS and BGP-SPF need
    link\n   neighbor discovery, liveness, and addressability data.  Link State\n
    \  Over Ethernet protocols provide link discovery, exchange AFI/SAFIs,\n   and
    discover addresses over raw Ethernet.  These data are pushed\n   directly to BGP-LS/SPF,
    obviating the need for centralized controller\n   architectures.  This protocol
    is more widely applicable, and has been\n   designed to support a wide range of
    routing and similar protocols\n   which need link discovery and characterisation.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
