abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a portion of the Management Information
    Base\n   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet\n   community.
    \ In particular, it describes managed objects for key\n   management implementations
    including asymmetric keys, symmetric keys,\n   trust anchors, and cryptographic-related
    firmware.\n\n   This profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and\n
    \  operation of all components of US National Security Systems (SP\n   800-59).
    \ It is also appropriate for other US Government systems that\n   process high-value
    information.  It is made publicly available for\n   use by developers and operators
    of these and any other system\n   deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
