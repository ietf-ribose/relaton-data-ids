abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the need for an interface between Mobile
    IPv6and IPsec/IKE and shows how the two protocols can interwork. Anextension of
    the PF_KEY framework is proposed which allows smooth andsolid operation of IPsec/IKE
    in a Mobile IPv6 environment.This document is heavily based on a previous draft
    [MIGRATE] writtenby Shinta Sugimoto, Masahide Nakamura and Francis Dupont. It
    simplyreuses the MIGRATE mechanism defined in the expired document, removesa companion
    extension (SADB_X_EXT_PACKET) based on implementationfeedback (complexity, limitations,
    ...) and fills the gap by verysimple changes to MIGRATE mechanism. This results
    in a more simpleand consistent mechanism, which also proved to be easier toimplement.
    This document is expected to serve as a continuation of[MIGRATE] work. For that
    reason, the name of the extension has beenkept.PF_KEY MIGRATE message serves as
    a carrier for updated informationfor both the in-kernel IPsec structures (Security
    Policy Database /Security Association Database) and those maintained by the keymanagers.
    This includes in-kernel Security Policy / SecurityAssociation endpoints, key manager
    maintained equivalents, andaddresses used by IKE_SA (current and to be negotiated).
    Theextension is helpful for assuring smooth interworking between MobileIPv6 and
    IPsec/IKE for the bootstrapping of mobile nodes and theirmovements.</p>"
