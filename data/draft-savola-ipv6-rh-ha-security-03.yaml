abstract:
  content: "\t <t>All IPv6 nodes must be able to process Routing Header [IPV6] and
    HomeAddress [MIPV6] Options. With these, packet filter access lists canbe tricked
    (among other things) as the destination and sourceaddresses, respectively, are
    being rewritten as the packet traversesthe network. Some of the security considerations
    of these featuresare analyzed, and a few possible solutions presented. It will
    beshown that with the current architecture, the network-based securitydoes not
    seem to scale to the requirements of Mobile IPv6; it seemspossible that unless
    security is taken seriously when implementingthe nodes, the new Mobile IPv6 requirements
    might not be allowed tobe used at all in some circumstances.</p>"
