abstract:
  content: "\t <t>One of the major advantages in SCTP is supporting multi-homingcommunication.
    If an multi-homed end-point has redundant networkconnections, sctp sessions can
    have a good chance to survive fromnetwork failures by migrating inactive network
    to active one.However, if we follow the SCTP standard, there can be significantdelay
    for the network migration. During this migration period, SCTPcannot transmit much
    data to the destination. This issue drasticallyimpairs the usability of SCTP in
    some situations. This memodescribes the issue of SCTP failover mechanism and discuss
    itssolutions which require minimal modification to the current standard.Status
