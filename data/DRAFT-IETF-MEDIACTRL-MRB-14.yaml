abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF has proposed an architecture
    for\n   controlling media services.  The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is\n
    \  used as the signalling protocol which provides many inherent\n   capabilities
    for message routing.  In addition to such signalling\n   properties, a need exists
    for intelligent, application level media\n   service selection based on non-static
    signalling properties.  This is\n   especially true when considered in conjunction
    with deployment\n   architectures that include 1:M and M:N combinations of Application\n
    \  Servers and Media Servers.  This document introduces a Media Resource\n   Broker
    (MRB) entity which manages the availability of Media Servers\n   and the media
    resource demands of Application Servers.  The document\n   includes potential
    deployment options for an MRB and appropriate\n   interfaces to Application Servers
    and Media Servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
