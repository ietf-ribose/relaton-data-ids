abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC6761 by requiring that the domain\n
    \  \"localhost.\" and any names falling within \".localhost.\" resolve to\n   loopback
    addresses.  This would allow other specifications to join\n   regular users in
    drawing the common-sense conclusions that\n   \"localhost\" means \"localhost\",
    and doesn't resolve to somewhere else\n   on the network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
