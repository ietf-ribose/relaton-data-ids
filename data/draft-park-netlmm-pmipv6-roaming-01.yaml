abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is designed to provide mobility service
    tomobile nodes in the network domain which does not require the mobilenodes to
    be involved in IP mobility management. In other words, thePMIPv6 can transparently
    support roaming within a PMIPv6 domain, i.e.intra-domain roaming, to mobile nodes.
    However, if the mobile nodesmove to other PMIPv6 domains, the nodes should have
    additionalprotocols for the inter-domain roaming although the domains alsoprovide
    the transparent mobility. Hence, an inter-domain roamingsolution would be needed
    for providing transparent mobility to mobilenodes that only move around among
    PMIPv6 domains. This documentspecifies the inter-domain roaming controlled by
    the networksadopting the PMIPv6.</p>"
