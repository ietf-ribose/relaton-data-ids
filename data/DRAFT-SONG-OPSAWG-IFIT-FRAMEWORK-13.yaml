abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As networks increase in scale and network operations become
    more\n   sophisticated, traditional Operation, Administration and Maintenance\n
    \  (OAM) methods, which include proactive and reactive techniques,\n   running
    in active and passive modes, are no longer sufficient to meet\n   the monitoring
    and measurement requirements.  Emerging on-path\n   telemetry techniques which
    provide high-precision flow insight and\n   real-time issue notification are required
    to ensure suitable quality\n   of experience for users and applications, and identify
    faults or\n   network deficiencies before they become critical.\n\n   This document
    outlines a high-level framework to provide an\n   operational environment that
    utilizes existing and emerging on-path\n   telemetry techniques to enable the
    collection and correlation of\n   performance information from the network.  The
    framework identifies\n   the components that are needed to coordinate the existing
    protocol\n   tools and telemetry mechanisms, and addresses key deployment\n   challenges
    for flow-oriented on-path telemetry techniques, especially\n   in carrier networks.\n\n
    \  The framework is informational and intended to guide system designers\n   attempting
    to use the referenced techniques as well as to motivate\n   further work to enhance
    the ecosystem .\n\n\t </p>\n      "
