abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo introduces the architecture of a multicast architecture\n
    \  derived from BIER-TE, which this memo calls Carrier Grade Minimalist\n   Multicast
    (CGM2).  It reduces limitations and complexities of BIER-TE\n   by replacing the
    representation of the in-packet-header delivery tree\n   of packets through a
    \"flat\" BitString of adjacencies with a\n   hierarchical structure of BFR-local
    BitStrings called the Recursive\n   BitString Structure (RBS) Address.\n\n   Benefits
    of CGM2 with RBS addresses include smaller/fewer BIFT in\n   BFR, less complexity
    for the network architect and in the CGM2\n   controller (compared to a BIER-TE
    controller) and fewer packet copies\n   to reach a larger set of BFER.\n\n   The
    additional cost of forwarding with RBS addresses is a slightly\n   more complex
    processing of the RBS address in BFR compared to a flat\n   BitString and the
    novel per-hop rewrite of the RBS address as opposed\n   to bit-reset rewrite in
    BIER/BIER-TE.\n\n   CGM2 can support the traditional deployment model of BIER/BIER-TE\n
    \  with the BIER/BIER-TE domain terminating at service provider PE\n   routers
    as BFIR/BFER, but it is also the intention of this document\n   to expand CGM2
    domains all the way into hosts, and therefore\n   eliminating the need for an
    IP Multicast flow overlay, further\n   reducing the complexity of Multicast services
    using CGM2.  Note that\n   this is not fully detailed in this version of the document.\n\n
    \  This document does not specify an encapsulation for CGM2/RBS\n   addresses.
    \ It could use existing encapsulations such as [RFC8296],\n   but also other encapsulations
    such as IPv6 extension headers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
