abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes DARE Container, a message and file syntax that
    allows an append-only sequence of data frames to be represented with cryptographic
    integrity, signature and encryption enhancements. The format supports data integrity
    checks using digest chains and Merkle trees. The simplest supports efficient write
    operations and efficient read operations in either the forward or reverse direction.
    Support for efficient random-access reads may be provided through the use of binary
    trees or index records appended to the end of the file. This document is also
    available online at http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-dare-container.html
