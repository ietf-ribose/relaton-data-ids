abstract:
  content: "<p>Two solutions are presented to show how to use Dual-Stack Litetransition
    technique in mobile networks: one for Proxy Mobile IPv6and the other for Dual-Stack
    Mobile IPv6. Proxy Mobile IPv6 allowsIPv4 nodes to receive mobility services using
    an IPv4 home address.Mobile node can have IPv4 only operation by sending IPv4
    datagramswhich are encapsulated by the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) at the DS-lite
    home router and and tunneled to Local Mobility Anchor (LMA)which is also DS-lite
    carrier-grade Network Address Translator (NAT).In case of client based mobility
    using DSMIPv6, mobile node is adual-stack node and it can receive an IPv4 home
    address from the homeagent which is co-located with DS-lite carrier-grade NAT.
    Mobilenode (MN) encapsulates IPv4 datagrams in IPv6 which are decapsulatedat the
    home agent (HA). Mobile network could be WiMAX network or3GPP Long Term Evolution
    network.</p>"
