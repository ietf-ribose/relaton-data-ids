abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IS-IS protocol specifies a procedure that if a Link State Protocol\n
    \  Data Unit (LSP) with an incorrect LSP Checksum is received, the\n   corruptedLSPReceived
    circuit event will be generated and the\n   corrupted LSP will be discarded. This
    document aims to emphasize that\n   although this procedure can maintain the network
    stability, it can\n   not diagnose and isolate the source of the network problem.
    In some\n   cases this procedure will create bad effect on the services carried\n
    \  by the network. This document suggests that IS-IS protocol introduce\n   the
    mechanism for link degradation detection and isolation, which\n   should be triggered
    when corrupted LSP is received.\n\t </p>\n      "
