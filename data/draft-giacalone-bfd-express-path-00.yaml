abstract:
  content: "<p>In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financialinformation
    networks (e.g. stock market data providers), networkperformance criteria (e.g.
    latency) have become (or are becoming) as(or more) critical to data path selection
    than other metrics.This document describes extensions to the BFD protocol, such
    thatnetwork performance information can be gathered in a scalablefashion, and
    subsequently used (by other protocols) to make pathselection decisions. These
    extensions will also provide granularperformance monitoring information.</p>"
