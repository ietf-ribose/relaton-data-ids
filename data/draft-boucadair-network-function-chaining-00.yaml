abstract:
- content: "<p>IP networks rely more and more on the combination of advanced functions
    (besides the basic routing and forwarding functions). This document defines a
    solution to enforce Network-Located Function Chaining (NLFC) with minimum requirements
    on the underlying network. The proposed solution allows for Differentiated Forwarding
    (DiffForward): packets are classified at the entry point of an NLFC- enabled network,
    and are then forwarded on a per NLFC map basis.</p>"
