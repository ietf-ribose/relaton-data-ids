abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The rapid growth of the Internet and the increasing number of
    Internet users have resulted in many scaling and growth problems with application
    designs focused on operations at the ends (i.e. the client or the server). This
    has led to a wide deployment of network edge caching proxies as a key strategy
    to address these problems. These systems have been very successful in accelerating
    Web content delivery and reducing the load on origin Web servers.  \n\n\t </p>\n
