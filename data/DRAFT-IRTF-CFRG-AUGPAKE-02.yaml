abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a secure and highly-efficient augmented\n
    \  password-authenticated key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user\n   remembers
    a low-entropy password and its verifier is registered in\n   the intended server.
    \ In general, the user password is chosen from a\n   small set of dictionary whose
    space is within the off-line dictionary\n   attacks.  The AugPAKE protocol described
    here is secure against\n   passive attacks, active attacks and off-line dictionary
    attacks (on\n   the obtained messages with passive/active attacks).  Also, this\n
    \  protocol provides resistance to server compromise in the context that\n   an
    attacker, who obtained the password verifier from the server, must\n   at least
    perform off-line dictionary attacks to gain any advantage in\n   impersonating
    the user.  The AugPAKE protocol is not only provably\n   secure in the random
    oracle model but also the most efficient over\n   the previous augmented PAKE
    protocols (SRP and AMP).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
