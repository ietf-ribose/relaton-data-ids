abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to transport Internet Key
    Exchange\n   Protocol (IKE) and IPsec packets over a TCP connection for traversing\n
    \  network middleboxes that may block IKE negotiation over UDP.  This\n   method,
    referred to as \"TCP encapsulation\", involves sending both IKE\n   packets for
    Security Association establishment and Encapsulating\n   Security Payload (ESP)
    packets over a TCP connection.  This method is\n   intended to be used as a fallback
    option when IKE cannot be\n   negotiated over UDP.\n\n   TCP encapsulation for
    IKE and IPsec was defined in [RFC8229].  This\n   document updates specification
    for TCP encapsulation by including\n   additional calarifications obtained during
    implementation and\n   deployment of this method.  This documents makes RFC8229
    obsolete.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
