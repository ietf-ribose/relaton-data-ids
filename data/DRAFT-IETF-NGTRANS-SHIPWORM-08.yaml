abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We propose here a service that enables nodes located behind one
    or\nseveral IPv4 NATs to obtain IPv6 connectivity by tunneling packets\nover UDP;
    we call this the Teredo service. Running the service\nrequires the help of 'Teredo
    servers' and 'Teredo relays'; the\nTeredo servers are stateless, and only have
    to manage a small\nfraction of the traffic between Teredo clients; the Teredo
    relays\nact as IPv6 routers between the Teredo service and the 'native' IPv6\nInternet.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
