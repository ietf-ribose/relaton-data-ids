abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer
    Security\n   (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application\n
    \  protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP.  Over the\n   last
    few years, several serious attacks on TLS have emerged,\n   including attacks
    on its most commonly used cipher suites and modes\n   of operation.  This document
    provides recommendations for improving\n   the security of deployed services that
    use TLS and DTLS.  The\n   recommendations are applicable to the majority of use
    cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
