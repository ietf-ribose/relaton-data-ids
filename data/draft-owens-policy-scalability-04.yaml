abstract:
- content: "<p>Policy Management System (PMS) scalability and resource utilization
    are important aspects of Policy. Policy management requires centralized management.
    Scalability factors into the requirements since a centralized management system
    is not practical if it doesn't scale well to fit the management needs of the environment.
    The objectives for providing PMS scalability and resource utilization are provided
    in this draft.</p>"
