abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses
    which\n   are not globally unique.  Examples are the addresses designated in\n
    \  RFC1918 for private use within individual sites.\n\n   Devices in such environments
    may occasionally originate reverse DNS\n   queries corresponding to those private-use
    addresses.  Since the\n   addresses concerned have only local significance, it
    is good practice\n   for site administrators to ensure that they are answered
    locally.\n   However, it is not uncommon for such queries to follow the normal\n
    \  delegation path in the public DNS instead of being answered within\n   the
    site.\n\n   It is not possible for public DNS servers to give useful answers to\n
    \  such queries.  In addition, due to the wide deployment of private-use\n   addresses
    and the continuing growth of the Internet, the volume of\n   such queries is large
    and growing.  The AS112 project aims to provide\n   a distributed sink for such
    queries in order to reduce the load on\n   the root and IN-ADDR.ARPA authority
    servers.\n\n   This document describes the steps required to install a new AS112\n
    \  node, and offers advice relating to such a node's operation.\n\t </p>\n      "
