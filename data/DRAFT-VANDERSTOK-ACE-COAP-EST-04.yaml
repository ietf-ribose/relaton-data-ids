abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030] is used as
    a\n   certificate management protocol over HTTPS.\n\n   Low-resource devices often
    use the lightweight Constrained\n   Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] for
    message exchanges.  This\n   document defines how to transport EST payloads over
    secure CoAP (EST-\n   coaps).  This allows low-resource constrained devices to
    re-use\n   existing EST functionality.  Example low-resource use cases for EST\n
    \  are: secure bootstrapping and certificate enrollment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
