abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Back-to-Back User Agents
    (B2BUAs)\n   are often designed to be on the media path, rather than just\n   intercepting
    signaling.  This means that B2BUAs often act on the\n   media path leading to
    separate media legs that the B2BUA correlates\n   and bridges together.  When
    acting on the media path, B2BUAs are\n   likely to receive Session Traversal Utilities
    for NAT (STUN) packets\n   as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
    processing.\n   It is critical that B2BUAs handle these STUN messages properly.\n\n
    \  This document defines behavior for a B2BUA performing ICE processing.\n   The
    goal of this draft is to ensure that ICE used for NAT and\n   Firewall traversal
    of multimedia sessions works when there are B2BUAs\n   in place and the B2BUAs
    handle STUN messages properly.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
