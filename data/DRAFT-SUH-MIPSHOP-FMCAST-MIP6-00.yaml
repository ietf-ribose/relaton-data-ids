abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This document defines the Fast Multicast Protocol for Mobile
    IPv6\n    [2] in the Fast Handovers environments whereby a mobile node (MN)\n
    \   can receive multicast data with reduced loss and delay after\n    handoffs.
    The proposed protocol can be implemented by the simple\n    modification of the
    Fast Handovers protocol [1] so that it can be\n    easily applied to the Fast
    Handovers for Mobile IPv6. This document\n    does not need a certain assumption
    of a specific multicast routing\n    protocol, so that any existing multicast
    routing protocol can be\n    used with the proposed protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
