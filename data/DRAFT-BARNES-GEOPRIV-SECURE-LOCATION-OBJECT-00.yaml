abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Protection of location information is an essential requirement
    of the\n   GEOPRIV architecture.  Since using protocols cannot be relied upon
    to\n   provide adequate protections to the location objects they carry, the\n
    \  location objects themselves must be secured.  This document examines\n   several
    candidates for a Secure Location Object format in the context\n   of GEOPRIV and
    ECRIT security requirements, including both locations\n   by value and by reference.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
