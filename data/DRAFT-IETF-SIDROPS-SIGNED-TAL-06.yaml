abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) [I-D.ietf-sidrops-https-tal] is
    used by\n   Relying Parties (RP) in the RPKI to locate and validate a Trust\n
    \  Anchor (TA) CA certificate used in RPKI validation.  This document\n   defines
    an RPKI signed object for a set of Trust Anchor Keys (TAK),\n   that can be used
    by TA creators and publishers to signal their set of\n   current keys and the
    location(s) of the accompanying CA certificates\n   to RPs, as well as changes
    to this set in the form of revoked keys\n   and new keys, in order to support
    both planned and unplanned key\n   rolls without impacting RPKI validation.\n\n\t
