abstract:
- content: <p>During IETF meetings, individual volunteers often help sessions run
    more smoothly by relaying information back and forth between the physical meeting
    room and an associated textual chatroom. Such volunteers are commonly called "Jabber
    scribes". This document summarizes experience with the Jabber scribe role and
    provides some suggestions for fulfilling the role at IETF meetings.</p>
