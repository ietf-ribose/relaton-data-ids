abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  Online Social Networking (OSN) applications have attracted millions\n
    \ of people over the last few years. Their traffic represents a large\n  part
    of the traffic of the Internet. For instance, Facebook\n  represents near 25 percent
    of the Internet traffic [14][15], and a\n  part of this traffic is exchanged amongst
    groups of end-users which\n  are located in the same geographic area. In this
    document, we\n  introduce a Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture to improve
    the\n  delivery of OSNs contents requested by end-users in the\n  neighbourhood
    of the publishers: Having the knowledge of the social\n  network graph and the
    end-users network location, a SDN-based NDN\n  controller dynamically configures
    the NDN routers to route the\n  interest requests directly between the end-users.\n\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
