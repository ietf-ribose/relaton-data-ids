abstract:
- content: <p>This draft describes the general problem of encryption of the Server
    Name Identification (SNI) parameter. The proposed solutions hide a Hidden Service
    behind a Fronting Service, only disclosing the SNI of the Fronting Service to
    external observers. The draft starts by listing known attacks against SNI encryption,
    discusses the current "co-tenancy fronting" solution, and then presents two potential
    TLS layer solutions that might mitigate these attacks. The first solution is based
    on TLS in TLS "quasi tunneling", and the second solution is based on "combined
    tickets". These solutions only require minimal extensions to the TLS protocol.</p>
