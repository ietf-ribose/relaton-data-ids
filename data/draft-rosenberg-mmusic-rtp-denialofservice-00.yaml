abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP) provides unreliable transportof
    real time media from a sender to one or more recipients. RTPsessions are typically
    set up through signaling protocols such as theSession Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    or the Real Time Streaming Protocol(RTSP). When RTP is set up with these protocols,
    a potential Denialof Service (DoS) attack is introduced. This attack allows an
    attackerto cause a flood of RTP packets to be sent towards a target. Wedescribe
    this attack, and also show how it is effectively preventedusing Interactive Connectivity
    Establishment (ICE), first introducedas a means of handling Network Address Translator
    (NAT) traversal.</p>"
