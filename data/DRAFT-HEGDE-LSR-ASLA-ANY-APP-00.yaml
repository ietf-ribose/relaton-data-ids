abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 8919 and RFC 8920 define Application Specific Link Attributes\n
    \  (ASLA).  Each ASLA includes an Application Identifier Bit Mask.  The\n   Application
    Identifier Bit Mask includes a Standard Application Bit\n   Mask (SABM) and a
    User Defined Application Bit Mask (UDABM).  The\n   SABM and UDABM determine which
    applications can use the ASLA as an\n   input.\n\n   This document introduces
    a new bit to the Standard Application\n   Identifier Bit Mask.  This bit is called
    the Any Application Bit\n   (i.e., the A-bit).  If the A-bit is set, the link
    attribute can be\n   used by any application.  This includes currently defined\n
    \  applications as well as applications to be defined in the future.\n\n\t </p>\n
