abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many proposals have been made to add semantics to IP packets
    by\n   placing additional information existing fields, by adding semantics\n   to
    IP addresses, or by adding fields to the packets.  The intent is\n   to facilitate
    enhanced routing decisions based on these additional\n   semantics to provide
    differentiated paths for different packet flows\n   distinct from simple shortest
    path first routing.  The process is\n   known as Semantic Routing.\n\n   This
    document provides a brief introduction to Semantic Routing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
