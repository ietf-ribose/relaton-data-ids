abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The initial version of the Open Web Authentication Protocol (OAuth\n1.0),
    often referred to as the community addition, included an\nmechanism for putting
    a digital signature (when using asymmetric\nkeys) or a keyed message digest (when
    using symmetric keys) to a\nresource request when presenting the OAuth token.
    \ This cryptographic\nmechanism has lead to lots of discussions, particularly
    about the\nproblems implementers had, the use cases it supports, and the\nbenefit-cost
    tradeoff.\n\nThis document tries to describe the use of the so-called 'OAuth\nSignature'
    mechamism in an unbiased and less emotional way with the\nmain purpose to conclude
    the discussions.\n\t </p>\n      "
