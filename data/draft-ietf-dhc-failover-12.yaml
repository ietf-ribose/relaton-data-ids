abstract:
  content: "\t <t>DHCP [RFC 2131] allows for multiple servers to be operating on asingle
    network. Some sites are interested in running multipleservers in such a way so
    as to provide redundancy in case of serverfailure. In order for this to work reliably,
    the cooperating primaryand secondary servers must maintain a consistent database
    of thelease information. This implies that servers will need to coordinateany
    and all lease activity so that this information is synchronizedin case of failover.This
    document defines a protocol to provide such synchronizationbetween two servers.
    One server is designated the 'primary' server,the other is the 'secondary' server.
    This document also describes away to integrate the failover protocol with the
    DHCP load balancingapproach.</p>"
