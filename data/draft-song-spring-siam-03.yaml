abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an active measurement method for SRv6 which can
    support hop-by-hop and end-to-end measurement on any SRv6 path using existing
    protocols such as IOAM. A packet containing an SRH uses a flag bit to indicate
    the packet is an active probing packet. The measurement information, such as the
    IOAM header and data, is encapsulated in UDP payload, indicated by a dedicated
    port number. The probing packet originates from a segment source node, traverses
    an arbitrary segment path, and terminates at a segment endpoint node, as configured
    by the segment list in SRH. Each segment node on the path, when detecting the
    flag, shall parse the UDP header and the payload. In the case of IOAM, the node
    shall process the IOAM option conforming to the standard procedures defined in
    the IOAM documents. The method is compatible with some other SRv6 active measurement
    proposals and support multiple applications.</p>"
