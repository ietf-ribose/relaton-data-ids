abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an architectural framework for network telemetry
    to address the current and future network operation challenges and requirements.
    As evidenced by some key characteristics and industry practices, network telemetry
    covers technologies and protocols beyond the conventional network Operations,
    Administration, and Management (OAM), so it promises better flexibility, scalability,
    accuracy, coverage, and performance and allows automated control loops to suit
    both today's and tomorrow's network operation requirements. This document clarifies
    the terminologies and classifies the modules and components of a network telemetry
    system. The framework and taxonomy help to set a common ground for the collection
    of related work and provide guidance for future technique and standard developments.</p>"
