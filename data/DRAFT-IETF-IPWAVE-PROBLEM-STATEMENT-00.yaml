abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a problem statement for IP Wireless
    Access in\n   Vehicular Environments (IPWAVE), that is, vehicular networks.  This\n
    \  document addresses the extension of IPv6 as the network layer\n   protocol
    in vehicular networks.  It deals with networking issues in\n   one-hop communication
    between a Road-Side Unit (RSU) and a vehicle,\n   that is, \"vehicle-to-infrastructure\"
    (V2I) communication.  It also\n   deals with one-hop communication between two
    neighboring vehicles,\n   that is, \"vehicle-to-vehicle\" (V2V) communication.
    \ Major issues\n   about IPv6 in vehicular networks include neighbor discovery
    protocol,\n   stateless address autoconfiguration, and DNS configuration for\n
    \  Internet connectivity.  When a vehicle and an RSU have an internal\n   network
    (respectively), the document discusses internetworking issues\n   between two
    internal networks through either V2I or V2V\n   communication.  Those issues include
    prefix discovery, prefix\n   exchange, service discovery, security, and privacy.\n\n\t
