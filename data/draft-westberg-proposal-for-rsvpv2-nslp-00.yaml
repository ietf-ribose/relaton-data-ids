abstract:
  content: "<p>The Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVPv1) has been on the standardstrack
    within the IETF for a number of years. During that time, thelevel of vendor support
    and deployment has been relatively slow,despite the demand for technologies offering
    services with differentlevels of quality of service to their customers. This memo
    seeks toinitiate a dialog about the design of a new version of RSVPv1, calledRSVPv2,
    that meet the requirements formulated by IETF NSIS workinggroup. It also outlines
    the motivation for using RSVP2 as 'next stepin signaling'.The RSVPv2 framework
    uses the layer-split architecture separatingsignaling application and transport
    functions. This concept wasadopted by NSIS WG and the two layers are called NSLP
    NSIS SignalingLayer Protocol (NSLP) and NSIS Transport Layer Protocol (NTLP).
    Thisdraft provides design guidelines and specifications for thedevelopment of
    the RSVPv2 NSLP part.RSVP2-NSLP offers increased modularity and contains less
    mandatoryobjects compared to RSVPv1, which allow lightweight implementationand
    flexible application. The new protocol is extended with PHR andPDR objects that
    makes it possible to use the protocol in differentpart of multi-domain networks
    and use the protocol in DiffServenvironment.</p>"
