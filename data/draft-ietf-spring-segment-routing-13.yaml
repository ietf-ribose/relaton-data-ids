abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. A node
    steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called segments. A segment
    can represent any instruction, topological or service-based. A segment can have
    a semantic local to an SR node or global within an SR domain. SR allows to enforce
    a flow through any topological path while maintaining per-flow state only at the
    ingress nodes to the SR domain. Segment Routing can be directly applied to the
    MPLS architecture with no change on the forwarding plane. A segment is encoded
    as an MPLS label. An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels.
    The segment to process is on the top of the stack. Upon completion of a segment,
    the related label is popped from the stack. Segment Routing can be applied to
    the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of routing header. A segment is encoded
    as an IPv6 address. An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list
    of IPv6 addresses in the routing header. The active segment is indicated by the
    Destination Address of the packet. The next active segment is indicated by a pointer
    in the new routing header.</p>"
