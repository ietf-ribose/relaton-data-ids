abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Presence federation refers to the exchange of presence information\nbetween
    systems.  One of the primary challenges in presence\nfederation is scale.  With
    a large number of watchers in one domain\nobtaining presence for many presentities
    in another, the amount of\nnotification traffic is large.  This document describes
    an extension\nto the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event framework, called
    view\nsharing.  View sharing can substantially reduce the amount of\ntraffic,
    but requires a certain level of trust between domains.  View\nsharing allows the
    amount of presence traffic between domains to\nachieve the theoretical lower bound
    on information exchange in any\npresence system.\n\t </p>\n      "
