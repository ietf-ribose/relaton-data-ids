abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Traffic Engineering (TE) mesh-group is defined as a group
    of Label\n   Switching Routers (LSRs) that are connected by a full mesh of TE\n
    \  LSPs.  Routing protocol (OSPF and IS-IS) extensions facilitate\n   discovery
    of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) LSR TE mesh\n   membership and automate
    the creation of a full mesh of TE Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs).\n\n   This
    document introduces a role-based TE mesh-group that applies to\n   the scenarios
    where full mesh TE LSPs are not necessary and TE LSPs\n   setup depends on the
    roles of LSRs in a TE mesh-group.  Interior\n   Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing
    extensions for automatic discovery of\n   role-based TE mesh membership are defined
    accordingly.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
