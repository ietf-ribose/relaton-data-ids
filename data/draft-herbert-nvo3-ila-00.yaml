abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes identifier-locator addressing (ILA) in
    IPv6 for network virtualization. Identifier-locator addressing differentiates
    between location and identity of a network node. Part of an address expresses
    the immutable identity of the node, and another part indicates the location of
    the node which can be dynamic. In the context of virtualization, a virtual address
    serves as an identifier and the address of the host where the associated tenant
    system currently resides is a locator.</p>"
