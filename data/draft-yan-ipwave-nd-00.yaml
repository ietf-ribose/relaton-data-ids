abstract:
- content: "<p>For C-ACC, platooning and other typical use cases in ITS, a direct
    IP communication between neighbor vehicles is required that poses the following
    two issues: 1) how to discover the neighbor vehicle and the required service;
    and 2) how to discover the link-layer address of the neighbor vehicle and server.
    This draft presents a solution to these problems based on DNS-SD/mDNS [RFC6762][RFC6763].</p>"
