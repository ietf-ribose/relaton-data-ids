abstract:
- content: <p>The Border Gateway Protocol, version 4, (BGP4) provides the means to
    advertise reachability for IP prefixes. This reachability information is propagated
    in a peer-to-peer topology. Sometimes routes are announced to peers for which
    the local peering policy does not permit. And sometimes routes are propagated
    indiscriminantly, once they have been accepted. This document is a requirements
    document for detection of (and prevention of) route leaks. Together with the definitions
    document, it is intended to suggest solutions which meet these criteria, and to
    facilitate evaluation of proposed solutions. The fundamental objective is to "solve
    the route leaks problem".</p>
