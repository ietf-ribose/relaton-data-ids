abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the problem statement for IPv6-based
    vehicle-\n   to-infrastructure networking.  Dedicated Short-Range Communications\n
    \  (DSRC) is standardized as IEEE 802.11p for the wireless media access\n   in
    vehicular networks.  This document addresses the extension of IPv6\n   as the
    network layer protocol in vehicular networks and is focused on\n   the networking
    issues in one-hop communication between a Road-Side\n   Unit (RSU) and vehicle.
    \ The RSU is connected to the Internet and\n   allows vehicles to have the Internet
    access if connected.  The major\n   issues of including IPv6 in vehicular networks
    are neighbor discovery\n   protocol, stateless address autoconfiguration, and
    DNS configuration\n   for the Internet connectivity over DSRC.  Also, when the
    vehicle and\n   the RSU have an internal network, respectively, the document\n
    \  discusses the issues of internetworking between the vehicle's\n   internal
    network and the RSU's internal network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
