abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A transit-only network is defined as a network connecting routers\n
    \  only.  In OSPF, transit-only networks are usually configured with\n   routable
    IP addresses, which are advertised in LSAs but not needed\n   for data traffic.
    \ In addition, remote attacks can be launched\n   against routers by sending packets
    to these transit-only networks.\n   This document presents a mechanism to hide
    transit-only networks to\n   speed up network convergence and minimize remote
    attack\n   vulnerability.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
