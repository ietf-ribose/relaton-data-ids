abstract:
- content: "<p>The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused changes in Internet
    user behavior, particularly during the introduction of initial quarantine and
    work-from-home arrangements. These behavior changes drove changes in Internet
    traffic. The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop to discuss network
    impacts of the pandemic on November 9-13, 2020. The workshop was held to convene
    interested researchers, network operators, network management experts, and Internet
    technologists to share their experiences. The meeting was held online given the
    ongoing travel and contact restrictions at that time. Note that this document
    is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and positions documented
    in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect
    IAB views and positions.</p>"
