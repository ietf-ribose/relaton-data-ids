abstract:
  content: "<p>OSPF is the preferred interior routing protocol of the Internet.It
    is a complex protocol intended to deal with complex networks. While it is a powerful
    mechanism, it does not handle all situations, andits appropriate use may not be
    obvious to beginners. Standards trackdocuments deal with protocol design, but
    deployment of OSPF in manyenterprise networks has been limited by lack of information
    on best current practice information for interior routing. Best Current Practices
    documents have focused on general exterior connectivity. This memorandum is intended
    to complement the protocol specification by describing the experience-based, vendor-independent
    techniques of OSPF and complementary technologies in representative networks.
    Better understanding of the use of OSPF features to help exterior connectivity
    will help reduce the demand for complex user BGP configuration.</p>"
