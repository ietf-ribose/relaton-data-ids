abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF is the preferred interior routing protocol of the Internet. It
    is a complex protocol intended to deal with complex networks. While it is a powerful
    mechanism, it does not handle all situations, and its appropriate use may not
    be obvious to beginners. Standards track documents deal with protocol design,
    but deployment of OSPF in many enterprise networks has been limited by lack of
    information on best current practice information for interior routing. Best Current
    Practices documents have focused on general exterior connectivity. This memorandum
    is intended to complement the protocol specification by describing the experience-based,
    vendor-independent techniques of OSPF and complementary technologies in representative
    networks. Better understanding of the use of OSPF features to help exterior connectivity
    will help reduce the demand for complex user BGP configuration.</p>"
