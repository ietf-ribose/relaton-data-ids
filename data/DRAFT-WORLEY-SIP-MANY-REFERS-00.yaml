abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The REFER method is defined in RFC 3515.  That RFC defines
    the syntax\n   of the REFER request and some of the machinery involved in its\n
    \  execution, but it defines the semantics of the method only so far as\n   to
    specify that the recipient will initiate a request to the target\n   specified
    in the Refer-To header.  But since almost all requests that\n   can be sent by
    the recipient are inherently part of an encompassing\n   UA action that affects
    the state of the recipient in ways that are\n   not directly reflected in SIP
    protocol actions, the standardized\n   action of initiating a request implicitly
    has further consequences\n   which are often not clearly specified.  As a result,
    various SIP\n   call-control proposals assume that a UA receiving a REFER will\n
    \  perform the UA operation that is needed at that moment without\n   specifying
    clearly how the UA recognizes which UA operation is\n   needed.  As a result there
    are now five semantically distinct defined\n   uses of REFER.  All five uses bear
    a family resemblance, and each\n   involves sending a SIP request, but the exact
    meaning of each use is\n   logically independent of the others, and the rules
    by which a UA\n   distinguishes the five cases are at best implicit.\n\t </p>\n
