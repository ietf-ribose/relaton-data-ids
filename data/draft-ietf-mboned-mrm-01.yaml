abstract:
- content: "<p>MRM facilitates automated fault detection and fault isolation in a
    large multicast routing infrastructure. It is designed to alarm a network administrator
    of multicast reachability problems in close to real-time. There are two basic
    types of components in MRM, MRM manager and MRM testers. This document specifies
    the protocol with which the two MRM components communicate, the types of operations
    the testers perform, and information an MRM manager can obtain.</p>"
