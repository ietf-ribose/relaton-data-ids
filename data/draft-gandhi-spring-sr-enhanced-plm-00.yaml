abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. SR is applicable
    to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This
    document defines procedure for Enhanced Performance and Liveness Monitoring (PLM)
    in Segment Routing networks. The procedure uses the probe messages defined in
    RFC 5357 (Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) Light) as well as STAMP
    and is applicable to both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes.</p>"
