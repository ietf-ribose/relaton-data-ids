abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The IETF brings together a technical community that shares acommon
    dedication to making the best possible engineering choicesand protocol standards
    for the Internet as whole. The communityshares a number of common beliefs, which
    create the basis of acommon work style and inform many of the decisions made within
    theIETF. As in many communities of believers, some of these beliefshave been elevated
    to the status of dogma. In the process ofconsidering reform, the treatment of
    these as unquestionable maybe hindering progress. This document challenges some
    of thebeliefs which the author believes have become dogmatic. It alsopresents
    two visions for the evolution of the IETF and articulatesa single belief.</p>"
