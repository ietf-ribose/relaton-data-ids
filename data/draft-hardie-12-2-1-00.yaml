abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF brings together a technical community that shares a common
    dedication to making the best possible engineering choices and protocol standards
    for the Internet as whole. The community shares a number of common beliefs, which
    create the basis of a common work style and inform many of the decisions made
    within the IETF. As in many communities of believers, some of these beliefs have
    been elevated to the status of dogma. In the process of considering reform, the
    treatment of these as unquestionable may be hindering progress. This document
    challenges some of the beliefs which the author believes have become dogmatic.
    It also presents two visions for the evolution of the IETF and articulates a single
    belief.</p>"
