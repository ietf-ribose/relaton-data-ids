abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol (PPSPP) is a protocol
    for\n   disseminating the same content to a group of interested parties in a\n
    \  streaming fashion.  PPSPP supports streaming of both pre-recorded\n   (on-demand)
    and live audio/video content.  It is based on the peer-\n   to-peer paradigm,
    where clients consuming the content are put on\n   equal footing with the servers
    initially providing the content, to\n   create a system where everyone can potentially
    provide upload\n   bandwidth.  It has been designed to provide short time-till-playback\n
    \  for the end user, and to prevent disruption of the streams by\n   malicious
    peers.  PPSPP has also been designed to be flexible and\n   extensible.  It can
    use different mechanisms to optimize peer\n   uploading, prevent freeriding, and
    work with different peer discovery\n   schemes (centralized trackers or Distributed
    Hash Tables).  It\n   supports multiple methods for content integrity protection
    and chunk\n   addressing.  Designed as a generic protocol that can run on top
    of\n   various transport protocols, it currently runs on top of UDP using\n   LEDBAT
    for congestion control.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
