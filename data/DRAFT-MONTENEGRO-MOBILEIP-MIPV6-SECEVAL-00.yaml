abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IESG has identified several security issues with the\ncurrent
    Mobile IPv6 specification [MIPv6]. A subsequent effort\n[MIPv6SecReq] details
    the security threats introduced by\nMIPv6. Two major issues are (1) how to obtain
    a security\nassociation between an arbitrary MN and CN such that the\nbinding
    update (BU) is secure, and, assuming such a mechanism\nis in place, (2) how to
    secure the individual BU messages.\nThis document is an assessment of the proposed
    solutions for\nproblem (1).\n\t </p>\n      "
