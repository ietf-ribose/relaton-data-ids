abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the introduction and evolvement of 5G and other network\n
    \  scenarios, some existing or new customers may require connectivity\n   services
    with advanced characteristics comparing to traditional\n   Virtual Private Networks
    (VPNs).  Such kind of network service is\n   called enhanced VPNs (VPN+).  The
    typical application of VPN+ is to\n   provide network slice services.\n\n   A
    Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual underlay network which\n   consists
    of a set of dedicated or shared network resources allocated\n   from the physical
    underlay network, and is associated with a\n   customized logical network topology.
    \ VPN+ services can be delivered\n   by mapping one or a group of overlay VPNs
    to the appropriate VTNs as\n   the virtual underlay.  Then traffic flows of the
    VPN+ service can be\n   steered onto the TE paths within the VTN.\n\n   The Path
    Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\n   functions in support of
    traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching (MPLS), Generalized MPLS
    (GMPLS) and Segment Routing (SR)\n   networks.\n\n   This document specifies the
    extensions to PCE communication Protocol\n   (PCEP) to carry VTN information in
    the PCEP messages.  The extensions\n   in this document can be used in the basic
    PCE computation, the\n   stateful PCE and the PCE-initiated LSP mechanisms to
    indicate path\n   computation, path status report and path initialization within
    a\n   specific VTN.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
