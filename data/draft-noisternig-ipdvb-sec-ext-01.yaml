abstract:
  content: "<p>The Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) protocol providesan
    efficient mechanism for transporting IP and other network layerprotocol data over
    MPEG-2 networks. Such networks, widely usedespecially for providing digital TV
    services, often use broadcastwireless transmission media, and are hence vulnerable
    to varioustypes of security attacks.This document describes a new mandatory ULE
    extension to protect ULEtraffic using security features such as data confidentiality,
    dataintegrity, data origin authentication, and prevention against replayattacks.
    Additionally, destination addresses may be hidden fromunauthorized receiver devices
    using the identity protection feature.The format of the security extension header
    as well as the processingat receivers and transmitters are described in detail.
    The extensionaims to be lightweight and flexible such that it may be implementedin
    low-cost, resource-scarce transceivers, and different levels ofsecurity may be
    selected.The security extension may be easily adapted to the Generic StreamEncapsulation
    (GSE) protocol, which uses a similar extension headermechanism.</p>"
