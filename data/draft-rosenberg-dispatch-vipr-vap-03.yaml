abstract:
  content: <p>Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a technique forinter-domain
    SIP federation. ViPR hybridizes the PSTN, P2P networks,and SIP, and in doing so,
    addresses the phone number routing and VoIPspam problems that have been a barrier
    to federation. The ViPRarchitecture uses a server, the ViPR server, which performs
    P2P andvalidation services on behalf of call agents, which acts as clientsto the
    server. Such an architecture requires a client/serverprotocol between call agents
    and the ViPR server. That protocol,defined here, is called the ViPR Access Protocol
    (VAP).LegalThis documents and the information contained therein are provided onan
