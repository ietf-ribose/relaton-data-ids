abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The framework for preparation and comparison of internationalized\n
    \  strings (\"PRECIS\") defines several classes of strings for preparation\n   and
    comparison.  In the framework, case mapping is defined because\n   many protocols
    handle case-sensitive or case-insensitive string\n   comparison and therefore
    preparation of the string is mandatory.  As\n   described in the mapping for Internationalized
    Domain Names in\n   Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS problem statement, mappings
    for\n   internationalized strings are not limited to case, but also width\n   mapping
    and mapping of delimiters and other specials can be taken\n   into consideration.
    \ This document provides guidelines for authors of\n   protocol profiles of the
    PRECIS framework and describes several\n   mappings that can be applied between
    receiving user input and passing\n   permitted code points to internationalized
    protocols.  The mappings\n   described here are expected to be applied as Additional
    mapping in\n   the PRECIS framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
