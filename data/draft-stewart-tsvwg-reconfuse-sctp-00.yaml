abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is used to convey different use cases for the Stream
    Reconfiguration draft xxxxxxx. It does not represent a standard nor does it represent
    real applications that are available for download. Instead it illustrates various
    use cases of the stream reconfiguration facilities for SCTP [RFC4960] . It serves
    as a guideline to application developers to show the stream reconfigurations various
    potentials.</p>"
