  content: "\n\t <p>This document aims to present a set of SIP user requirements that\nsupport
    communications for deaf, hard of hearing and speech-impaired\nindividuals. These
    user requirements address the current difficulties\nof deaf, hard of hearing and
    speech-impaired individuals in using\ncommunications facilities, while acknowledging
    the multi-functional\npotential of SIP-based communications.\nA number of issues
    related to these user requirements are further\nraised in this document.\nAlso
    included are some real world scenarios and some technical\nrequirements to show
    the robustness of these requirements on a\nconcept-level.\n\t </p>\n      "
