abstract:
- content: "<p>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general term
    that refers to a toolset that can be used for fault detection and localization,
    and for performance measurement. OAM mechanisms have been defined for various
    layers in the protocol stack, and are used with a variety of protocols. This document
    presents an overview of the OAM mechanisms that have been defined and are currently
    being defined by the IETF, as well as a comparison to other OAM mechanisms that
    have been defined by the IEEE and ITU-T.</p>"
