abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Real-time applications impose very strict requirements on theunderlying
    transmission network that requires a high level of qualityof service (QoS). This
    level of QoS can only be achieved by means ofQoS management on an end-to-end basis
    (i.e., end user to end user),from application to application, potentially across
    many domains, asthe current Internet is a concatenation of many domains, usuallymanaged
    by different QoS administrators (operators).The requirement for end-to-end QoS
    management does not necessarilymean that a single resource reservation protocol
    must be applied end-to-end. In fact it is most likely that the end-to-end QoS
    managementarchitecture will consist of many interoperable and concatenated QoSmanagement
    architectures rather than one global end-to-end QoSinfrastructure. Usually a network
    consists of three network parts,i.e., a host to first hop router, access network
    and the backbone ofthe network. Each of these three network parts imposes differentrequirements
    on the provided QoS solution.This draft describes a framework for NSIS QoS signaling
    in edge toedge networks. The main goal is to provide a skeleton for lightweightedge
    to edge NSIS signaling in a network. This skeleton would be usedas input to the
    NSIS 'Framework signaling architecture'.Even though designed for edge-to-edge
    signaling the applicability ofthis framework is not to be limited only to signaling
    between theedges of a network, but it can be extended in other signalingscenarios
    as well, such as end host - to - end host signaling.The QoS protocol that will
    be applied in an edge to edge network isdenoted as edge-to-edge NSIS protocol.</p>"
