abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. SR is applicable
    to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This
    document defines procedures for Enhanced Performance and Liveness Monitoring of
    end-to-end SR paths including SR Policies for both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes,
    those reduce the deployment and operational complexities in a network.</p>"
