abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an algorithm for the detection and\n
    \  quantification of packet reordering for TCP.  In the absence of\n   explicit
    congestion notification from the network, TCP uses only\n   packet loss as an
    indication of congestion.  One of the signals TCP\n   uses to determine loss is
    the arrival of three duplicate\n   acknowledgments.  However, this heuristic is
    not always correct,\n   notably in the case when paths reorder packets.  This
    results in\n   degraded performance.\n\n   The algorithm for the detection and
    quantification of reordering in\n   this document uses information gathered from
    the TCP Timestamps\n   Option, the TCP SACK Option and its DSACK extension.  When
    a\n   reordering event is detected, the algorithm calculates a reordering\n   extent
    by determining the number of segments the reordered segment\n   was late with
    respect to its position in the sequence number space.\n   Additionally, the algorithm
    computes a second reordering extent that\n   is relative to the amount of outstanding
    data and thus provides a\n   better estimation of the reordering delay when other
    sender state\n   changes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
