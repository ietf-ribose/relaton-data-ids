abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines an extension for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol,
    called RRVS (for "Require Recipient Valid Since"), to provide a method for senders
    to indicate to receivers the time when the sender last confirmed the ownership
    of the target mailbox. This can be used to detect changes of mailbox ownership,
    and thus prevent mail from being delivered to the wrong party. The intended use
    of this facility is on automatically generated messages that might contain sensitive
    information, though it may also be useful in other applications.</p>
