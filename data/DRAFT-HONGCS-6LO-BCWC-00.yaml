abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Wearable devices are among the core technologies for Internet
    of Things\n(IoT).  Recent advances in wireless communication devices have made
    it\npossible to create a wearable network in and around the human body. Such\na
    network can be used for diverse applications such as monitoring human\nbody activities
    and personal entertainments. A typical wearable device\nruns on battery power,
    which is limited and often non-rechargeable.\nTherefore, a low energy operation
    environment is desirable. Emergency\ntraffic management is an important aspect
    of such a network. This\ndocument describes how an out-of-bound external wake
    up based on\non-demand mechanism can work to successfully transmit emergency traffic\nin
    a typical body-centric wearable network (BC-WN).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
