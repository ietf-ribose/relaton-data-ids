abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism named \"CCNinfo\" that
    discovers\n   information about the network topology and in-network cache in\n
    \  Content-Centric Networks (CCN).  CCNinfo investigates: 1) the CCN\n   routing
    path information per name prefix, 2) the Round-Trip Time\n   (RTT) between the
    content forwarder and consumer, and 3) the states\n   of in-network cache per
    name prefix.  CCNinfo is useful to understand\n   and debug the behavior of testbed
    networks and other experimental\n   deployments of CCN systems.\n\n   This document
    is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric Networking\n   Research Group (ICNRG).
    \ This document represents the consensus view\n   of ICNRG and has been reviewed
    extensively by several members of the\n   ICN community and the RG.  The authors
    and RG chairs approve of the\n   contents.  The document is sponsored under the
    IRTF and is not issued\n   by the IETF and is not an IETF standard.  This is an
    experimental\n   protocol and the specification may change in the future.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
