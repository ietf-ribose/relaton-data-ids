abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces alternate ways to perform certain
    operations\n   defined in RFC6378, \"MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear\n
    \  Protection\", and also defines additional behaviors.  This set of\n   modified
    and additional behaviors together with the protocol defined\n   in RFC6378 meets
    the ITU-T's protection switching requirements.\n\n   This document introduces
    capabilities and modes.  A capability is an\n   individual behavior.  The capabilities
    of a node are advertised using\n   the method given in this document.  A mode
    is a particular\n   combination of capabilities.  Two modes are defined in this
    document:\n   Protection State Coordination (PSC) mode and Automatic Protection\n
    \  Switching (APS) mode.\n\n   This document describes the behavior of the PSC
    protocol including\n   priority logic and state machine when all the capabilities
    associated\n   with the APS mode are enabled.\n\n   This document updates RFC6378
    in that the capability advertisement\n   method defined here is an addition to
    that document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
