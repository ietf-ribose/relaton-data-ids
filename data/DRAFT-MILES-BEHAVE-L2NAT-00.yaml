abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a \"Layer2-Aware\" IPv4-to-IPv4 (NAT44)
    Service\nProvider NAT function that identifies subscriber traffic based on IP-\nindependent
    methods such as a link-layer address, VLAN, PPP session,\ntunnel, etc. in order
    to allow one to either avoid \"double-NAT\"\n(NAT444) of subscriber IP traffic
    altogether, the need for additional\n\"Shared Service-Provider\" IPv4 address
    space, or partitioning of RFC\n1918 space between subscribers.  While the mechanisms
    described in\nthis document may be applicable to a variety of network\narchitectures,
    the primary focus is on residential \"fixed-line\"\nInternet access.\n\t </p>\n
