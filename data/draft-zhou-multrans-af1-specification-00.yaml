abstract:
- content: <p>Discussion of the problem of multicast transition has brought out a
    number of scenarios that are the most likely to be encountered in practice. In
    some of these scenarios the IP version supported by the multicast receiver differs
    from that supported by the provider network to which it is attached. In such cases
    an adaptation function is required between the receiver and the network, to mediate
    the signalling and data flows between them. This memo uses the term "Type 1 Adaptation
    Function" (AF1) for such a function. It is written for the purpose of specifying
    the functions performed by an AF1. The scope of this memo is limited to the case
    where flows are unidirectional, from a designated set of sources to a designated
    (and normally much more numerous) set of receivers. The IP television (IPTV) case
    falls within this scope.</p>
