abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is an HTTP authentication method
    with credentials that are not vulnerable to simple phishing attacks, and that
    does not require a server-side password database. It is an alternative to HTTP
    authentication that requires passwords and all the negative attributes that come
    with password-based systems. HOBA can be integrated with account management and
    other applications running over HTTP and supports portability, so a user can associate
    more than one device or origin-bound certificate with the same service. HOBA has
    many other useful features such as a mechanism to handle state-loss if one of
    a user's credentials is lost and a logout mechanism.</p>"
