abstract:
- content: "<p>When split-horizon DNS is deployed by a network, certain domains are
    only resolvable by querying the network-designated DNS server rather than a public
    DNS server. DNS clients which use DNS servers not provided by the network need
    to route those DNS domain queries to the network-designated DNS server. This document
    informs DNS clients of split-horizon DNS, their DNS domains, and is compatible
    with encrypted DNS.</p>"
