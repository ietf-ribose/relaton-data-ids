abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This paper explains the problems created by Network Address
    \n   Translators (NATs) in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlays and recommends some \n
    \  NAT traversal techniques appropriate for P2PSIP networks. Two P2PSIP \n   overlay
    architectures that accommodate the presence of NATs are \n   described and analyzed.
    The first is the super-peer scheme used in a    number of p2p file-sharing systems
    today. The second is a scheme \n   where all peers play an equal role in the overlay.
    \ \n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
