abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial information
    networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network performance criteria (e.g.
    latency) are becoming as critical to data path selection as other metrics. This
    document describes extensions to IS-IS Traffic Engineering Extensions (RFC5305)
    such that network performance information can be distributed and collected in
    a scalable fashion. The information distributed using IS-IS TE Metric Extensions
    can then be used to make path selection decisions based on network performance.
    Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network performance
    information is distributed. The mechanisms for measuring network performance or
    acting on that information, once distributed, are outside the scope of this document.</p>"
