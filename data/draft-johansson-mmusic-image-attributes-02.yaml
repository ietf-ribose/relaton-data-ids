abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes a new generic session setup attribute to
    makeit possible to negotiate different image attributes such as imagesize. A possible
    use case is to make it possible for a e.g a low-endhand-held terminal to display
    video without the need to rescale theimage, something that may consume large amounts
    of memory andprocessing power. The draft also helps to maintain an optimalbitrate
    for video as only the image size that is desired by thereceiver is transmitted.Requirements
    LanguageThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL
    NOT\",\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in
    thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</p>"
