abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF brings together a technical community that shares a\ncommon
    dedication to making the best possible engineering choices\nand protocol standards
    for the Internet as whole.  The community\nshares a number of common beliefs,
    which create the basis of a\ncommon work style and inform many of the decisions
    made within the\nIETF.  As in many communities of believers, some of these beliefs\nhave
    been elevated to the status of dogma.  In the process of\nconsidering reform,
    the treatment of these as unquestionable may\nbe hindering progress.  This document
    challenges some of the\nbeliefs which the author believes have become dogmatic.
    \ It also\npresents two visions for the evolution of the IETF and articulates\na
    single belief.\n\t </p>\n      "
