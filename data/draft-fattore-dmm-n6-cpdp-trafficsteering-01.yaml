abstract:
- content: "<p>Current standardization effort on the evolution of the mobile communication
    system reconsiders the mobile data plane protocol. The IETF DMM Working Group
    has work that proposes and analyzes various protocols as alternative to the GPRS
    Tunneling Protocol for User Plane (GTP-U) for an overlay deployment in between
    the mobile device's assigned data plane anchor and its current radio base station,
    which are denoted as N9 and N3 interfaces. In the view of some future deployment
    and the original intent per the very early DMM WG charter, a mobile device's data
    plane anchor may be highly distributed and re-selected for optimization throughout
    a mobile device's communication with one or more correspondent services. Such
    re-configuration has impact on the packet routing in between the mobile device's
    data plane anchor and the one or multiple data networks hosting the services,
    which is denoted as N6 interface. This draft proposes and discusses a solution
    to control, setup and maintain traffic treatment policy on the cellular communication
    system's N6 interface while taking the UE's PDU session settings per the cellular
    system's control plane, such as QoS and locator information, into account.</p>"
