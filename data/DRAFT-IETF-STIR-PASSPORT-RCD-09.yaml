abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends PASSporT, a token for conveying\n   cryptographically-signed
    call information about personal\n   communications, to include rich meta-data
    about a call and caller\n   that can be signed and integrity protected, transmitted,
    and\n   subsequently rendered to users.  This framework is intended to extend\n
    \  caller and call specific information beyond human-readable display\n   name
    comparable to the \"Caller ID\" function common on the telephone\n   network.
    \ The JSON element defined for this purpose, Rich Call Data\n   (RCD), is an extensible
    object defined to either be used as part of\n   STIR or with SIP Call-Info to
    include related information about calls\n   that helps people decide whether to
    pick up the phone.  This signing\n   of the RCD information is also enhanced with
    a integrity mechanism\n   that is designed to protect the authoring and transport
    of this\n   information between authoritative and non-authoritative parties\n
    \  authoring and signing the Rich Call Data for support of different\n   usage
    and content policies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
