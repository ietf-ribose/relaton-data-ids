abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies \"XTLS\", a protocol for end-to-end encryption\nof
    Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) traffic.  XTLS\nis an application-level
    usage of Transport Layer Security (TLS) that\nis set up using the XMPP Jingle
    extension for session negotiation and\ntransported using any streaming transport
    as the data delivery\nmechanism.  Thus XTLS treats the end-to-end exchange of
    XML stanzas\nas a virtual transport and uses TLS to secure that transport,\nenabling
    XMPP entities to communicate in a way that is designed to\nensure the confidentiality
    and integrity XML stanzas.  The protocol\ncan be used for secure end-to-end messaging
    as well as other XMPP\napplications, such as file transfer.\n\t </p>\n      "
