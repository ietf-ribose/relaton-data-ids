abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many operators may deploy network infrastructures that use\nunidirectional
    links such as broadcast satellite links or digital TV\nlinks (...), which are
    capable of carrying IP traffic. In order to\ntransparently integrate these links
    in their infrastructure, they may\nuse a link-layer tunnelling mechanism such
    as defined in [RFC3077].\nThe purpose of this document is to attempt to identify
    any potential\nsecurity implications related to this mechanism in order to help\noperators
    set up adequate securing mechanisms.\n\t </p>\n      "
