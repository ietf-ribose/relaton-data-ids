abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is noticed that within a data center, unique traffic pattern
    and\n   performance goals for the transport layer exist, as compared to\n   things
    on the Internet.  This draft discusses the usecases for\n   applying transport
    APIs from the perspective of an application\n   running in a data center environment,
    and proposes potential\n   requirements for such API design.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
