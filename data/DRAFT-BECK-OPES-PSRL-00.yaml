abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Proxy services are a new class of applications running on caching
    \nproxies or dedicated application servers, preferably at the network \nedge.
    They are described in [2] and [3]. Execution of proxy services \nis triggered
    by certain conditions. These conditions are service \nspecific and have to be
    provided by the party on behalf of which the \naffected service modules are executed.
    \nThe Proxy Service Rule Specification Language (PSRL) is an XML-based \nlanguage
    that can be used to describe service specific execution \nrules. It allows a service
    provider to tell a proxy caching provider \nwhen and how the services should be
    executed. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
