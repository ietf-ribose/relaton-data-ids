abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As operators struggle to optimize their network for different\n
    \  applications while maximizing network resources usage, there's\n   growing
    business pressure to minimize operational tasks and the\n   deployment time of
    new services.\n\n   New automation paradigms are meant to help reach these goals,\n
    \  including the optimization of network functions through application\n   control.
    \ This control could be signaled directly by an application,\n   through a proxy
    or orchestrated in a centralized manner.\n\n   The purpose of SUPA is to develop
    a methodology by which network\n   services can be managed using standardized
    policy rules.  SUPA will\n   focus in the first phase on inter-datacenter traffic
    management as\n   part of the distributed data center use case, including the
    automated\n   provisioning of site-to-site virtual private networks of various\n
    \  types.  This memo analyses the current state of the art of the\n   industries
    in IETF and outside IETF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
