abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how push notification mechanisms can
    be used\n   to wake up suspended Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents\n
    \  (UAs), in order to be able to receive and generate SIP requests.  The\n   document
    defines new SIP URI parameters, that can be used in a SIP\n   REGISTER request
    to provide push notification information from the\n   SIP User Agent (UA) to the
    SIP entity (realized as a SIP proxy in\n   this document) that will send a push
    request to the push server in\n   order to trigger a push notification towards
    the SIP UA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
