abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This draft discusses authorization models for DNSSEC that
    can be\n    used to determine the relationship of a KEY RR and a DNS RRset\n    in
    the validation process.  Is this key trusted to sign for this\n    data?  Is this
    data trusted because it was signed by this key?\n    This draft defines a number
    of different policies that can be\n    used and what the signing authority of
    keys are in each.  This\n    draft also addresses what steps are recommended in
    the secure\n    DNS resolution process and how the authorization policy is put\n
    \   to use. The ideas and definitions expressed here are based on\n    the authors
    experience in implementing a reference secure\n    resolver.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
