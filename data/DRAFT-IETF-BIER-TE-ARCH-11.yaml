abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes per-packet stateless strict and loose path\n
    \  steered replication and forwarding for Bit Index Explicit Replication\n   packets
    (RFC8279).  It is called BIER Tree Engineering (BIER-TE) and\n   is intended to
    be used as the path steering mechanism for Traffic\n   Engineering with BIER.\n\n
    \  BIER-TE introduces a new semantic for bit positions (BP) that\n   indicate
    adjacencies, as opposed to (non-TE) BIER in which BPs\n   indicate Bit-Forwarding
    Egress Routers (BFER).  BIER-TE can leverage\n   BIER forwarding engines with
    little changes.  Co-existence of BIER\n   and BIER-TE forwarding in the same domain
    is possible, for example by\n   using separate BIER sub-domains (SDs).  Except
    for the optional\n   routed adjacencies, BIER-TE does not require a BIER routing
    underlay,\n   and can therefore operate without depending on an Interior Gateway\n
    \  Routing protocol (IGP).\n\n   As it operates on the same per-packet stateless
    forwarding\n   principles, BIER-TE can also be a good fit to support multicast
    path\n   steering in Segment Routing (SR) networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
