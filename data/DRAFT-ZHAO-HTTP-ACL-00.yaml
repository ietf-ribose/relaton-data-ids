abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In current Internet, HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 protocol has limited methods
    to\ncontrol resource access. Usually it's achieved by modifying the\nconfiguration
    of the cache and proxy to enforce the access control\nrules. When original server's
    access control list (ACL) is updated,\na reconfiguration of cache and proxy systems
    on the chain is\nrequired for the change to take effect, which always impacts
    the\nnetwork stability. This document introduces a new access control\nmechanism,
    which introduces a new header field to dynamically\ncontrol resource access.\n\n\t
