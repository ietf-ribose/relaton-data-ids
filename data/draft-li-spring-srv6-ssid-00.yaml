abstract:
  content: "<p>Segment Routing enables an operator or an application to specify a
    packet processing program. When Segment Routing is applied to IPv6 data plane,
    the list of IPv6 SIDs in SRH makes overhead a big challenge. This document proposes
    Short SID (SSID) and Short SRH (SSRH), and the operations with SSRH. The proposed
    solution tries to reduce the overhead of SRv6 without defining new routing header.</p>"
