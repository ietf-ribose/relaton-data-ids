abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies protocol independent multicast- Next generation
    or simply called PIM-NG. like PIM-SM, PIM-NG uses the underlying unicast routing
    information, but unlike PIM-SM it doesn't necessarily need to build unidirectional
    shared trees rooted at a Rendezvous Point (RP) per group, due to the fact that
    the processes through which a source registers with the Rendezvous Point and a
    host finds the source of the multicast destination groups it needs are done in
    a whole new way. So at some points PIM-NG works faster than its predecessor. Also
    the new Domain concept, unique to PIM-NG, along the RPF check method used in PIM-NG
    specifications provides many features along a robust and flexible control and
    administration over multicast networks.</p>"
