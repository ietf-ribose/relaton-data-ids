abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a solution to encode a slice identifier in MPLS
    in order to distinguish packets that belong to different slices, to allow enforcing
    per network slice policies (.e.g, Qos). The slice identification is independent
    of the topology. It allows for QoS/DiffServ policy on a per slice basis in addition
    to the per packet QoS/DiffServ policy provided by the MPLS Traffic Class field.
    In order to minimize the size of the MPLS stack and to ease incremental deployment
    the slice identifier is encoded as part of the Entropy Label. This document also
    extends the use of the TTL field of the Entropy Label in order to provide a flexible
    set of flags called the Entropy Label Control field.</p>"
