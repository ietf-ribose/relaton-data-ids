abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The BGP4 protocol specifies the selection and propagation of a
    single\nbest path for each prefix.  As defined today BGP has no mechanisms to\ndistribute
    paths other then best path between it's speakers.  This\nbehavior results in number
    of disadvantages for new applications and\nservices.\n\nThis document presents
    an alternative mechanism for solving the\nproblem based on the concept of parallel
    route reflector planes.  It\nalso compares existing solutions and proposed ideas
    that enable\ndistribution of more paths than just the best path.\n\nThis proposal
    does not specify any changes to the BGP protocol\ndefinition.  It does not require
    upgrades to provider edge or core\nrouters nor does it need network wide upgrades.
    \ The authors believe\nthat the GROW WG would be the best place for this work.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
