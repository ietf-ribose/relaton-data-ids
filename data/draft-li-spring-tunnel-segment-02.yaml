abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new type of segment, Tunnel Segment, for
    the segment routing (SR). Tunnel segment can be used to reduce SID stack depth
    of SR path, span the non-SR domain or provide differentiated services. Forwarding
    mechanisms and requirements of control plane and data models for tunnel segments
    are also defined.</p>"
