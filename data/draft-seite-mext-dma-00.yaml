abstract:
- content: <p>Most existing IP mobility solutions are derived from Mobile IP principles
    where a given mobility anchor maintains Mobile Nodes (MNs) binding up-to-date.
    Data traffic is then encapsulated between the mobility anchor and the MN or its
    Access Router. These approaches are usually implemented on a centralised architectures
    where both MN context and traffic encapsulation need to be processed at a central
    network entity, i.e. the mobility anchor. However, one of the trend in mobile
    network evolution is to "flatten" mobility architecture by confining mobility
    support in the access network, e.g. at the access routers level, keeping the rest
    of the network unaware of the mobility events and their support. This document
    discusses the deployment of a Proxy Mobile IP approach in such a flat architecture.
    The solution allows to dynamically distribute mobility functions among access
    routers. The goal is also to dynamically adapt the mobility support of the MN's
    needs by applying traffic redirection only to MNs' flows when an IP handover occurs.</p>
