abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a methodology and framework for quantifying
    the performance impact of monitoring of IP flows on a network device and export
    of this information to a collector. It identifies the rate at which the IP flows
    are created, expired, and successfully exported as a new performance metric in
    combination with traditional throughput. The metric is only applicable to the
    devices compliant with the Architecture for IP Flow Information Export [RFC5470].</p>"
