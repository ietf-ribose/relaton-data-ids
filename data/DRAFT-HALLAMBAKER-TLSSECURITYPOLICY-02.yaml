abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of the TLS Security Policy extension is to prevent\n
    \  downgrade attacks that are not otherwise prevented by the TLS\n   protocol.
    \ In particular, the TLS Security Policy extension may be\n   used to mandate
    support for revocation checking features in the TLS\n   protocol such as OCSP
    stapling.  Informing clients that an OCSP\n   status response will always be stapled
    permits an immediate failure\n   in the case that the response is not stapled.
    \ This in turn prevents\n   a denial of service attack that might otherwise be
    possible.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
