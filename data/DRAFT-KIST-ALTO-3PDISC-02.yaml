abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is
    to\n   provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several\n   hosts
    from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired\n   resource.  ALTO is
    realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an\n   ALTO client can ask for guidance
    it needs to discover one or more\n   ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance.\n\n
    \  This document specifies a procedure for third-party ALTO server\n   discovery,
    which can be used if the ALTO client is not co-located\n   with the actual resource
    consumer, but instead embedded in a third\n   party such as a peer-to-peer tracker.\n\n
    \  This algorithm takes a resource consumer's IP address as argument,\n   performs
    several DNS lookups (for PTR, SOA, and U-NAPTR resource\n   records), and produces
    URIs of ALTO servers that are able to give\n   reasonable ALTO guidance to a resource
    consumer willing to\n   communicate using this IP address.\n\n   Starting with
    draft-kist-alto-3pdisc-02 the algorithm has\n   significantly changed compared
    to previous versions of this document,\n   including draft-kiesel-alto-3pdisc-*
    and\n   draft-ietf-alto-server-discovery-*.  The new algorithm does not try\n
    \  \"DNS tree climbing\" and it does not neccessarily rely on PTR records,\n   i.e.,
    it can also produce results if no PTR records are populated in\n   the DNS, for
    example when IPv6 privacy exensions are in use.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
