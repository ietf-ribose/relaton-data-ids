abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Proposals have been made to include Network Address Translation
    (NAT)\nin IPv6.  Network Address Translation substitutes a source address in\nthe
    outbound Packet headers at the Internet Egress point for one\npresent at the network
    edge.  It then matches the responding packets\nby destination address, and restores
    the original headers.\n\nNAT itself is not a feature.  It is a mechanism which
    provides\nfeatures at an application cost.  This document identifies features\nwhich
    are supplied by NAT in IPv4 and how these features may be\nprovisioned in IPv6.
    \ Both NAT and application-friendly alternatives\nare presented.\n\t </p>\n      "
