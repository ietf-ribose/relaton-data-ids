abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the framework for CCDR traffic engineering within
    Native IP network, using Dual/Multi-BGP session strategy and PCE-based central
    control architecture. The proposed central mode control framework conforms to
    the concept that defined in RFC " An Architecture for Use of PCE and the PCE Communication
    Protocol (PCEP) in a Network with Central Control". The scenario and simulation
    results of CCDR traffic engineering is described in draft "CCDR Scenario, Simulation
    and Suggestion".</p>
