abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines TLVs (type-length-value) structures for representing
    cost values using the generalized MANET packet/message format. A message block
    TLV structure is defined for representing a cost value associated with the local
    node. An address block TLV structure is defined for representing a cost value
    associated with links or a cost value associated with other nodes. Both TLV structures
    are defined for use within MANET protocols. Registry space is created for TLVs
    which follow this format.</p>"
