abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the associativity-based long-livedrouting (ABR)
    protocol for ad hoc mobile networks. It is a simpleand bandwidth-efficient distributed
    routing protocols which doesnot attempt to consistently maintain routing information
    in everynode. In an ad hoc wireless network where mobile hosts are actingas routers
    and where routes are made inconsistent by mobilehosts' movement, we propose an
    Associativity-based routing schemewhere a route is selected based on nodes having
    associativitystates that imply periods of spatial, temporal, connection andsignal
    stability. In this manner, the routes selected are likelyto be long-lived and
    hence there is no need to restartfrequently, resulting in higher attainable throughput.
    Ourproposed protocol is based on source-initiated on-demand routing.Route requests
    are broadcast on a per-need basis. To discovershorten the route discovery time
    when the association property isviolated, the localized- query and quick-abort
    mechanisms arerespectively incorporated into the protocol. The associationproperty
    also allows the integration of ad hoc routing into abase station oriented wireless
    LAN environment, providing thefault tolerance in times of base station failures.
    This draftwill describe the protocol functions and information about packetheaders
    and routing tables.</p>"
