abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a prooftype that uses DNS-based Authentication\n
    \  of Named Entities (DANE) for associating a domain name with an XML\n   stream
    in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  It\n   also defines
    a method that uses DNS Security (DNSSEC) for securely\n   delegating a source
    domain to a derived domain in XMPP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
