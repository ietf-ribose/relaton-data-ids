abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 6374 specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient
    and\n   accurate measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as\n   well
    as related metrics such as delay variation in MPLS networks.\n   This document
    reviews how these mechanisms can be used for Delay and\n   Loss Performance Measurements
    (PM) in Segment Routing (SR) networks\n   with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS), for
    both SR links and end-to-end SR\n   Policies.  The measured performance values
    for SR links are used to\n   compute extended metrics for delay and loss and are
    advertised in the\n   network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
