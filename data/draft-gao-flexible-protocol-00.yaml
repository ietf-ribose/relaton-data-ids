abstract:
- content: "<p>FSP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol that provides
    mobility, multihoming and multipath load balancing support by introducing the
    concept of 'upper layer thread ID', which was firstly suggested in [Gao2002].
    It provides additional transport layer features such as ubiquitous message authentication
    with optional encryption, zero round-trip connection cloning, transmit transaction
    and quad-party shared secret installation facility.</p>"
