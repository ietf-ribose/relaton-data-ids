abstract:
- content: "<p>Under some circumstances operators will need to maintain a dynamic
    record of external address and port assignments made by a Carrier Grade NAT (CGN),
    and will find it feasible and convenient to create such records using SYSLOG (RFC
    5424). The present document standardizes a SYSLOG format to meet that recording
    requirement. It specifies a number of fields that could be a part of the log report,
    leaving it up to operators to select the fields needed for their specific circumstances.
    [*** Subject to discussion*** The log format presented here may also be used by
    PCP server implementations to log the mappings they implement.]</p>"
