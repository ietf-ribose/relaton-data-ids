abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the procedure for creating bindings between
    a\nstateless address (including Stateless Autoconfiguration Address,\nmanually
    configured non-static address, etc) and an anchor (refer to\n[SAVI-framework])
    on SAVI (Source Address Validation Improvements)\ndevice. The bindings can be
    used to filter packets generated on the\nlocal link with forged IP addresses.
    Different from other proposed\nsolution for stateless address (e.g., SAVI-FCFS),
    this solution\nfollows RFC4862 to arbitrate the ownership of address. Supplemental\nbinding
    processes are also specified to cover conditions that cannot\nbe handled by control
    packet snooping.\n\t </p>\n      "
