abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces the concept of Virtual Customer Premises\n
    \  Equipment (VCPE).  Such concept was first proposed in Broadband Forum\n   (BBF)
    as Network Enhanced Residential Gateway (NERG).  The VCPE is\n   the Home Agent
    (HA) of the Mobile Nodes (MN) attached to the physical\n   CPE (pCPE).  In this
    document, we explain the motivation and\n   advantages of VCPE.  Three usecases
    of VCPE is further discussed in\n   the enterprise network, the residential network,
    and the Internet of\n   Things (IoT) Network.  Two models of field deployment
    of VCPE are\n   discussed afterwards.  The models of VCPE decompose the Control
    Plane\n   (CP) and the Data Plane (DP), which makes it easier for the\n   deployment
    of the distributed mobility model.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
