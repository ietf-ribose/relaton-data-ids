abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This specification takes a new approach to extensibility that is
    bothprincipled and a hack. It builds on recent moves to formalise theincreasingly
    common practice where fragmentation in IPv4 more closelymatches that of IPv6.
    The large majority of IPv4 packets are now'atomic', meaning indivisible. In such
    packets, the 16 bits of theIPv4 Identification (IPv4 ID) field are redundant and
    could be freedup for the Internet community to put to other uses, at least withinthe
    constraints imposed by their original use for reassembly. Thisspecification defines
    the process for redefining the semantics ofthese bits. It uses the previously
    reserved control flag in the IPv4header to indicate that these 16 bits have new
    semantics. Great careis taken throughout to ease incremental deployment, even
    in thepresence of middleboxes that incorrectly discard or normalise packetsthat
    have the reserved control flag set.</p>"
