abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft proposes a scheme that allows a mobile node to register
    aprimary care-of address(CoA) as well as one or more non-primary CoAsby sending
    a single binding update message to the home agent and/orcorrespondent node. This
    is achieved by using two new mobilityoptions defined in this draft. Mobile nodes
    that perform duplicateaddress detection procedure, such as Advance DAD and Optimistic
    DADcan benefit from this scheme. Proposed scheme does not require toexchange CoTI
    and CoT messages, usually required for the registrationof each of the non-primary
    CoA(s). It also does not require tomaintain binding management key for each of
    the non-primary CoA(s).Thus the proposed scheme reduces the signaling and processingoverhead
    in Mobile IPv6 networks.</p>"
