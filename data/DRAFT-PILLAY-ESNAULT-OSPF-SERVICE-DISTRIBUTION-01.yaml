abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol is used to carry
    data on\n   behalf of other services using the Opaque Link State Advertisements.\n
    \  The protocol's flooding mechanism is well suited to cover the data\n   propagation
    requirements of services such as Traffic Engineering.\n   The current mechanism
    cannot scale for a large number of services nor\n   satisfy some of their new
    set of requirements.  This document\n   describes a new mechanism in OSPF to support
    service and data\n   distribution for a large number of services, computation
    of preferred\n   service access points and a controlled service data exchange.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
