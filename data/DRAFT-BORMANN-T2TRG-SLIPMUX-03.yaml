abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many research and maker platforms for Internet of Things\n
    \  experimentation offer a serial interface.  This is often used for\n   programming,
    diagnostic output, as well as a crude command interface\n   (\"AT interface\").
    \ Alternatively, it is often used with SLIP\n   (RFC1055) to transfer IP packets
    only.\n\n   The present report describes how to use a single serial interface
    for\n   diagnostics, configuration commands and state readback, as well as\n   packet
    transfer.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
