abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the TCP Authentication Option
    (TCP-AO) to encrypt the TCP segment payload in addition to providing TCP-AO's
    authentication of the payload, TCP header, and IP pseudoheader. This extension
    augments how the packet contents and headers are processed and which keys are
    derived, and adds a capability for in-band coordination of unauthenticated Diffie-
    Hellman key exchange at connection establishment. The extension preserves key
    rollover coordination and protection of long-lived connections.</p>"
