abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document permits usage of Internationalized Email Addresses
    in\n   the EPP protocol.  The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), being\n
    \  developed before appearing the standards for Internationalized Email\n   Addresses
    (EAI), does not support such email addressed.  This\n   document describes an
    EPP extension that allows EAI addresses to be\n   used in contact mapping in the
    EPP protocol.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED on turning to RFC: The document is edited in
    the\n   dedicated github repo [1].  Please send your submissions via GitHub.\n\n\t
