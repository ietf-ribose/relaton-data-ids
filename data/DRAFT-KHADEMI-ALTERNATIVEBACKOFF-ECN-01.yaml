abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo provides an experimental update to RFC3168.  It updates
    the\n   TCP sender-side reaction to a congestion notification received via\n   Explicit
    Congestion Notification (ECN).  ECN-marking can allow a\n   network device to
    signal congestion at a point before a transport\n   experiences congestion loss
    or additional queueing delay.  The\n   updated method is less conservative than
    the TCP reaction in response\n   to loss.  The intention is to achieve good throughput
    when the queue\n   at the bottleneck is smaller than the bandwidth-delay-product
    of the\n   connection.  This is more likely when an Active Queue Management\n
    \  (AQM) mechanism has used ECN to CE-mark a packet, than when a packet\n   was
    lost.  Future versions of this document will discuss SCTP as well\n   as other
    transports using ECN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
