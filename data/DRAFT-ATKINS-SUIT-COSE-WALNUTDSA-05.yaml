abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the conventions for using the Walnut
    Digital\n   Signature Algorithm (WalnutDSA) for digital signatures with the CBOR\n
    \  Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax.  WalnutDSA is a\n   lightweight,
    quantum-resistant signature scheme based on Group\n   Theoretic Cryptography with
    implementation and computational\n   efficiency of signature verification in constrained16807\n
    \  environments, even on 8- and 16-bit platforms.\n\n   The goal of this publication
    is to document a way to use the\n   lightweight, quantum-resistant WalnutDSA signature
    algorithm in COSE\n   in a way that would allow multiple developers to build compatible\n
    \  implementations.  As of this publication, WalnutDSA has not been\n   endorsed
    by the IETF.\n\n   WalnutDSA(TM) and Walnut Digital Signature Algorithm(TM) are\n
    \  trademarks of Veridify Security Inc..\n\n\t </p>\n      "
