abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is difficult to supervise the great deal of Internet of
    Things\n   (IoT) smart terminals which are widely distributed.  Furthermore, a\n
    \  large number of smart terminals (such as IP cameras, access control\n   terminals,
    traffic cameras, etc.) running on the network have high\n   security risks in
    access control.  This draft introduces the\n   technical requirements for access
    management and control of IoT smart\n   terminals, which is used to solve the
    problem of personate and\n   illegal connection in the access process, and enables
    users to\n   strengthen the control of devices and discover devices that is\n
    \  offline in time, so as to ensure the safety and stability of smart\n   terminals
    in the access process.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
