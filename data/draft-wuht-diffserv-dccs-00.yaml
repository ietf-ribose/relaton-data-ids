abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft considers the potentially negative impacts of an increasing
    deployment of non-congestion-controlled or non-responsive traffic on the Internet.
    Traffic unresponsiveness could bring extremely unfairness against responsive TCP
    traffic and great service degradation. Differentiated Services (DS)[5,6], which
    has been proposed by IETF recently, aims to provide a scalable service differentiation
    in the Internet that can be used for differentiated payment. We argue that this
    could add the incentives of their customer to use unresponsive flow to achieve
    better service assurance against the competing traffic.</p>"
