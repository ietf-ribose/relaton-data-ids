abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines extensions to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol
    for allowing a mobile router in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to obtain IP prefixes
    for its attached mobile networks using DHCPv6 prefix delegation. Network-based
    mobility management support is provided for those delegated IP prefixes just as
    it is provided for the mobile node's home address. Even if the mobile router performs
    a handoff and changes its network point of attachment, mobility support is ensured
    for all the delegated IP prefixes and for all the IP nodes in the mobile network
    that use IP address configuration from those delegated IP prefixes.</p>"
