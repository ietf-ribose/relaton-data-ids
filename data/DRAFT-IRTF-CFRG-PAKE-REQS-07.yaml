abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Password-Authenticated Key Agreement (PAKE) schemes are interactive\n
    \  protocols that allow the participants to authenticate each other and\n   derive
    shared cryptographic keys using a (weaker) shared password.\n   This document
    reviews different types of PAKE schemes.  Furthermore,\n   it presents requirements
    and gives recommendations to designers of\n   new schemes.  It is a product of
    the Crypto Forum Research Group\n   (CFRG).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
