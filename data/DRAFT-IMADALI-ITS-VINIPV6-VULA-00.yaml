abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is standardized in
    ISO-3779\n   and ISO-3780.  The VIN is made of 17 alphanumeric characters code\n
    \  that uniquely identifies a vehicle worldwide.  Some public\n   information
    related to a vehicle can be obtained knowing its VIN\n   code.  This code may
    also be used to enable novel vehicular\n   networking communications.\n\n   RFC
    4193 introduces a globally unique IPv6 unicast address format\n   intended for
    local communications, usually inside of a site.  These\n   addresses (ULA) are
    not expected to be routable on the global\n   Internet.  This document introduces
    a method to build a VIN-based\n   IPv6 Prefix that is intended for local communications
    involving more\n   than one hop (VULA).  The VIN-based generated prefix is assured
    to be\n   unique among other VIN-based generated prefixes.  Typically, in a\n
    \  scenario involving several vehicles, each single vehicle (in which\n   one
    Mobile Router is in charge) is capable of generating its own\n   unique infrastructure-independent
    globally-scoped VIN-based IPv6\n   prefix.  This document also describes some
    use cases where VULA could\n   be exploited.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
