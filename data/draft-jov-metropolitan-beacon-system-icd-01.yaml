abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the air interface of the Metropolitan Beacon
    System (MBS) system. MBS provides a high precision, reliable, consistent positioning
    system indoors and in urban canyons, where GNSS solutions are degraded or denied.
    In addition to the high 2-D accuracy, the MBS system architecture also provides
    for high resolution and accuracy in the vertical dimension, with the aid of embedded
    sensors. MBS technology provides a very fast time to first fix (TTFF), on the
    order of ~6 seconds under cold start conditions. Similar to GNSS, MBS technology
    allows computation of the location on the device without any network dependence
    thus enabling a wide variety of standalone applications.</p>"
