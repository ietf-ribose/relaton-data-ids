abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides YANG data models that describe performance monitoring
    telemetry and scaling intent mechanism for TE-tunnels and Virtual Networks (VN).
    The models presented in this draft allow customers to subscribe to and monitor
    their key performance data of their interest on the level of TE-tunnel or VN.
    The models also provide customers with the ability to program autonomic scaling
    intent mechanism on the level of TE-tunnel as well as VN.</p>"
