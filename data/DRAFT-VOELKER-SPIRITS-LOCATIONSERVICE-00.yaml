abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SPIRITS services are those originating in the PSTN and involving\ninteractions
    between the PSTN and the Internet.  This document describes\nhow SPIRITS supports
    those aspects of location services whereby the PSTN\nwireless network provides
    location related events to internet\napplications requesting them.  An example
    of such an event is a mobile\nstation entering a pre-specified geographic zone.
