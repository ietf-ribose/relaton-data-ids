abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies IPv4 compatibility mechanisms that can
    be\nimplemented by IPv6 hosts and routers.  These mechanisms include\nproviding
    complete implementations of both versions of the Internet\nProtocol (IPv4 and
    IPv6), and tunneling IPv6 packets over IPv4\nrouting infrastructures.  They are
    designed to allow IPv6 nodes to\nmaintain complete compatibility with IPv4, which
    should greatly\nsimplify the deployment of IPv6 in the Internet, and facilitate
    the\neventual transition of the entire Internet to IPv6.\n\t </p>\n      "
