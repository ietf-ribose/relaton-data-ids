abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Documents published in 2013 have revealed several classes of\n
    \  \"pervasive\" attack on Internet communications.  In this document we\n   develop
    a threat model that describes these pervasive attacks.  We\n   start by assuming
    a completely passive adversary with an interest in\n   indiscriminate eavesdropping
    that can observe network traffic, then\n   expand the threat model with a set
    of verified attacks that have been\n   published.  Based on this threat model,
    we discuss the techniques\n   that can be employed in Internet protocol design
    to increase the\n   protocols robustness to pervasive attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
