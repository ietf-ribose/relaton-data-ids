abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of this memo is to highlight the new QoS requirements
    of\n   the multiparty communication services in terms of measurement\n   parameters.
    \ It tries to derive a set of parameter metrics from the\n   existing one-way
    metrics in IP Performance metrics IPPM [2] [3] [4] \n   for the multiparty communications
    to present these new requirements.\n   These parameter metrics are supposed to
    provide methods and rules for\n   engineers to measure and judge the QoS of the
    multiparty\n   communications.\n\t </p>\n      "
