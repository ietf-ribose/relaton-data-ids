abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It has already been confirmed that software-defined networking
    (SDN)\n   can make the networks more programmable, adaptive and application\n
    \  aware. However, due to the large-scale and geographically-distributed\n   nature
    of wide-area networks (WAN), the scalability could become a\n   critical issue
    if we incorporate SDN for WANs (i.e., realizing SD-\n   WANs). In this paper,
    we design and implement a novel network system\n   that can leverage source routing
    with the protocol-oblivious\n   forwarding (POF) to facilitate efficient e-Health
    data transfers with\n   low setup latency. We develop the POF-based source routing
    protocol\n   to realize a pipeline based packet processing procedure, which can\n
    \  replace the table-lookup based approach in traditional SDN networks\n   and
    make the forwarding plane more efficient. The proposed scheme is\n   demonstrated
    experimentally, and the results verify that with it, the\n   flow-tables installed
    in each core switches in a POF-controlled SD-\n   WAN can be minimized and the
    path setup latency of traffic flows can\n   be reduced significantly as well.\n\n\n\t
