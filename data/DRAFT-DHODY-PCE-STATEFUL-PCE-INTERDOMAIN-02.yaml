abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information
    about\n   Label Switched Path (LSP) characteristics and resource usage within
    a\n   network in order to provide traffic engineering path calculations for\n
    \  its associated Path Computation Clients (PCCs).  Furthermore, PCEs\n   are
    used to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label\n   Switched Paths
    (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
    networks across multiple domains.\n\n   This document describes general considerations
    for the deployment of\n   stateful PCE(s) in inter-domain scenarios including
    inter-area and\n   inter-AS.  The inter-layer considerations will be described
    in a\n   separate document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
