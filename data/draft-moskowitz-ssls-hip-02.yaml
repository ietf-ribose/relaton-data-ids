abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies the details for establishing and maintaining a
    Secure Session Layer Services (SSLS) association between two applications using
    the Host Identity Protocol (HIP [RFC7401]). This is primarily achieved by adding
    SSLS specific HIP parameters for the HIP base exchange. The SSLS association state
    and security boundaries are also defined.</p>"
