abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) technology enables
    the establishment of a logical link-aggregation connection with a redundant group
    of independent nodes. The purpose of multi-chassis LAG is to provide a solution
    to achieve higher network availability, while providing different modes of sharing/balancing
    of traffic. EVPN standard defines EVPN based MC-LAG with single-active and all-active
    multi-homing load-balancing mode. The current draft expands on existing redundancy
    mechanisms supported by EVPN and introduces support of port-active load-balancing
    mode. In the current document, port-active load-balancing mode is also referred
    to as per interface active/standby.</p>"
