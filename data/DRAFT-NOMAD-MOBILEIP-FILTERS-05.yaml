abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Filters for Mobile IPv4 bindings enables mobile nodes to associate
    \none or more Filters with mobility bindings during registration. \nFlows that
    match a Filter will be processed as defined by the \nFilter. In this manner, it
    is possible for a mobile node to \ndistribute flows or packets of a flow among
    its available points of \nattachment, or to request that such flows are dropped
    before \nreaching the mobile node.\n\t </p>\n      "
