abstract:
- content: '<p>The "alert" namespace of uniform resource names (URNs) can be used
    in the Alert-Info header field of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) requests and
    responses to inform a VoIP telephone (user agent) of the characteristics of the
    call that the user agent has originated or terminated. The user agent must resolve
    the URNs into a signal, that is, it must select the best available signal to present
    to its user to indicate the characteristics of the call. RFC 7462 describes a
    non-normative algorithm for signal selection. This document describes a more efficient
    alternative algorithm: A user agent''s designer can, based on the user agent''s
    signals and their meanings, construct a finite state machine (FSM) to process
    the URNs to select a signal in a way that obeys the restrictions given in the
    definition of the "alert" URN namespace.</p>'
