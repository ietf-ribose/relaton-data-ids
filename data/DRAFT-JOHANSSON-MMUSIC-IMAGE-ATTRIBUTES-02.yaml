abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a new generic session setup attribute to
    make\nit possible to negotiate different image attributes such as image\nsize.
    \ A possible use case is to make it possible for a e.g a low-end\nhand-held terminal
    to display video without the need to rescale the\nimage, something that may consume
    large amounts of memory and\nprocessing power.  The draft also helps to maintain
    an optimal\nbitrate for video as only the image size that is desired by the\nreceiver
    is transmitted.Requirements Language\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n\t </p>\n      "
