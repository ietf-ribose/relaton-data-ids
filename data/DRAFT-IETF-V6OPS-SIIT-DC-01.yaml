abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation\n
    \  (SIIT) algorithm in an IPv6 Internet Data Centre (IDC).  In this\n   deployment
    model, traffic from legacy IPv4-only clients on the\n   Internet is translated
    to IPv6 when reaches the IDC operator's\n   network infrastructure.  From that
    point on, it is treated just as if\n   it was traffic from any other IPv6-capable
    end user.  This\n   facilitates a single-stack IPv6-only network infrastructure,
    as well\n   as efficient utilisation of public IPv4 addresses.\n\n   The primary
    audience is IDC operators who are deploying IPv6, running\n   out of available
    IPv4 addresses, and/or feel that dual stack causes\n   undesirable operational
    complexity.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
