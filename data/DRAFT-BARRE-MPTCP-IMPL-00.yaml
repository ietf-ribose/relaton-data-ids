abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multipath TCP is a major extension to TCP that allows improving
    the\nresource usage in the current Internet by transmitting data over\nseveral
    TCP subflows, while still showing one single regular TCP\nsocket to the application.
    \ This document describes our experience in\nwriting a MultiPath TCP implementation
    in the Linux kernel and\ndiscusses implementation guidelines that could be useful
    for other\ndevelopers who are planning to add MultiPath TCP to their networking\nstack.\n\t
