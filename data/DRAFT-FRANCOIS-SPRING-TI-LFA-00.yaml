abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a Fast Reroute (FRR) approach aimed
    at\n   providing link and node protection of node and adjacency segments\n   within
    the Segment Routing (SR) framework.  This FRR behavior builds\n   on proven IP-FRR
    concepts being LFAs, remote LFAs (RLFA), and remote\n   LFAs with directed forwarding
    (DLFA).  It extends these concepts to\n   provide guaranteed coverage in any IGP
    network.  We accommodate the\n   FRR discovery and selection approaches in order
    to establish\n   protection over post-convergence paths from the point of local\n
    \  repair, dramatically reducing the operator's need to control the tie-\n   breaks
    among various FRR options.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
