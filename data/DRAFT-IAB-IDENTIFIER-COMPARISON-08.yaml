abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Identifiers such as hostnames, URIs, IP addresses, and email\n
    \  addresses are often used in security contexts to identify security\n   principals
    and resources.  In such contexts, an identifier supplied\n   via some protocol
    is often compared using some policy to make\n   security decisions such as whether
    the security principal may access\n   the resource, what level of authentication
    or encryption is required,\n   etc.  If the parties involved in a security decision
    use different\n   algorithms to compare identifiers, then failure scenarios ranging\n
    \  from denial of service to elevation of privilege can result.  This\n   document
    provides a discussion of these issues that designers should\n   consider when
    defining identifiers and protocols, and when\n   constructing architectures that
    use multiple protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
