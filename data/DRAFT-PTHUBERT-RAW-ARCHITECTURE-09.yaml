abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) provides for high reliability\n
    \  and availability for IP connectivity over a wireless medium.  The\n   wireless
    medium presents significant challenges to achieve\n   deterministic properties
    such as low packet error rate, bounded\n   consecutive losses, and bounded latency.
    \ This document defines the\n   RAW Architecture.  It builds on the DetNet Architecture
    and discusses\n   specific challenges and technology considerations needed to
    deliver\n   DetNet service utilizing scheduled wireless segments and other media,\n
    \  e.g., frequency/time-sharing physical media resources with stochastic\n   traffic.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
