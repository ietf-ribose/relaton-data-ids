abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.
    \ SR is\n   applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6\n
    \  (SRv6) data planes.  This document specifies procedure for sending\n   and
    processing probe query and response messages for Performance\n   Measurement (PM)
    in Segment Routing networks.  The procedure uses the\n   messages defined in RFC
    5357 (Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol\n   (TWAMP) Light) and Simple Two-Way
    Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)\n   for Delay Measurement, and uses the messages
    defined in this document\n   for Loss Measurement.  The procedure specified is
    applicable to SR-\n   MPLS and SRv6 data planes and is used for both Links and
    end-to-end\n   SR Policies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
