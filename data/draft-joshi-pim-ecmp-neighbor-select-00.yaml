abstract:
- content: "<p>A Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) router uses local forwarding
    table to select the upstream PIM neighbor towards the source or Rendezvous Point
    (RP). A router need to choose one upstream PIM neighbor from the list of PIM neighbors
    if the route for a source or RP is an Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) route. Currently
    PIM routers use vendor specific algorithm to choose one neighbor. This may lead
    to unnecessary wastage of network resources. This draft first explains the need
    for a standard algorithm to select a PIM neighbor with ECMP route and then suggest
    such an algorithm.</p>"
