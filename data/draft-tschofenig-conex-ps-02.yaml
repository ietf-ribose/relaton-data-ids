abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The increasingly ubiquitous availability of broadband, together
    withflat-rate pricing, have made for increasing congestion problems onthe network,
    which are often caused by a small number of usersconsuming a large amount of bandwidth.
    In some cases, building outmore capacity to handle this new congestion may be
    infeasible orunwarranted. As a result, network operators have sought other waysto
    manage congestion both from their own users and from othernetworks. These different
    types of solutions have differentstrengths and weaknesses, but all of them are
    limited in a number ofkey ways.This document discusses the problems created for
    operators by high-consuming users and describes the strengths and weaknesses of
    anumber of techniques operators are currently using to cope with highbandwidth
    usage. The discussion of these solutions ultimately pointsto a need for a new
    kind of congestion accounting.</p>"
