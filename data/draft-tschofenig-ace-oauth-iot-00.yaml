abstract:
- content: "<p>As Internet of Things (IoT) deployments increase steadily the need
    for a better user experience for handling the authentication and authorization
    tasks in constrained environments increases. While several technologies have been
    developed already that allow federated access to protected resource the nature
    of IoT deployments requires care with the limited resources available on many
    of these devices. This document defines a new OAuth 2.0 authorization grant for
    the interaction between constrained clients and resource servers to obtain access
    tokens for access to protected resources. It does so by leveraging prior work
    on OAuth 2.0, CoAP, and DTLS.</p>"
