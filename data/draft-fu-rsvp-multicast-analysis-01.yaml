abstract:
  content: "<p>RSVP version 1 has been designed for optimum support multicast.However,
    in reality multicast is being used much less frequently thananticipated. Still,
    even for unicast (one sender, one receiver)full-fledged multicast-enabled RSVP
    signaling must be used. Aspointed out in the NSIS requirement draft, multicast
    would not benecessarily required for an NSIS signaling protocol. This draftanalyses
    ingredients of RSVP Version 1 which are affected bymulticast, and derives how
    these ingredients may look like ifmulticast is not supported in the generic RSVP
    signaling protocol andadapt related functionalities accordingly - we call the
    resultingfeature set 'RSVP Lite', a potentially more light-weight version ofRSVP.</p>"
