abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this document we consider the problem of key management in
    a\nmobile wireless networking environment, such as a dynamic, dis-\ntributed setting
    in which command and control nodes move along with\nindividual users.  In this
    scenario, data must be securely multicast\nfrom one source to many users, requiring
    that users be properly\nkeyed.\n\t </p>\n      "
