abstract:
- content: "<p>Remote Triggered Black Hole (RTBH) filtering is a popular and effective
    technique for the mitigation of denial of service attacks. This document expands
    upon destination-based RTBH filtering by outlining a method to enable filtering
    by source address as well. It also defines a standard BGP community for black
    hole prefixes to simplify associated semantics.</p>"
