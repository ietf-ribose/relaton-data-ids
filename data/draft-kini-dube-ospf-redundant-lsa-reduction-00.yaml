abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In a link state routing protocol like OSPF, the network and CPUbandwidth
    consumed by the routing protocol is primarily topropagate and process information
    about the network topologyand changes in the topology. The 'flooding procedure'
    of OSPFpropagates the topology change information to all routers in thenetwork.
    This procedure delivers the information, multiple timesto a router (depending
    on the source of the information and itsconnectivity) even though it needs to
    be delivered only once.The resultant wastage of network bandwidth and CPU processingtime
    reduces the scalability of OSPF. In some cases like a fullyconnected subgraph
    this redundant information increases by an orderof magnitude (from O(n) to O(n^2)).
    This draft describes atechnique to reduce this redundant information for a fullyconnected
    subgraph of the network.</p>"
