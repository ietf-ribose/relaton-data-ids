abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As an optical signal progresses along its path it may be altered
    by\n   the various physical processes in the optical fibers and devices it\n   encounters.
    When such alterations result in signal degradation,\n   these processes are usually
    referred to as \"impairments\". These\n   physical characteristics may be important
    constraints to consider in\n   path computation process in wavelength switched
    optical networks.\n\n   This document provides PCEP extensions to support Impairment
    Aware\n   Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) in wavelength switched\n
    \  optical networks.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
