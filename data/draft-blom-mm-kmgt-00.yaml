abstract:
- content: "<p>For conversational multimedia to take off, many important aspects have
    still to be fully investigated. The security framework is one of them. While some
    proposals on how to secure the media traffic have appeared, a key management solution
    has still to be developed. It should take into account the conversational multimedia
    type of scenario and an heterogeneous communication environment, in which thin
    clients are used. Such a scenario will result in a number of challenging requirements.
    The purpose of this document is to describe the scenario and to list constraints
    and requirements on a key management scheme for media traffic in conversational
    multimedia.</p>"
