abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 (RFC7341) is a mechanism for dynamically\n
    \  configuring IPv4 for use as an over-the-top service in a IPv6-only\n   network.
    \ Softwires are an example of such a service.  For DHCPv4\n   over DHCPv6 (DHCP
    4o6) to function with some IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire\n   mechanisms and deployment
    scenarios (e.g., RFC7596 or RFC7597), the\n   operator needs to know the IPv6
    address that the client will use as\n   the source of IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire tunnel.
    \ This address, in\n   conjunction with the client's IPv4 address, and (in some
    deployments)\n   the Port Set ID are used to create a binding table entry in the\n
    \  operator's softwire tunnel concentrator.  This memo defines a DHCPv6\n   option
    to convey IPv6 parameters for establishing the softwire tunnel\n   and a DHCPv4
    option (to be used only with DHCP 4o6) to communicate\n   the source tunnel IPv6
    address between the DHCP 4o6 client and\n   server.  It is designed to work in
    conjunction with the IPv4 address\n   allocation process.\n\n   DHCPv6 Options
    for Configuration of Softwire Address and Port-Mapped\n   Clients (RFC7598) describes
    a deterministic DHCPv6 based mechanism\n   for provisioning softwires.  This document
    updates \"DHCPv6 Options\n   for Configuration of Softwire Address and Port-Mapped
    Clients\"\n   (RFC7598), allowing OPTION_S46_BR (90) to be enumerated in the DHCPv6\n
    \  client's Option Request Option (ORO) request and appear directly\n   within
    subsequent messages sent by the DHCPv6 server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
