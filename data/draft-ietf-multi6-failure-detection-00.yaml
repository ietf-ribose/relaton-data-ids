abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses locator pair selection and failure detection mechanisms
    for the IPv6 multihoming feature being developed in the Multi6 working group.
    Elements of this document may also be useful for developing the details of the
    MOBIKE or HIP multihoming mechanisms. The draft also discusses the roles of a
    multihoming protocol versus network attachment functions at IP and link layers.</p>"
