abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The DTNRG research group has defined many protocols such as Bundle\nProtocol
    and Licklider.  The specifications of these protocols\ncontain fields that are
    subject to a registry.  For the purpose of\nits research work, the group created
    adhoc registries[DTNRGREG].  As\nthe specifications are stable and have multiple
    interoperable\nimplementations, the group would like to handoff the registries
    to\nIANA for official custidy.  This document describes the actions\nneeded to
    be executed by IANA.\n\t </p>\n      "
