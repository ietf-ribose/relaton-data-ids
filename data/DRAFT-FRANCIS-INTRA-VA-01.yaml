abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT)\nstresses
    the global routing system in a number of ways.  One of the\nmost costly stresses
    is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade router\nhardware simply because the FIB has
    run out of space, and router\nvendors must design routers that have adequate FIB.
    \ FIB suppression\nis an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT loading
    selected\nRIB entries into the FIB.  Virtual Aggregation (VA) allows ISPs to\nshrink
    the FIBs of any and all routers, easily by an order of\nmagnitude with negligible
    increase in path length and load.  FIB\nsuppression deployed autonomously by an
    ISP (cooperation between ISPs\nis not required), and can co-exist with legacy
    routers in the ISP.\n\t </p>\n      "
