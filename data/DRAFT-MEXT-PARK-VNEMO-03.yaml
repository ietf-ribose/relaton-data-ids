abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A mobile network can be multihomed as described in [RFC4980].
    \ This\n   document describes the experimental result of service differentiation\n
    \  using multihoming with multiple prefixes.  The multiple prefixes in\n   IPv6
    NEMO implements multiple virtual mobile networks on a single\n   physical NEMO.
    \ The multiple virtual mobile networks provide service\n   differentiation on
    a single mobile network.  Each mobile network node\n   inside the mobile network
    prioritizes for service differenciation.\n   It can be differenciated among the
    virutal mobile networks or\n   forwarding traffic from each virtual mobile network
    to different\n   access networks.  In this experiment, a mobile router with multiple\n
    \  interfaces can make connection to several access networks\n   simultaneoulsly.\n\n\t
