abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Constrained nodes are devices which are limited in terms of\n
    \  processing power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission\n   capacity.
    \ Due to these constraints, commonly used security protocols\n   are not easily
    applicable.  Nevertheless, an authentication and\n   authorization solution is
    needed to ensure the security of these\n   devices.\n\n   During the lifecycle
    of a constrained device, responsibility for\n   managing authorization policies
    for the constrained device may change\n   several times.  To ensure the security
    of the constrained devices,\n   the authorization to authorize must be transferred
    to the new\n   principal in a secure way.\n\n   Resource-constrained nodes benefit
    from delegating defined\n   authentication- and authorization-related tasks to
    less-constrained\n   devices called Authorization Managers, thus limiting the
    hardware\n   requirements of the security solution for the constrained devices.\n\n
    \  This document defines how security relationships between constrained\n   nodes
    and their Authorization Managers can be established and managed\n   in a RESTful
    way, thus providing for a flexible authorization\n   solution for the whole lifecycle
    of a constrained node.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
