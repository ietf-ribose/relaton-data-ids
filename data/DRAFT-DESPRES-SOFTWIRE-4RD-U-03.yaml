abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an automatic tunneling mechanism tailored
    for\n   residual deployment of public IPv4 via IPv6 networks (the reverse of\n
    \  6rd whose purpose is rapid deployment of IPv6 via IPv4).  In order to\n   deal
    with the IPv4-address shortage, customers can be assigned shared\n   IPv4 addresses
    with statically assigned restricted port sets.\n   Operation is stateless, with
    neither per-connection nor per-customer\n   state needed in network nodes.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
