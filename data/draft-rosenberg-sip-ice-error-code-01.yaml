abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) defines an extension
    tothe offer/answer model used by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).This extension
    allows endpoints to traverse firewalls and NATs.However, in cases where highly
    restrictive firewalls exist, or wherenetwork failures have occurred, ICE may not
    be able to successfullyfind a media path. This document provides an error response
    codethat can be used with SIP in these cases.</p>"
