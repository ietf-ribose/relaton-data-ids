abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines a new content format encoding that can be
    used to\n   combine several different media types into a single CoAP message-\n
    \  body.  The proposed encoding provides a cheap framing facility aimed\n   at
    minimizing the overhead bits as much as possible.\n\n   Its main use case is for
    applications whose purpose is as simple as\n   just pulling together a number
    of known content formats, with the\n   caveat that their juxtaposition must not
    raise any semantic ambiguity\n   on the receiving side (i.e. strictly ordered,
    with no optional\n   parts).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
