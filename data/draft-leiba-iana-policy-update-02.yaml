abstract:
- content: "<p>Section 4.1 of BCP 26 (RFC 5226) discusses possible IANA registration
    policies that might be used in documents with IANA actions, and defines some well-known
    policy terms. This document clarifies the usage of these terms, and discourages
    the use of overly restrictive registration policies. The author is working with
    IANA on an update to BCP 26, and this document's contents will be folded into
    that effort. While that's in process, this draft will be kept alive for reference.</p>"
