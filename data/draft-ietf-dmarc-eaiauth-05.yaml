abstract:
- content: "<p>SPF (RFC7208), DKIM (RFC6376), and DMARC (RFC7489) enable a domain
    owner to publish e-mail authentication and policy information in the DNS. In internationalized
    e-mail, domain names can occur both as U-labels and A-labels. This specification
    updates the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC specifications to clarify which form of internationalized
    domain names to use in those specifications.</p>"
