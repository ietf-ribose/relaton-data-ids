abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To mitigate the IPv6 header overhead in edge networks, this
    draft\n   proposes to use short hierarchical addresses excluding the network\n
    \  prefix within edge networks.  An edge network can be organized into a\n   hierarchical
    architecture containing one or more levels of networks.\n   The border routers
    for each hierarchical level are responsible for\n   address augmenting and pruning.
    \ Specifically, the top-level border\n   routers convert the internal IP header
    to and from the standard IPv6\n   header.  This draft presents an incrementally
    deployable scheme\n   allowing packet header to be effectively compressed in edge
    networks\n   without affecting the network interoperability.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
