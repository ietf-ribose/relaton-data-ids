abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Applications using the Internet already have access to some
    topology\n   information of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks.  For\n   example,
    views to Internet routing tables at looking glass servers\n   are available and
    can be practically downloaded to many network\n   application clients.  What is
    missing is knowledge of the underlying\n   network topologies from the point of
    view of ISPs.  In other words,\n   what an ISP prefers in terms of traffic optimization
    -- and a way to\n   distribute it.\n\n   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) Service provides\n   network information (e.g., basic network location
    structure and\n   preferences of network paths) with the goal of modifying network\n
    \  resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving\n   application
    performance.  The basic information of ALTO is based on\n   abstract maps of a
    network.  These maps provide a simplified view,\n   yet enough information about
    a network for applications to\n   effectively utilize them.  Additional services
    are built on top of\n   the maps.\n\n   This document describes a protocol implementing
    the ALTO Service.\n   Although the ALTO Service would primarily be provided by
    ISPs, other\n   entities such as content service providers could also operate
    an ALTO\n   Service.  Applications that could use this service are those that\n
    \  have a choice to which end points to connect.  Examples of such\n   applications
    are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
