abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   More and more operators have deployed or are about to deploy
    IPv6\n   transition technologies such as DS-lite, MAP, LAFT6, etc.  The\n   fundamental
    elements of these technologies are Network Address\n   Translation (NAT) and Tunneling.
    \ The elements of these transition\n   technologies may be subject to a number
    of attacks, unless\n   appropriate mitigations are in place.  This memo discusses
    the\n   security implications of the aforementioned points, and additionally,\n
    \  provides a number of operational mitigations that could be deployed\n   against
    these attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
