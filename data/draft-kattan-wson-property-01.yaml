abstract:
- content: "<p>Wavelength Switched Optical Network will extend GMPLS protocols to
    to manage wavelength across DWDM optical networks. In many situations the control
    plane needs to know additional information regarding wavelengths. The current
    proposal identify a way to carry some property information along with wavelength
    information. Control plane can leverage the knowledge of such properties during
    its operations.</p>"
