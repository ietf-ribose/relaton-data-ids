abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document describes the encoding of BGP UPDATE messages
    for the\n   SDWAN edge node discovery.\n\n   In the context of this document,
    BGP Route Reflector (RR) is the\n   component of the SDWAN Controller that receives
    the BGP UPDATE from\n   SDWAN edges and in turns propagates the information to
    the intended\n   peers that are authorized to communicate via the SDWAN overlay\n
    \  network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
