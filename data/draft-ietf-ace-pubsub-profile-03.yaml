abstract:
  content: "<p>This specification defines an application profile for authentication
    and authorization for publishers and subscribers in a constrained pub-sub scenario,
    using the ACE framework. This profile relies on transport layer or application
    layer security to authorize the pub- sub clients to the broker. Moreover, it describes
    application layer security for publisher-subscriber communication going through
    the broker.</p>"
