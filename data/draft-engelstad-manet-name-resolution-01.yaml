abstract:
- content: "<p>The most common user applications for data communication (including
    web browsing and e-mail) lack a method for name resolution in multi- hop wireless
    ad-hoc networks of mobile nodes (MANETs). While the Domain Name System (DNS) works
    well on the fixed Internet, it represents a centralized approach to name resolution,
    which is not suitable for MANETs. This document specifies a straightforward solution
    for name resolution lookup in on-demand MANETs, i.e. MANETs that are routed with
    a reactive routing protocol, such as DSR [DSR] or AODV [AODV]. Names are resolved
    locally within the MANET with a mechanism similar to multicast DNS or LLMNR on
    a link. Although names resolved locally normally will have preference, MANET nodes
    that have access to external networks may complement the local name resolution
    by injecting into the MANET lookup results resolved by a conventional DNS server.
    The proposed solution applies equally well to IPv4 or IPv6.</p>"
