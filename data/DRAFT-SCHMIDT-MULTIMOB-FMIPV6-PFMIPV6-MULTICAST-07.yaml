abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Fast handover protocols for MIPv6 and PMIPv6 define mobility\n
    \  management procedures that support unicast communication at reduced\n   handover
    latency.  Fast handover base operations do not affect\n   multicast communication,
    and hence do not accelerate handover\n   management for native multicast listeners.
    \ Many multicast\n   applications like IPTV or conferencing, though, are comprised
    of\n   delay-sensitive real-time traffic and will benefit from fast handover\n
    \  execution.  This document specifies extension of the Mobile IPv6 Fast\n   Handovers
    (FMIPv6) and the Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6\n   (PFMIPv6) protocols
    to include multicast traffic management in fast\n   handover operations.  This
    multicast support is provided first at the\n   control plane by a management of
    rapid context transfer between\n   access routers, second at the data plane by
    an optional fast traffic\n   forwarding that MAY include buffering.\n\n\t </p>\n
