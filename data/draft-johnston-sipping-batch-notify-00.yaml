abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies the requirements and mechanism for a SIP events
    extension where bulk SIP event information can be shared between two peers both
    with the ability and authority to act as notifiers for this information. An example
    application use case is the transition of event state information during a backup/recovery
    sequence between event state servers. This document is targeted at addressing
    server overflow conditions that include the possibilities of the size of individual
    notification messages getting excessive and the processing of state information
    by both the subscriber and notifier also becoming excessive.</p>"
