abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents advice on certain routing-related design\n
    \  choices that arise when designing IPv6 networks (both dual-stack and\n   IPv6-only).
    \ The intended audience is someone designing an IPv6\n   network who is knowledgeable
    about best current practices around IPv4\n   network design, and wishes to learn
    the corresponding practices for\n   IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
