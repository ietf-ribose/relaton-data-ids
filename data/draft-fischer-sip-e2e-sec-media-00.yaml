abstract:
- content: "<p>The end-to-end security properties of DTLS-SRTP depend on the authenticity
    of the certificate fingerprint exchanged in the signalling channel. In current
    approaches the authenticity is protected by SIP-Identity or SIP-Identity-Media.
    These types of signatures are broken if intermediaries like Session Border Controllers
    in other domains change specific information of the SIP header or the SIP body.
    The end-to-end security property between the originating and terminating domain
    is lost if these intermediaries re-sign the SIP message and create a new identity
    signature using their own domain credentials. This document defines a new signature
    type 'Fingerprint-Identity' which is exchanged in the signalling channel. Fingerprint-Identity
    covers only those elements of a SIP message necessary to authenticate the certificate
    fingerprint and to secure media end-to-end. It is independent from SIP-Identity
    and SIP-Identity-Media and can be applied in parallel to them.</p>"
