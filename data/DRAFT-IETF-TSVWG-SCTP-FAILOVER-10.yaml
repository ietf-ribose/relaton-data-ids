abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the major advantages of SCTP is the support of multi-homed\n
    \  communication.  A multi-homed SCTP end-point has the ability to\n   withstand
    network failures by migrating the traffic from an inactive\n   network to an active
    one.  However, if the failover operation as\n   specified in RFC4960 is followed,
    there can be a significant delay in\n   the migration to the active destination
    addresses, thus severely\n   reducing the effectiveness of the SCTP failover operation.\n\n
    \  This document complements RFC4960 by the introduction of a new path\n   state,
    the Potentially Failed (PF) path state, and an associated new\n   failover operation
    to apply during a network failure.  The algorithm\n   defined is called SCTP Potentially
    Failed Algorithm, SCTP-PF for\n   short.  In addition, the document complements
    RFC4960 by introducing\n   alternative switchover operation modes for the data
    transfer path\n   management after the recovery of a failed primary path.  These
    modes\n   can allow improvements in the performance of the operation in some\n
    \  network environments.  The implementation of the additional\n   switchover
    operation modes is an optional part of SCTP-PF.\n\n   The procedures defined in
    the document require only minimal\n   modifications to the current specification.
    \ The procedures are\n   sender-side only and do not impact the SCTP receiver.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
