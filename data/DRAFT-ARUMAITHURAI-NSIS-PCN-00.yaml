abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a Quality of Service model (QOSM),
    for\n   networks that support the use of the Controlled load service over a\n
    \  Diffserv cloud using pre-congestion notification.  Ths is a technique\n   to
    perform admission control in a Diffserv network by measuring the\n   congestion
    level in a domain.  New flows are admitted only if the\n   current congestion
    level is below the allowed threshold.  When the\n   controlled load in a domain
    exceeds a certain threshold, the egress\n   prompts the ingress to pre-empt certain
    flows.  This proposal is\n   based on the proposal made by B.Briscoe et al., for
    the extension of\n   RSVP to support the Controlled load service over a Diffserv
    cloud\n   using pre-congestion notification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
