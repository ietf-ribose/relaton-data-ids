abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describe and discuss the text encodings of Public-Key\n
    \  Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates, PKIX Certificate\n   Revocation
    Lists (CRLs), PKCS #10 Certificate Request Syntax, PKCS #7\n   structures, and
    Attribute Certificates.  The text encodings are well-\n   known, implemented by
    several applications and libraries, and is\n   widely deployed.  This document
    is intended to articulate the de-\n   facto rules that existing implementations
    operate by, and to give\n   recommendations that will promote interoperability
    going forward.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
