abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines new attributes to facilitate Proxy Mobile
    IPv6\noperations using RADIUS infrastructure.  The RADIUS interactions take\nplace
    when the Mobile Node attaches, authenticates and authorizes to\na Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 domain.  Furthermore, this document also defines\na RADIUS based interface
    between the Local Mobility Anchor and the\nRADIUS server for authorizing received
    initial Proxy Binding Update\nmessages for the mobility service session.  In addition
    to the\nmobility session setup related RADIUS interaction, this document\ndefines
    the baseline for both the Mobile Access Gateway and the Local\nMobility Anchor
    generated accounting.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft is submitted
