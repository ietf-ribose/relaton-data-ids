abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We introduce a new class of Model Based Metrics designed to
    assess if\n   a complete Internet path can be expected to meet a predefined Target\n
    \  Transport Performance by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to\n   successive
    subpaths.  The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly\n   applied to critical
    infrastructure, such as network interconnections\n   or even individual devices,
    to accurately detect if any part of the\n   infrastructure will prevent paths
    traversing it from meeting the\n   Target Transport Performance.\n\n   Model Based
    Metrics rely on peer-reviewed mathematical models to\n   specify a Targeted Suite
    of IP Diagnostic tests, designed to assess\n   whether common transport protocols
    can be expected to meet a\n   predetermined Target Transport Performance over
    an Internet path.\n\n   For Bulk Transport Capacity, the IP diagnostics are built
    on test\n   streams that mimic TCP over the complete path and statistical\n   criteria
    for evaluating the packet transfer statistics of those\n   streams.  The temporal
    structure of the test stream (bursts, etc)\n   mimic TCP or other transport protocol
    carrying bulk data over a long\n   path.  However they are constructed to be independent
    of the details\n   of the subpath under test, end systems or applications.  Likewise
    the\n   success criteria evaluates the packet transfer statistics of the\n   subpath
    against criteria determined by protocol performance models\n   applied to the
    Target Transport Performance of the complete path.\n   The success criteria also
    does not depend on the details of the\n   subpath, end systems or application.\n\n
    \  Model Based Metrics exhibit several important new properties not\n   present
    in other Bulk Transport Capacity Metrics, including the\n   ability to reason
    about concatenated or overlapping subpaths.  The\n   results are vantage independent
    which is critical for supporting\n   independent validation of tests by comparing
    results from multiple\n   measurement points.\n\n   This document does not define
    the IP diagnostic tests, but provides a\n   framework for designing suites of
    IP diagnostic tests that are\n   tailored to confirming that infrastructure can
    meet the predetermined\n   Target Transport Performance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
