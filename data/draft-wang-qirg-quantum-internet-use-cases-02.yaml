abstract:
- content: "<p>The Quantum Internet has the potential to improve Internet protocol
    and application functionality by incorporating quantum information technology
    into the infrastructure of the overall Internet. In this document, we provide
    an overview of some applications expected to be used on the Quantum Internet,
    and then categorize them using the standard telecommunications classification
    of control plane versus data plane functionality. Other classification schemes
    are also possible and discussed briefly. We then provide detailed use cases for
    selected applications. The intent of this document is to provide a common understanding
    and framework of applications and use cases for the Quantum Internet.</p>"
