abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath transmission is regarded as an effective way to improve the
    quality of service of data delivery. This document defines a multipath message
    transport protocol based on application level relay (MPMTP-AR), which is a special
    profile of multipath transport protocol suite defined in Multipath Transport System
    Based on Application-level Relay (MPTS-AR). MPMTP-AR provides reliable data delivery
    service over multiple paths. This document discusses related message format and
    mechanism to support MPMTP-AR.</p>"
