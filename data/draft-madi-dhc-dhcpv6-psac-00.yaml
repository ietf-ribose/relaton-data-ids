abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IPSec [RFC2401]is pervasive in many scenarios to build the channel
    ofsecurity mechanism to protect the communication between the host andthe local
    servers, such as DNS recursive name server [RFC1304]. Inthe public wireless access
    environment, an extra trust relationshipconfiguration between the roaming host
    and the local server, manuallyor by IKE [RFC2409], is indispensible.DHCP is typically
    the first protocol executed by a mobile host whenit enters a new network, so this
    document present an extension toDHCPv6 to piggyback the parameters needed for
    IPSec, avoiding thedelay invited by manual configuration of security association
    or IKEinteraction for IPSec.</p>"
