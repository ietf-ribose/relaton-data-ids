abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a web transfer\n
    \  protocol designed for resource limited nodes in constrained networks.\n   For
    securing the protocol, CoAP defines a binding to Datagram\n   Transport Layer
    Security (DTLS) with four security modes.  One of\n   them is the Certificate
    mode where the device has an asymmetric key\n   pair with an X.509 certificate.
    \ However, the intrinsic properties of\n   x.509 certificates impede the application
    on the resource constrained\n   nodes.  This draft describes the necessary adjustments
    and derives a\n   modified profile for X.509 certificates to cope with the resource\n
    \  limitations of low-power low-performing devices\n\n\t </p>\n      "
