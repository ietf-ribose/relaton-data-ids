abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) defines a set of topological \"segments\"
    within\n   an IGP topology to enable steering over a specific SR path.  These\n
    \  segments are advertised by the link-state routing protocols (IS-IS\n   and
    OSPF).\n\n   This document describes extensions to the IS-IS that enable\n   advertising
    Slice Aggregate SR segments that share the same IGP\n   computed forwarding path
    but offer a forwarding treatment (e.g.\n   scheduling and drop policy) that is
    associated with a specific Slice\n   Aggregate.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
