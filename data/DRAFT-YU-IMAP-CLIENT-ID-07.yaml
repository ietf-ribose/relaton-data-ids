abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)\n
    \  service extension called \"CLIENTID\" which provides a method for\n   clients
    to indicate an identity to the server.\n\n   This identity is an additional token
    that may be used for security\n   and/or informational purposes, and with it a
    server may optionally\n   apply heuristics using this token.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
