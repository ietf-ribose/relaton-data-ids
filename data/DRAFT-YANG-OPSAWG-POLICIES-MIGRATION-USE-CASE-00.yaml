abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Draft I-D.gu-opsawg-policies-migration makes general problem\n
    \  statement on state migration in Data Center (DC).  This use case\n   draft
    is composed to introduce the states on network devices that\n   need to be migrated
    with VM and the scenario that requires states\n   migration.  The authors of this
    draft make a survey among several DC\n   providers to make sure the use cases
    introduced in this draft are\n   real problem from these DC providers' perspective,
    instead of\n   technology driven.  The purpose of this draft is to figure out
    which\n   states should be considered in the beginning stage of state migration\n
    \  effort.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
