abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An efficient encoding for Certificate Revocation Lists is described\n
    \  based on a Disjoint Set encoding technique. When applied to the\n   population
    of currently issued certificates enroled in the\n   Certificate Transparency Notary
    network, the data set was reduced by\n   97% without introduction of false positives
    or false negatives.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
