abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For the Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)\n
    \  linear protection capable of 1+1 and 1:1 protection has already been\n   defined.
    \ That linear protection mechanism has not been designed for\n   handling multiple,
    simultaneously occuring failures, i.e. multiple\n   failures that affect the working
    and the protection entity during the\n   same time period.  In these situations
    currently defined protection\n   mechanisms would fail.\n\n   This document introduces
    use cases and requirements for mechanisms\n   that are capable of protecting against
    such failures.  It does not\n   specify a multi-failure protection mechanism itself.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
