abstract:
- content: "<p>The current work of SIPREC will soon finish. As conferences are the
    key requirement for some environments, it is worth to explore several extensions
    and additional functionality to support multimedia conference recording. SIPREC
    is not sufficient to record all the conference sessions via certain interactive
    media channels, like multi-user chat or screen sharing. This draft tries to show
    the use cases for multimedia conference recording and the requirements for how
    to work well under SIPREC mechanism. The requirements ask for extensions to SIP
    that will manage delivery of RTP media sessions, including content media defined
    by [RFC4796] , and MSRP media sessions to a recording device. The recorded media
    sessions are all SIP-based.</p>"
