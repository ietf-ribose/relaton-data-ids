abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for BGP that would help
    minimize\n   the negative effects on routing caused by BGP restart.  An End-of-RIB\n
    \  marker is specified and can be used to convey routing convergence\n   information.
    \ A new BGP capability, termed \"Graceful Restart\n   Capability\", is defined
    that would allow a BGP speaker to express its\n   ability to preserve its forwarding
    state during BGP restart, as well\n   as to convey its intention of generating
    the End-of-RIB marker upon\n   the completion of its initial routing update.  Finally,
    procedures\n   are outlined for temporarily retaining routing information across
    a\n   TCP session termination/re-establishment.\n\n   The mechanisms described
    in this document are applicable to all\n   routers, both those with the ability
    to preserve the forwarding state\n   during BGP restart and those without (although
    the latter need to\n   implement only a subset of the mechanisms described in
    this\n   document).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
