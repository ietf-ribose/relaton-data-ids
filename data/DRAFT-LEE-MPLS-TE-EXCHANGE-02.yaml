abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The  current  link  state  routing protocols flood link states
    to all\nrouters so that routers have the information required to compute  the\nshortest
    \ paths  to route packets on a hop by hop basis. However, for\nthe purpose of
    establishing MPLS paths, constraint  path  computation\nis  only  performed at
    certain nodes, for instance, at the node where\npath setup is triggered or  at
    \ the  head-end  of  a  loosely  routed\nsegment  that  crosses  a network (or
    area) boundary. In addition, it\nnot possible to have all required constraints
    present in all nodes in\na  network,  nor  is it always feasible for nodes setting
    up paths to\ncompute the constraint paths themselves, a notable example is when
    \ a\npath  traverses  network  or area boundary.  These reasons motivate a\nsolution
    using a 'subset' of routers (called  route  exchangers),  to\ncollect  constraint
    \ information  and  exchange  it  with other route\nexchangers. Route exchangers
    store traffic  engineering  link  states\nand  other types of constraint information
    and compute on demand, the\nexplicit routes required by routers establishing paths.
    \ Hence,  link\nstate  information  need  only  be distributed to the subset of
    nodes\nthat help compute constraint paths in the network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
