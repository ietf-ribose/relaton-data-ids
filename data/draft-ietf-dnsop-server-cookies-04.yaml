abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Cookies, as specified in [RFC7873], are a lightweight DNS transaction
    security mechanism that provide limited protection to DNS servers and clients
    against a variety of denial-of-service and amplification, forgery, or cache poisoning
    attacks by off-path attackers. This document provides precise directions for creating
    Server Cookies so that an anycast server set including diverse implementations
    will interoperate with standard clients. This document updates [RFC7873] with
    * suggestions for constructing Client Cookies in a privacy preserving fashion,
    * precise instructions for constructing Server Cookies deprecating the methods
    described in [RFC7873], and * suggestions on how to update a server secret. An
    IANA registry listing the methods and associated pseudo random function suitable
    for creating DNS Server cookies is created, with the method described in this
    document as the first and as of yet only entry.</p>"
