abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT) [RFC6013] deter spoofing of\n
    \  connections and prevent resource exhaustion, eliminating Responder\n   (server)
    state during the initial handshake.  The Initiator (client)\n   has sole responsibility
    for ensuring required delays between\n   connections.  The cookie exchange may
    carry data, limited to inhibit\n   amplification and reflection denial of service
    attacks.\n\n   This specification provides an optional rapid restart facility
    for\n   persistent connections.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
