abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests a localized mobility solution controlled by
    the network within a local mobility domain. The proposed solution is based on
    Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIP) technique and employs a PMIP client that generates a
    Proxy Binding Update message. The solution allows for a clean separation between
    the bearer and signaling paths, and reuse of MIPv6 home agent as the local mobility
    anchor. The security association between the network elements for executing the
    local mobility is also discussed.</p>"
