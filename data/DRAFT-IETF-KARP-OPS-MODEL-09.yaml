abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF is engaged in an effort to analyze security of routing\n
    \  protocol authentication according to design guidelines discussed in\n   RFC
    6518.  Developing an operational and management model for routing\n   protocol
    security that works with all the routing protocols will be\n   critical to the
    deployability of these efforts.  This document gives\n   recommendations to operators
    and implementors regarding management\n   and operation of router authentication.
    \ These recommendations will\n   also assist protocol designers in understanding
    management issues\n   they will face.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
