abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a practical mechanism to implement
    IP fast\n   reroute using multiple viable loop-free next hops, which are not\n
    \  necessarily shortest path to a destination. Upon a link failure,\n   all the
    destinations reachable via the primary nexthop will be \n   forwarded to pre-computed
    alternative loop free nexthops, if any,\n   without much delay. The mechanism
    does not impose any new protocol\n   message/capability exchange. The mechanism
    does not use any \n   tunneling techniques. It is shown that simple changes to
    existing\n   IGP shortest path computation and routing table structures are  \n
    \  sufficient to achieve the desired functionality. More over, routers\n   which
    implement the proposed mechanism can co-exist and can be fully\n   backward compatible
    with existing unmodified routers.\n\t </p>\n      "
