abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Existing security mechanisms for the Protocol Independent Multicast
    -\n   Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) routing protocol mandates the use of IPsec to\n   provide
    message authenticity and integrity.  This draft proposes an\n   embedded authentication
    mechanism to facilitate data origin\n   authentication and integrity verification
    for PIM packets in the\n   cases where IPsec cannot be applied.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
