abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes text aiming at providing clarification
    to RFC\n2598. As explained in [CHA], the primary motivation is that the\ndefinition
    of EF PHB given in RFC 2598 does not match the intuition\nof the EF PHB, and has
    been determined to be unimplementable in a\nmanner compliant with the definition.\n\n[CHA]
    gives a new rigorous definition of EF PHB, using a recurrence\nequation that determines
    a bound for time at the which a packet must\nexit the node, given that the arriving
    times and the exit times of\nall packets are recorded.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
