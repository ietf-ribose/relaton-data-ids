abstract:
- content: "<p>Actual EAP methods provide authentication services based on the use
    of certificates, secret keys or passwords. These methods, excepting the tunneling
    ones, exchange peer identity in clear text. Moreover, some of these methods do
    not enable the ability to exchange channel binding information. They do not, however,
    define a common encoding of the credential protection or of the channel binding
    or of. This document defines AVPs to securely exchange data related to the peer
    identity, when an EAP method deriving keys is deployed.</p>"
