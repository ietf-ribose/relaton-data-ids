abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document reports lessons learned from an experimental
    deployment\n   of service chaining with Segment Routing over the IPv6 data plane\n
    \  (SRv6) at an event network.  The service chaining part of the network\n   was
    comprised of four SRv6-capable nodes (three products from\n   different vendors),
    five SRv6 proxy nodes (two products from\n   different vendors and three open
    source software), and six services.\n   This network was deployed at Interop Tokyo
    2019, and it successfully\n   provided network connectivity and services to all
    the exhibitors and\n   visitors on the event.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
