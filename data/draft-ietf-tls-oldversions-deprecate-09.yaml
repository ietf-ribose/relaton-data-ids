abstract:
- content: "<p>This document, if approved, formally deprecates Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346). Accordingly, those documents
    (will be moved|have been moved) to Historic status. These versions lack support
    for current and recommended cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms, and various
    government and industry profiles of applications using TLS now mandate avoiding
    these old TLS versions. TLSv1.2 has been the recommended version for IETF protocols
    since 2008, providing sufficient time to transition away from older versions.
    Removing support for older versions from implementations reduces the attack surface,
    reduces opportunity for misconfiguration, and streamlines library and product
    maintenance. This document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version 1.0 (RFC6347),
    but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version 1.1. This document updates
    many RFCs that normatively refer to TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.1 as described herein. This
    document also updates the best practices for TLS usage in RFC 7525 and hence is
    part of BCP195.</p>"
