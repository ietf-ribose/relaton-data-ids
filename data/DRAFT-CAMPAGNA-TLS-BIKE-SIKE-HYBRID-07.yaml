abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Hybrid key exchange refers to executing two independent key
    exchanges\n   and feeding the two resulting shared secrets into a Pseudo Random\n
    \  Function (PRF), with the goal of deriving a secret which is as secure\n   as
    the stronger of the two key exchanges.  This document describes\n   new hybrid
    key exchange schemes for the Transport Layer Security 1.2\n   (TLS) protocol.
    \ The key exchange schemes are based on combining\n   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
    (ECDH) with a post-quantum key\n   encapsulation method (PQ KEM) using the existing
    TLS PRF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
