abstract:
- content: <p>Path MTU Discovery between end-host-devices/Virtual-Machines/servers/
    workloads connected over an EVPN-Overlay Network in an Datacenter/Campus/enterprise
    deployment, is a problem, yet to be resolved in the standards forums. It needs
    a converged solution to ensure optimal usage of network and computational resources
    of the underlay routers/switches forming the basis of the overlay network. There
    is concerted guidelines presented in [RFC4459]. The overlay connectivity can pan
    across various sites (geographically seperated or collocated) for realizing a
    Datacenter Interconnect or intersite VPNs between campus sites (buildings, branch
    offices etc). This literature intends to solve problem of icmp error propagation
    from an underlay routing/switching device to an end-host (hooked to EVPN overlay),
    thus facilitating "accurate MTU" learnings.</p>
