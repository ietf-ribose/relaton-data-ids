abstract:
- content: "<p>Next-generation optical network configurations are increasingly becoming
    a complex mix of SONET/SDH and DWDM-based direct data-over- fiber links. As SONET/SDH
    networks are primarily geared for TDM support, transporting IP/ATM packets along
    with PDH (Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy) channels (such as T1/T3/E1/E3) results
    in inefficient utilization of provisioned bandwidth. In addition, hybrid networks
    of ring and mesh configurations for short and long haul LAN/MAN/WAN communications
    need a unified end-to-end protocol that can seamlessly transport packets (native
    or otherwise) over any mix of optical networks.</p>"
