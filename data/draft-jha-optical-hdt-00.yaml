abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Next-generation optical network configurations are increasinglybecoming
    a complex mix of SONET/SDH and DWDM-based direct data-over-fiber links. As SONET/SDH
    networks are primarily geared for TDMsupport, transporting IP/ATM packets along
    with PDH (PlesiochronousDigital Hierarchy) channels (such as T1/T3/E1/E3) results
    ininefficient utilization of provisioned bandwidth. In addition, hybridnetworks
    of ring and mesh configurations for short and long haulLAN/MAN/WAN communications
    need a unified end-to-end protocol thatcan seamlessly transport packets (native
    or otherwise) over any mixof optical networks.</p>"
