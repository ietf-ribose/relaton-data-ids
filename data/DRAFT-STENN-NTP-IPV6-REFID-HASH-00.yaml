abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 5905 [RFC5905], section 7.3, \"Packet Header Variables\",
    defines\n   the value to be used as the REFID for network associations.  For IPv4\n
    \  associations the IPv4 address is used, and for IPv6 associations four\n   octets
    of the MD5 hash of the IPv6 are used.  Often, the REFID is\n   simplistically
    and incorrectly used to identify upstream servers.\n   While this works in an
    IPv4 network, it doesn't work for IPv6\n   associations and may have other problems
    in an environment with mixed\n   use of IPv4 and IPv6.  Specifically, the NTP
    Project has received a\n   report where the generated IPv6 hash decoded to the
    IPv4 address of a\n   different machine on the system peer's network.\n\n   This
    proposal offers a way for a system to generate a REFID for a\n   system peer that
    communicates over IPv6 that does not conflict with a\n   valid IPv4-based REFID.\n\n\t
