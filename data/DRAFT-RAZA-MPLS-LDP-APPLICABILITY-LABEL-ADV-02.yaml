abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An LDP speaker negotiates the label advertisement mode with
    its LDP\n   peer at the time of session establishment. Although different\n   applications
    sharing the same LDP session may need different modes\n   of label distribution
    and advertisement, there is only one type of\n   label advertisement mode that
    is negotiated and used per LDP\n   session. This document clarifies the use and
    the applicability of\n   session's negotiated label advertisement mode, and categorizes
    LDP\n   applications into two broad categories of negotiated mode-bound and\n
    \  mode-independent applications. The document also suggests an update\n   to
    RFC5036 and RFC4447 to remove any ambiguity and conflict in the\n   area of using
    correct label advertisement mode for a given\n   application.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
