abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF Source Address Validation Improvements (SAVI) working group is
    chartered for source address validation within the first hop from the end hosts,
    i.e. preventing a node from spoofing the IP source address of another node in
    the same IP link. For source address validation beyond the first hop (SAVI-BF),
    Ingress Filtering [BCP38]/[BCP84] is the best current practice. However Ingress
    Filtering may drop legitimate packets (false positive) or fail to recognize spoofing
    packets (false negative) in case of asymmetric routing, which is not rare under
    SAVI-BF scenario. This document states the possible scenarios in which Ingress
    Filtering may have problems (false positive or false negative). We claim that
    the reason of the problems is that the routers are lack of sufficient routing
    information to predict the incoming direction of a packet, since source address
    validation beyond the first hop should act consistently with the behavior of the
    routing system. We also discuss the availability of the needed routing information
    under different routing environments.</p>"
