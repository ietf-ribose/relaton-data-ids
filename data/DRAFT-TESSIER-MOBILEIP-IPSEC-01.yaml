abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document highlights some of the issues that should be considered
    \nwhen IPSec [2] and Mobile IP [3] inter-work with each other.  \nThis work finds
    some applications in the following fields: VPN \ntraversal requirement [4], IPSec
    Remote access client co-located  \nwith a Mobile Node, IPSec security Gateway
    running in parallel with  \na Home Agent or a MIP Proxy [5]. The purpose of this
    document is \ninformational. Rather that strictly indicating how both protocol
    \nshould take advantages of each other (IPSec running on top of Mobile \nIP or
    the other way around), which is a subjective task left to the \nuser and implementation
    developers of both protocol, it rather \nproposes some usage guidelines and general
    considerations regarding \nthe preference of one solution over the other one.
