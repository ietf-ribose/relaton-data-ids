abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the overall architecture of network slicing.\n
    \  Based on the general architecture, basic concepts of network slicing\n   and
    examples of network slicing instances are introduced for\n   clarification purposes.
    \ Some architectural considerations about the\n   data plane, control plane, management
    and orchestration of network\n   slicing are described to give a general view
    of network slicing\n   implementation principles.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
