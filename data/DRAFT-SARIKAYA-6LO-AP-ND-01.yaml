abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an extension of 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery
    for\n   application in low-power and lossy networks.  The protocol is\n   specified
    to be protected and to support multi-hop operation.  A node\n   computes its Cryptographic,
    Unique Interface ID, and associates one\n   or more of its Registered Addresses
    with that Cryptographic ID in\n   place of the EUI-64 that is used in RFC 6775
    to uniquely identify the\n   interface of the Registered Address.  Once an address
    is registered\n   with a Cryptographic ID, only the owner of that ID can modify
    the\n   state in the 6LR and 6LBR regarding the Registered Address.\n\n\t </p>\n
