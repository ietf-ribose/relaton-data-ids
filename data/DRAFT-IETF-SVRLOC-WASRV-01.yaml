abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We propose extensions to the Service Location Protocol (SLP),
    which\n   allow for registration and discovery of services scattered across the\n
    \  wide area network. We make use of scalable wide area multicast to\n   allow
    agents within an administrative domain to learn about services\n   within other
    domains. We also describe a new agent, the Brokering\n   Agent (BA), which is
    responsible for providing information about a\n   particular set of services types.\n\t
