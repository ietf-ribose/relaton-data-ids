abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes the Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol
    (RTMFP),\n   an endpoint-to-endpoint communication protocol designed to securely\n
    \  transport parallel flows of real-time video, audio, and data\n   messages,
    as well as bulk data, over IP networks.  RTMFP has features\n   making it effective
    for peer-to-peer (P2P) as well as client-server\n   communications, even when
    Network Address Translators (NATs) are\n   used.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
