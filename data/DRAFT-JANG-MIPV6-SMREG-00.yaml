abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes a scheme that allows a mobile node to register
    a\nprimary care-of address(CoA) as well as one or more non-primary CoAs\nby sending
    a single binding update message to the home agent and/or\ncorrespondent node.
    This is achieved by using two new mobility\noptions defined in this draft. Mobile
    nodes that perform duplicate\naddress detection procedure, such as Advance DAD
    and Optimistic DAD\ncan benefit from this scheme. Proposed scheme does not require
    to\nexchange CoTI and CoT messages, usually required for the registration\nof
    each of the non-primary CoA(s). It also does not require to\nmaintain binding
    management key for each of the non-primary CoA(s).\nThus the proposed scheme reduces
    the signaling and processing\noverhead in Mobile IPv6 networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
