abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The concept of IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration (SAA)
    lends\nitself easily to a mobile ad hoc network where no administrative\nconfigurations
    are available. However, the SAA designed to operate\non a single link is not directly
    applicable to the mobile ad hoc\nnetwork with multi-hop paths. In this document,
    we extend the\ncurrent SAA to overcome this limitation by using the IPv6 site-\nlocal
    address.\n\t </p>\n      "
