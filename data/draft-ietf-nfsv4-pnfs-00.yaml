abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft provides a description of the pNFS extension for
    NFSv4. The key feature of the protocol extension is the ability for clients to
    perform read and write operations that go directly from the client to individual
    storage system elements without funneling all such accesses through a single file
    server. Of course, the file server must provide sufficient coordination of the
    client I/O so that the file system retains its integrity. The extension adds operations
    that query and manage layout information that allows parallel I/O between clients
    and storage system elements. The layouts are managed in a similar way to delegations
    in that they are associated with leases and can be recalled by the server, but
    layout information is independent of delegations.</p>"
