abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Node Potential Oriented Multi-Nexthop Routing Protocol
    (NP-MNRP)\n   bases on the idea of \"hop-by-hop routing forwarding, multi-backup\n
    \  next hop\" and combines with the phenomena that water flows from\n   higher
    place to lower.  NP-MNRP defines a metric named as node\n   potential, which is
    based on hop count and the actual link bandwidth,\n   and calculates multiple
    next-hops through the potential difference\n   between the nodes.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
