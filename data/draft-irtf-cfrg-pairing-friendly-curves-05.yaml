abstract:
- content: <p>Pairing-based cryptography, a subfield of elliptic curve cryptography,
    has received attention due to its flexible and practical functionality. Pairing
    is a special map defined using elliptic curves and it can be applied to construct
    several cryptographic protocols such as identity-based encryption, attribute-
    based encryption, and so on. At CRYPTO 2016, Kim and Barbulescu proposed an efficient
    number field sieve algorithm named exTNFS for the discrete logarithm problem in
    a finite field. Several types of pairing-friendly curves such as Barreto-Naehrig
    curves are affected by the attack. In particular, a Barreto-Naehrig curve with
    a 254-bit characteristic was adopted by a lot of cryptographic libraries as a
    parameter of 128-bit security, however, it ensures no more than the 100-bit security
    level due to the effect of the attack. In this memo, we list the security levels
    of certain pairing-friendly curves, and motivate our choices of curves. First,
    we summarize the adoption status of pairing-friendly curves in standards, libraries
    and applications, and classify them in the 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit security
    levels. Then, from the viewpoints of "security" and "widely used", we select the
    recommended pairing-friendly curves considering exTNFS.</p>
