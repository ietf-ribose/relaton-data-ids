abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Appliance Class Identifier option is used by a Dynamic Host
    \nConfiguration Protocol (DHCP) client to identify the type of \nappliance it
    is.  The information contained in this option is an \nopaque field that represents
    the appliance class of which the client \nbelongs.  Based on this class, a DHCP
    server selects the appropriate \naddress pool to assign an address and the appropriate
    configuration \nparameters to the client.  The value of this option should be
    \nselected by the appliance manufacturer and included in the DHCP \nDiscover/Request
    messages.  Multiple vendors may choose to use the \nsame appliance class identifier
    for like appliances (an IP phone for \nexample).\n\t </p>\n      "
