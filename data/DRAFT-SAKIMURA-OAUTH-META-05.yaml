abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines an extensible metadata that may
    be\n   inserted into the OAuth 2.0 responses to assist the clients to\n   process
    those responses.  It is expressed either as a link header, or\n   query parameters.
    \ It will allow the client to learn where the\n   members in the response could
    be used.  Since it is just additional\n   response header/query parameters, any
    client that does not understand\n   this extension should not break and work normally
    while supporting\n   clients can utilize the metadata to take the advantage of
    the\n   extension.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
