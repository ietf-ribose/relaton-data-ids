abstract:
  content: "<p>Composite Objects for the Directory (COD) describes an abstractionlayer
    above the schema, content, and structure facilities of theDirectory. COD enables
    the construction of reusable information com-ponents from schema primitives. These
    components include compositeobjects, type-signed object references, graphs of
    object hierarchies,and object-oriented relationships among Directory objects.COD
    also provides a repository of templates, or prototypes of theinformation components.
    This repository captures component designinformation which cannot be expressed
    in the Directory schema. Thisrepository allows the design of the components to
    be unequivocablydescribed and reused both within and beyond the immediate Directoryinstance.</p>"
