abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
    is\n   based on a profile of the MPLS and pseudo wire (PW) procedures as\n   specified
    in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), pseudo wire (PW)\n   and multi-segment
    PW (MS-PW) architectures complemented with\n   additional Operations, Administration
    and Maintenance (OAM)\n   procedures for fault, performance and protection-switching
    management\n   for packet transport applications that do not rely on the presence
    of\n   a control plane.\n\n   This document is intended to explain the criticality
    of progressing\n   the essential suite of MPLS-TP OAM solution elements in order
    to meet\n   the urgent and increasing requirements for metro packet transport\n
    \  networks. It describes examples of key packet transport network\n   applications
    for several operators, reviews associated MPLS-TP\n   service provider requirements,
    and analyzes MPLS-TP OAM solution\n   approaches that have been submitted to the
    IETF.  Based upon this, it\n   is recommended that the solution elements described
    in draft-bhh-\n   mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6] be included within the MPLS-TP toolkit
    for\n   supporting MPLS-TP OAM Functions, and that the draft be progressed as\n
    \  a Standards Track RFC.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
