abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network\n
    \  Communications Research Group (NWCRG).  It conforms to the directions\n   found
    in the NWCRG taxonomy [RFC8406].  Thus, the scope of the\n   document is network
    coding as a linear combination of packets in and\n   above the network layer.
    \ Physical and MAC layer coding are beyond\n   the scope of the document.  The
    document focuses on a multi-gateway\n   satellite system and identifies the use-cases
    where network coding\n   provides significant performance improvements.  The objective
    is to\n   contribute to a larger deployment of network coding techniques in and\n
    \  above the network layer in satellite communication systems.  These\n   systems
    generally exploit PHY layer loss recovery mechanisms.  The\n   document also identifies
    open research issues related to the\n   deployment of network coding in satellite
    communication systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
