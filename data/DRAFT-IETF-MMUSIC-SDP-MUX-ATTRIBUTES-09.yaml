abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) provides mechanisms
    to\n   describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media\n   streams
    (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within a\n   multimedia session.
    \ Typically media associated with individual media\n   descriptions (\"m=\" lines)
    represent RTP sessions and are thus carried\n   over individual underlying transport
    layer flows.  For scenarios\n   where SDP is used to negotiate the usage of single
    5-tuple for\n   sending and receiving media associated with multiple media\n   descriptions,
    it is required to understand the semantic implications\n   of the SDP attributes
    associated with the RTP Media Streams\n   multiplexed over a single underlying
    transport layer flow.\n\n   The purpose of this specification is to provide a
    framework for\n   analyzing the multiplexing characteristics of SDP attributes.
    \ This\n   specification also categorizes the existing SDP attributes based on\n
    \  the framework described herein.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
