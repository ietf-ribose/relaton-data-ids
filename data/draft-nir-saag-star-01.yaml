abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently there has been renewed interest in an old idea: Issue certificates
    with short validity periods and forego revocation processing, reasoning that expiration
    is a sufficient replacement for revocation as long as that expiration is not too
    far off. This document covers considerations, both security and operational, for
    using such Short Term Auto Renewed (STAR) certificates for various scenarios where
    Using a revocation protocol is considered inappropriate.</p>"
