abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes
    and\n   networks.  The state of a resource on a CoAP server can change over\n
    \  time.  This document specifies a simple protocol extension for CoAP\n   that
    enables CoAP clients to \"observe\" resources, i.e., to retrieve\n   a representation
    of a resource and keep this representation updated\n   by the server over a period
    of time.  The protocol follows a best-\n   effort approach for sending new representations
    to clients, and\n   provides eventual consistency between the state observed by
    each\n   client and the actual resource state at the server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
