abstract:
- content: "<p>The Alternate Marking method, as presented in RFC 8321 [RFC8321], can
    be applied only to point-to-point flows because it assumes that all the packets
    of the flow measured on one node are measured again by a single second node. This
    document aims to generalize and expand this methodology to measure any kind of
    unicast flows, whose packets can follow several different paths in the network,
    in wider terms a multipoint-to-multipoint network. For this reason the technique
    here described is called Multipoint Alternate Marking. Some definitions here introduced
    extend the scope of RFC 5644 [RFC5644] in the context of alternate marking schema.</p>"
