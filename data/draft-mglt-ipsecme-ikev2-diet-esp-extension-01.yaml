abstract:
- content: "<p>ESP Header Compression (EHC) reduces the ESP overhead by compressing
    ESP fields. Compression results from a coordination of various EHC Rules designed
    as EHC Strategies. An EHC Strategy may require to be configured with some configuration
    parameters. When a Security Association (SA) is enabling EHC, the two peers need
    to agree which EHC Strategy is applied as well as its associated configuration
    parameters. This document describes an extension of IKEv2 that enables two peers
    to agree on a specific EHC Strategy as well as its associated configuration parameters.</p>"
