abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a protocol for use with relational database systems
    in a TCP/IP based internet environment. This protocol is intended to make interoperability
    among different database systems possible. It is built on RPC (Remote Procedure
    Call) with a client/server type of relationship. This document also defines the
    concept of Unit of Work. The work of Network Database is involved with Data Conversion,
    Security, I/O Buffer Management, and Transaction Management. They will be described
    one by one in this document.</p>"
