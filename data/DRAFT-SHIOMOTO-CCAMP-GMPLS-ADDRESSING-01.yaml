abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document explains and clarifies addressing and messaging
    in \n   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks.  The aim
    \n   of this document is to facilitate and ensure better interworking of \n   GMPLS-capable
    Label Switching Routers (LSR) based on experience \n   gained in deployments and
    interoperability testing and proper \n   interpretation of published RFCs.\n\t
