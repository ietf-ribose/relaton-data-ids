abstract:
- content: "<p>OAuth provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf
    of a resource owner (such as a different client or an end-user). It also provides
    a process for end-users to authorize third-party access to their server resources
    without sharing their credentials (typically, a username and password pair), using
    user-agent redirections. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
