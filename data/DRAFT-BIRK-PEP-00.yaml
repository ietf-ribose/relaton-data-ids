abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Building on already available security formats and message
    transports\n   (like PGP/MIME for email), pretty Easy privacy (pEp) describes\n
    \  protocols to automatize operations (key management, key discovery,\n   private
    key handling including peer-to-peer synchronization of\n   private keys and other
    user data across devices) that have been seen\n   to be barriers to deployment
    of end-to-end secure interpersonal\n   messaging.  pEp also introduces \"Trustwords\"
    (instead of\n   fingerprints) to verify communication peers and proposes a trust\n
    \  rating system to denote secure types of communications and signal the\n   privacy
    level available on a per-user and per-message level.  In this\n   document, the
    general design choices and principles of pEp are\n   outlined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
