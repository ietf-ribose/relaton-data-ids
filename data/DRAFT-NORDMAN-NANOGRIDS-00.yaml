abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A nanogrid is a very small electricity domain that is distinct
    from\n   any other grid it is connected to in voltage, reliability, quality,\n
    \  or price.  Nanogrids could form the basis of a future electricity\n   system
    built on a bottom-up, decentralized, and distributed network\n   model rather
    than the top-down centralized grid we have today in most\n   parts of the world.
    \ This document introduces the idea of a nanogrid\n   to the IETF community for
    two purposes -- to inform the work on\n   energy management presently underway
    in the EMAN working group, and\n   to describe how future communications within
    and between grids could\n   be accomplished with protocols that are the product
    of the IETF.\n   There appears to be no fundamental conflict between the nanogrid\n
    \  concept and the current drafts in the EMAN working group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
