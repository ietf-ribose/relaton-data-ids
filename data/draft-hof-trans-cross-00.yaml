abstract:
- content: <p>A malicious Certificate Transparency (CT) log can offer a modified tree
    to a client in a "split view" attack. This document proposes to extend CT by submitting
    Signed Tree Heads (STH) into another log, run by a different operator. Auditors
    and monitors can use these cross logged STHs to detect split view attacks by the
    log.</p>
