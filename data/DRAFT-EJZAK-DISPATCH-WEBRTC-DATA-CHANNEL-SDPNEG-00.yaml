abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working
    group is\n   charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich\n
    \  communication using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-\n   browsers.
    \ For the support of data communication, the RTCWeb working\n   group has in particular
    defined the concept of bi-directional data\n   channels over SCTP, where each
    data channel might be used to\n   transport other protocols, called sub-protocols.
    \ Data channel setup\n   can be done using either the in-band WebRTC Data Channel
    protocol or\n   some external (in-band or out-of-band) negotiation.  This document\n
    \  specifies how the SDP offer/answer exchange can be used to achieve\n   such
    an external negotiation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
