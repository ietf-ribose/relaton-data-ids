abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is one of a set of documents, which together describe
    all aspects of the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). IPP is an application level
    protocol that can be used for distributed printing using Internet tools and technologies.
    This document describes a simplified model consisting of abstract objects, their
    attributes, and their operations that is independent of encoding and transport.
    The model consists of several objects including Printers and Jobs. Jobs optionally
    support multiple Documents. IPP 1.1 semantics allow end users and operators to
    query Printer capabilities, submit print jobs, inquire about the status of print
    Jobs and printers, and cancel, hold, and release print Jobs. IPP 1.1 semantics
    allow operators to pause and resume (Jobs from) Printer objects. This document
    also addresses security, internationalization, and directory issues.</p>"
