abstract:
- content: "<p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a fault detection protocol
    that can quickly determine a communication failure between two forwarding engines.
    This document proposes a use of the BFD Echo where the local system supports BFD
    but the neighboring system does not support BFD. This document updates RFC 5880.</p>"
