abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document describes several use cases for peering between
    two or\n   more communities that provide real time communications services and\n
    \  presence and IM in particular.  The communities create a peering\n   relationship
    between themselves thus enabling their users to\n   collaborate with users on
    other communities.  The target of the\n   document is to help understanding the
    requirements for peering\n   between domains with regard to real time services\n\n\t
