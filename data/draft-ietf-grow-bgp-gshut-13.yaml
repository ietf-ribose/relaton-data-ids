abstract:
- content: "<p>This document standardizes a new well-known BGP community, GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN,
    to signal the graceful shutdown of paths. This document also describes operational
    procedures that use this well-known community to reduce the amount of traffic
    lost when BGP peering sessions are about to be shut down deliberately, e.g., for
    planned maintenance.</p>"
