abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many systems (e.g., cryptographic protocols relying on symmetric\n
    \  cryptography) require that plaintext passwords be stored.  Given how\n   often
    people reuse passwords on different systems, this poses a very\n   serious risk
    if a single machine is compromised.  We propose a scheme\n   to derive passwords
    limited to a single machine from a typed\n   password, and explain how a protocol
    definition can specify this\n   scheme.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
