abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IP mobility protocols are designed to allow a mobile node to
    remain\n   reachable while moving around in the network.  The currently deployed\n
    \  mobility management protocols are anchor-based approaches, where a\n   mobile
    node's IP sessions are anchored on a central node.  The mobile\n   node's IP traffic
    enters and exits from this anchor node and it\n   remains as the control point
    for all subscriber services.  This\n   architecture based on fixed IP anchors
    comes with some complexity and\n   there is some interest from the mobile operators
    to eliminate the use\n   of fixed anchors, and other residual elements such as
    the overlay\n   tunneling that come with it.\n\n   This document describes a new
    approach for realizing a mobile user-\n   plane that does not require fixed IP
    anchors.  The architectural-\n   basis for this approach is the separation of
    control and user plane,\n   and the use of programmability constructs of the user-plane
    for\n   traffic steering.  This approach is referred to as, Mobility-aware\n   Floating
    Anchor (MFA).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
