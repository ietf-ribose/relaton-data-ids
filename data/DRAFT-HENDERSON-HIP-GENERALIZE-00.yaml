abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Host Identity Protocol and architecture (HIP) proposes
    to add a\n   cryptographic name space for network stack names.  This draft\n   observes
    that HIP can be viewed as an instance of a more general\n   migration towards
    decoupling identity from location in the Internet\n   architecture, and shows
    how other proposals (mobile IP, multi6,\n   mobike, and i3) fit into this framework.
    \ We argue that if the HIP\n   base protocol were to be slightly generalized,
    it might be useful to\n   other related efforts and might allow more experimental
    flexibility.\n   Specifically, an extensible identifier TLV, the ability to define\n
    \  usage profiles for the HIP handshake, and a relaxation of the\n   requirements
    that specific HIP messages carry specific parameters are\n   the three changes
    suggested.\n\t </p>\n      "
