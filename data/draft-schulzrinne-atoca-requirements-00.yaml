abstract:
- content: "<p>Various agencies need to provide information to the restricted group
    of persons or even to the generic public before, during and after emergency situations.
    While many aspects of such systems are specific to national or local jurisdictions,
    emergencies span such boundaries and notifications need to reach visitors from
    other jurisdictions. This document summarizes requirements for protocols to allow
    alerts to be conveyed to IP-based end points.</p>"
