abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate\n
    \  addresses using a combination of locally available information and\n   information
    advertised by routers.  Addresses are formed by combining\n   network prefixes
    with an interface identifier.  On an interface that\n   contains an embedded IEEE
    Identifier, the interface identifier is\n   typically derived from it.  On other
    interface types, the interface\n   identifier is generated through other means,
    for example, via random\n   number generation.  This document describes an extension
    to IPv6\n   stateless address autoconfiguration for interfaces whose interface\n
    \  identifier is derived from an IEEE identifier.  Use of the extension\n   causes
    nodes to generate global scope addresses from interface\n   identifiers that change
    over time, even in cases where the interface\n   contains an embedded IEEE identifier.
    \ Changing the interface\n   identifier (and the global scope addresses generated
    from it) over\n   time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other information\n
    \  collectors to identify when different addresses used in different\n   transactions
    actually correspond to the same node.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
