abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a new proposal for a future Internet\n
    \  architecture.  Similar to many other proposals it employs a locator/\n   identifier
    split to overcome the short-comings arising from the dual\n   role of IP addresses.
    \ Similar to the Host Identity Protocol, each\n   node carries a unique, randomly
    self-generated identifier - the\n   public part of a public/private key pair.
    \ It can therefore directly\n   be used for authentication and authorisation purposes.
    \ Different\n   from some other proposals, the Node Identity Internetworking\n
    \  architecture does not try to converge on a single (globally managed)\n   address
    space, but instead accepts the co-existence of different\n   networking domains
    - here called locator domains.  Routing within the\n   architecture is based on
    a two-level approach.  First, routing within\n   a locator domain is managed by
    the internal addressing and routing\n   scheme of the locator domain.  Second,
    routing between locator\n   domains involves specialized nodes at locator domain
    borders.  By\n   grouping the nodes into locator domains, the effects of certain\n
    \  events such as mobility can often be localised, thus reducing the\n   impact
    on the global network.\n\t </p>\n      "
