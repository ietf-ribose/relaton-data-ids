abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an extension to the NFSv4 protocol to
    allow\nclients to create and write files with greater efficiency.\n\nThe first
    proposal allows the server to defer creating the file on\nstable storage when
    replying to an OPEN call.  The aim is to improve\nserver efficiency and scalability
    by reducing the number of required\ndisk accesses when writing a file from scratch.\n\nThe
    second proposal allows the server to share information about the\nimplementation
    of its change attribute with the client.  The aim is\nto improve the client's
    ability to determine the order in which\nparallel updates to the same file were
    processed.Keywords\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\t </p>\n
