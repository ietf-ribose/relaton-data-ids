abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a YANG data model for an SD-WAN service. An
    SD-WAN service is a connectivity service offered by a service provider network
    to provide connectivity across different locations of a customer network or between
    a customer network and an external network, such as the Internet or a private/public
    cloud network. This connectivity is provided as an overlay constructed using one
    of more underlay networks. The model can be used by a service orchestrator of
    a service provider to request, configure, and manage the components of an SD-WAN
    service.</p>"
