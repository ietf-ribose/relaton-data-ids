abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The year-2000 problem (Y2K problem) is of increasing interest.
    Little\nhas been said about the relationship of Y2K to synchronous\ngroupware.
    We describe a matrix model of selective dissemination of\ninformation to viewers
    of that information. The model is suitable for\nsome forms of synchronous groupware.\n\n\t
