abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies protocol independent multicast- Next\n
    \  generation or simply called PIM-NG. PIM-NG uses the underlying\n   unicast
    routing information, but unlike PIM-SM it doesn't necessarily\n   need to build
    unidirectional shared trees rooted at a Rendezvous\n   Point (RP) per group, due
    to the fact that the processes through\n   which a source registers with the Rendezvous
    Point and a host finds\n   the source of the multicast destination groups it needs
    are done in a\n   whole new way and hence, the source of multicast group (G) is\n
    \  discovered faster. So at some points PIM-NG works faster than its\n   predecessor.
    Also the new Domain concept, unique to PIM-NG, along the\n   RPF check method
    used in PIM-NG specifications provides many features\n   along a robust and flexible
    control and administration over multicast\n   networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
