abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a solution suite for TRILL data plane\n
    \  monitoring and failure detection. Methods presented herein allow in-\n   cooperating
    IP payloads, exercising multi-paths, verifying multicast\n   trees, locating end
    stations, virtual segments and diagnosing\n   connectivity problems. ICMP protocol
    is proposed as framework for\n   error reporting. Document also presents network
    wide health\n   monitoring, distribution and reporting methods that are intended
    for\n   efficient troubleshooting.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
