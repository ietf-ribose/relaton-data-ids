abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The process of producing today's Internet through a culture
    of open\n   participation and diverse collaboration has proved strikingly\n   efficient
    and effective, and it is distinctive among standards\n   organizations.  Historically
    participation in the IETF and its\n   antecedent was almost entirely composed
    of well-funded, American,\n   white, male engineers.  No matter the intentions
    of the participants,\n   such a narrow demographic distorts group dynamics, both
    in management\n   and in personal interactions.  In the case of the IETF, group\n
    \  interaction style can often demonstrate singularly aggressive\n   behavior,
    often including singularly hostile tone and content.\n   Groups with greater diversity
    make better decisions.  Obtaining\n   meaningful diversity requires more than
    generic good will and\n   statements of principle.  Many different behaviors can
    serve to\n   reduce participant diversity or participation diversity.  This paper\n
    \  discusses the nature and practicalities of IETF attention to its\n   diverse
    participation and to the requirement for professional\n   demeanor.\n\n\t </p>\n
