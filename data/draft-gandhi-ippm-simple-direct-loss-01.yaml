abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Simple Two-Way Direct Loss Measurement (DLM)
    procedure that can be used for Alternate-Marking Method for detecting accurate
    data packet loss in a network. Specifically, DLM probe packets are defined for
    both unauthenticated and authenticated modes and they are efficient for hardware-based
    implementation.</p>"
