abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The RealMedia File Format (RMFF) is designed to be a generic
    container\n   for streaming media data.  This data may then be played back locally
    or\n   streamed over a network using protocols such as RTSP and RTP.  The\n   format
    is data-independent, allowing any data type to be recorded,\n   manipulated and
    played back.\n \n   Note: This document is intended to be informational in nature
    of what\n   the file format in use by RealNetworks' RealServer and RealPlayer\n
    \  implementations.  Though we think that there are a lot of important\n   concepts
    embodied in this specification, and that it may even make the\n   basis of a ''standard''
    file format, this is intended to eventually end\n   up as an Informational RFC.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
