abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft proposes a routing protocol for supporting real-time
    multicast service over the Internet. The work is motivated by the fact that the
    existing multicast routing protocols are designed under the assumption of symmetric
    paths, which is not necessarily true especially in the real-time applications.
    The essence of the proposed protocol is using the inter-subnet Routing Guide Message
    (RGM) flows generated by sink-subnets to form multicast spanning trees. The underlying
    algorithms enable source and intermediate nodes to construct minimal end-to-end
    delay paths to sink-subnets based on the path and the session information conveyed
    by incident RGM-flows.</p>"
