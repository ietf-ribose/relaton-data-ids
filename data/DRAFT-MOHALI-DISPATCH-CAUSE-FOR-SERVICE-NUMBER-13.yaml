abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC4458 (SIP URIs for applications) defines a \"cause\" URI
    parameter,\n   which may appear in the Request-URI of a SIP request, that is used
    to\n   indicate a reason why the request arrived to the User Agent Server\n   (UAS)
    receiving the message.  This document creates a new predefined\n   value for the
    \"cause\" URI parameter to cover service number\n   translation for cases of retargeting
    due to specific service action\n   leading to the translation of a called service
    access number.  This\n   document also provides guidance, which was missing in
    RFC4458, for\n   using the \"cause\" URI parameter within the History-Info header
    field\n   since this use is mandatory in some IP networks' implementations.\n\n
    \  This document updates RFC4458.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
