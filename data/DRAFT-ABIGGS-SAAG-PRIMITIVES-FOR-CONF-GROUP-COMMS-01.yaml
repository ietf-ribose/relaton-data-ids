abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines generalized primitives for use in\n
    \  establishing end-to-end confidentiality in multiparty communications.\n   These
    primitives address three essential elements of group privacy:\n   authentication,
    group membership, and secure key exchange.  The\n   purpose is to define these
    primitives in such a way as they may be\n   leveraged as common constructs within
    new and existing secure group\n   communications protocols, and in support of
    both centralized and\n   decentralized architectures.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
