abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Users want to control how their DNS queries are handled by
    DNS\n   servers so they can configure their system to use DNS servers that\n   comply
    with their privacy expectations.\n\n   This document defines a mechanism for a
    DNS server to communicate its\n   privacy policy to a DNS client.  This communication
    is\n   cryptographically signed to attest to its authenticity.  By\n   evaluating
    the DNS privacy policy and the signatory, the DNS client\n   can choose a DNS
    server that best supports its desired privacy\n   policies.  The privacy assertion
    token is particularly useful for\n   DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers,
    both public resolvers and\n   those discovered on the local network.\n\n\t </p>\n
