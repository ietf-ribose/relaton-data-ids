abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies Non-Congestion Robustness (NCR) for
    TCP.  In\n   the absence of explicit congestion notification from the network,
    TCP\n   uses loss as an indication of congestion.  One of the ways TCP\n   detects
    loss is using the arrival of three duplicate acknowledgments.\n   However, this
    heuristic is not always correct, notably in the case\n   when network paths reorder
    segments (for whatever reason), resulting\n   in degraded performance.  TCP-NCR
    is designed to mitigate this\n   degraded performance by increasing the number
    of duplicate\n   acknowledgments required to trigger loss recovery, based on the\n
    \  current state of the connection, in an effort to better disambiguate\n   true
    segment loss from segment reordering.  This document specifies\n   the changes
    to TCP, as well as the costs and benefits of these\n   modifications.\n\n\t </p>\n
