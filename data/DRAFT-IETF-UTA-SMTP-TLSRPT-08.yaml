abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels\n
    \  between SMTP Mail Transfer Agents, including STARTTLS [RFC3207], DANE\n   [RFC6698],
    and MTA-STS (TODO: Add ref).  These protocols can fail due\n   to misconfiguration
    or active attack, leading to undelivered messages\n   or delivery over unencrypted
    or unauthenticated channels.  This\n   document describes a reporting mechanism
    and format by which sending\n   systems can share statistics and specific information
    about potential\n   failures with recipient domains.  Recipient domains can then
    use this\n   information to both detect potential attackers and diagnose\n   unintentional
    misconfigurations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
