abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As specified in RFC 6388, Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
    can be\n   used to set up Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-\n   Multipoint
    (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths.  However, RFC 6388\n   presupposes that the two
    endpoints of an LDP session are directly\n   connected.  The LDP base specification
    (RFC 5036) allows for the case\n   where the two endpoints of an LDP session are
    not directly connected;\n   such a session is known as a \"Targeted LDP\" session.
    \ This document\n   provides the specification for using the LDP P2MP/MP2MP extensions\n
    \  over a Targeted LDP session.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
