abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In industrial field/backhaul networks, joint real-time scheduling\n
    \  method is important to make end-to-end flows meet their deadline.\n   This
    document proposes four joint scheduling methods, and they\n   involve four scenarios:
    time-slotted industrial backhaul network,\n   regarding industrial backhaul network
    as a black box system,\n   ignoring delay of industrial backhaul and establishing
    latency model\n   of industrial backhaul network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
