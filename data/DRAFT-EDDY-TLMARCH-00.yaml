abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a generalized architecture for implementing\n
    \  mobility in the transport layer rather than the network layer.  In\n   addition,
    the document discusses the advantages of this approach, the\n   basic mechanisms
    and interactions required to support transport layer\n   mobility, and examples
    of how to enable mobility in various transport\n   protocols, using this architecture.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
