abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   LOOPS (Local Optimizations on Path Segments) aims to provide
    local\n   in-network loss recovery.  It can be used with tunneling protocols to\n
    \  efficiently recover lost packets on a single segment of an end-to-end\n   path
    instead of leaving recovery to the end-to-end protocol,\n   traversing the entire
    path.\n\n   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing mechanisms and\n
    \  steers the packets through an policy instantiated as an ordered list\n   of
    instructions called segments.  LOOPS can be embedded in an SR\n   segment to improve
    the packet recovery. draft-welzl-loops-gen-info\n   defines the generic information
    model, without binding that to any\n   specific protocols, to be carried between
    LOOPS ingress and egress\n   nodes, which can be SR segment endpoints.  This document
    specifies\n   the concrete mechanisms to embed LOOPS in SRv6 segment.\n\n\t </p>\n
