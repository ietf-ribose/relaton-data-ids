abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines guidelines and protocol extensions for combining\nSession
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) based real-time media sessions with\nExtensible Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (XMPP) based instant\nmessaging and presence services in
    a seamless manner.  This is\naccomplished by integration and protocol extension
    support in the\nendpoints, without requiring any changes in the SIP or XMPP server\ninfrastructure.
    \ It is even possible that SIP and XMPP services are\noffered by different service
    providers.\n\t </p>\n      "
