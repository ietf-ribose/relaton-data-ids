abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The base MPEG2-TS splicing related protocols, i.e., Digital Program\nInsertion
    Splicing API [SCTE30] and Digital Program Insertion Cueing\nMessage for Cable
    [SCTE35], only take into account how to insert the\ncontent (e.g., spot advertisements
    of various lengths, program\nsubstitution, public service announcements, etc)
    into any MPEG2-TS\noutput multiplex on the splicer , as well as how to carry\nnotification
    of upcoming splicing and other timing information in the\ntransport stream, but
    not give enough mechanisms to direct the\nunderlying transport protocol such as
    RTP how to compatibly work with\nthe MPEG2-TS splicing.  This memo highlights
    the issues of what's the\nimpact on RTP and RTCP when performing splicing between
    the primary\nchannel and the insertion channel.\n\t </p>\n      "
