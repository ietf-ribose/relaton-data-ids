abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of usable
    next-hop\n   address families is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI)\n
    \  and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).  The AFI/SAFI\n   definitions
    for the IPv4 address family only have provisions for\n   advertising a Next Hop
    address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol when\n   advertising IPv4 Network Layer
    Reachability Information (NLRI) or\n   VPN-IPv4 NLRI.\n\n   This document specifies
    the extensions necessary to allow advertising\n   IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with
    a Next Hop address that belongs to\n   the IPv6 protocol.  This comprises an extension
    of the AFI/SAFI\n   definitions to allow the address of the Next Hop for IPv4
    NLRI or\n   VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of\n
    \  the Next Hop to determine which of the protocols the address actually\n   belongs
    to, and a BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers to dynamically\n   discover whether
    they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with\n   an IPv6 Next Hop. This
    document obsoletes RFC5549.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
