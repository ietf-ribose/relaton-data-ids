abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) RFC2960 [SXM00]
    \n   specifications utilize the possible multiple paths between the \n   sender
    and receiver for retransmission of lost data chunks and as a \n   backup for the
    primary path, in case of primary path failure. \n   Other than that, all the data
    chunks are being sent on the primary \n   path chosen by the SCTP user during
    the association initiation. \n   This memo describes an extension to SCTP that
    allows endpoints to \n   use the multiple available paths for simultaneous data
    transmission. \n   The extension maintains SCTP congestion control on each path,
    so as \n   to ensure fair integration with other traffic in the network. \n\t
