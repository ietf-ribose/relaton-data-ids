abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IDNA has been a world-wide success since it was introduced over
    five\nyears ago.  However, it has some notable deficiencies, including\nbeing
    tied to an old version of the Unicode standard and needless\nrestrictions that
    prevented some languages from being used.  This\ndocument describes IDNA version
    2, which rectifies those problems\nwhile making the fewest changes necessary to
    the original protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
