abstract:
- content: "<p>Content Distribution Applications (e.g., P2P applications) are widely
    used on the Internet and make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks.
    One technique to improve the network efficiency of these applications is to introduce
    storage capabilities within the networks; this is the capability provided by a
    DECADE (DECoupled Application Data Enroute) compatible system. This document presents
    an architecture, discusses the underlying principles, and identifies key functionalities
    in the architecture for introducing a DECADE in- network storage system. In addition,
    some examples are given to illustrate these concepts.</p>"
