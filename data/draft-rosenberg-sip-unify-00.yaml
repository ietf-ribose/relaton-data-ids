abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The SIP working group has been grappling with a variety of verydifficult
    problems lately. These include early media, coupling ofresource reservation and
    call signaling, and the so-calledHeterogeneous Error Response Forking Problem
    (HERFP). Additionalproblems being considered include supporting capability negotiationfor
    indicating support any one of one-of-N codecs, upgrading thesecurity on RTP streams,
    and demultiplexing media from a forkedINVITE. In this document, we present a unified
    view of all of theseproblems, and present a unified solution that solves all of
    them inthe same way.</p>"
