abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Today the Dual-Stack approach is the most straightforward and
    the\n   most common way for introducing IPv6 into existing systems and\n   networks.
    \ However a typical drawback of implementing Dual-Stack is\n   that each node
    will still require at least one IPv4 address.  Hence,\n   solely deploying Dual-Stack
    does not provide a sufficient solution to\n   the IPv4 address exhaustion problem.
    \ Assuming a situation where most\n   of the IP communication (e.g. always-on,
    VoIP etc.) can be provided\n   via IPv6, the usage of public IPv4 addresses can
    significantly be\n   reduced and the unused public IPv4 addresses can under certain\n
    \  circumstances be returned to the public IPv4 address pool of the\n   service
    provider.  New Dual-Stack enabled services can be introduced\n   without increasing
    the public IPv4 address demand, whereas IPv6 will\n   be the preferred network
    layer protocol.  This document describes\n   such a solution in a Dual-Stack PPP
    session network scenario and\n   explains the protocol mechanisms which are used.\n\n\t
