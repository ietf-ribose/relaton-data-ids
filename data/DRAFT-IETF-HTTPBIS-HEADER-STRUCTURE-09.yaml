abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a set of data types and algorithms
    associated\n   with them that are intended to make it easier and safer to define
    and\n   handle HTTP header fields.  It is intended for use by new\n   specifications
    of HTTP header fields as well as revisions of existing\n   header field specifications
    when doing so does not cause\n   interoperability issues.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
