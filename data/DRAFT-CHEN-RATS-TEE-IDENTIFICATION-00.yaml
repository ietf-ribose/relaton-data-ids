abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In security considerations, identity of a device should be
    protected\n   and cannot be exposed in public.  Based on this purpose, this\n
    \  document specifies the architecture of TEE(Trust Execution\n   Environment)
    identification based on EAP-TLS.  In this architecture,\n   TEE is in charge of
    protecting the certificate and generating\n   handshake keys which will be used
    for EAP-TLS authentication.\n   REE(Rich Execution Environment) is in charge of
    building\n   communication with EAP-TLS Server.  A middle layer is introduced
    to\n   communicate with separate parts of EAP-TLS in TEE and REE to\n   implement
    its original functionality.\n\n   This architecture could be used in data link
    layer and also\n   application layer to implement identity authentication under
    the\n   protection of TEE and EAP-TLS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
