abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a terminology for defining the problem
    faced\nby network mobility. Network mobility is concerned with situations\nwhere
    an entire network changes its point of attachment to the\nInternet and thus its
    reachability in the topology. We shall refer to\nsuch a network as a mobile network.
    Network mobility support is to\nmaintain session continuity between nodes in the
    mobile network and\nnodes in the global Internet.\n\t </p>\n      "
