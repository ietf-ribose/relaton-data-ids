abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes some important simplifications to the original
    PCEP protocol and also serves to clarify certain aspects of PCEP operation. The
    content of this document has been compiled based on the feedback from several
    multi-vendor interop exercises. Several constructs are introduced, such as the
    LSP-DB and the ASSO-DB.</p>"
