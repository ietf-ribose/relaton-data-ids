abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines extensions of PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing
    Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity. The document presents two
    extensions of current PRoPHET draft-09. The first extension is to apply the contact
    duration to calculate the delivery predictability. The other is to provide a forward
    strategy which can alleviate the bundle starving problem by considering expiration
    of bundles.</p>"
