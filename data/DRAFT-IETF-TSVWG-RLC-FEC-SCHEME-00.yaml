abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a fully-specified FEC scheme for the
    Sliding\n   Window Random Linear Codes (RLC) over GF(2^^m), where m equals 1\n
    \  (binary case), 4 or 8, that can be used to protect arbitrary media\n   streams
    along the lines defined by FECFRAME extended to sliding\n   window codes.  These
    sliding window FEC codes rely on an encoding\n   window that slides over the source
    symbols, generating new repair\n   symbols whenever needed.  Compared to block
    FEC codes, these sliding\n   window FEC codes offer key advantages with real-time
    flows in terms\n   of reduced FEC-related latency while often providing improved
    erasure\n   recovery capabilities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
