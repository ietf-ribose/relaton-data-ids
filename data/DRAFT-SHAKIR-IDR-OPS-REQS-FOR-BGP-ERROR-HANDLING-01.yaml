abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>BGP-4 is utilised as a key intra- and inter-Autonomous System
    routing\nprotocol in modern IP networks.  The failure modes as defined by the\noriginal
    protocol standards are based on a number of assumptions\naround the impact of
    session failure.  Numerous incidents both in the\nglobal Internet routing table
    and within Service Provider networks\nhave been caused by strict handling of a
    single invalid UPDATE\nmessage causing large-scale failures in one or more Autonomous\nSystems.\n\nThis
    memo describes the current use of BGP-4 within Service Provider\nnetworks, and
    outlines a set of requirements for further work to\nenhance the mechanisms available
    to a BGP-4 implementation when\nerroneous data is detected.  Whilst this document
    does not provide\nspecification of any standard, it is intended as an overview
    of a set\nof enhancements to BGP-4 to improve the protocol's robustness to suit\nits
    current deployment.\n\t </p>\n      "
