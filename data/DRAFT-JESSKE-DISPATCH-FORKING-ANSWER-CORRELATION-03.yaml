abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describe the scenarios where multiples early
    dialogs\n   can be created.  The main use case is based on forking.  But also\n
    \  forwarding of SIP Invites and other applications may create early\n   dialogs.
    \ The scenarios shown describe how a correlation/multiplexing\n   of multiple
    early dialogs caused by forked or forwarded INVITEs in\n   Back to Back User Agents
    can apply.  Existing RFC's are analyzed how\n   forking is described and points
    to facts which may be taken in to\n   consideration.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
