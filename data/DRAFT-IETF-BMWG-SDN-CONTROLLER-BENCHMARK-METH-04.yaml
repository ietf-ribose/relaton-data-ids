abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the methodologies for benchmarking control\n
    \  plane performance of SDN controllers. Terminology related to\n   benchmarking
    SDN controllers is described in the companion\n   terminology document. SDN controllers
    have been implemented with\n   many varying designs in order to achieve their
    intended network\n   functionality. Hence, the authors have taken the approach
    of\n   considering an SDN controller as a black box, defining the\n   methodology
    in a manner that is agnostic to protocols and network\n   services supported by
    controllers. The intent of this document is to\n   provide a standard mechanism
    to measure the performance of all\n   controller implementations.\n\n\t </p>\n
