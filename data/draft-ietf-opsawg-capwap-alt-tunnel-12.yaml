abstract:
- content: "<p>Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) is a protocol
    for encapsulating a station's data frames between the Wireless Transmission Point
    (WTP) and Access Controller (AC). Specifically, the station's IEEE 802.11 data
    frames can be either locally bridged or tunneled to the AC. When tunneled, a CAPWAP
    Data Channel is used for tunneling. In many deployments, encapsulating data frames
    to an entity other than the AC (for example, to an Access Router (AR)) is desirable.
    Furthermore, it may also be desirable to use different tunnel encapsulation modes
    between the WTP and the Access Router. This document defines an extension to the
    CAPWAP protocol that supports this capability and refers to it as alternate tunnel
    encapsulation. The alternate tunnel encapsulation allows 1) the WTP to tunnel
    non-management data frames to an endpoint different from the AC and 2) the WTP
    to tunnel using one of many known encapsulation types, such as IP-IP, IP-GRE,
    or CAPWAP. The WTP may advertise support for alternate tunnel encapsulation during
    the discovery and join process, and the AC may select one of the supported alternate
    tunnel encapsulation types while configuring the WTP.</p>"
