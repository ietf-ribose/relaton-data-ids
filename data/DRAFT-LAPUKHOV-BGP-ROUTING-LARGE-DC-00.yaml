abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some service providers build and operate data centers at the
    size\n   exceeding 100,000 servers.  In this document, those data-centers are\n
    \  referred to as \"large-scale\" to differentiate them from more common\n   smaller
    infrastructures.  The data centers of that scale have unique\n   set of network
    design requirement, with primary focus on operational\n   simplicity and stability.\n\n
    \  This document attempts to summarize the authors' experiences in\n   designing
    and supporting large data centers, using BGP as the only\n   control-plane protocol.
    \ The intent is to describe a proven and\n   stable routing design that could
    be leveraged by others in the\n   industry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
