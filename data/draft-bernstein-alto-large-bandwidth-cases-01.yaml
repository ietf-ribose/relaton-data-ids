abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes two generic use-cases that illustrate application
    layer traffic optimization applied to high bandwidth core networks. The type of
    information and interactions needed to perform various optimizations is described.
    In addition, extensions to the existing ALTO protocol are suggested that provide
    this functionality.</p>"
