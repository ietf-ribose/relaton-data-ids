abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the distributed data export mechanism
    that\n   allows multiple data streams to be managed by using a single\n   subscription.
    \ Specifically, device can decide to decompse one\n   subscription into multiple
    subscriptions to the line-cards.  So that\n   each line-card can directly push
    data to the collector without\n   passing through a broker for internal consolidation.
    \ And the device\n   can indicate the subscription decomposition result to the
    receiver to\n   check the data integrity.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
