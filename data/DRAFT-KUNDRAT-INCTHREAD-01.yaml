abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the INCTHREAD IMAP extension which
    enables\n   clients to retrieve incremental updates of the mailbox threading.\n
    \  The extension repurposes the ESEARCH response for passing along the\n   threading
    information and builds on top of Arnt Gulbrandsen's work on\n   the INTHREAD search
    key.  The UID THREAD command is also extended to\n   allow activating this extension.
    \ Together, these changes make it\n   possible for clients not to fetch the complete
    mailbox threading each\n   time a new message arrives.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
