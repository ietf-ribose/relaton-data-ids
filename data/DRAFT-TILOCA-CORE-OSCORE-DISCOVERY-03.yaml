abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Group communication over the Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP)\n   can be secured by means of Object Security for Constrained RESTful\n
    \  Environments (OSCORE).  At deployment time, devices may not know the\n   exact
    OSCORE groups to join, the respective Group Manager, or other\n   information
    required to perform the joining process.  This document\n   describes how a CoAP
    endpoint can use the CoRE Resource Directory to\n   discover OSCORE groups and
    acquire information to join them through\n   the respective Group Manager.  A
    given OSCORE group may protect\n   multiple application groups, which are separately
    announced in the\n   Resource Directory as sets of endpoints sharing a pool of
    resources.\n   This approach is consistent with, but not limited to, the joining
    of\n   OSCORE groups based on the ACE framework for Authentication and\n   Authorization
    in constrained environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
