abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability to carry Early Media - defined as media that is delivered
    prior to call answer or session establishment - has been the subject of many discussions
    and internet drafts within the IETF [6][7]. Despite these discussions, it appears
    that no clear solution has emerged to solve the Early media problem.</p>"
