abstract:
- content: "<p>For Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (C-ACC), platooning and other
    typical use cases in ITS, direct IP communication between neighbor vehicles poses
    the following two issues: 1) how to discover a neighbor vehicle and the demanded
    service; and 2) how to discover the link-layer address of the neighbor vehicle
    and selected server. This document presents a solution to these problems based
    on DNS-SD/mDNS [RFC6762][RFC6763].</p>"
