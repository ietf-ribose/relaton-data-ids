abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Mobile Ad Hoc Networks need an auto-configuration protocol being
    ableto satisfy their self-deployment requirements while remainingflexible enough
    to accommodate special features for differentdevices.The Extensible Manet Auto-configuration
    Protocol (EMAP) tries tofullfil these requirements both for IPv4 and IPv6 mobile
    ad hocnetworks. It provides auto-configuration mechanisms for isolated aswell
    as hybrid MANETs, and is envisioned to be integrated withinunicast routing protocols
    (like DYMO [1] or OLSRv2 [2]).EMAP allows nodes to create a (highly likely) unique
    IP address whichcan be used locally inside the MANET. In a similar way, nodes
    canauto-configure globally routable IP addresses when one (or more)gateways to
    the Internet are present in the network. The generalframework provided by the
    protocol may be used as a service discoveryprotocol for MANETs. As an example,
    this document also specifies anoptional feature which consists on the discovery
    of DNS serversreachable from the MANET. However, the approach is extensible toother
    services like SIP proxies, authentication entities, etc.Therefore, EMAP has been
    designed taking into consideration thepossibility of extending it later on with
    new features, uses, andoptimizations.</p>"
