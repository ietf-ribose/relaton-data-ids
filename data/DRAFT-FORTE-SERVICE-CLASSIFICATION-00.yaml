abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document creates a registry for describing the types of
    services\n   available at a specific location.  The registry is expected to be\n
    \  referenced by other protocols that need a common set of service terms\n   as
    protocol constants.  In particular, we define location-based\n   service as either
    a point at a specific geographic location (e.g.,\n   bus stop) or a service covering
    a specific region (e.g., pizza\n   delivery).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
