abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes some additions to the specification of
    the\n   Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) Protocol\n   regarding
    security issues of its link-local messages.  Although the\n   new specifications
    for IPsec architecture (RFC 4301) and\n   Authorization Header (RFC 4302) permit
    the use of anti-replay, they\n   counsel against its use for multi-sender, multicast
    Security\n   Associations.  This makes PIM-SM vulnerable to Denial of Service\n
    \  (DoS) attack.  In this document, a new proposal is presented to\n   protect
    PIM link-local messages while activating the anti-replay\n   mechanism as well.
    \ This proposal builds on the new Security\n   Association lookup method that
    has been specified in RFC 4301 and RFC\n   4302.\n\t </p>\n      "
