abstract:
- content: "<p>The current flat-structured Host Identity Tag architecture has various
    problems and limitation. Hence, a hierarchical HIT architecture that is compatible
    with the flat-structured HIT architecture is introduced in the document. This
    architecture and the process of HIT generation ensure the global uniqueness of
    HITs. This architecture also enables the multiple Host Identity Protocol administrative
    domains, solves the deployment problem of current flat-structured HIT architecture.
    It also enhances the scalability and resolution efficiency of the mapping system
    from HIT to IP or FQDN.</p>"
