abstract:
- content: "<p>A new framework called Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) has
    been designed with the primary goal of supporting IPv6 over Low Power Wide Area
    Network (LPWAN) technologies [RFC8724]. One of the SCHC components is a header
    compression mechanism. If used properly, SCHC header compression allows a greater
    compression ratio than that achievable with traditional 6LoWPAN header compression
    [RFC6282]. For this reason, it may make sense to use SCHC header compression in
    some 6LoWPAN environments. This document defines a 6LoWPAN Dispatch Type to signal
    when a packet header has been compressed by using SCHC header compression.</p>"
