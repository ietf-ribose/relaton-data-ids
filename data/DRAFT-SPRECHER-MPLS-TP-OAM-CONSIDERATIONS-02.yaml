abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of the MPLS\n
    \  technology for use in transport network deployments.  The work on\n   MPLS-TP
    has extended the MPLS technology with additional\n   architectural elements and
    functions that can be used in any MPLS\n   deployment.  MPLS-TP is a set of functions
    and features selected from\n   the extended MPLS toolset and applied in a consistent
    way to meet the\n   needs and requirements of operators of packet transport networks.\n\n
    \  During the process of development of the profile, additions to the\n   MPLS
    toolset have been made to ensure that the tools available met\n   the requirements.
    \ These additions were motivated by MPLS-TP, but\n   form part of the wider MPLS
    toolset such that any of them could be\n   used in any MPLS deployment.\n\n   One
    major set of additions provides enhanced support for Operations,\n   Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM).  This enables fault management\n   and performance monitoring
    to the level needed in a transport\n   network.  Many solutions and protocol extensions
    have been proposed\n   to address the requirements for MPLS-TP OAM, and this document
    sets\n   out the reasons for selecting a single, coherent set of solutions for\n
    \  standardization.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
