abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Due to the exhaustion of global IPv4 address space, there are
    demands\n   arising for IPv4 address sharing between end users.  In such context,\n
    \  different users can employ the same address, but different ports.\n   This
    document defines two DHCP options for assigning a set of ports\n   to a device.
    \ One is used for allocating continuous port set, while\n   the other is designed
    for non-continuous port set allocation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
