abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of BGP as a control plane for\n
    \  networks that support Service Function Chaining (SFC).  The document\n   introduces
    a new BGP address family called the SFC AFI/SAFI with two\n   route types.  One
    route type is originated by a node to advertise\n   that it hosts a particular
    instance of a specified service function.\n   This route type also provides \"instructions\"
    on how to send a packet\n   to the hosting node in a way that indicates that the
    service function\n   has to be applied to the packet.  The other route type is
    used by a\n   Controller to advertise the paths of \"chains\" of service functions,\n
    \  and to give a unique designator to each such path so that they can be\n   used
    in conjunction with the Network Service Header.\n\n   This document adopts the
    SFC architecture described in RFC 7665.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
