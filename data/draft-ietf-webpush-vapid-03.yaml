abstract:
- content: "<p>An application server can use the method described to voluntarily identify
    itself to a push service. This identification information can be used by the push
    service to attribute requests that are made by the same application server to
    a single entity. An application server can include additional information that
    the operator of a push service can use to contact the operator of the application
    server. This identification information can be used to restrict the use of a push
    subscription a single application server.</p>"
