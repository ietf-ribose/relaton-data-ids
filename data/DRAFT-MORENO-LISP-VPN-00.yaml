abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of the Locator/ID Separation
    Protocol\n   (LISP) to create Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).  LISP is used to\n
    \  provide segmentation in both the LISP data plane and control plane.\n   These
    VPNs can be created over the top of the Internet or over\n   private transport
    networks, and can be implemented by Enterprises or\n   Service Providers.  The
    goal of these VPNs is to leverage the\n   characteristics of LISP - routing scalability,
    simply expressed\n   Ingress site TE Policy, IP Address Family traversal, and
    mobility, in\n   ways that provide value to network operators.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
