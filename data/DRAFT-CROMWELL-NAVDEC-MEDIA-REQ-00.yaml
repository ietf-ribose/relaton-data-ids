abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the functional requirements for protocol
    used\n   by a call processing agent in a packet network to control an media\n
    \  services function located in the same packet network or at the inter-\n   face
    of the packet network and the traditional telephone network. The\n   primary focus
    of the protocol is on audio, however the protocol could\n   be extended in the
    future to support other media streams such as\n   video.\n \n   The protocol provides
    the standard audio operations of play audio,\n   collect DTMF,  and record speech.
    It supports direct references to\n   simple audio as well as indirect references
    to simple and complex\n   audio. It provides multi-language audio variables, interruptibility\n
    \  of audio, digit buffer control, special key sequences, and support\n   for
    reprompting during data collection.\n\n   The approach used in specifying protocol
    functionality was to look at\n   several existing protocols currently in use in
    the telephone network,\n   taking the best concepts from each and attempting to
    avoid any limi-\n   tations.  The following protocols were examined:  ITU CS1-R
    [2], Nor-\n   tel Extended CS1-R [3], Bellcore GR-1129 [4], and Bellcore SR-3511\n
    \  [5].  The protocol described in this document provides at a minimum a\n   superset
    of the functionality of these protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
