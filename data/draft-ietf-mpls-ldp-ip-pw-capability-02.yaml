abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, no LDP capability is exchanged for LDP applications like
    IP label switching and L2VPN P2P PW signaling. When an LDP session comes up, an
    LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state for such LDP applications
    even when the peer session may be established for some other applications like
    ICCP. This document proposes a solution by which an LDP speaker announces its
    disinterest in such non-negotiated application. This, in turn, disables the advertisement
    of corresponding application state, which would have otherwise be advertised by
    default, over the established LDP session.</p>"
