abstract:
  content: "<p>This proposal extends the PIM-DM [1] protocol specification by intro-ducing
    the PIM State-Refresh control message.When an (S,G) entry is created in a router
    for a directly connectedsource, if the interface directly connected to the source
    is theincoming interface for the entry, a new timer is started: the State-Refresh-Timer
    [SRT(S,G)]. The State-Refresh-Timer controls periodictransmission of the PIM State-Refresh
    message, which is propagatedhop-by-hop down the (S,G) RPF tree. When received
    by a router on theRPF interface, the State-Refresh message causes existing prune
    stateto be refreshed.Addition of this heartbeat message solves many of the current
    prob-lems with PIM-DM. It prevents the periodic timeout of prune state inrouters,
    greatly reducing the re-flooding of multicast traffic downthe pruned branches
    that expire periodically. It also causes topologychanges to be realised quicker
    than the traditional 3 minute timeout.</p>"
