abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a new AppMetaData subTLV carried by Tunnel Encap[RFC9012]
    Path Attribute for egress router to advertise the running status and environment
    of the directly attached 5G Edge Computing servers. The AppMetaData can be used
    by the ingress routers in the 5G Local Data Network to make intelligent path selection
    for flows from UEs. The goal is to improve latency and performance for 5G Edge
    Computing services. The extension enables a feature, called soft anchoring, which
    makes one Edge Computing Server at one specific location to be more preferred
    than others for the same application to receive packets from a specific source
    (UE).</p>"
