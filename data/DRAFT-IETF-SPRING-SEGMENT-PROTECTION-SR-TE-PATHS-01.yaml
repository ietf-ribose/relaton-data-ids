abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment routing supports the creation of explicit paths using
    Adj-\n   Segment-ID (SID), Node-SIDs, and BSIDs.  It is important to provide\n
    \  fast reroute (FRR) mechanisms to respond to failures of links and\n   nodes
    in the Segment-Routed Traffic-Engineered(SR-TE) path.  A point\n   of local repair
    (PLR) can provide FRR protection against the failure\n   of a link in an SR-TE
    path by examining only the first (top) label in\n   the SR label stack.  In order
    to protect against the failure of a\n   node, a PLR may need to examine the second
    label in the stack as\n   well, in order to determine SR-TE path beyond the failed
    node.  This\n   document specifies how a PLR can use the first and second label
    in\n   the SR-MPLS label stack describing an SR-TE path to provide\n   protection
    against node failures.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
