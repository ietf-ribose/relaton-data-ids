abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a simple process that allows authors
    of\n   Internet-Drafts to record the status of known implementations by\n   including
    an Implementation Status section.  This will allow\n   reviewers and working groups
    to assign due consideration to documents\n   that have the benefit of running
    code, which may serve as evidence of\n   valuable experimentation and feedback
    that have made the implemented\n   protocols more mature.\n\n   This process is
    not mandatory.  Authors of Internet-Drafts are\n   encouraged to consider using
    the process for their documents, and\n   working groups are invited to think about
    applying the process to all\n   of their protocol specifications.  This document
    obsoletes RFC 6982,\n   advancing it to a Best Current Practice.\n\n\t </p>\n
