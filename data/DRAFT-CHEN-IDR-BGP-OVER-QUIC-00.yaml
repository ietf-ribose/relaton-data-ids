abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an autonomous system routing\n
    \  protocol.  The main function of BGP is to exchange routing and\n   reachability
    information between autonomous systems(AS) on the\n   Internet.  BGP uses TCP
    to implement reliable and orderly\n   transmission of information.  Similar to
    TCP, QUIC is a UDP-based,\n   byte-stream-based reliable data transmission service.
    \ In addition,\n   by integrating with TLS 1.3, QUIC also supports functions such
    as\n   establishing connections with minimum latency and providing\n   confidentiality
    and integrity protection for the transmitted data,\n   and multi-stream multiplexing.
    \ Taking use of QUIC for BGP can\n   achieve the possible advantages.  This document
    defines the mechanism\n   of BGP over QUIC to and corresponding procedures.\n\n\n\t
