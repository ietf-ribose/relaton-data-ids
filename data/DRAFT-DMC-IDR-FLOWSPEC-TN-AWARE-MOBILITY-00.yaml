  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a BGP Flow Specification (flowSpec)\n
    \  extension to disseminate flows from 5G mobile networks so that the\n   5G mobile
    systems slices and Service Types (SSTs) can be mapped to\n   optimal underlying
    network paths in the data network outside the\n   5G UPFs, or the N6 interface
    in 3GPP 5G Architecture [3GPP TR\n   23.501].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
