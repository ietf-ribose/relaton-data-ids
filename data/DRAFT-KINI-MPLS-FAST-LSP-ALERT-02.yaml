abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are applications (e.g. fault-management, OAM) that need
    to\nalert LSRs along an LSP. Currently defined alert mechanisms for\nlabeled packets
    (e.g., TTL expiry, GAL, etc) alert a single LSR along\nthe LSP with one alert
    message. To alert multiple LSRs along the LSP,\nmultiple alert messages have to
    be generated. This results in\nincreasing delays in generating the message as
    the number of LSRs\nincrease. If the message is used to recover from faults, it
    results\nin increasing traffic loss. This document defines a simple and fast\nmechanism
    that can alert all the LSRs along a LSP.\n\t </p>\n      "
