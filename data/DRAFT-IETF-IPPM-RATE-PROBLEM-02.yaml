abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a rate measurement scenario which has wide-spread
    attention\n   of Internet access subscribers and seemingly all industry players,\n
    \  including regulators.  This memo presents an access rate-measurement\n   problem
    statement for test protocols to measure IP Performance\n   Metrics.  Key test
    protocol aspects require the ability to control\n   packet size on the tested
    path and enable asymmetrical packet size\n   testing in a controller-responder
    architecture.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
