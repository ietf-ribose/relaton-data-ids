abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables
    a\nsubscriber to receive asynchronous notification of various events\nfrom other
    SIP user agents.  It defines mechanisms to create,\nrefresh, terminate subscriptions.
    \ This framework also defines\nmechanism to fetch (poll) an event state of a resource
    without\ncreating persistent subscriptions.  There is no mechanism to\ntemporarily
    pause the notifications, while still maintaining a\nsubscription on the server.
    \ This lack of functionality sometime\nresults in a lot of superfluous notification
    traffic, and put\nunnecessary load on the server.  This draft defines an extension
    to\nSIP events that allows the subscriber to pause, un-pause\nnotifications, and
    be able to perform fetch (poll) subscriptions\nwithin an established (created)
    subscription dialog.\n\t </p>\n      "
