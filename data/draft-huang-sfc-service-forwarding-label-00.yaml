    chaining, and application-centric traffic steering bring new opportunities for
    network providers and service providers. This internet draft defines a new Layer
    5 packet header format called Service Forwarding Label (SFL) and procedures which
    can be used as a universal label to differentiate various services and forward
    packets based on different service requirements.</p>"
