abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the original version of the Internationalized Domain Names
    in\nApplications (IDNA) protocol, any Unicode code points taken from user\ninput
    were mapped into a set of Unicode code points that \"make\nsense\", which were
    then encoded and passed to the domain name system\n(DNS).  The current version
    of IDNA presumes that the input to the\nprotocol comes from a set of \"permitted\"
    code points, which it then\nencodes and passes to the DNS, but does not specify
    what to do with\nthe result of user input.  This document describes the actions
    that\ncan be taken by an implementation between user input and passing\npermitted
    code points to the new IDNA protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
