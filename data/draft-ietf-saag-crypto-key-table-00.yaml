abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies the information contained in a database
    oflong-lived cryptographic keys used by many different securityprotocols. The
    database design supports both manual and automatedkey management. In many instances,
    the security protocols do notdirectly use the long-lived key, but rather a key
    derivation functionis used to derive a short-lived key from a long-lived key.</p>"
