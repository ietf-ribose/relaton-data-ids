abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) enables\n
    \  DHCPv4 servers to pass configuration parameters.  It offers\n   configuration
    flexibility.  If not being secured, DHCPv4 is\n   vulnerable to various attacks,
    particularly spoofing attacks.  This\n   document analyzes the security issues
    of DHCPv4 and specifies a\n   Secure DHCPv4 mechanism for communications between
    DHCPv4 clients and\n   servers.  This document provides a DHCPv4 client/server\n
    \  authentication mechanism based on sender's public/private key pairs\n   or
    certificates with associated private keys.  The DHCPv4 message\n   exchanges are
    protected by the signature option and the timestamp\n   option newly defined in
    this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
