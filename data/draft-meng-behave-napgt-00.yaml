abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, if an internal server and hosts are behind NAT, they cannot
    share a global IP address except adding lots of static NAPT rule configuration.
    Because if a server wants to provide a service by constant port(i.e. HTTP and
    FTP) , the destination port of packet sent by an external client should not be
    changed any time when it crosses NAT. This document specifies a new method to
    assign NAPT global address and port, aiming to solve the problem that internal
    servers and hosts cannot share less global IP addresses.</p>"
