abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of this draft is to extend RFC 1958 and RFC 3439\n
    \  analysing the design principles that govern the Internet\n   Architecture,
    evaluate how then have evolved since they were\n   initially introduced and how
    we expect to evolve in the near future.\n   We describe a number of design principle,
    discuss their implications\n   on the Internet architecture, design and engineering.\n\n
    \  The work has been based on the outcome of the ad-hoc European\n   Commission
    Future Internet Architecture (FIArch) group.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
