abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Today, the wireless network arena is made up of different types
    of\n     access (TDMA, CDMA, GSM, etc) and core network technologies (IS-41\n
    \    and MAP over SS7, etc). The heterogeneous nature of today's\n     wireless
    and wireline packet data networks limits the scope of\n     mobility between these
    heterogeneous networks. However, as these\n     heterogeneous networks evolve,
    the mobility management provided by\n     them must evolve to insure seamless
    roaming between the networks.\n \n     With the convergence of voice and data,
    networks of the future will\n     be built on IP packet switched technology, mostly
    due to inherent\n     advantages offered by the technology.\n \n     This document
    identifies several drivers that provide input for an\n     IP Mobility based network
    and also describes a high level IP\n     Mobility architecture that extends the
    current third generation\n     IMT2000 wireless architecture and builds on Mobile
    IP concepts.\n\t </p>\n      "
