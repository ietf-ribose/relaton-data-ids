abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Web servers and the entities that operate them have long had the\nability
    to track user agents as they access resources hosted across\ndifferent web domains.
    \ Concern over the privacy implications of such\ntracking has prompted recent
    work on a number of solutions that aim\nto provide a universal opt-out mechanism
    for web tracking that can be\neffectuated through a simple binary choice presented
    to users.\n\nThis document provides an overview of the following mechanisms:\npermanent
    opt-out cookies, cookie blocking, domain blocking, a \"Do\nNot Track\" (DNT) HTTP
    header, and a Do Not Track Document Object\nModel (DOM) property.  The aim of
    this document is to describe each\napproach, the pros and cons of each, and areas
    where standardization\nmay be necessary should each approach be further pursued,
    without\nmaking recommendations about which approach or approaches should be\nadopted.\n\t
