abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Pervasive Monitoring (PM) attacks on the privacy of Internet
    users is\n   of serious concern to both the user and the operator communities.\n
    \  RFC7258 discussed the critical need to protect users' privacy when\n   developing
    IETF specifications and also recognized making networks\n   unmanageable to mitigate
    PM is not an acceptable outcome, an\n   appropriate balance is needed.  This document
    discusses current\n   security and network management practices that may be impacted
    by the\n   shift to increased use of encryption to help guide protocol\n   development
    in support of manageable, secure networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
