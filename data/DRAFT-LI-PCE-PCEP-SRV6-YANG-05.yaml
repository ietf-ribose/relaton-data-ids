abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document augments a YANG data model for the management
    of Path\n   Computation Element Communications Protocol (PCEP) for communications\n
    \  between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation\n   Element
    (PCE), or between two PCEs in support for Segment Routing in\n   IPv6 (SRv6) and
    SR Policy.  The data model includes configuration\n   data and state data (status
    information and counters for the\n   collection of statistics).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
