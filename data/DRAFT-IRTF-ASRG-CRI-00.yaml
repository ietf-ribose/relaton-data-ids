abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SMTP was designed simply to deliver email messages without\nauthenticating
    sources or senders of email messages. In an\naffort to reduce spam on the Internet,
    Challenge/Response \n('C/R') email systems were developed to provide a method\nfor
    validating message origination for an intended recipient.\nThis document defines
    a Challenge / Response Interworking \n('CRI') protocol by proposing the use of
    SMTP extensions and \nMIME headers for interoperability of C/R systems. This\ndocument
    also defines a set of guidelines for continued\nuse with existing non-CRI mail
    systems and clients.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
