abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Position Aware Secure and Efficient Mesh Routing Protocol\n
    \  (PASER) aims to efficiently establish accurate routes in terms of\n   metric
    and legitimated mesh nodes in wireless mesh networks in\n   presence of external
    attackers. For this end, it achieves the\n   following goals: Node authentication,
    message freshness and\n   integrity, and neighbor transmissions authentication.
    The novelty of\n   PASER lies essentially in combining asymmetric cryptography
    with\n   Merkle tree (a lightweight cryptographic primitive) and a keyed-hash\n
    \  function to secure the routing messages. Another key feature of\n   PASER is
    integrating (virtual) geographical positions of nodes in\n   its hierarchical
    reactive routing process to enable an advanced\n   network management while mitigating
    the wormhole attack. Apart from\n   that, to address the problem of node compromise,
    PASER endorses a\n   key revocation scheme to efficiently exclude those nodes.\n\n\t
