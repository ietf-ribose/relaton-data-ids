abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP is a core part of a network including Software-Defined Networking
    (SDN) system. It has the traffic engineering information on the network topology
    and can compute optimal paths for a given traffic flow across the network. This
    document describes some reference architectures for BGP as a central controller.
    A BGP-based central controller can simplify the operations on the network and
    use network resources efficiently for providing services with high quality.</p>"
