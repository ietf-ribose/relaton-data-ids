abstract:
- content: "<p>Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) are
    established using signaling procedures defined in [RFC4875]. However, [RFC4875]
    does not address several issues that arise when a P2MP-TE LSP is signaled in inter-domain
    networks. One such issue is the computation of a loosely routed inter-domain P2MP-
    TE LSP paths that are re-merge free. Another issue is the reoptimization of the
    inter-domain P2MP-TE LSP tree vs. an individual destination(s), since the loosely
    routing domain ingress border node is not aware of the reoptimization scope. This
    document defines the required protocol extensions needed for establishing and
    reoptimizing P2MP MPLS and GMPLS TE LSPs in inter-domain networks.</p>"
