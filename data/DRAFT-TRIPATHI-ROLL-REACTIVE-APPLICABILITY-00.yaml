abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes serious issues regarding the use of
    reactive\n   routing protocols in Low power and lossy network.  Routing\n   requirements
    for various LLN deployments are studied in order to\n   judge how reactive routing
    may or may not fit to those criteria.\n   This document is intended to point out
    shortcomings of reactive\n   protocols to operate in LLN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
