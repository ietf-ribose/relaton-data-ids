abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IPv6 [1] allows a MN to maintain its IPv6 communications
    while\n   moving between subnets.  This document presents the problematic for
    a\n   MN that has multiple network interfaces.  It discusses how to perform\n
    \  vertical handovers (flow redirection between interfaces) and propose\n   MMI
    (Mobile IPv6 for Multiple Interfaces) which describes the use of\n   Mobile IPv6
    to support multiple interfaces.  One one hand, these\n   extensions focus on the
    MN ability to use a backup interface for\n   communications and on the other hand
    to spread flows between the MN\n   own interfaces.\n\t </p>\n      "
