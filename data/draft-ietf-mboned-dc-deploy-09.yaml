abstract:
- content: "<p>The volume and importance of one-to-many traffic patterns in data centers
    is likely to increase significantly in the future. Reasons for this increase are
    discussed and then attention is paid to the manner in which this traffic pattern
    may be judiciously handled in data centers. The intuitive solution of deploying
    conventional IP multicast within data centers is explored and evaluated. Thereafter,
    a number of emerging innovative approaches are described before a number of recommendations
    are made.</p>"
