abstract:
  content: <p>This document describes an extension to the NFSv4 protocol to allowclients
    to create and write files with greater efficiency.The proposed extension allows
    the server to defer creating the fileon stable storage when replying to an OPEN
    call. The aim is toimprove server efficiency and scalability by reducing the number
    ofrequired disk accesses when writing a file from scratch.KeywordsThe key words
    "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>
