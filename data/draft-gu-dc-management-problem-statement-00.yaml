abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Virtualization provides Data Center with feasibility and improves
    theutilization of limited physical resource, e.g. switches/routers,servers and
    links. Virtual machines (VM) are allowed to migrate toany place in the Data Center.
    A variety of policies (e.g. ACL,firewalls, load balancers, IPS and QoS) are deployed
    in Data Centerto guarantee the SLA the provider signed with their clients. Dynamicinformation,
    such as TCP Connection Table, dynamic ACLs and cumulateddata, is generated on
    network devices. In order to keep runningservices uninterrupted while VM migrating,
    relevant policies anddynamic information, also need to migrate with VM.This document
    describes some examples of the policies and dynamicinformation that need to migrate
    with VM, the influence if they arenot migrated with VM, the problems that need
    to consider when migratepolices and dynamic information. It also describes some
    existingnetwork management protocols standardized by IETF and the advantagesand
    disadvantages of them for operating policies and dynamicinformation migration
    respectively. The goal is to justify that itis necessary for IETF to make effort
    on policy and dynamicinformation migration for large virtualized Data Center.</p>"
