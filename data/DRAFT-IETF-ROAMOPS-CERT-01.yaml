abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To date, roaming implementations have been based on the concept
    of proxy\nchaining, where packets are routed between the NAS and home server\nthrough
    a series of proxies.  While commonly used, proxy chaining\nintroduces difficult
    security problems that have prevented its\nimplementation on a wide scale.\n\nThis
    document describes a new approach to roaming based on certificates\nthat eliminates
    the need for proxy chaining. As described, this approach\nprovides improved security
    as well as scalability.\n\t </p>\n      "
