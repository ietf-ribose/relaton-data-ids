abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Over the last few years, the use of IP addresses for Internet\nconnectivity
    has changed dramatically.  The Name Space Research Group\n(NSRG) was chartered
    by the IRTF to review these changes, and\nmake recommendations on whether or not
    remediation within the\nprotocol stack is necessary.  This document reports the
    outcome of\nsome of the discussions within the research group.\nOne of the questiones
    addressed by the NSRG is: Does the TCP/IP\nprotocol suite need an additional level
    of naming above layer 3 but\nbelow the application layer?  There was no consensus
    on the answer.\nThis document reviews the motivation for an additional naming\nmechanism,
    reviews related work, proposes a straw man 'stack name'\nand discusses the structure
    and use of those names.\n\t </p>\n      "
