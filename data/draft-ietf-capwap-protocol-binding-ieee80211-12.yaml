abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless LAN product architectures have evolved from single autonomous
    access points to systems consisting of a centralized Access Controller (AC) and
    Wireless Termination Points (WTPs). The general goal of centralized control architectures
    is to move access control, including user authentication and authorization, mobility
    management, and radio management from the single access point to a centralized
    controller. This specification defines the Control And Provisioning of Wireless
    Access Points (CAPWAP) Protocol Binding Specification for use with the IEEE 802.11
    Wireless Local Area Network protocol. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
