abstract:
  content: "<p>Traffic engineering using MPLS involves the setting up of labelswitched
    paths (LSP) possibly with explicit routing and withbandwidth guarantees (for label
    switched paths). The reliability ofthese LSPs can be increased by providing a
    backup LSP onto whichtraffic can be switched upon failure of an element in the
    path of theactive LSP. Backup LSPs can be routed in a way that bandwidth can beshared
    between backup links of more than one active path while stillguaranteeing recoverability
    for a set of failures. This sharing greatly increases the network efficiency,
    thereby increasing the number of LSPs that can be carried while maintaining guarantees.
    Algorithms which can route such recoverable LSPs while using only aggregate network
    usage information are being developed.</p>"
