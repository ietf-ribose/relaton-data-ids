abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a protocol to securely assign a pledge
    to an\n   owner, using an intermediary node between pledge and owner.  This\n
    \  intermediary node is known as a \"constrained Join Proxy\".\n\n   This document
    extends the work of\n   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] by replacing the
    Circuit-\n   proxy by a stateless constrained (CoAP) Join Proxy.  It transports\n
    \  join traffic from the pledge to the Registrar without requiring per-\n   client
    state.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
