abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate
    changes to\n   a common IMAP mailbox.  Examples include different clients working
    on\n   behalf of the same user, and multiple users accessing shared\n   mailboxes.
    \ These clients need a mechanism to efficiently synchronize\n   state changes
    for messages within the mailbox.\n\n   Initially defined in RFC 4551, The Conditional
    Store facility\n   provides a protected update mechanism for message state information\n
    \  and a mechanism for requesting only changes to message state.  This\n   memo
    updates that mechanism and obsoletes RFC 4551, based on\n   operational experience.\n\n
    \  This document additionally updates another IMAP extension, Quick\n   Resynchronization,
    which builds on the Conditional Store extension to\n   provide an IMAP client
    the ability to fully resynchronize a mailbox\n   as part of the SELECT/EXAMINE
    command, without the need for\n   additional server-side state or client round-trips.
    \ Hence this memo\n   obsoletes RFC 5162.\n\n   Finally, when these extensions
    are used, other mechanisms are\n   updated.  In particular, the line length recommendation
    in RFC 2863\n   is modified, the UID EXPUNGE command from RFC 4315 is modified,
    and\n   the behavior of STORE/UID STORE/FETCH/UID FETCH/EXPUNGE commands from\n
    \  RFC 3501 is modified.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
