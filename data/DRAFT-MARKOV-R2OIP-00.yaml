abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A way of sending of telephone interexchange R2 signals over the
    \nInternet is presented. Signals are sent as named events. All \nsignals/events
    are divided in four groups. The label of the group is \ntransferred as payload
    type, and type of signal inside the group is \ntransferred as an event code. Transfer
    of signaling packets over the \nReal-time Transport Protocol (RTP) utilizes sequencing,
    numbering \nand timestamping provided by this protocol. Packets used to transfer
    \nthe long lasting line signals are intensively transferred only after \nthe change.
    Labelling of start and the end of signal is performed by \nmarker fields in the
    header and payload. The reliability of transfer \ncan be increased using the well-known
    methods of redundant transfer.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
