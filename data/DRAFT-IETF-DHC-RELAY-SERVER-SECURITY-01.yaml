abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has
    no\n   guidance for how to secure messages exchanged between servers and\n   relay
    agents.  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6\n   (DHCPv6) states
    that IPsec should be used to secure messages\n   exchanged between servers and
    relay agents, but does not recommend\n   encryption.  And, with recent concerns
    about pervasive monitoring it\n   is appropriate to provide recommendations for
    DHCPv4 and also improve\n   the recommendations for DHCPv6.  This document updates
    RFC1542 and\n   RFC3315.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
