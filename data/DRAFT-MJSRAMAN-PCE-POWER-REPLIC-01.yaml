abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Power consumption in multicast replication operations is an
    area of\n   concern and choosing suitable replication points that can decrease\n
    \  power consumption overall assumes importance. Multicast replication\n   capacity
    is an attribute of every line card of major routers and\n   multi-layer switches
    that support multicast in the core of an\n   Internet Service Provider (ISP) or
    an enterprise network.\n\n   Currently multicast replication points on Point-to-Multipoint
    Traffic\n   Engineering Label-Switched-Paths (P2MP TE-LSPs) consume power while\n
    \  delivering multiple output streams of data from a given input stream.\n   The
    multicast distribution trees are constructed without any regard\n   for a proper
    placement of the replication points and consequent\n   optimal power consumption
    at these points.\n\n   This results in overloading certain routers while under-utilizing\n
    \  others. An optimal usage of these replication resources could\n   substantially
    reduce power consumption on these routers. In this\n   paper, we propose a mechanism
    by which P2MP TE-LSPs are constructed\n   for carrying multicast traffic across
    multiple areas within a given\n   AS. We propose that these LSPs be built by using
    the advertisements\n   of the power-replication capacity ratio advertised by fine
    grained\n   components such as multicast capable line-cards of routers and multi-\n
    \  layer switches deployed within an AS.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
