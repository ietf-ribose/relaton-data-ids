abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines an extensible metadata framework
    that may\n   be inserted into the OAuth 2.0 responses to assist the clients to\n
    \  process those responses.  It is expressed either as a link header, or\n   query
    parameters.  It will allow the client to learn the metadata\n   about the particular
    response.  For example, the client can learn\n   where the members in the response
    could be used, what is the\n   characteristics of the payload is, how it should
    be processed, and so\n   on.  Since they are just additional response header/query
    parameters,\n   any client that does not understand this extension should not
    break\n   and work normally while supporting clients can utilize the metadata\n
    \  to take the advantage of the extension.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
