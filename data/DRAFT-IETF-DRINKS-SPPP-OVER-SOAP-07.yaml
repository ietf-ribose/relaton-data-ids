abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Session Peering Provisioning Protocol (SPPP) is an XML
    protocol\n   that exists to enable the provisioning of session establishment data\n
    \  into Session Data Registries or SIP Service Provider data stores.\n   Sending
    XML data structures over Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)\n   and HTTP(s)
    is a widely used, de-facto standard for messaging between\n   elements of provisioning
    systems.  Therefore the combination of SOAP\n   and HTTP(s) as a transport for
    SPPP is a natural fit.  The obvious\n   benefits include leveraging existing industry
    expertise, leveraging\n   existing standards, and a higher probability that existing\n
    \  provisioning systems can be more easily integrated with this\n   protocol.
    \ This document describes the specification for transporting\n   SPPP XML structures
    over SOAP and HTTP(s).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
