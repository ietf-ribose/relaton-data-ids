abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER request, as defined by
    RFC3515, triggers an implicit SIP-Specific Event Notification framework subscription.
    Conflating the start of the subscription with handling the REFER request makes
    negotiating SUBSCRIBE extensions impossible, and complicates avoiding SIP dialog
    sharing. This document defines extensions to REFER to remove the implicit subscription
    and, if desired, replace it with an explicit one.</p>"
