abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines shim header for the transfer of CoAP
    messages\n   over non-TCP/IP constrained networks. In this environment, IP and
    UDP\n   or TCP are not used, so that additional shim header as a container\n   for
    addresses of sender/receiver and the length of CoAP header and\n   its payload
    is required.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
