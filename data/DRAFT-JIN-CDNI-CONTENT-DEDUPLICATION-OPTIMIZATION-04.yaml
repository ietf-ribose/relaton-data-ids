abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent explosive growth of content delivery/distribution networks\n
    \  (CDNs) and their interconnection are causing unintended repetition of\n   content
    storage in the same dCDN.  This can be avoided by using a\n   suitable de-duplication
    mechanism.  This document explores the\n   scenarios which create the problem,
    and then discusses the approaches\n   to eliminate the duplicated transmission
    of the same content from\n   uCDN(s) to dCDN in CDNi networks.  To implement the
    optimization,\n   some enhancement to the CDNi metadata model and interface is\n
    \  required.\n\n   We realize that for business-specific purposes the same content
    may\n   be encrypted/packaged with different keys for different providers.\n   The
    impact of DRM (Digital Rights Management) technology on de-\n   duplication will
    be discussed in a future version of this draft.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
