abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a set of interval values that we call
    \"Standard\n   intervals\".  Values of this set must be supported for transmitting\n
    \  BFD control packets and for calculating the detection time in the\n   receive
    direction when the value is equal or larger than the fastest,\n   i.e. lowest,
    interval a particular BFD implementation supports.\n\n   This solves the problem
    of finding an interval value that both BFD\n   speakers can support while allowing
    a simplified implementation as\n   seen for hardware-based BFD.  It does not restrict
    an implementation\n   from supporting more intervals in addition to the Standard
    intervals.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
