abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a payload format for use with the Real-time
    Transport Protocol (RTP) version 2 for interleaving encoded audio data. It is
    intended for use in audio streaming delay tolerant applications operating over
    best-effort packet networks. The goal of interleaving is to disperse burst losses
    into a series of shorter losses. The total amount of audio lost is not changed
    by interleaving, but the individual loss events are shorter and easier to conceal
    at the receiver.</p>"
