abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a payload format for use with theReal-time
    Transport Protocol (RTP) version 2 for interleavingencoded audio data. It is intended
    for use in audio streamingdelay tolerant applications operating over best-effort
    packetnetworks. The goal of interleaving is to disperse burstlosses into a series
    of shorter losses. The total amount ofaudio lost is not changed by interleaving,
    but the individualloss events are shorter and easier to conceal at the receiver.</p>"
