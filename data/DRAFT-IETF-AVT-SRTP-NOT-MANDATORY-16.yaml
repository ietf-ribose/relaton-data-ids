abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo discusses the problem of securing real-time multimedia
    sessions.  It also explains why the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) and the
    associated RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) do not mandate a single media security
    mechanism.  This is relevant for designers and reviewers of future RTP extensions
    to ensure that appropriate security mechanisms are mandated and that any such
    mechanisms are specified in a manner that conforms with the RTP architecture.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
