abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC7432 defines the Designated Forwarder (DF) in (PBB-)EVPN
    networks\n   as the PE responsible for sending broadcast, multicast and unknown\n
    \  unicast traffic (BUM) to a multi-homed device/network in the case of\n   an
    all-active multi-homing ES, or BUM and unicast in the case of\n   single-active
    multi-homing.\n\n   The DF is selected out of a candidate list of PEs that advertise
    the\n   Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) to the EVPN network, according to\n
    \  the 'service-carving' algorithm.\n\n   While 'service-carving' provides an
    efficient and automated way of\n   selecting the DF across different EVIs or ISIDs
    in the ES, there are\n   some use-cases where a more 'deterministic' and user-controlled\n
    \  method is required. At the same time, Service Providers require an\n   easy
    way to force an on-demand DF switchover in order to carry out\n   some maintenance
    tasks on the existing DF or control whether a new\n   active PE can preempt the
    existing DF PE.\n\n   This document proposes an extension to the current RFC7432
    DF\n   election procedures so that the above requirements can be met.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
