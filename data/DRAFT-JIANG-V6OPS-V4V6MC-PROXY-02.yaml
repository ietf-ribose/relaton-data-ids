abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   During the long co-existing period of IPv6 and IPv4, the\n
    \  interoperation between IPv6 network and IPv4 network is essential.\n   Multicast
    services across IPv6 and IPv4 networks are also needed.\n   Besides the packet-based
    multicast translation mechanism, this\n   document describes a multicast proxy
    solution. The solution is a\n   multicast deployment for transition scenario.
    It does not propose\n   any new protocol or protocol modification/extension for
    multicast.\n   The multicast proxy is deployed at the border of IPv6/IPv4 networks.\n
    \  It is mainly based on content\n   cache. Without packet-based translation,
    it acquires the content data\n   from IPvX network, caches the data, and multicasts
    the data in IPvY\n   network. It acts as a multicast leaf in the IPvX network
    where the\n   data source locates while acting as a multicast source in IPvY\n
    \  network where the multicast client locates.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
