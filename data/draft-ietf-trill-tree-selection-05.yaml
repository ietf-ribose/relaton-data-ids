abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) uses distribution
    trees to deliver multi-destination frames. Multiple trees can be used by an ingress
    Routing Bridge (RBridge) for flows, regardless of the VLAN, Fine-Grained Label
    (FGL), and/or multicast group of the flow. Different ingress RBridges may choose
    different distribution trees for TRILL Data packets in the same VLAN, FGL, and/or
    multicast group. To avoid unnecessary link utilization, distribution trees should
    be pruned based on one or more of the following: VLAN, FGL, or multicast destination
    address. If any VLAN, FGL, or multicast group can be sent on any tree, for typical
    fast-path hardware, the amount of pruning information is multiplied by the number
    of trees, but there is limited hardware capacity for such pruning information.
    This document specifies an optional facility to restrict the TRILL Data packets
    sent on particular distribution trees by VLAN, FGL, and/or multicast groups, thus
    reducing the total amount of pruning information so that it can more easily be
    accommodated by fast-path hardware.</p>"
