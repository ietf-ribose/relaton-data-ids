abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of the architecture of the L-band
    Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS), which provides a secure, scalable
    and spectrum efficient terrestrial data link for civil aviation. LDACS is a scheduled,
    reliable multi-application cellular broadband system with support for IPv6. LDACS
    shall provide a data link for IP network-based aircraft guidance. High reliability
    and availability for IP connectivity over LDACS are therefore essential.</p>"
