abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a terminology for benchmarking the SIP\n
    \  performance of networking devices.  The term performance in this\n   context
    means the capacity of the device- or system-under-test to\n   process SIP messages.
    \ Terms are included for test components, test\n   setup parameters, and performance
    benchmark metrics for black-box\n   benchmarking of SIP networking devices.  The
    performance benchmark\n   metrics are obtained for the SIP signaling plane only.
    \ The terms are\n   intended for use in a companion methodology document for\n
    \  characterizing the performance of a SIP networking device under a\n   variety
    of conditions.  The intent of the two documents is to enable\n   a comparison
    of the capacity of SIP networking devices.  Test setup\n   parameters and a methodology
    document are necessary because SIP\n   allows a wide range of configuration and
    operational conditions that\n   can influence performance benchmark measurements.
    \ A standard\n   terminology and methodology will ensure that benchmarks have\n
    \  consistent definition and were obtained following the same\n   procedures.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
