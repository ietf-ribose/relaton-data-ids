abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When a mobile node moves between two foreign networks it has to
    be\nreauthenticated.  If the home network has multiple AAA servers the\nreauthentication
    request may not be received by the same AAAH as\nprevious authentication requests.\nIn
    order for the new AAAH to be able to forward the request to the\ncorrect HA it
    has to know the identity of the HA.  This document\ndefines an extension that
    enables the HA to pass its identity to the\nmobile node which can in turn pass
    it to the AAA server when changing\npoint of attachment.  This document specifies
    a NAI extension that\ncan carry these NAIs.\n\t </p>\n      "
