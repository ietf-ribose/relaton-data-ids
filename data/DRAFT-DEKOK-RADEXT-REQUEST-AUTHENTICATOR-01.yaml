abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RADIUS contains a one-octet Identifier field which is used
    to\n   correlate requests and replies.  This field limits the number of\n   outstanding
    requests to 256.  Experience shows that this limitation\n   is problematic for
    high load systems.  This document proposes to use\n   the Request Authenticator
    field as an additional unique identifier.\n   The replies can then be correlated
    to requests by copying the Request\n   Authenticator from the request to a new
    attribute in the response,\n   called the Original-Request-Authenticator.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
