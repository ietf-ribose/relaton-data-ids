abstract:
- content: "<p>New services such as virtual network, service function chaining, and
    application-centric traffic steering bring new opportunities for network providers
    and service providers. With these new services, the interactions between applications
    and networks are becoming more critical in order to achieve satisfactory QoS,
    reliability, and security, which are tailored to each specific application. Application-based
    Policy for Network Function (APONF) is designed to facilitate these interactions.
    This internet draft describes some use cases that show how APONF may be deployed
    to support these services.</p>"
