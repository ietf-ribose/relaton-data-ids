abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   3GPP and TISPAN are defining the protocol specification for
    the\n   Communication Diversion (CDIV) service using IP Multimedia (IM) Core\n
    \  Network (CN) subsystem (IMS) supplementary service.  As part of CDIV,\n   a
    SIP based event package is used for notifying users about\n   diversions (re-directions
    or forwarding) of requests for\n   communication sessions targetting the user.
    \ This document defines\n   the SIP event package to support subscription and
    notification of\n   diversions.  The proposed event package is applicable to the
    CDIV\n   supplementary service in IMS and may not be applicable to the general\n
    \  internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
