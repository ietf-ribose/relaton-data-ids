abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] requires a reliable\ntransport
    for end-to-end communication.  While historically TCP has\nbeen used for this
    purpose, this document proposes an alternative --\nthe Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960].  Similar\nto TCP, SCTP offers a reliable end-to-end
    transport connection to\napplications.  Additionally, SCTP offers innovative services\nunavailable
    in TCP.  This draft (i) specifies HTTP over SCTP's\nmultistreaming service, (ii)
    lists open issues warranting more\ndiscussion and/or investigation, and (iii)
    shares some lessons\nlearned from implementing HTTP over SCTP.  Finally, this
    document\nhighlights SCTP services that better match HTTP's needs than TCP.\n\t
