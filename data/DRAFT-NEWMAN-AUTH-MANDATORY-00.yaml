abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     This memo defines the ``mandatory-to-implement authentication\n
    \    mechanism'' problem (at the per-TCP-connection level), describes\n     the
    requirements necessary for a solution, and identifies the\n     mechanisms which
    meet a significant subset of the requirements.  It\n     is hoped this will help
    the IETF come to an understanding of the\n     problem and a rough consensus on
    a solution.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
