abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides a new mechanism for caching DNS resolvers.\nWhen
    all the authoritative name servers for a zone fail, and the\nrequest can't be
    found in the cache, during a period of time the\ncaching DNS resolvers won't query
    the authoritative name servers, but\ndirectly return a SERVFAIL to the clients
    to reduce the recursive\nname server load and the network load.\n\t </p>\n      "
