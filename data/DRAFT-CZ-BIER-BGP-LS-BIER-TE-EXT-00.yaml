abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)-TE shares architecture
    and\n   packet formats with BIER as described in [RFC8279].  BIER-TE forwards\n
    \  and replicates packets based on a BitString in the packet header, but\n   every
    BitPosition of the BitString of a BIER-TE packet indicates one\n   or more adjacencies
    as described in [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].\n\n   BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) enables
    the collection of various topology\n   informations from the network, and the
    topology informations are used\n   by the PCE to calculate the path and then propagate
    them onto the\n   BFRs(instead of having each node to calculate on its own) and
    that\n   can be for both inter-as and intra-as situations.\n\n   This document
    specifies extensions to the BGP Link-state address-\n   family in order to advertise
    BIER-TE informations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
