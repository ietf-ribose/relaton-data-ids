abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In CoAP as defined by RFC 7252, responses are always unicast
    back to\n   a client that posed a request.  The present memo describes two forms\n
    \  of responses that go beyond that model.  These descriptions are not\n   intended
    as advocacy for adopting these approaches immediately, they\n   are provided to
    point out potential avenues for development that\n   would have to be carefully
    evaluated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
