abstract:
- content: "<p>In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access
    (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a captive portal
    mode. This highly restricts what the customer can do until the customer has authenticated.
    This document describes a DHCP option (and a RA extension) to inform clients that
    they are behind some sort of captive portal device, and that they will need to
    authenticate to get Internet Access.</p>"
