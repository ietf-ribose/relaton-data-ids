abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an UDP-based notification mechanism to collect
    data from networking devices. A shim header is proposed to facilitate the data
    streaming directly from the publishing process on network processor of line cards
    to receivers. The objective is to provide a lightweight approach to enable higher
    frequency and less performance impact on publisher and receiver processes compared
    to already established notification mechanisms.</p>"
