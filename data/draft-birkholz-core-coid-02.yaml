abstract:
- content: "<p>There is an increased demand of trustworthy claim sets -- a set of
    system entity characteristics tied to an entity via signatures -- in order to
    provide information. Claim sets represented via CBOR Web Tokens (CWT) can compose
    a variety of evidence suitable for constrained-node networks and to support secure
    device automation. This document focuses on sets of identifiers and attributes
    that are tied to a system entity and are typically used to compose identities
    appropriate for Constrained RESTful Environment (CoRE) authentication needs.</p>"
