abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the Constrained Bootstrapping Remote
    Secure Key\n   Infrastructure (Constrained BRSKI) protocol, which provides a\n
    \  solution for secure zero-touch bootstrapping of resource-constrained\n   (IoT)
    devices into the network of a domain owner.  This protocol is\n   designed for
    constrained networks, which may have limited data\n   throughput or may experience
    frequent packet loss.  Constrained BRSKI\n   is a variant of the BRSKI protocol,
    which uses an artifact signed by\n   the device manufacturer called the \"voucher\"
    which enables a new\n   device and the owner's network to mutually authenticate.
    \ While the\n   BRSKI voucher is typically encoded in JSON, Constrained BRSKI
    defines\n   a compact CBOR-encoded voucher.  The BRSKI voucher is extended with\n
    \  new data types that allow for smaller voucher sizes.  The Enrollment\n   over
    Secure Transport (EST) protocol, used in BRSKI, is replaced with\n   EST-over-CoAPS;
    and HTTPS used in BRSKI is replaced with CoAPS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
