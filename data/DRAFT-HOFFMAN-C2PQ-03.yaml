abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Quantum computing is the study of computers that use quantum
    features\n   in calculations.  For over 20 years, it has been known that if very\n
    \  large, specialized quantum computers could be built, they could have\n   a
    devastating effect on asymmetric classical cryptographic algorithms\n   such as
    RSA and elliptic curve signatures and key exchange, as well\n   as (but in smaller
    scale) on symmetric cryptographic algorithms such\n   as block ciphers, MACs,
    and hash functions.  There has already been a\n   great deal of study on how to
    create algorithms that will resist\n   large, specialized quantum computers, but
    so far, the properties of\n   those algorithms make them onerous to adopt before
    they are needed.\n\n   Small quantum computers are being built today, but it is
    still far\n   from clear when large, specialized quantum computers will be built\n
    \  that can recover private or secret keys in classical algorithms at\n   the
    key sizes commonly used today.  It is important to be able to\n   predict when
    large, specialized quantum computers usable for\n   cryptanalysis will be possible
    so that organization can change to\n   post-quantum cryptographic algorithms well
    before they are needed.\n\n   This document describes quantum computing, how it
    might be used to\n   attack classical cryptographic algorithms, and possibly how
    to\n   predict when large, specialized quantum computers will become\n   feasible.\n\n\t
