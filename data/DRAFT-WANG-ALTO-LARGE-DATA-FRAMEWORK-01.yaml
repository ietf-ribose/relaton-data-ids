abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol
    provides\n   network information with the goal of improving both application\n
    \  performance and network resource utilization.  As data transfers\n   become
    larger (e.g., due to big data analysis), more data transfers\n   are concurrent
    but with service requirements, and more network\n   capabilities are emerging
    (e.g., SDN allowing a data transfer to\n   request specific routes or Qos), the
    management of large data\n   transfers has become an increasingly challenging
    issue.  This\n   document introduces Data Transfer Coordinator (DTC), a centralized\n
    \  data transfer scheduling framework which provides Scheduling Hub\n   Service
    (SHS) to coordinate and schedule large data transfers.  DTC\n   considers all
    three components: data transfer requirements, (ALTO)\n   network information,
    and SDN control capabilities.  This document\n   specifies not only the basic
    framework of DTC, but also a key\n   component, service API for SHS to specify
    data transfers and their\n   relations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
