abstract:
- content: "<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Core Optical
    Networks (CORONET) program has laid out a vision for the next evolution of IP
    and optical commercial and government networks, with a focus on highly dynamic
    and resilient multi-terabit core networks. It anticipates the need for rapid (sub-second)
    setup and SONET/SDH- like restoration times for high-churn (up to tens of requests
    per second network-wide and one second to one minute holding times) on- demand
    wavelength, sub-wavelength and packet services for a variety of applications (e.g.,
    grid computing, cloud computing, data visualization, fast data transfer, etc.).
    This must be done while meeting stringent call blocking requirements, and while
    minimizing the use of resources such as time slots, switch ports, wavelength conversion
    and wavelength-km. This document discusses the requirements for extensions to
    Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling for expediting the
    control of Label Switched Paths (LSPs), including sub- wavelengths (e.g., OTN
    ODUs) and full wavelengths, in order to satisfy application requirements laid
    out in this program.</p>"
