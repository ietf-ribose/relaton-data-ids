abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document identifies a potential SPIT and Phishing attack,
    which \nsubverts the RFC 4474 SIP Identity and RFC 4916 Connected Identity \nmechanisms
    in a particular way.  The attack is termed \"Baiting\", as \nit uses a RFC4474-signed
    call as the bait for malicious use.\n\t </p>\n      "
