abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the processing of the Hop-by-Hop Options\n
    \  Header (HBH) in today's routers in the aspects of standards\n   specification,
    common implementations, and default operations.  This\n   document outlines the
    reasons why the Hop-by-Hop Options Header is\n   rarely utilized in current networks.
    \ In addition, this document\n   describes how the HBH could be used as a powerful
    mechanism allowing\n   deployment and operations of new services requiring a more
    optimized\n   way to leverage network resources of an infrastructure.  The Hop-by-\n
    \  Hop Options Header is taken into consideration by several network\n   operators
    as a valuable container for carrying the information\n   facilitating the introduction
    of new services.  The purpose of this\n   draft is to document the reasons why
    the HBH is rarely used within\n   networks and to define a proper list of requirements
    aiming to allow\n   a better leverage of the HBH capability.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
