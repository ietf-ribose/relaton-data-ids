abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the frame format for transmission of
    IPv6\n   packets and the method of forming IPv6 link-local addresses and\n   statelessly
    autoconfigured addresses on Ethernet networks.  It also\n   specifies the content
    of the Source/Target Link-layer Address option\n   used in Router Solicitation,
    Router Advertisement, Neighbor\n   Solicitation, Neighbor Advertisement and Redirect
    messages when those\n   messages are transmitted on an Ethernet.\n\n   This document
    replaces RFC 2464 \"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over\n   Ethernet Networks\",
    which will become historic.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
