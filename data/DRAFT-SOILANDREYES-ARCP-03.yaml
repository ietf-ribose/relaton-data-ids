abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification define the Archive and Package URI scheme
    \"arcp\".\n\n   arcp URIs can be used to consume or reference hypermedia resources\n
    \  bundled inside a file archive or an application package, as well as\n   to
    resolve URIs for archive resources within a programmatic\n   framework.\n\n   This
    URI scheme provides mechanisms to generate a unique base URI to\n   represent
    the root of the archive, so that relative URI references in\n   a bundled resource
    can be resolved within the archive without having\n   to extract the archive content
    on the local file system.\n\n   An arcp URI can be used for purposes of isolation
    (e.g. when\n   consuming multiple archives), security constraints (avoiding \"climb\n
    \  out\" from the archive), or for externally identiyfing sub-resources\n   referenced
    by hypermedia formats.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
