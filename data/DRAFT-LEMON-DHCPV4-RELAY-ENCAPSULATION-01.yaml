abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a general mechanism whereby DHCP relay
    agents\ncan encapsulate DHCP packets that they are forwarding in the\ndirection
    of DHCP servers, and decapsulate packets that they they are\nforwarding toward
    DHCP clients, so that more than one relay agent can\ninsert relay agent suboptions
    into the forwarding chain.\n\t </p>\n      "
