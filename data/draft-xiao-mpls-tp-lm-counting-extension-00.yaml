abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Packet loss measurement for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)PseudoWires,
    Label Switched Paths, and Sections, is an importantOperation, Administration and
    Maintenance (OAM) function of theMPLS-TP. When this OAM function is performed,
    counting thetransmitted and received packets at both the source MEP and the sinkMEP
    needs to be activated at first. This document specifies OAMpackets and protocol
    mechanism to facilitate the counting activationand deactivation at the sink MEP,
    and leave out the unnecessarymanagement configuration at the sink MEP when the
    MPLS-TP connectionis bidirectional or there exists an out-of-band return path.</p>"
