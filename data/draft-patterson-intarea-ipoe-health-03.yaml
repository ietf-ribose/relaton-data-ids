abstract:
- content: "<p>PPP over Ethernet clients have the functionality to detect path unavailability
    by using PPP Keepalives. IP over Ethernet does not have this functionality, and
    it is not specified in the IETF when an IP over Ethernet client should consider
    its WAN connectivity down, unless there is a physical layer link down event. This
    document describes a mechanism for IP over Ethernet clients to achieve connectivity
    validation, similar to that of PPP over Ethernet, by using BFD Echo, or ARP and
    Neighbor Discovery functions.</p>"
