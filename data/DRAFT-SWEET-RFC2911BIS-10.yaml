abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an application level
    protocol\n   for distributed printing using Internet tools and technologies.  This\n
    \  document describes a simplified model consisting of abstract objects,\n   attributes,
    and operations that is independent of encoding and\n   transport.  The model consists
    of several objects including Printers\n   and Jobs.  Jobs optionally support multiple
    Documents.\n\n   IPP semantics allow End Users and Operators to query Printer\n
    \  capabilities, submit print Jobs, inquire about the status of print\n   Jobs
    and Printers, and cancel, hold, and release print Jobs.  IPP\n   semantics also
    allow Operators to pause and resume Jobs and Printers.\n\n   Security, internationalization,
    and directory issues are also\n   addressed by the model and semantics.  The IPP
    message encoding and\n   transport are described in IPP/1.1: Encoding and Transport\n
    \  [RFC2910bis].\n\n   This document obsoletes RFCs 2911, 3381, and 3382.\n\n\t
