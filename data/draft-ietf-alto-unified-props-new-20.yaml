abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) Protocol that generalizes the concept of "endpoint properties",
    which were so far tied to IP addresses, to entities defined by a wide set of objects.
    Further, these properties are presented as maps, similar to the network and cost
    maps in the base ALTO protocol. While supporting the endpoints and related endpoint
    property service defined in RFC7285, the protocol is extended in two major directions.
    First, from endpoints restricted to IP addresses to entities covering a wider
    and extensible set of objects; second, from properties on specific endpoints to
    entire entity property maps. These extensions introduce additional features allowing
    entities and property values to be specific to a given information resource. This
    is made possible by a generic and flexible design of entity and property types.</p>
