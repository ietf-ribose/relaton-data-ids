abstract:
  content: "<p>Mobile nodes enhance their connections across wireless media byestablishing
    specific parameters at the FA/AR/AP in order tofacilitate optimal usage of the
    resources as well as enhance the QoSas seen by a MN. During handover from one
    access router to another, abandwidth-constrained mobile node MAY need to have
    state informationpassed from the previous router to the new one. This documentproposes
    a context transfer framework that makes use of existing fasthandoff signaling
    for context transfer as well as provide a mechanismfor QoS negotiation and renegotiations.
    We also cover CT under CARdiscovery. The suggested mechanism provides for context
    transfer sothat the applications running on the mobile node could operate withminimal
    disruption.</p>"
