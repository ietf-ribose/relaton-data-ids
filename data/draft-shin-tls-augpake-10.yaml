abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an efficient augmented password-authenticated
    key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user remembers a low-entropy password
    and its verifier is registered in the intended server. In general, the user's
    password is chosen from a small set of dictionary, making the password susceptible
    to offline dictionary attacks. The AugPAKE protocol described here is secure against
    passive attacks, active attacks and offline dictionary attacks (on the obtained
    messages with passive/active attacks), and also provides resistance to server
    compromise (in the context of augmented PAKE security). Based on the AugPAKE protocol,
    this document also specifies a new password-only authentication handshake for
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.</p>"
