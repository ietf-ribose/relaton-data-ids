abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP routing security is becoming a major issue that affects the normal
    running of Internet services. Currently, there are many solutions, including ROA
    authentication and ASPA authentication, to prevent route source hijacking, path
    hijacking, and route leaking. However, on an actual network, large ISPs with multiple
    ASes can use carefully constructed routes to bypass ROA and ASPA authentication
    to attack the target network. This document defines an region-based authentication
    method for large ISPs with many ASes to prevent traffic hijacking within ISPs.</p>"
