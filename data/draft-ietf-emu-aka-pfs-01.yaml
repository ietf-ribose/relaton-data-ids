abstract:
- content: "<p>Many different attacks have been reported as part of revelations associated
    with pervasive surveillance. Some of the reported attacks involved compromising
    smart cards, such as attacking SIM card manufacturers and operators in an effort
    to compromise shared secrets stored on these cards. Since the publication of those
    reports, manufacturing and provisioning processes have gained much scrutiny and
    have improved. However, the danger of resourceful attackers for these systems
    is still a concern. This specification is an optional extension to the EAP-AKA'
    authentication method which was defined in RFC 5448 (to be superseded by draft-ietf-emu-rfc5448bis).
    The extension, when negotiated, provides Perfect Forward Secrecy for the session
    key generated as a part of the authentication run in EAP-AKA'. This prevents an
    attacker who has gained access to the long-term pre-shared secret in a SIM card
    from being able to decrypt all past communications. In addition, if the attacker
    stays merely a passive eavesdropper, the extension prevents attacks against future
    sessions. This forces attackers to use active attacks instead.</p>"
