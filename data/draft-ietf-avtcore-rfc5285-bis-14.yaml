abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a general mechanism to use the header extension
    feature of RTP (the Real-time Transport Protocol). It provides the option to use
    a small number of small extensions in each RTP packet, where the universe of possible
    extensions is large and registration is decentralized. The actual extensions in
    use in a session are signaled in the setup information for that session. This
    document obsoletes RFC 5285.</p>"
