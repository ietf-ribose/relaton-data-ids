abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines extensions to RFC 4279, \"Pre-Shared Key\nCiphersuites
    for Transport Layer Security (TLS)\", to enable dynamic\nkey sharing in distributed
    environments using a Generic Security\nService Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
    mechanism, and then\nimport that shared key as the \"Pre-Shared Key\" to complete
    the TLS\nhandshake.\nThis is a modular approach to perform authentication and
    key exchange\nbased on off-shelf libraries.  And it obviates the need of pair-wise\nkey
    sharing by enabling the use of the widely-deployed Kerberos alike\ntrust infrastructures
    that are highly scalable and robust.\nFurthermore, conforming implementations
    can provide server\nauthentication without the use of certificates.\n\t </p>\n
