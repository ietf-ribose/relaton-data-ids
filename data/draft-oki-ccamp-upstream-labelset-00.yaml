abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes extensions to GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling requiredto
    support a upstream label set when a bidirectional path is set up. Inthe existing
    drafts on GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling, a upstream label for theupstream path has to
    be reserved at an intermediate node before Pathmessage is transmitted to the next-hop
    node. On the other hand, a labelset that includes one or more labels for the downstream
    path is carriedby Path message and then Resv message reserves a label at each
    interme-diate node on the route or a source node. This document proposes theway
    to support the upstream label set as is the case of the Label Setfor downstream.</p>"
