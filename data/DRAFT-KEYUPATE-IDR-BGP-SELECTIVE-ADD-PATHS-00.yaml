abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Originally, a BGP speaker was only allowed to advertise one
    path to\n   any given address prefix.  If the BGP speaker advertised a second\n
    \  path to a given prefix, the second path was considered to be a\n   replacement
    for the first.  The BGP ADD-PATH capability was defined\n   to enable a BGP speaker
    to advertise multiple paths to a given\n   address prefix, without one path replacing
    any of the others.\n   However, whether a BGP speaker advertises multiple paths
    for any\n   given prefix is always a matter of local policy for that BGP speaker.\n
    \  In certain situations, it is desirable to allow a BGP speaker to\n   signal
    to its peers that the peers may advertise multiple\n   simultaneous paths for
    certain prefixes but not for others.  This\n   document defines a new BGP capability,
    the Selective ADD-PATH\n   capability, that allows a BGP speaker to signal to
    its peers whether\n   a particular prefix is or is not eligible to have multiple
    paths\n   advertised.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
