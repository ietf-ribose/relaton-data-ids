abstract:
  content: "<p>With bidirectional tunneling in Proxy Mobile IPv6, the communicationbetween
    any two Mobile Nodes is required to traverse the LocalMobility Anchor (LMA). This
    is the case even when the communicatingMobile Nodes are attached to the same Mobility
    Anchor Gateway (MAG).This document introduces two messages between the LMA and
    the MAGenabling local forwarding by the MAG. Such forwarding avoids thedelay due
    to bidirectional forwarding, and reduces the traffic loadon the LMA.</p>"
