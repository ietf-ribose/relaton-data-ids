abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Re-establishment of the QoS after a Mobile Node handover must
    be done \nas quickly as possible in order to reduce degradation or interruption
    \nof the QoS and it is especially useful when realtime applications are \nused.
    \nWe propose a Semi-Proactive procedure for a fast QoS re-establishment \nin environments
    where there are Mobile Nodes. The basic idea of this \nprocedure is to perform
    as many operation as possible before the \nhandover (in a proactive way). Resources
    are reserved only after \nthe handover on the effective new data path, in order
    to avoid their\nwaste.\nMoreover, we propose to buffer at the Candidate CRossover
    Node - \nCCRN (an intermediate node on end-to-end data path) the packets \ndirected
    to the Mobile Node during the handover. In this way the \ntotal QoS re-establishment
    time is reduced. This buffering also \nguarantees, for the buffered packets, the
    same QoS treatment of the \nother packets (the no-buffered ones).\n\t </p>\n      "
