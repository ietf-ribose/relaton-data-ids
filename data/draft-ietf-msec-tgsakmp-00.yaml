abstract:
  content: "<p>The Tunneled Group Secure Association Key Management Protocol(T-GSAKMP)
    provides a security framework for creating cryptographicgroups on a network. It
    is designed to provide key distributionservices under the cryptographic protection
    of a pairwise SA,like IPSec. T-GSAKMP relies on the pairwise SA to provide dataconfidentiality
    services for policy, DoS mitigation services,and protection from 'man-in-the-middle'
    attacks. It providesmechanisms to disseminate group security policy, perform accesscontrol
    based upon PKI certificates, generate group keys,and recover from compromise.
    This framework addresses groupscalability issues by facilitating delegation of
    process-intensiveactions in a secure and controlled manner.</p>"
