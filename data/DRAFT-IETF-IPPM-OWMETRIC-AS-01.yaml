abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Active traffic measurements are starting to become more widely
    used to\nascertain network performance characteristics.  All active measurement\nsystems
    have the capability to measure one-way delay and one-way loss\nmetrics, as defined
    in RFC2679 [1] A One- way Delay Metric for IPPM and\nRFC 2680 [2] A One-way Packet
    Loss Metric for IPPM, respectively.  To\nensure that the resulting numbers have
    some meaning, we attempt to\ncharacterize how the measurements are taken and what
    would ensure that\nthe end numbers are indeed meaningful.  This document describes
    an\napplicability statement (formerly known as best current practices) for\nmeasuring
    the one-way delay and one-way loss metrics in operational\nnetworks.\n\t </p>\n
