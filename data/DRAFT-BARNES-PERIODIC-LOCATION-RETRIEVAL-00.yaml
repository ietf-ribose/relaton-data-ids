abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The base HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) protocol includes\n
    \  options for retrieving location information from a LIS by a Device.\n   Some
    networks require the ability for the device to periodically\n   request location
    information from the LIS and/or for the LIS to\n   periodically request location
    information from the device.\n   Extensions to base HELD allow a Device to establish
    a context with a\n   LIS and negotiate capabilities of the Device in terms of
    providing\n   location information.  The measurement extensions to base HELD allow\n
    \  the LIS to request location information from a Device.  This document\n   provides
    an overview of the requirements and a solution using HELD\n   and HELD extensions
    to support the periodic request of location information, both by a Device from
    an LIS and by the LIS from a\n   Device, depending upon the specific scenario
    and measurement\n   capabilities of the Device.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
