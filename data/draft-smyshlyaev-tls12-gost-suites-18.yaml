abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies three new cipher suites, two new signature
    algorithms, seven new supported groups and two new certificate types for the Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) protocol Version 1.2 to support the Russian cryptographic
    standard algorithms (called GOST algorithms). This document specifies a profile
    of TLS 1.2 with GOST algorithms so that implementers can produce interoperable
    implementations. This specification is developed to facilitate implementations
    that wish to support the GOST algorithms. This document does not imply IETF endorsement
    of the cipher suites, signature algorithms, supported groups and certificate types.</p>"
