abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [RFC8175] describes
    a\n   protocol for modems to advertise the status of wireless links between\n
    \  reachable destinations to attached routers.  The core specification\n   of
    the protocol assumes that every modem in the radio network has an\n   attached
    DLEP router, and requires that the MAC address of the DLEP\n   interface on the
    attached router be used to identify the destination\n   in the network, for purposes
    of reporting the state and quality of\n   the link to that destination.\n\n   This
    document describes a DLEP Extension allowing modems that do not\n   meet the strict
    requirement above to use DLEP to describe link\n   availability and quality to
    one or more destinations reachable beyond\n   a device on the Layer 2 domain.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
