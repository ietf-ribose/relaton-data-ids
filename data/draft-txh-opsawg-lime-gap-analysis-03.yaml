abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft analyses the existing management plane OAM related works
    in different SDOs, against the key objectives of Layer Independent OAM Management
    (LIME), to find the gap between them. The results can be used as the guidance
    for further work. This gap analysis is not targeted at L0-L2 transport OAM in
    ITU-T, either technology specific or generic across those technologies. Rather,
    it is intended to leverage knowledge from that domain for the benefit of developing
    generic layer independent OAM management for L3-L7 (and L2.5 MPLS OAM).</p>"
