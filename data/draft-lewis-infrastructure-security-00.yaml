abstract:
  content: <p>This RFC defines best current practices for implementing ServiceProvider
    network infrastructure protection for network elements.This RFC complements and
    extends RFC 2267 and RFC 3704. RFC 2267provides guidelines for filtering traffic
    on the ingress to serviceprovider networks. RFC 3704 expands the recommendations
    described inRFC 2267 to address operational filtering guidelines for single andmulti-homed
    environments. The focus of those RFCs is on filteringingress packets ingress,
    regardless of destination, if those packetsare have spoofed source address or
    fall within "reserved" addressspace. Deployment of RFCs 2267 and 3704 has limited
    the effects ofdenial of service attacks by dropping ingress packets with spoofedsource
    addresses, which in turn offers other benefits by ensuringthat packets coming
    into a network originate from validly allocatedand consistent sources.This document
    focuses solely on traffic destined to the networkinfrastructure itself to protect
    the network from denial of serviceand other attacks. This document presents techniques
    that, togetherwith network edge ingress filtering and RFC 2267 and RFC 3704, createa
    layered approach for infrastructure protection.This document does not present
    recommendations for protocol validation (i.e. "sanity checking") nor does it address
    guidelinesfor general security configuration.</p>
