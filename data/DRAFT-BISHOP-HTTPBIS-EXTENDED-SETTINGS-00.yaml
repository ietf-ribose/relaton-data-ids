abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HTTP/2 defines the SETTINGS frame to contain a single 32-bit
    value\n   per setting.  While this is sufficient to convey everything used in\n
    \  the core HTTP/2 specification, some protocols will require more\n   complex
    values, such as arrays of code-points or strings.\n\n   For such protocols, this
    extension defines a parallel to the SETTINGS\n   frame, EXTENDED_SETTINGS, where
    the value of a setting is not a\n   32-bit value, but a variable-length opaque
    data blob whose\n   interpretation is subject entirely to the definition of the
    protocol\n   using it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
