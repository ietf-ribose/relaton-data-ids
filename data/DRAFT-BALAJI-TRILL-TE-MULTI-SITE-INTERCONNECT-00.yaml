abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the control plane procedures to support\n
    \  Traffic Engineering (TE) across TRILL sites where such sites are\n   interconnected
    using [1] with the help of a Layer 3 core running\n   IP+GRE or IP+MPLS.  Traffic
    Engineering permits usage of a set of\n   links that possess a certain characteristic
    like specified bandwidth,\n   cost or even MTU. This draft aims at addressing
    how unicast frames\n   travelling from one TRILL site to another across a Layer
    3 core that\n   supports IP+GRE and/or IP+MPLS can make use of the TE calculated\n
    \  paths in the sending site as well as the receiving site where such TE\n   paths
    are pre-computed in both sites and need a mechanism to inter-\n   link them together.\n\n\n\n\n\t
