abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some RFC need to include some code or some kind of data like
    test\n   vectors.  Extracting the code or the data from the RFC \"by hand\" is\n
    \  possible, but tiresome and prone to errors, especially if the portion\n   to
    be extracted is long or comprises many files.  This document\n   describes a format
    that can be used to embed code or data in an RFC,\n   so that it can be extract
    by a software, while preserving the\n   readibility of the embedded text.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
