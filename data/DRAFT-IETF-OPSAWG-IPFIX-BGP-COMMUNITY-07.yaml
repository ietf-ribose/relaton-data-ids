abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   By introducing new Information Elements (IEs), this draft extends
    the\n   existing BGP related IEs to enable IPFIX [RFC7011] to export the BGP\n
    \  community information, including the information of BGP standard\n   community
    [RFC1997], BGP extended community [RFC4360], and BGP large\n   community [RFC8092].
    \ Network traffic information can then be\n   accumulated and analysed at the
    BGP community granularity, which\n   represents the traffic of different kinds
    of customers, services, or\n   geographical regions according to the network operator's
    BGP\n   community planning.  Network traffic information at the BGP community\n
    \  granularity is useful for network traffic analysis and engineering.\n\n   To
    clarify, no new BGP community attribute is defined in this\n   document and this
    document has no purpose to replace BGP Monitoring\n   Protocol (BMP) defined in
    RFC7854.  The IEs introduced in this\n   document are used by IPFIX together with
    other IEs to facilitate the\n   IPFIX collector analyzing the network traffic
    at the BGP community\n   granularity without running the heavy BGP protocol.  When
    needed, the\n   mediator or collector can use the IEs introduced in this document
    to\n   report the BGP community related traffic flow information it gets\n   either
    from exporters or through local correlation to other IPFIX\n   devices.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
