abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In the connected MANET, the MANET Border Router (MBR) is used toconnect
    the MANET with the external network and MANET nodes are required to know the MBR
    address to communicate with hosts in the external network. One way of acquiring
    the MBR address is to use the Router Advertisement (RA) and the Router Solicitation
    (RS) messages.In order to allow RA/RS messages to be delivered in the multi-hopMANET,
    the modified RA/RS message has been defined [4]. However, this approach may incur
    the duplicate packet reception problem due to rebroadcasting of received RA/RS
    messages to its neighbors.In this draft, we define the scope-extended Router Advertisement/Solicitation
    message for announcing/solicitating the MBR address inthe connected MANET. In
    the scope-extended RA/RS message, a new message field, the sequence number field,
    is defined so that duplicate RA/RS messages can be detected based on the sequence
    number and the MBR address included in the message.</p>"
