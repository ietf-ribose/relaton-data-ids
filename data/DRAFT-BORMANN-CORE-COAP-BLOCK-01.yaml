abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and\nnetworks.
    \ CoAP is based on datagram transport, which limits the\nmaximum size of resource
    representations that can be transferred\nwithout too much fragmentation.  A previous
    version of this draft\ndefined the Block option.  The Block option provides a
    minimal way to\ntransfer larger representations in a block-wise fashion.  It is\ncurrently
    documented in the WG draft draft-ietf-core-block-00.txt\n\nThis short I-D attempts
    to pick up some recent discussion on the CoRE\nmailing list, and defines a more
    general, but also slightly more\ncomplex approach.  It is intended as an example
    for a complete design\nbased on this discussion, to enable a rational assessment
    of the\nrelative complexities.\n\t </p>\n      "
