abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       Access control is one of the major security concerns for
    Low power\n       and Lossy Networks (LLN). As LLNs are normally highly distributed
    and\n       resource-constrained, conventional access control systems that rely\n
    \      on the central Certificate Authority (CA) and sophisticated\n       cryptographic
    algorithms are not suitable for them. Furthermore, LLNs\n       may consist of
    embedded devices with limited power, memory, and\n       processing resources
    from different manufacturers or service\n       providers. Due to the different
    specifications and designs, it is\n       difficult to ensure consistency in security
    implementation among all\n       devices. This document proposes a distributed
    access control method\n       based on local authorization decisions, which takes
    both the single-\n       domain and the multi-domain situation into account.\n\n\t
