abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines an application profile for authentication\n
    \  and authorization for publishers and subscribers in a constrained\n   pub-sub
    scenario, using the ACE framework.  This profile relies on\n   transport layer
    or application layer security to authorize the pub-\n   sub clients to the broker.
    \ Moreover, it describes application layer\n   security for publisher-subscriber
    communication going through the\n   broker.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
