abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), holders of
    IP\n   address space can become a Certification Authority (CA), optionally\n   hosting
    their repository.  They can also delegate (part of) their\n   resources to subordinate
    CAs, who in turn may do the same.  This CA\n   hierarchy forms a tree structure.
    \ Relying Party (RP) software walks\n   this tree and determines the current valid
    objects.  An underlying\n   assumption is that this tree is a reasonable size,
    and that the\n   information can be processed within reasonable time.  This assumption\n
    \  is not guaranteed to hold.  This document describes two new\n   extensions,
    \"maxDescendants\" and \"maxVrps\", that add constraints for\n   use in RP processing
    that ensure this assumption holds.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
