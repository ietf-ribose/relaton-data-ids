abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the concept of an NSF (Network Security\n
    \  Function) Capability, as well as its information model. Capabilities\n   are
    a set of features that are available from a managed entity, and\n   are represented
    as data that unambiguously characterizes an NSF.\n   Capabilities enable management
    entities to determine the set offer\n   features from available NSFs that will
    be used, and simplify the\n   management of NSFs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
