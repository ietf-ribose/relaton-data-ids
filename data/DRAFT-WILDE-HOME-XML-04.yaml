abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The specification for HTTP API Home Documents provides a JSON
    syntax\n   only.  This specification provides an XML syntax for the same data\n
    \  model, so that the concept of Home Documents can be consistently\n   exposed
    in both JSON- and XML-based HTTP APIs.  It also defines the\n   link relation
    type \"home\" so that applications can identify links to\n   home documents.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
