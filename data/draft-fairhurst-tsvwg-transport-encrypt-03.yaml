abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes implications of applying end-to-end encryption
    at the transport layer. It identifies some in-network uses of transport layer
    header information that can be used with a transport header integrity check. It
    reviews the implication of developing encrypted end-to-end transport protocols
    and examines the implication of developing and deploying encrypted end-to-end
    transport protocols. Since transport measurement and analysis of the impact of
    network characteristics have been important to the design of current transport
    protocols, it also considers some anticipated implications on transport and application
    evolution.</p>"
