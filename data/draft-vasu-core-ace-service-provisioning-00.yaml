abstract:
- content: "<p>As more constrained devices are integrating with current Internet,
    the ubiquitous computing in scenarios like smart home is very important. In smart
    home, the constrained devices (ex. thermostat) need to be provisioned in such
    a way that it can inter-operate with any kind of devices like other constrained
    devices (ex. Air conditioner) or client devices (ex. smart phone). This document
    provides a method to support service provisioning based on pre- configured admission
    and resource control policies, where this method explains device's service access
    in two different use cases: first provisioning the service when a constrained
    device accessing the service provided by other constrained device, second, accessing
    the service provided by constrained device from the client device (non constrained
    device).</p>"
