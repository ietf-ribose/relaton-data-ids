abstract:
- content: <p>This specification augments "Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4" (MP-
    BGP) by proposing a mechanism to facilitate the use of multiple sessions between
    a given pair of BGP speakers. Each session is used to transport routes related
    by some session-based attribute such as AFI/SAFI. This provides an alternative
    to the MP-BGP approach of multiplexing all routes onto a single connection. Use
    of this approach is expected to provide finer-grained fault management and isolation
    as the BGP protocol is used to support more and more diverse services.</p>
