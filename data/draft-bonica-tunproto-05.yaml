abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the Generic Tunnel Tracing Protocol (GTTP).GTTP
    supports enhanced route-tracing applications. Network operatorsuse enhanced route-tracing
    applications to trace the path between anytwo points on an IP network. Enhanced
    route-tracing applications cantrace through a network's forwarding plane, its
    control plane orboth. Furthermore, enhanced route-tracing applications can revealdetails
    concerning tunnels that support the traced path. Tunneldetails can be revealed
    regardless of tunneling technology. Forexample, enhanced route-tracing applications
    can trace through anMPLS LSP as well as they can trace through an IP-in-IP tunnel.</p>"
