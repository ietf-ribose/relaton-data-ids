abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document presents some recommendations for firewall\n
    \  administrators to help them configure their firewalls in a way that\n   allows
    Mobile IPv6 signaling and data messags to pass through.  This\n   document assumes
    that the firewalls in question include some kind of\n   stateful packet filtering
    capability.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
