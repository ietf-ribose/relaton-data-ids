abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describe an data encryption specification which is based
    on random bytes selection of data and random key generation. This encryption process
    accepts variable input and the key size is dependent on the input data. This encryption
    process does not depend upon any 128 or 256 fixed block encryption. The mechanism
    for encryption is simpler to implement, but gives key complexity of more than
    256 bit encryption.</p>"
