abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The NAT-PT, one of the IPv6 transition mechanisms, supports
    IPv6 node\n   in a NAT-PT domain to communicate with IPv4-only nodes outside.\n
    \  However, due to the IP datagram conversion at the NAT-PT server, \n   NAT-PT
    node has a problem in establishing the end-to-end security \n   using the IPsec
    IKE and AH mode. This memo describes the reason why \n   the problem is caused
    and proposes a solution for assuring the \n   end-to-end security using IPsec
    in the NAT-PT environment. \n\t </p>\n      "
