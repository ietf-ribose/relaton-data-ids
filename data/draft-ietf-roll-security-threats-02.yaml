abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a security threat analysis for routing over
    low-power and lossy networks (LLN). The development builds upon previous work
    on routing security and adapts the assessments to the issues and constraints specific
    to low-power and lossy networks. A systematic approach is used in defining and
    evaluating the security threats. Applicable countermeasures are application specific
    and are addressed in relevant applicability statements. These assessments provide
    the basis of the security recommendations for incorporation into low-power, lossy
    network routing protocols.</p>"
