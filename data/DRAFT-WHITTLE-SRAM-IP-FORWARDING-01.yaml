abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   I propose a simple, low-cost, low-power, Static RAM (SRAM)
    based\n   architecture for the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) function of\n
    \  transit and border routers in the Default Free Zone (DFZ) of the\n   Internet.
    \ This will provide direct hardware forwarding irrespective\n   of the size of
    the \"global BGP routing table\", within the current\n   IPv4 convention of limiting
    advertised prefixes to no longer than\n   /24.  Routers with this or a similar
    architecture provide the only\n   elegant hardware solution to the problem of
    route disaggregation,\n   which is unavoidable due to increasing numbers of ISPs
    and Autonomous\n   System (AS) end-users who need to advertise their prefixes
    on\n   topologically diverse parts of the network, for purposes including\n   multihoming
    and traffic engineering.\n\n   Router hardware limitations with respect to route
    disaggregation\n   could also be eliminated for IPv6, by adding further SRAMs
    or, on a\n   more limited basis, by using spare space in the SRAM which is\n   required
    for IPv4.  Two additional SRAMs and a reallocation of the\n   existing 2000::/3
    global unicast allocations to a smaller range - for\n   instance 2000::/10 - would
    provide for Provider Independent (PI) /32\n   allocations to 4 million ISPs and
    multihomed end-users.  Each /32\n   assignment could be advertised as up to eight
    /35 prefixes - each of\n   which provides 8192 /48 user networks.  A less disruptive
    alternative\n   to reallocating existing IPv6 global unicast addresses would be
    to\n   define a /10 prefix - inside or outside 2000::/3 - for new PI\n   assignments
    to ISPs and AS end-users with the long-term assurance of\n   rapid SRAM-based
    forwarding for prefixes as short as /35, without\n   concern for route aggregation
    or network topology.  It may be\n   feasible, for a decade or more, to handle
    IPv6 without an addition\n   SRAM chip.  Unused space in the IPv4 chip (or two
    chips for larger\n   routers) would map 2,097,152 /35 prefixes - for instance
    to support\n   PI assignments of /32 prefixes to 262,144 ISPs and AS end-users.\n
    \  This would provide 17 billion /48 prefixes - the standard assignment\n   for
    non-AS end-users.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
