abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network based mobility management\nprotocol
    that enables IP mobility for a host without requiring its\nparticipation in any
    mobility-related signaling.  PMIPv6 requires all\ncommunications to go through
    the local mobility anchor.  As this can\nbe suboptimal, localized routing allows
    mobile nodes attached to the\nsame or different mobile access gateways to exchange
    traffic by using\nlocalized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the gateways.
    \ This\ndocument proposes an initiation mechanism for localized routing.\n\t </p>\n
