abstract:
- content: "<p>IKE is a component of IPsec used for performing mutual authentication
    and establishing and maintaining security associations (SAs). This document presents
    the changes in Internet Key Exchange Version 2 for one time password. The proposed
    method of using OTP in IKEv2 not only enhances the security but also has less
    number of exchange messages as compared to existing OTP-EAP based method.</p>"
