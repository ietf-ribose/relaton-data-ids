abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks
    to roam\n   and attach to different access networks without disrupting the\n   ongoing
    sessions that nodes of the network may have.  By extending\n   the Mobile IPv6
    support to Mobile Routers, nodes of the network are\n   not required to support
    any kind of mobility, since packets must go\n   through the Mobile Router-Home
    Agent (MRHA) bi-directional tunnel.\n   Communications from/to a mobile network
    have to traverse the Home\n   Agent, and therefore better paths may be available.
    \ Additionally,\n   this solution adds packet overhead, due to the encapsulation.\n\n
    \  This document describes an approach to the Route Optimisation for\n   NEMO,
    called Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation for NEMO (MIRON).  MIRON\n   enables mobility-agnostic
    nodes within the mobile network to directly\n   communicate (i.e. without traversing
    the MRHA bi-directional tunnel)\n   with Correspondent Nodes.  The solution is
    based on the Mobile Router\n   performing the Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation signalling
    on behalf of\n   the nodes of the mobile network.\n\n   This document (in an appendix)
    also analyses how MIRON fits each of\n   the NEMO RO Aeronautics requirements.\n\n\t
