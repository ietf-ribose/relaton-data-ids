abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the need for an interface between Mobile IPv6and
    IPsec/IKE and show how the two protocols can interwork. Wepropose a set of extensions
    to the PF_KEY framework which allowssmooth and solid operation of IKE in a Mobile
    IPv6 environment. Thefirst extension is called PF_KEY MIGRATE and is for migrating
    theendpoint addresses of a IPsec Security Association pair in tunnelmode. The
    second extension is named SADB_X_EXT_PACKET and allows IKEto make the right choice
    for address selection in bootstrappingprocess. Both extensions are helpful for
    assuring smoothinterworking between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE and achievingperformance
    optimization.</p>"
