    networks as an initial configuration protocol for nomadicusers. The authentication
    mechanism described here interacts withexisting public Authentication, Authorization,
    and Accounting (AAA)mechanisms, thus enabling per customer authentication andauthorization
    across multiple domains. In addition, we describe amechanism that enables the
    client to authenticate the network toprevent attacks on an end host from a bogus
    network access point.</p>"
