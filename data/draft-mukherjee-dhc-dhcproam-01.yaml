abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines enhancements to DHCP so that it can be used by access
    networks as an initial configuration protocol for nomadic users. The authentication
    mechanism described here interacts with existing public Authentication, Authorization,
    and Accounting (AAA) mechanisms, thus enabling per customer authentication and
    authorization across multiple domains. In addition, we describe a mechanism that
    enables the client to authenticate the network to prevent attacks on an end host
    from a bogus network access point.</p>"
