abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a conceptual outline of an Application Programming
    Interface (API) for the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP). Such an
    API is needed for Autonomic Service Agents (ASAs) calling the GRASP protocol module
    to exchange Autonomic Network messages with other ASAs. Since GRASP is designed
    to support asynchronous operations, the API will need to be adapted according
    to the support for asynchronicity in various programming languages and operating
    systems.</p>"
