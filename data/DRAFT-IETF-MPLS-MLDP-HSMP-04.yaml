abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft introduces a hub &amp; spoke multipoint (HSMP) Label
    Switched\n   Path (LSP), which allows traffic both from root to leaf through\n
    \  point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSP and also leaf to root along the\n   reverse
    path.  That means traffic entering the HSMP LSP from\n   application/customer
    at the root node travels downstream to each leaf\n   node, exactly as if it is
    travelling downstream along a P2MP LSP to\n   each leaf node.  Upstream traffic
    entering the HSMP LSP at any leaf\n   node travels upstream along the tree to
    the root, as if it is unicast\n   to the root.  The communication among the leaf
    nodes are not allowed.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
