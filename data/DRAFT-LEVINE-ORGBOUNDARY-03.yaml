abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Often, the organization that manages a subtree in the DNS is\n
    \  different from the one that manages the tree above it.  Rather than\n   describing
    a particular design, we describe an architecture to\n   publish in the DNS the
    boundaries between organizations that can be\n   adapted to various policy models.\n\n\t
