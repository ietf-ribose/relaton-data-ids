abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft investigates possibilities to use so-called 'transport-
    derived service function forwarders' (tSFFs) that ignore the SFC encapsulation,
    using instead existing transport information for explicit service path information.
    The draft discusses two such possibilities. In the first one, the transport network
    is SDN-based. The second one introduces and explains a specific service request
    routing (SRR) function to support URL-level routing of service requests.</p>"
