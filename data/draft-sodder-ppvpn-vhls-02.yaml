abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an Ethernet [IEEE-802.3] L2VPN model that provides
    point-to-point and point-to-multipoint Layer 2 data communication services using
    a hierarchical LAN switching architecture. The model is based on a hierarchical
    MAC frame format. Scalability and manageability is achieved by simplifying the
    control plane at the cost of adding functionality to the forwarding plane.</p>"
