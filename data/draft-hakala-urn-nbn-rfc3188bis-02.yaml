abstract:
- content: "<p>National Bibliography Numbers (NBNs) are used by national libraries
    and other organizations in order to identify resources in their collections. NBNs
    are usually applied to resources that are not catered for by established (standard)
    identifier systems such as International Standard Book Number (ISBN). A Uniform
    Resource Name (URN) namespace for NBNs was established in 2001 in RFC 3188. Since
    then, a number of European national libraries have implemented URN:NBN-based systems.
    This document replaces RFC 3188 and defines how NBNs can be supported within the
    updated URN framework. A revised namespace registration (version 4) compliant
    to RFC 8141 is included.</p>"
