abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a solution suite for TRILL campuses
    to be\n   connected over WAN networks. TRILL protocol is primarily designed to\n
    \  work within intra-data centers. Connecting different sites over WAN\n   using
    overlay tunnel protocols is the primary method employed at\n   present. Though
    this presents a simple mechanisms to extend TRILL\n   campuses over WAN networks,
    it also brings in the problem of\n   scalability for TRILL nicknames exchanged
    between sites, latency,\n   duplication of traffic etc. This draft proposes a
    way to extend the\n   TRILL sites without having the WAN network aware of TRILL
    campus\n   network and its topology. This document details on how to extend\n
    \  TRILL campus sites and to establish connections between various sites\n   without
    having to exchange entire TRILL campus information, thus\n   reducing the information
    flow to the required sites only. This\n   document do not add or define datacenter
    interconnect protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
