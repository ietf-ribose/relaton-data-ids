abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Handle System [1][2]is a name service system for handle\n
    \  resolution and management over the public Internet. Handle System\n   protocol
    [3] is designed to be transmitted as a byte stream via a TCP\n   connection. This
    document describes a Trusted Resolution System and\n   the protocol extension
    based on Handle System protocol. Trusted\n   resolution aims to achieve credibility
    verification through data\n   signing. The Trusted Resolution System determines
    whether to perform\n   trusted resolution and verification on the response according
    to the\n   trusted flag requested by the client.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
