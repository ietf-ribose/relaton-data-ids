abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Mesh Callsign Registry is a name registry that provides
    a mapping\n   from human-friendly callsigns to root of trusts and a service\n
    \  assigned by the callsign holder to service the account bound to that\n   callsign.
    \ An append only sequence authenticated by means of a Merkle\n   Tree and periodic
    third party notarizations provides ground truth for\n   the integrity of the registry
    and for all the assertions enrolled in\n   the sequence.\n\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/mathmesh/\n
    \  (http://whatever)Discussion of this draft should take place on the\n   MathMesh
    mailing list (mathmesh@ietf.org), which is archived at .\n\n\t </p>\n      "
