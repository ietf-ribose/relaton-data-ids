abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>          A  new  kind of application is emerging on the Internet,
    driven\n          by the desire of individuals to know instantly whether another\n
    \         individual is online,  to be notified when another individual\n          arrives
    online, and to send messages in \\021real time\\022.  These are\n          all
    special cases of the more general problem of Internet-wide\n          notification.\n
    \n          This protocol for facilitating rendezvous between users, known\n          herein
    as RVP, is designed  to enable such notifications and\n          messages across
    a loosely coupled (federated) constellation of\n          servers.  RVP is designed
    to address the need for notification in\n          a secure, reliable and scaleable
    fashion.  RVP encompasses the\n          client-server and server-server interactions.\n
    \n          The authors recognize that there is significant overlap with\n          between
    RVP and HTTP, though there are also significant\n          differences.  We expect
    RVP to evolve and either converge or\n          diverge with HTTP and/or other
    existing protocols.  The protocol\n          described in this document represents
    a very viable starting\n          point for a discussion of a standardized solution
    to the problem.\n \n          Comments on this draft are solicited and should
    be sent to the\n          authors or the RVP discussion list.  To join the RVP
    discussion           list, send email with the body 'subscribe' to rvp-\n          request@iastate.edu.\n\n\n\t
