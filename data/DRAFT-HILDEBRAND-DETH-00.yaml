abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a strong desire in many communities for service operators
    to\n   be able to dynamically update DNS records in an easy-to-deploy,\n   standardized
    method.  For example, operating SIP requires DNS records\n   to be added and updated
    as the SIP service starts and is moved among\n   different servers.  This document
    describes an HTTPS-based mechanism\n   for service operators who are authorized
    by their DNS administrator\n   to add, change, and delete DNS records.\n\n\t </p>\n
