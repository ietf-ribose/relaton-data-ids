abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft introduces Mapped-BGP, a routing protocol that uses
    BGP to\ndistributed tunnel endpoint-to-prefix mappings.  The goal of this\ndraft
    are to present preliminary concepts and get feedback.  It is\nnot meant to be
    a fully-formed proposal.  The goals of Mapped-BGP\nare: 1) to reduce the processing
    required to run BGP, 2) to speed up\ninter-domain convergence, 3) to improve the
    cross-ISP load balancing\ncapabilities of BGP, and where possible, 4) to enable
    forms of\naddress aggregation like geographical addressing (i.e. for IPv6).\nImproved
    address aggregation is unlikely to be very useful for IPv4,\nbecause most addresses
    have already been assigned.  This design takes\nthe position that Mapped BGP is
    useful even without better\naggregation, because 1) FIB size can be reduced through
    FIB\nsuppression with Virtual Aggregation, and 2) RIB size per se is not\nthe
    growth bottleneck.\n\t </p>\n      "
