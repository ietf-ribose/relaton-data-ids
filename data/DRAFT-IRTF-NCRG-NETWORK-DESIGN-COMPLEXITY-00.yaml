abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network architecture revolves around the concept of fitting
    the\n   design of a network to its purpose; of asking the question, \"what\n   network
    will best fit these needs?\"  A part of fitting network design\n   to requirements
    is the problem of complexity, an idea often\n   informally measured using intuition
    and subjective experience.  When\n   would adding a particular protocol, policy,
    or configuration be \"too\n   complex?\"  This document suggests a series of continuums
    along which\n   network complexity might be measured.  No suggestions are made
    on how\n   to measure complexity for each of these continuums; this is left for\n
    \  future documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
