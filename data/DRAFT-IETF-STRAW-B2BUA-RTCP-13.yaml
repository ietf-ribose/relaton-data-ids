abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) are often envisaged to
    also be\n   on the media path, rather than just intercepting signalling.  This\n
    \  means that B2BUAs often implement an RTP/RTCP stack as well, thus\n   leading
    to separate multimedia sessions that the B2BUA correlates and\n   bridges together.
    \ If not disciplined, though, this behaviour can\n   severely impact the communication
    experience, especially when\n   statistics and feedback information contained
    in RTCP messages get\n   lost because of mismatches in the reported data.\n\n
    \  This document defines the proper behaviour B2BUAs should follow when\n   also
    acting on the signalling/media plane in order to preserve the\n   end-to-end functionality
    of RTCP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
