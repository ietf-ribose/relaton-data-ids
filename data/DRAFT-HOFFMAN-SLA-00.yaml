abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SLA is a new IKEv2 exchange that reuses most of the features of
    the\nIKEv2 Initial (Phase 1) exchange but allows for legacy authentication\nthat
    is not susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. It has a flexible\nnumber of
    messages based on the type of authentication being used, and\nis extensible for
    new authentication mechanisms. SLA will work with\nremote access configuration
    in the same way as IKEv2's Initial exchange.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
