abstract:
- content: "<p>ACE37 is a combination of DUDE-02, AMC-W/V and LACE. ACE37 utilizes
    the simple one pass algorithm of DUDE, the character block considerations of AMC-W/V
    and the Base-32 compression of LACE. It also fully utilizes entire LDH set currently
    allowed in the DNS (A- z, 0-9 and '-') within its character repertoire to optimize
    performance and compression.</p>"
