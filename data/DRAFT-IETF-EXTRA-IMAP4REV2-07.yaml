abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev2 (IMAP4rev2)\n
    \  allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on\n   a
    server.  IMAP4rev2 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote\n   message folders)
    in a way that is functionally equivalent to local\n   folders.  IMAP4rev2 also
    provides the capability for an offline\n   client to resynchronize with the server.\n\n
    \  IMAP4rev2 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming\n   mailboxes,
    checking for new messages, permanently removing messages,\n   setting and clearing
    flags, RFC 5322, RFC 2045 and RFC 2231 parsing,\n   searching, and selective fetching
    of message attributes, texts, and\n   portions thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev2
    are accessed by the use of\n   numbers.  These numbers are either message sequence
    numbers or unique\n   identifiers.\n\n   IMAP4rev2 does not specify a means of
    posting mail; this function is\n   handled by a mail submission protocol such
    as RFC 6409.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
