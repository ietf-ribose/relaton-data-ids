abstract:
  content: "<p>TLS supports X.509 and OpenPGP certificate based mechanisms toauthenticate
    a server. Users want their applications to verify thatthe certificate provided
    by the TLS server is in fact associated withthe domain name they expect. Instead
    of trusting a certificateauthority to have made this association correctly, and
    an X.509/OpenPGP implementation to validate that properly, the user mightinstead
    trust the authoritative DNS server for the domain name tomake that association.
    This document describes how to use secure DNSto associate the certificate chain
    transferred by TLS with theintended domain name.</p>"
