abstract:
- content: "<p>TLS supports X.509 and OpenPGP certificate based mechanisms to authenticate
    a server. Users want their applications to verify that the certificate provided
    by the TLS server is in fact associated with the domain name they expect. Instead
    of trusting a certificate authority to have made this association correctly, and
    an X.509/ OpenPGP implementation to validate that properly, the user might instead
    trust the authoritative DNS server for the domain name to make that association.
    This document describes how to use secure DNS to associate the certificate chain
    transferred by TLS with the intended domain name.</p>"
