abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A recursive DNS server generally uses random port numbers to
    send\n   outbound requests to protect against DNS spoofing attacks.  Due to\n
    \  the limitation of operation system, a process typically can only open\n   numerable
    file descriptors simultaneously.  This limit reduces\n   recursion performance
    of resolvers.  This draft offers an approach to\n   improve both recursion performance
    and security for recursive\n   servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
