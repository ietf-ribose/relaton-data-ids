abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the conventions for using the Walnut Digital
    Signature Algorithm (WalnutDSA) for digital signatures with the CBOR Object Signing
    and Encryption (COSE) syntax. WalnutDSA is a lightweight, quantum-resistant signature
    scheme based on Group Theoretic Cryptography (see [WALNUTDSA] and [WALNUTSPEC])
    with implementation and computational efficiency of signature verification in
    constrained environments, even on 8- and 16-bit platforms.</p>"
