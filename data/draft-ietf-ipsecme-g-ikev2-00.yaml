abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a set of IKEv2 exchanges that comprise a group
    key management protocol. The protocol is in conformance with the Multicast Security
    (MSEC) key management architecture, which contains two components: member registration
    and group rekeying. Both components require a Group Controller/Key Server to download
    IPsec group security associations to authorized members of a group. The group
    members then exchange IP multicast or other group traffic as IPsec packets. This
    document obsoletes RFC 6407.</p>"
