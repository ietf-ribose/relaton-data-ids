abstract:
  content: "<p>Service chains specifying the ordered sequences of network functions\taccording
    to network policies requested, play a very important role\tin improving network
    performance in most networks. With the\tintroduction of Software-Defined Networking
    (SDN) and Network\tFunction Virtualization (NFV) technologies, service chains
    can be\timmediately deployed in more effective ways. Since different\tcustomers
    or operators would request multiple service chains in the\tsame network but different
    administrative domains, and the multiple\tservice chains may apply to the same
    network connection, we propose\ta service chain aggregation architecture that
    has ability to\teffectively aggregate them before the deployment. In this\tarchitecture,
    we determine the aggregating order of service chains\taccording to different conditions
    verifying the aggregation\teffectiveness. The benefits of our architecture are
    1) security, 2)\tnetwork resource (e.g., flow entries in switches) savings and
    3)\tscalability.</p>"
