abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document obsoletes RFC 4960, if approved.  It describes
    the\n   Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and incorporates the\n   specification
    of the chunk flags registry from RFC 6096 and the\n   specification of the I bit
    of DATA chunks from RFC 7053.  Therefore,\n   RFC 6096 and RFC 7053 are also obsoleted
    by this document, if\n   approved.\n\n   SCTP was originally designed to transport
    Public Switched Telephone\n   Network (PSTN) signaling messages over IP networks.
    \ It is also\n   suited to be used for other applications, for example WebRTC.\n\n
    \  SCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a\n   connectionless
    packet network such as IP.  It offers the following\n   services to its users:\n\n
    \  *  acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data,\n\n   *  data
    fragmentation to conform to discovered path maximum\n      transmission unit (PMTU)
    size,\n\n   *  sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with\n
    \     an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user\n      messages,\n\n
    \  *  optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP\n      packet,
    and\n\n   *  network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing\n
    \     at either or both ends of an association.\n\n   The design of SCTP includes
    appropriate congestion avoidance behavior\n   and resistance to flooding and masquerade
    attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
