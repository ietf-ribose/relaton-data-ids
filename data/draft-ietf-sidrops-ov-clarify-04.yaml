abstract:
- content: "<p>Deployment of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) based BGP origin
    validation is hampered by, among other things, vendor mis- implementations in
    two critical areas: which routes are validated and whether policy is applied when
    not specified by configuration. This document is meant to clarify possible misunderstandings
    causing those mis-implementations; and thus updates RFC6811 by clarifying that
    all prefixes should have their validation state set, and that policy must not
    be applied without operator configuration.</p>"
