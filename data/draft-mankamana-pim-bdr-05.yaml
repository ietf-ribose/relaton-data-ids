abstract:
- content: "<p>On a multi-access network, one of the PIM routers is elected as a Designated
    Router (DR). On the last hop LAN, the PIM DR is responsible for tracking local
    multicast listeners and forwarding traffic to these listeners if the group is
    operating in PIM-SM. In this document, we propose a mechanism to elect backup
    DR on a shared LAN. A backup DR on LAN would be useful for faster convergence.
    This draft introduces the concept of a Backup Designated Router (BDR) and the
    procedure to implement it.</p>"
