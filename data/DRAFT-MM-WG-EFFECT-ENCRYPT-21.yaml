abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Pervasive Monitoring (PM) attacks on the privacy of Internet
    users\n   are of serious concern to both the user and the operator communities.\n
    \  RFC7258 discussed the critical need to protect users' privacy when\n   developing
    IETF specifications and also recognized making networks\n   unmanageable to mitigate
    PM is not an acceptable outcome; an\n   appropriate balance is needed.  This document
    discusses current\n   security and network operations and management practices
    that may be\n   impacted by the shift to increased use of encryption to help guide\n
    \  protocol development in support of manageable and secure networks.\n\n\t </p>\n
