abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces the capabilities of the DHCPv4 Relay
    Agent \n   Information Option in RFC 3046 and the corresponding RADIUS-\n   Attributes
    Sub-option to DHCPv6. In particular, the document \n   describes a new DHCPv6
    option called the Relay Agent Information \n   option which extends the set of
    DHCPv6 options as defined in RFC 3315 \n   and 3376. Following its DHCPv4 counterpart
    as defined in RFC 3046, \n   the new option is inserted by the DHCPv6 relay agent
    when forwarding \n   client-originated DHCPv6 packets to a DHCPv6 server. Servers
    \n   recognizing the Relay Agent Information option may use the \n   information
    to implement IP address or other parameter assignment \n   policies.  The DHCP
    Server echoes the option back verbatim to the \n   relay agent in server-to-client
    replies, and the relay agent strips \n   the option before forwarding the reply
    to the client. The Relay Agent \n   Information option is organized as a single
    DHCPv6 option that \n   contains one or more \"sub-options\" that convey information
    known by \n   the relay agent.  A RADIUS Attributes Sub-option, following its
    \n   DHCPv4 counterpart, is also defined.  \n\t </p>\n      "
