- content: "<p>This document provides a summary of the 'Workshop on Internet of Things
    (IoT) Semantic Interoperability (IOTSI)' [IOTSIAG], [IOTSIWS], which took place
    in Santa Clara, CA, on March 17-18, 2016. The main goal of the workshop was to
    foster a discussion on the different approaches used by companies and standards
    developing organizations to accomplish interoperability at the application layer.
    This report summarizes the discussions and lists recommendations to the standards
    community. The views and positions in this report are those of the workshop participants
    and do not necessarily reflect those of the authors and the Internet Architecture
    Board (IAB), which organized the workshop.</p>"
