abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The tunnel MTU for popular IP-in-IP tunneling mechanisms is
    currently\n   recommended to be set to 1500 (or less) minus the length of the\n
    \  encapsulation headers when static MTU determination is used.  This is\n   to
    avoid IP fragmentation within the tunnel, but requires the tunnel\n   ingress
    to either fragment any IP packet larger than the MTU or drop\n   the packet and
    return an ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB) message.  Concerns\n   for operational issues
    with both IPv4 and IPv6 Path MTU Discovery\n   point to the possibility of MTU-related
    black holes when a packet is\n   dropped due to an MTU restriction.  Fortunately,
    the \"Internet cell\n   size\" is 1500 bytes, i.e., the minimum MTU configured
    by the vast\n   majority of links in the Internet.  We also note that these same\n
    \  considerations apply to the encapsulation of any combination of IP-\n   within-IP
    protocol versions.  This document therefore presents a\n   method to boost the
    tunnel MTU to larger values.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
