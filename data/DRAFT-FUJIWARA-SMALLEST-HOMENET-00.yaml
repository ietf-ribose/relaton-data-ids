abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document tries to describe a configuration difficulty
    of complex\n   networks and two example solutions.  Although access control for
    home\n   servers is very important, managements and setups of access controls\n
    \  are difficult for ordinary users.  One of solutions is to limit\n   smallest
    home network inside a L2 link and the smallest home network\n   uses link-local
    address only.  The other solutions uses ULA (Unique\n   Local Address).\n\n\t
