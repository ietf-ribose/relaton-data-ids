abstract:
- content: "<p>Intrusion prevention systems(IPSs) are a kind of systems that can keep
    away and interdict intrusions actively. This document puts forward some relevant
    solutions to the existing problems in IPSs at present. Zero-copy technology is
    adopted to reduce the system expenses, in order to optimize communication performance;
    Load balancing technology guarantees the flow distributed at each IPSs engine
    even; Protocol analysis technology improves detection efficiency to a certain
    degree. The structure of detection engine designed can be either a node of Large-scale
    Distributed Intrusion Prevention Systems or an independent IPS.</p>"
