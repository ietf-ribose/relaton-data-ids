abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When a mobile node roams, its location information can be revealed
    \n   by monitoring the IP addresses in its IP packets. This document \n   proposes
    a technique for hiding a mobile node's care-of adress \n   from its correspondent
    node and its home address from an \n   eavesdropper using reverse tunelling. It
    also proposes another \n   technique for preventing movement tracing of a mobile
    node by an \n   eavesdropper during route optimization.\n\t </p>\n      "
