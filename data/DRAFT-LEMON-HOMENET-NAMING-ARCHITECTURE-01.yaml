abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document recommends a naming and service discovery resolution\n
    \  architecture for homenets.  This architecture covers local and global\n   publication
    of names, discusses security and privacy implications,\n   and addresses those
    implications.  The architecture also covers name\n   resolution and service discovery
    for hosts on the homenet, and for\n   hosts that roam off of the homenet and still
    need access to homenet\n   services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
