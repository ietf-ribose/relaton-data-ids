abstract:
- content: "<p>The Host Identity Protocol [RFC5201] is a secure signaling protocol
    with a cryptographic namespace. It provides the communicating peers with a cryptographic
    puzzle mechanism to protect against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting
    its computation and memory overhead. This document specifies an extension that
    enables middleboxes to assist in the choice of the puzzle difficulty as well as
    in solving the puzzle on behalf of the host.</p>"
