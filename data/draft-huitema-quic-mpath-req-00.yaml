abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the requirement and plausible architecture
    of QUIC multipath extensions. While the first version of QUIC is not scheduled
    to include multipath extensions, there are risks that decisions made in this first
    version might preclude some options that we may later find attractive. An early
    review of multipath extension requirements and issues should minimize that risk.</p>"
