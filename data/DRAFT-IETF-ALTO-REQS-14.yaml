abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such
    as\n   pieces of information or server processes, which are available in\n   several
    equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but\n   is not limited
    to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal\n   of Application-Layer
    Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide\n   guidance to applications, which
    have to select one or several hosts\n   from a set of candidates capable of providing
    a desired resource.\n   This guidance shall be based on parameters that affect
    performance\n   and efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts, e.g.,
    the\n   topological distance.  The ultimate goal is to improve performance\n   (or
    Quality of Experience) in the application while reducing resource\n   consumption
    in the underlying network infrastructure.\n\n   This document enumerates requirements
    for specifying, assessing, or\n   comparing protocols and implementations.\n\n\t
