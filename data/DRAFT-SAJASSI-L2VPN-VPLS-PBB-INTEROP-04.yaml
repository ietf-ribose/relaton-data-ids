abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The scalability of H-VPLS with Ethernet access network can be
    \nimproved by incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge (PBB) \nfunctionality in
    VPLS access. PBB has been standardized as IEEE \n802.1ah-2008, which is an amendment
    to 802.1Q to improve the \nscalability of MAC addresses and service instances
    in Provider \nEthernet networks. This document describes different \ninteroperability
    scenarios where IEEE 802.1ah functionality is used \nin H-VPLS with Ethernet or
    MPLS access network to attain better \nscalability in terms of number of customer
    MAC addresses and number \nof service instances. The document also describes the
    scenarios and \nthe mechanisms for incorporating PBB functionality within H-VPLS
    \nwith existing IEEE 802.1ad (aka QinQ) Ethernet access and \ninteroperability
    among them. Furthermore, the document discusses the \nmigration mechanisms and
    scenarios by which PBB functionality can be \nincorporated into H-VPLS with existing
    MPLS access. \n \n \nConventions used in this document \n \nThe key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",
    \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC 2119.\n\t </p>\n      "
