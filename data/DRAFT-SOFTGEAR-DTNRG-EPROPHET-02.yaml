abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines extensions of PRoPHET, a Probabilistic
    Routing\n   Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity. The document\n
    \  presents two extensions of current PRoPHET draft-09. The first\n   extension
    is to apply the contact duration to calculate the delivery\n   predictability.
    The other is to provide a forward strategy which can\n   alleviate the bundle
    starving problem by considering expiration of\n   bundles.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
