abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides detailed description of IPv6 deployment
    and \n   integration methods and scenarios in today's Service Provider (SP) \n
    \  Broadband (BB) networks in coexistance with deployed IPv4 services. \n\n   Cable/HFC,
    BB Ethernet, xDSL and WLAN are the main BB technologies \n   that are currently
    deployed, and discussed in this document. In this\n   document we will discuss
    main components of IPv6 BB networks and \n   their differences from IPv4 BB networks
    and how IPv6 is deployed \n   and integrated in each of these BB technologies
    using tunneling \n   mechanisms and native IPv6.\n\t </p>\n      "
