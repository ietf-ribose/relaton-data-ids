abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents the evaluation results of CoAP in terms
    of\n   various latency metrics over UDP/TCP under different network\n   environments.
    \ We conduct experiments via both GPRS and WiFi.  We\n   also evaluate how the
    latency metrics are impacted by the background\n   traffic.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
