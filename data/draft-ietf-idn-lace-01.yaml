abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a transformation method for representingnon-ASCII
    characters in host name parts in a fashion that is completelycompatible with the
    current DNS. It is a potential candidate for anASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE)
    for internationalized host names, asdescribed in the comparison document from
    the IETF IDN Working Group.This method is based on the observation that many internationalized
    hostname parts will have a few substrings from a small number of rows of theISO
    10646 repertoire. Run-length encoding for these types ofhost names will be fairly
    compact, and is fairly easy to describe.</p>"
