abstract:
- content: "<p>Requirements for providing the End to End(E2E) performance assurance
    are emerging within the service provider networks. While there are various technology
    solutions, there is no single solution that can fulfill these requirements for
    a native IP network. In particular, there is a need for a universal (E2E) solution
    that is simultaneously applicable for both intra- and inter-domain scenarios.
    One feasible E2E traffic engineering solution is the addition of central control
    in a native IP network. This document describes various complex scenarios and
    simulation results when applying the Path Computation Element (PCE) in a native
    IP network. This solution, referred to as Centralized Control Dynamic Routing
    (CCDR), integrates the advantage of using distributed protocols and the power
    of a centralized control technology, providing traffic engineering for native
    IP networks in a manner that applies equally to intra- and inter-domain scenarios.</p>"
