abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the minimal framework required for
    a new\n   device, called \"pledge\", to securely join a 6TiSCH (IPv6 over the\n
    \  TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e) network.  The framework requires that\n   the
    pledge and the JRC (join registrar/coordinator, a central\n   entity), share a
    symmetric key.  How this key is provisioned is out\n   of scope of this document.
    \ Through a single CoAP (Constrained\n   Application Protocol) request-response
    exchange secured by OSCORE\n   (Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments),
    the pledge\n   requests admission into the network and the JRC configures it with\n
    \  link-layer keying material and other parameters.  The JRC may at any\n   time
    update the parameters through another request-response exchange\n   secured by
    OSCORE.  This specification defines the Constrained Join\n   Protocol and its
    CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) data\n   structures, and configures
    the rest of the 6TiSCH communication stack\n   for this join process to occur
    in a secure manner.  Additional\n   security mechanisms may be added on top of
    this minimal framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
