abstract:
- content: "<p>Privacy is an important issue concerning many governments and users
    with its importance becoming more evident every day. Nodes might change their
    IP addresses frequently in order to avoid being tracked by attackers. This frequent
    IP address change also helps in the prevention of information being leaked by
    nodes. In IPv6 networks there is currently one solution to maintain the privacy
    of nodes when IPv6 StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) (RFC 4662) is used.
    Unfortunately there are some problems associated with this solution which entails
    the use of the Privacy Extension (RFC 4941). Some of these problems are not generating
    a new Interface ID (IID) after changing the router prefix, the fact that nodes
    may use an IID that was generated based on a MAC address and use this in their
    response, the act of cutting the current connections to other nodes if the max
    lifetime of the old IID has elapsed, and a need to have stable storage for generating
    a randomized IID. The RFC also gives no explanation as to how to use CGA in its
    randomizing solution when stable storage is not available. The purpose of this
    document is to address these issues and to update the current RFC.</p>"
