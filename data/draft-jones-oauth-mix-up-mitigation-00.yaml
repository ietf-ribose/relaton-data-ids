abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines an extension to The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
    Framework that enables an authorization server to provide a client using it with
    a consistent set of metadata about itself. This information is returned in the
    authorization response. It can be used by the client to prevent classes of attacks
    in which the client might otherwise be tricked into using inconsistent sets of
    metadata from multiple authorization servers, including potentially using a token
    endpoint that does not belong to the same authorization server as the authorization
    endpoint used. Recent research publications refer to these as "IdP Mix-Up" and
    "Malicious Endpoint" attacks.</p>
