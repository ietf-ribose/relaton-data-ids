abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The UUCP Mapping Project started in the early 1980s as a means tofacilitate
    the exchange of electronic mail among sites using the UUCPstore-and-forward transport
    mechanism. This UUCP software, originallypart of the UNIX operating system became
    available on a variety ofoperating systems and platforms, from large mainframe
    to small homePC's. This was done by creating a single database of systemsconnected
    to each other via UUCP and then using path buildingsoftware (such as pathalias)
    to determine the optimal path from onesystem to another. Email addresses using
    this system incorporated theuse of the path as part of the address.</p>"
