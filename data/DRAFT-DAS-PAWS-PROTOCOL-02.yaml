abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the `Protocol to Access White Space
    database\n   (PAWS)' that uses HTTP/TLS as transport.  The protocol is used for\n
    \  retrieving the necessary TV white space information (e.g., channel,\n   frequency,
    transmitted power) at a given location and time from a\n   database that is operating
    under a regulatory domain.  The document\n   includes the protocol functionalities,
    its elements, corresponding\n   data model and recommends its encoding scheme.\n\n\t
