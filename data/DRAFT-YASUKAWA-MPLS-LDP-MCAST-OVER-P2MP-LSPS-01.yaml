abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) includes the facility
    to\n   provision point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineered (TE) Label\n   Switched
    Paths (LSPs) which can be used to construct P2MP tunnels\n   across MPLS networks.\n\n
    \  The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) has also been extended to\n   support
    label distribution for multicast traffic by forming multicast\n   LSPs.\n\n   When
    traffic for a user network is carried across a provider network,\n   it is common
    practice for the traffic to be placed in tunnels. This\n   document examines the
    requirements to carry multicast LDP traffic\n   across a provider network within
    P2MP MPLS tunnels, and introduces\n   solution models that meet those requirements.\n\n
    \  Note that the requirements and solutions discussed in this document\n   are
    also applicable to the use of multicast LDP on multi-access\n   networks.\n\t
