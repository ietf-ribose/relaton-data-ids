abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For wide scale routing protocols to build their topology and\n
    \  reachability databases they need link neighbor discovery, link\n   encapsulation
    data, and layer two liveness.  BGP-LS and its\n   enhancements provide an API
    to present much of these data to BGP\n   protocols, but do not actually collect
    these data.  This document\n   explores the needs and criteria for the data needed.\n\n\t
