abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Evolving networking scenarios (e.g., 5G) are considering the\n
    \  provision of value-added and on-demand end-to-end (E2E) network\n   services
    in multi-domain (multi-operator/multi-technology)\n   environments.  This document
    presents different initiatives, mainly\n   within standardization efforts and
    research projects, working on E2E\n   network services across multiple domains.
    \ Problem statement and a\n   layered network model are also described.  In addition,
    this document\n   raises an initial proposal towards a new ALTO service in support
    of\n   E2E network service requirements.  Finally, another important\n   objective
    of this document is to begin a discussion about motivating\n   use cases in scope
    of the ALTO WG after the re-chartering process.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
