abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), which permit
    hosts to conduct route optimization (RO) without home agent. These extensions
    add robustness and flexibility to MIPv6 since mobility can be supported when the
    home agent becomes temporarily unavailable or when home-agent support is not desirable.
    These extensions are compliant with all peer-to-peer signaling solutions that
    are currently supported for RO.</p>"
