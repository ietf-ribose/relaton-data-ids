abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies a new password-based protocol that can beused
    as the basis of mutual authentication, or downloading of aprivate key. The only
    thing the client needs to know is the user'spassword. The protocol is constructed
    such that an eavesdroppercannot do off-line password-guessing attacks. Someone
    stealing theserver's database cannot directly impersonate the user, although theycan
    do an off-line password-guessing attack on the contents. Theprotocol presented
    in this paper is similar in functionality, higherin performance at the server,
    but lower in performance at the client,to the extended EKE and SPEKE, and SRP
    schemes. Additionalproperties of this scheme are salt, no password-equivalent
    stored atthe server, and prevention of servers on which the user has the samepassword
    from impersonating each other to the user. This documentgives an overview of the
    approach, but not wire-formats, which arepremature at this stage. The purpose
    of this document is to advertisethis new scheme to various groups that might be
    interested (CAT, fora GSS-API mechanism, LDAP, for download of a private key).</p>"
