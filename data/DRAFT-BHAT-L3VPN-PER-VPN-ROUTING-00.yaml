abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to do Per VPN routing for
    L3 PPVPNs. \n   The solution uses BGP for auto-discovery of VPN membership, but
    uses \n   Per VPN RIP instances and dynamic MPLS tunnel interfaces to exchange
    \n   customer routes. The document proposes modifications to the RIP \n   protocol
    to the make the solution scalable. The framework presented \n   also supports
    deployment of multicast routing and forwarding for L3 \n   PPVPNs without enabling
    multicast in the core. \n\t </p>\n      "
