abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document introduces a Wireless Channel Model Based rate controlscheme
    for improving the behavior of real time multimedia streamswith TFRC [2] in wireless-wired
    heterogeneous networks. Based onwireless channel characteristics, the method can
    first identify thelevel of packet losses of two different types by sending large
    andsmall packets alternately, then adopt different adaptive rate controlstrategies
    to increase the network throughput and decrease congestionpacket loss rate, to
    improve transmission quality of real-timemultimedia stream. The proposed method
    is compared with previouslyreported algorithms [3-4] by simulation. It is shown
    from thesimulation results in different network topology environments, theperformance
    the proposed algorithm is better than existing algorithmsin the aspects of network
    bandwidth utilization and congestion packetloss control. Parts of this method
    published in the IEEE WirelessCommunications and Networking Conference (WCNC2007)
    and in a pendingChina patent (access number: CN101686100).</p>"
