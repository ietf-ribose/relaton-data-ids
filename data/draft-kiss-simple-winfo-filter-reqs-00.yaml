abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of structured requirements whereby a watcher
    information subscriber (client) may select specific information to be received
    in the watcherinfo notification sent by the notifier (server). The purpose is
    to limit the content so that only essential information is delivered by the server.
    Also the preference for full or partial state information is considered in requirements.</p>"
