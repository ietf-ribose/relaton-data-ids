abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RFC6294] makes a survey of Proposed Use Cases for the IPv6
    Flow\n   Label.  The IPv6 protocol includes a flow label in every packet\n   header,
    but this field is, according to [RFC6294], not used in\n   practice.  This document
    describes how the alternate marking method\n   can be used as the passive performance
    measurement method in a IPv6\n   domain.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
