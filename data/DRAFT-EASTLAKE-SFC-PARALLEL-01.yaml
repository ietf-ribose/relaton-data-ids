abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service Function Chaining (SFC) is the processing of packets
    through\n   a sequence of Service Functions (SFs) within an SFC domain by the\n
    \  addition of path information and metadata on entry to that domain,\n   the
    use and modification of that path information and metadata to\n   step the packet
    through a sequence of SFs, and the removal of that\n   path information and metadata
    on exit from that domain. The IETF has\n   standardized a method for SFC using
    the Network Service Header\n   specified in RFC 8300.\n\n   There are requirements
    for SFC to process packets through parallel\n   sequences of service functions
    and to easily splice in additional\n   service functions or splice service functions
    out of a service chain.\n   This document provides use cases for these requirements
    and\n   extensions to SFC to support them.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
