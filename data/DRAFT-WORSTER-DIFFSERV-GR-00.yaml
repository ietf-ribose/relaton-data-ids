abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We propose a diff-serv per hop behavior (PHB) for the transport\nof
    non-real time traffic with a guaranteed rate (GR). This\nproposal is based on
    principles developed for the specification\nof the Guaranteed Frame Rate (GFR)
    service category currently\nbeing specified for ATM [TM5]. It is shown that a
    diff-serv\nnetwork using the GR PHB together with a explicit routing\ncapability
    can support edge-to-edge guaranteed rate service.\nInterconnection of diff-serv
    networks deploying GR to achieve\nend-to-end service and interworking with ATM's
    GFR service are\nalso discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
