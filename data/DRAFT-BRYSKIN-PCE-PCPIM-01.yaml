abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Policy-Enabled Path Computation Framework [PCE-POLICY]
    introduced\n   the use of the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM), [RFC3060],
    as a\n   framework for supporting path computation policy within the context\n
    \  of the Path Computation Element (PCE)-Based Architecture, [RFC4655].\n   This
    document defines the Path Computation Policy Information Model\n   (PCPIM), which
    provides the specifics of using PCIM as the method for\n   supporting path computation
    policy.  PCPIM includes classes that\n   model constraints, conditions, actions,
    variables and values\n   associated with supporting path computation policy. While
    PCPIM was\n   conceived to operate within the path computation element (PCE)-based\n
    \  architecture, it can be applied to any path computation methodology.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
