abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multimedia data transport over ad hoc networks is a challenging
    \n   problem. The dynamic nature of the underlying routing and the highly \n   varying
    quality of the wireless communication links present \n   additional hurdles for
    the transport of real-time traffic between \n   hosts. However, the mesh topology
    of ad hoc networks implies the \n   existence of multiple paths between any two
    nodes. It has been shown \n   in the literature that path diversity provides an
    effective means of \n   combating transmission errors and topology changes that
    are typical \n   in ad hoc networks. Moreover, data partitioning techniques, such
    as \n   striping and thinning, have been demonstrated to improve the queuing \n
    \  performance of real-time data. Recognizing the advantages of these \n   techniques,
    as well as the increasing need for video services in ad \n   hoc networks, we
    propose a new transport protocol to support \n   multipath transport of real-time
    data. The new protocol, called \n   Multi-flow Real-time Transport Protocol (MRTP),
    provides a convenient \n   vehicle for real-time multimedia applications to partition
    and to \n   transmit data using multiple flows. Even though the basic idea of
    \n   MRTP is presented in the context of ad hoc networks, the benefits \n   demonstrated
    by the use of MRTP is equally applicable to other types \n   of IP network providing
    multi-media streaming services including the \n   Internet. \n\t </p>\n      "
