abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) provides a
    reliable\n   communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar
    to\n   the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  With the widespread\n   deployment
    of Network Address Translators (NAT), specialized code has\n   been added to NAT
    for TCP that allows multiple hosts to reside behind\n   a NAT and yet use only
    a single globally unique IPv4 address, even\n   when two hosts (behind a NAT)
    choose the same port numbers for their\n   connection.  This additional code is
    sometimes classified as Network\n   Address and Port Translation (NAPT).\n\n   This
    document describes the protocol extensions required for the SCTP\n   endpoints
    and the mechanisms for NAT devices necessary to provide\n   similar features of
    NAPT in the single-point and multi-point\n   traversal scenario.\n\n\t </p>\n
