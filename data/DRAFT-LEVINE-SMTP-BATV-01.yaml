abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The envelope of Internet mail contains an RFC2821.MailFrom command,\nwhich
    may supply an address to be used as the recipient of\ntransmission and delivery
    notices about the original message.\nExisting Internet mail permits unauthorized
    use of addresses in the\nMailFrom command, causing notices to be sent to unwitting
    and\nunwilling recipients.  Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) defines\nan extensible
    mechanism for validating the MailFrom address.  It also\ndefines an initial use
    of that mechanism which requires no\nadministrative overhead and no global implementation.\n\nThis
    document is a revision of draft-levine-mass-batv-02.\n\t </p>\n      "
