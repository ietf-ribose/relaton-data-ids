abstract:
- content: "<p>This proposal describes a mechanism that can be used to detect Data
    Path Failures of various overlay technologies as VXLAN, NVGRE, MPLSoGRE and MPLSoUDP
    and verifying/sanity of their Control and Data Plane for given Overlay Segment.
    This document defines the following for each of the above Overlay Technologies:
    o Encapsulation of OAM Packet, such that it has same Outer and Overlay Header
    as any End-System's data going over the same Overlay Segment. o The mechanism
    to trace the Underlay that is exercised by any Overlay Segment. o Procedure to
    verify presence of any given Tenant VM or End-System within a given Overlay Segment
    at Overlay End-Point. Even though the present proposal addresses Overlay OAM for
    VXLAN, NVGRE, MPLSoGRE and MPLSoUDP, but the procedures described are generic
    enough to accommodate OAM for any other Overlay Technology.</p>"
