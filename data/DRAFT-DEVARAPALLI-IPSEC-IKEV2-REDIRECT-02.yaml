abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IKEv2 is a popular protocol for setting up VPN tunnels from a
    remote\nlocation to a gateway so that the VPN client can access services in\nthe
    network behind the gateway.  Currently there is no standard\nmechanism specified
    that allows an overloaded VPN gateway to re-\ndirect the VPN client to attach
    to another gateway.  This document\nproposes a re-direct mechanism for IKEv2.
    \ The proposed mechanism can\nalso be used for Mobile IPv6 to enable the home
    agent to re-direct\nthe mobile node to another home agent.\n\t </p>\n      "
