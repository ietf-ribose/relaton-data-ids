abstract:
  content: "<p>The Hop-by-Hop Options header is used to convey optional information
    that must be examined by every node along a packet's delivery path. This document
    updates RFC2460, removing the requirement that source nodes must process the Hop-by-Hop
    extension header, on the basis that it imposes a performance impact with no advantages.</p>"
