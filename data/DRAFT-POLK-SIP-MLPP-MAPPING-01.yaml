abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation
    \nProtocol [1] to allow SIP (and IP) into existing Voice Backbone\nInfrastructures
    that require Multi-Level Precedence and Pre-\nemption [2] Service throughout those
    networks. This document \nwill also allow MLPP networks that are ISDN-based now
    to evolve/\nmigrate or be replaced by a SIP-based Voice Signaling network \nwith
    no loss in capability of that original network. More likely\nis the case that
    additional functionality and capabilities can \nbe realized such as mobility and
    reduced user headaches (ex-\nplained later) with SIP being MLPP enabled within
    a network \ninfrastructure.\n\t </p>\n      "
