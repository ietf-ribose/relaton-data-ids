abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism that enables unlinkable
    session\n   resumption for TLS 1.3 without server-side state.  In contrast to\n
    \  existing ticket-based resumption in TLS 1.3, wherein servers\n   construct
    and issue tickets to clients, this document specifies a\n   mechanism by which
    clients request \"anonymous tickets\" from servers.\n   When a session is resumed
    using an anonymous ticket, a server only\n   learns that it previously engaged
    in a session with some client,\n   rather than linking it to a specific client.
    \ Anonymous tickets are\n   only useful for clients with idempotent early data
    to send.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
