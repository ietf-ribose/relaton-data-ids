abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines low level monitoring and status MIBs for
    IPsec\nsecurity associations (SAs). It does not define MIBs that may be used\nfor
    configuring IPsec implementations or for providing low-level\ndiagnostic or debugging
    information. It assumes no specific use of\nIPsec. Further, it does not provide
    policy information.\nThe purpose of the MIBs is to allow system administrators
    to\ndetermine operating conditions and perform system operational level\nmonitoring
    of the IPsec portion of their network. Statistics are\nprovided as well. Additionally,
    it may be used as the basis for\napplication specific MIBs for specific uses of
    IPsec SAs.\n\t </p>\n      "
