abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a mechanism for a host to signal via
    PCP\n   which connections should be protected against network failures.\n   These
    connections will be elected to be subject to high availability\n   mechanisms
    enabled at the network side.\n\n   This approach assumes that aplications/users
    have more visibility\n   about sensitive connections rather than any heuristic
    that can be\n   enabled at the network side to guess which connections should
    be\n   secured.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
