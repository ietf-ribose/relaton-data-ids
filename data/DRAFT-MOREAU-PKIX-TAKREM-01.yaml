abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     In the Internet PKI, trust anchor keys are distributed as
    self-\n     signed X.509 security certificates. This document specifies a trust\n
    \    anchor key renewal mechanism that leverages the confidence in the\n     initial
    certificate distribution. A non-critical X.509 certificate\n     extension holds
    a sequence of opaque octet strings. The trust\n     anchor renewal operation occurs
    upon receipt of a message that\n     hashes to one of those octet strings.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
