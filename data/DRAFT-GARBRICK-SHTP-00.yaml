abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes HTTPX, a protocol for providing access
    to\n   materials that may be objectionable or that have age or locale-based\n
    \  restrictions, while providing a simple method to filter such content\n   where
    required.\n \n   HTTPX uses the protocol HTTP 1.1 ([RFC 2068]), with the single\n
    \  exception of designating a separate range of TCP and UDP port\n   numbers that
    are allocated to a specific content type.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
