abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Since IPv6 connectivity is not yet broadly available, there is
    a need\nin NEMO for a simple technology that allows a MIPv6 based Mobile\nRouter
    to roam over IPv4 networks.\nThe Doors Protocol proposed in this memo allows an
    arbitrary Mobile\nNode to roam even within private IPv4 address spaces, across
    both\nNetwork Address Translations (NAT), reverse NAT, and even Port\nAddress
    Translation (PAT), in order to cope with the reality of\ntoday's Internet.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
