abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The period of IPv4/IPv6 transisation will last for a long time.Different
    phases of IPv4/IPv6 transisation have different scenarioesand requirements thus
    need different solutions. In the early stageof IPv4/IPv6 transisation, sicne the
    majority of the Internetresources locate in the IPv4 Internet, the main communication
    type ofthe IPv4/IPv6 transition is v6 to v4 which is the IPv6 clients iniatecommunication
    to the IPv4 servers. At the later stage of the IPv4/IPv6 transisation, the servers
    may locate in the IPv6 network/Internet, in this scenario, there is a need for
    the legacy IPv4client to iniate communication to the IPv6 servers. This documentanalyses
    the problems of v4 to v6 communication and discusses asolution called PNAT-Lite.</p>"
