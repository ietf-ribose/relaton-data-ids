abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There is heightened concern about the growth of the global routingtable
    and the increased frequency of routing table updates. Both isdue to the use of
    provider-independent addressing space in edgenetworks, which accommodates operators'
    desire to move trafficquickly and easily from one provider to another. The main
    recentproposals attempt to solve this problem by hiding provider-independent addressing
    space through a level of indirection.Unfortunately, indirection requires a non-trivial
    distribution ofaddress translation information across the Internet. This is eitherslow,
    or costly in terms of signaling overhead, or both. Securityand transitionability
    are further issues. This document proposes analternative solution, which is based
    on a single, provider-dependentaddressing space and hence avoids the problems
    of indirection. Thesolution meets the objectives of edge network operators whilelimiting
    the size of the routing table and its update frequency.</p>"
