abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies mechanisms of NSA (Native Short Address)
    that\n   enables IP packet transmission over links where the transmission of a\n
    \  full length address may not be desirable.  This document focuses on\n   carrying
    IP packets across a LLN (Low power and Lossy Network), in\n   which the topology
    is relatively static where nodes' location is\n   fixed and the connection between
    nodes is rather stable.  The changes\n   in the logical topology are only caused
    by non-frequent disconnection\n   in the link due to some reasons.  The specifications
    details NSA\n   address allocation, forwarding mechanism, header format design,\n
    \  including length-variable fields, and IPv6 interconnection support.\n\n\t </p>\n
