abstract:
  content: "<p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting qualityof
    service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. Theoverall PCN architecture
    is described in RFC5559. This memo is oneof a series describing possible boundary
    node behaviours for a PCNdomain.This document proposes an admission control method.
    It assumes thatPCN nodes perform threshold-marking configured with the PCN-admissible-rate
    on any link. The decision point uses the PCN markingstate of an initial signaling
    message of a flow to determine whetherthe flow should be admitted or blocked.</p>"
