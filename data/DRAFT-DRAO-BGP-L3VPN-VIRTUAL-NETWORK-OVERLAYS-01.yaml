abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Virtual network overlays are being designed and deployed in
    various\n   types of networks, including data centers.  These network overlays\n
    \  address several requirements including flexible network\n   virtualization
    and multi-tenancy, increased scale, and support for\n   mobility of virtual machines.
    \ Such overlay networks can be used to\n   provide both Layer-2 and Layer-3 network
    services to hosts at the\n   network edge.  New packet encapsulations are being
    defined and\n   standardized to support these virtual networks.  These\n   encapsulations,
    such as VXLAN and NVGRE, are primarily based on IP\n   and are currently defined
    to support a Layer-2 forwarding service.\n\n   BGP based Layer-3 VPNs, as specified
    in RFC 4364, provide an industry\n   proven and well-defined solution for supporting
    Layer-3 virtual\n   network services.  However, RFC 4364 procedures use MPLS labels
    to\n   provide the network virtualization capability in the data plane.\n   With
    the increasing support for IP overlay encapsulations in data\n   center devices,
    there is a strong preference to utilize this support\n   to deploy Layer-3 virtual
    networks using the familiarpolicy and\n   operational primitives of Layer-3 VPNs.\n\n
    \  This document describes the use of BGP Layer-3 VPNs alongwith the new\n   IP-based
    virtual network overlay encapsulations to provide a Layer-3\n   virtualization
    solution for all IP traffic, and specifies mechanisms\n   to use the new encapsulations
    while continuing to leverage the BGP\n   Layer-3 VPN control plane techniques
    and extensions.  This mechanism\n   provides an efficient incremental solution
    to support forwarding for\n   IP traffic, irrespective of whether it is destined
    within or across\n   an IP subnet boundary.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
