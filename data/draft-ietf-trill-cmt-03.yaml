abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL facilitates loop free connectivity to non-TRILL legacy networks
    via choice of an Appointed Forwarder for a set of VLANs. Appointed Forwarder provides
    load sharing based on VLAN with an active-standby model. Mission critical operations
    such as High Performance Data Centers require active-active load sharing model.
    The Active-Active load sharing model can be accomplished by representing any given
    non-TRILL legacy network with a single virtual RBridge. Virtual representation
    of the non-TRILL legacy network with a single RBridge poses serious challenges
    in multi- destination RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) check calculations. This document
    specifies required enhancements to build Coordinated Multicast Trees (CMT) within
    the TRILL campus to solve related RPF issues. CMT provides flexibility to RBridges
    in selecting desired path of association to a given TRILL multi-destination distribution
    tree.</p>"
