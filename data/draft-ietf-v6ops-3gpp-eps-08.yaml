abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of cellular broadband for accessing the Internet and other
    data services via smartphones, tablets, and notebook/netbook computers has increased
    rapidly as a result of high-speed packet data networks such as HSPA, HSPA+, and
    now Long-Term Evolution (LTE) being deployed. Operators that have deployed networks
    based on 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network architectures are facing
    IPv4 address shortages at the Internet registries and are feeling pressure to
    migrate to IPv6. This document describes the support for IPv6 in 3GPP network
    architectures. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
