abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.
    \ RFC 6374\n   specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate\n
    \  measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as\n   related
    metrics such as delay variation in MPLS networks using probe\n   messages.  This
    document utilizes these mechanisms for Performance\n   Delay and Loss Measurements
    in Segment Routing (SR) networks with\n   MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS), for both
    SR links and end-to-end SR\n   Policies.  In addition, this document defines Return
    Path TLV for\n   two-way performance measurement and Block Number TLV for loss\n
    \  measurement.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
