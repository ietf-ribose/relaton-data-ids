abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a profile for the Authentication and\n
    \  Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework.  The\n   profile
    uses Group OSCORE to provide communication security between a\n   Client and a
    (set of) Resource Server(s) as members of an OSCORE\n   Group.  The profile securely
    binds an OAuth 2.0 Access Token with the\n   public key of the Client associated
    to the signing private key used\n   in the OSCORE group.  The profile uses Group
    OSCORE to achieve server\n   authentication, as well as proof-of-possession for
    the Client's\n   public key.  Also, it provides proof of the Client's membership
    to\n   the correct OSCORE group, by binding the Access Token to information\n
    \  from the Group OSCORE Security Context, thus allowing the Resource\n   Server(s)
    to verify the Client's membership upon receiving a message\n   protected with
    Group OSCORE from the Client.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
