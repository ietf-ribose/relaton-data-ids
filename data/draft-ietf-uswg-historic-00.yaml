abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditionally, the User Services Area of the IETF has been responsible
    for keeping FYI documents updated. However, as the Internet has progressed and
    developed, it has become clear that not all FYIs are worth updating. Some of the
    information is simply obsolete. This memo documents which FYIs are considered
    obsolete, and lets users know not to trust the information they contain.</p>"
