abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP is good at addressing IP session continuity (hide of the
    IP address change from transport layer perspective, as well as from the correspondent
    perspective) but certainly not optimal for mobility management as would perform
    3GPP systems providers that want to extend their services to IP access systems.
    This document only describes the problem and is not meant to provide any solution
    nor any requirement thereof.</p>"
