abstract:
  content: "<p>QUIC encrypts its Initial Packets using keys derived from well-known
    constants, meaning that observers can inspect the contents of these packets and
    successfully spoof them. This document proposes a new version of QUIC that encrypts
    Initial Packets more securely by leveraging a Public Key distributed via the Domain
    Name System (DNS) or other out-of-band system.</p>"
