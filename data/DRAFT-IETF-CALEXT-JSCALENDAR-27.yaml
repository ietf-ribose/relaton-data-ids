abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a data model and JSON representation
    of\n   calendar data that can be used for storage and data exchange in a\n   calendaring
    and scheduling environment.  It aims to be an alternative\n   and, over time,
    successor to the widely deployed iCalendar data\n   format, and to be unambiguous,
    extendable, and simple to process.  In\n   contrast to the jCal format, which
    is also JSON-based, JSCalendar is\n   not a direct mapping from iCalendar, but
    defines the data model\n   independently and expands semantics where appropriate.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
