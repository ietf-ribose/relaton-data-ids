abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network\n
    \  Communications Research Group (NWCRG).  It conforms to the directions\n   found
    in the NWCRG taxonomy [RFC8406].  Thus, the scope of the\n   document is network
    coding as a linear combination of packets in and\n   above the network layer.
    \ Physical and MAC layer coding are beyond\n   the scope of the document.  The
    draft focuses on a multi-gateway\n   satellite system and identifies the use-cases
    where network coding\n   provides significant performance improvements.  The objective
    is to\n   contribute to a larger deployment of network coding techniques in\n
    \  SATCOM to complement already implemented loss recovery mechanisms.\n   The
    draft also identifies open research issues related to the\n   deployment of network
    coding in SATCOM systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
