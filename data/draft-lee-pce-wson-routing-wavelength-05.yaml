abstract:
- content: <p>This memo provides application-specific requirements for the Path Computation
    Element communication Protocol (PCEP) for the support of Wavelength Switched Optical
    Networks (WSON). Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength
    assignment (RWA) process. From a path computation perspective, wavelength assignment
    is the process of determining which wavelength can be used on each hop of a path
    and forms an additional routing constraint to optical light path computation.
    Requirements related to optical impairments will be addressed in a separate document.
    Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
