abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two fully-specified FEC Schemes for Sliding
    Window Random Linear Codes (RLC), one for RLC over GF(2) (binary case), a second
    one for RLC over GF(2^^8), both of them with the possibility of controlling the
    code density. They are meant to protect arbitrary media streams along the lines
    defined by FECFRAME extended to sliding window FEC codes. These sliding window
    FEC codes rely on an encoding window that slides over the source symbols, generating
    new repair symbols whenever needed. Compared to block FEC codes, these sliding
    window FEC codes offer key advantages with real- time flows in terms of reduced
    FEC-related latency while often providing improved erasure recovery capabilities.</p>"
