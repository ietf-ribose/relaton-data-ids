abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As OTN network capabilities continue to evolve, there is an
    increased\n   need to support GMPLS control for the same. [RFC4328] introduced\n
    \  GMPLS signaling extensions for supporting early version of G.709\n   [G.709-v1].The
    basic routing considerations from signaling\n   perspective is also specified
    in [RFC4328].\n\n   The recent revision of ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G.709-v3]
    and\n   [GSUP.43] have introduced new ODU containers (both fixed and\n   flexible)
    and additional ODU multiplexing capabilities, enabling\n   support for optimal
    service aggregation.\n\n   This document extends [RFC4328] to provide GMPLS signaling
    support\n   for the new OTN capabilities defined in [G.709-v3] and [GSUP.43].
    The\n   signaling extensions described in this document caters to ODU layer\n
    \  switching only. Optical Channel Layer switching considerations in\n   [RFC4328]
    are not modified in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
