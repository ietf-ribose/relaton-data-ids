abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS-SD Service Registration Protocol provides a way to
    perform\n   DNS-Based Service Discovery using only unicast packets.  This\n   eliminates
    the dependency on Multicast DNS as the foundation layer,\n   which has worked
    well in some environments, like the simplest of home\n   networks, but not in
    others, like large enterprise networks (where\n   multicast does not scale well
    to thousands of devices) and mesh\n   networks (where multicast and broadcast
    are supported poorly, if at\n   all).  Broadly speaking, the DNS-SD Service Registration
    Protocol is\n   DNS Update, with a few additions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
