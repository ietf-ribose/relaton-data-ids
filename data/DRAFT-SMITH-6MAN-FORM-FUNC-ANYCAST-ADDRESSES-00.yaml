abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 anycast addresses are chosen from within the existing
    IPv6\n   unicast address space, with the addresses nominated as anycast\n   addresses
    through configuration.  An alternative scheme is to have a\n   special class of
    addresses for use as anycast addresses.  This memo\n   proposes a distinct general
    anycast addressing class and a more\n   specific scheme for functional anycast
    addresses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
