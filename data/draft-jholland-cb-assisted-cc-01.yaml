abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Circuit Breaker Assisted Congestion Control
    (CBACC), which provides bandwidth information from senders to intermediate network
    nodes to enable good decisions for fast-trip Network Transport Circuit Breaker
    activity ([I-D.ietf-tsvwg-circuit-breaker]) when necessary for network health.
    CBACC is specifically designed to support protocols using IP multicast, particularly
    as a supplement to receiver-driven congestion control protocols to help affected
    networks rapidly detect and mitigate the impact of scenarios in which a network
    is oversubscribed to flows which are not responsive to congestion.</p>"
