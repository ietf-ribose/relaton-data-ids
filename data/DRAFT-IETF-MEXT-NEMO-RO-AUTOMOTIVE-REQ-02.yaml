abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies requirements for NEMO Route Optimization\n
    \  techniques as identified by the automotive industry.  Requirements\n   are
    gathered from the Car2Car Communication Consortium and ISO\n   Technical Committee
    204 Working Group 16 (CALM).  The document also\n   overviews the current status
    of ETSI TC ITS, which is going to unify\n   the approaches of these two automotive
    consortia in a single\n   communication architecture.\n\t </p>\n      "
