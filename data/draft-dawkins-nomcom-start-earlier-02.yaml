abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3777 defines the Nominations and Recall Committee's (NomCom's)
    operation, and includes a sample timeline for major steps in the NomCom process
    that meets the minimum normative requirements for the process. Recent NomComs
    have been scheduling based on the sample timeline, and the chairs of the last
    three NomComs -- Danny McPherson (2004-2005), Ralph Droms (2005-2006), and Andrew
    Lange (2006-2007) -- have all reported that this timeline is very aggressive and
    suggested starting earlier. This document restructures the sample timeline, but
    makes no normative process changes. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
