abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft presents an experimental work proposing a lightweight\n
    \  secure session establishment scheme to mutually authenticate two\n   endpoints
    and share the session key. It works on symmetric\n   cryptosystem with pre-shared
    secret between the endpoints during\n   provisioning. The main algorithm is proposed
    as a generic concept.\n   This draft further describes how the generic concept
    can be modeled\n   as simple CoAP request/response pairs. Thus the proposed scheme\n
    \  enables CoAP with inherent security which might be useful for object\n   security
    without requiring any secure transport. Still further, this\n   draft demonstrates
    how the scheme could be integrated with the\n   record encryption mechanism of
    DTLS-PSK. It reuses the DTLS session\n   parameter structure without any modification.
    Thus channel security\n   for the whole application message can be provided. So
    the scheme is\n   a cross-layer mechanism such that the session establishment
    is\n   performed in CoAP and channel encryption is performed in the\n   transport
    layer reusing only the record encryption mechanism of\n   DTLS-PSK. The scheme
    uses all standard encryption libraries. The\n   lightweight nature and performance
    improvement is demonstrated with\n   some supporting comparative results.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
