abstract:
  content: "\t <t>SDN and NFV have been creating paradigm shifts across major service
    providers,governments, and industries. In most recent months, these two novel
    frameworks created jittersand excitements across major academic institutions and
    communities of practice. While theseare considered disruptive to major network
    infrastructures operating on status quo, SDN andNFV nonetheless bring network
    resiliency, scalability, manageability, and, mostimportantly, lower long-term
    operational expenditures.They create opportunities for innovation that engage
    key players from networks,security, and software to develop new software controllers,
    APIs, networks, and technologies.This document aims to propose a formal security
    architecture that overarches importantaspects of SDN and NFV 's frameworks.The
    architecture can be elaborated and modified as these two frameworks mature overtime.</p>"
