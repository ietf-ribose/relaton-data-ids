abstract:
- content: "<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a handling agent to affix
    a digital signature to an email message, associating a domain name with that message
    using cryptographic signing techniques. The digital signature typically covers
    most of a message's original portions, although the specific choices for content
    hashing are at the discretion of the signer. DKIM signatures survive simply email
    relaying but typically are invalidated by processing through Mediators, such as
    mailing lists. For such cases, the signer needs a way to indicate that a valid
    signature from some third party was anticipated, and constitutes an acceptable
    handling of the message. This enables a receiver to conclude that the content
    is legitimately from that original signer, even though its original signature
    no longer validates. This document defines a mechanism for improving the ability
    to assess DKIM validity for such messages.</p>"
