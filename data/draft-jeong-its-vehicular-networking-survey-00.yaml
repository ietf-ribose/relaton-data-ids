abstract:
  content: <p>This document surveys the IP-based vehicular networks, which are considered
    a key component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The main topics of
    vehicular networking are vehicle-to- vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I), and infrastructure- to-vehicle (I2V) networking. Vehicular networks deal
    with some critical aspects, such as IP address autoconfiguration, routing, handover,
    and mobility management. This document summarizes and analyzes the previous research
    activities that use IPv4 or IPv6 for vehicular networking"</p>
