abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a mechanism to describe 3D video streams
    in the\n   Session Description Protocol (SDP).  This includes 3D video streams\n
    \  composed of multiple video views, or of a combination of views and\n   depth
    maps.  Several 3D video formats are supported, including\n   simulcast, video-plus-depth,
    and frame-packing.\n\n   A new decoding dependency, \"3dd\", is defined, describing
    the\n   association between media stream belonging to a 3D video stream.  In\n
    \  addition, a new SDP media-level attribute, \"3dvFormat\", is defined,\n   describing
    the format used by media streams within a 3D video stream.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
