abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document \"FIB Suppression with Virtual Aggregation\" [I-D.grow-va]\n
    \  describes how FIB size may be reduced.  That draft refers generically\n   to
    tunnels, and leaves it to other documents to define the tunnel\n   establishment
    methods for specific tunnel types.  This document\n   provides those definitions
    for GRE and IP-in-IP tunnels.\n\t </p>\n      "
