abstract:
  content: "<p>The Session Peering Provisioning Protocol (SPPP) is an XML protocolthat
    exists to enable the provisioning of session establishment datainto Session Data
    Registries or SIP Service Provider data stores.Sending XML data structures over
    Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)and HTTP(s) is a widely used, de-facto standard
    for messaging betweenelements of provisioning systems. Therefore the combination
    of SOAPand HTTP(s) as a transport for SPPP is a natural fit. The obviousbenefits
    include leveraging existing industry expertise, leveragingexisting standards,
    and a higher probability that existingprovisioning systems can be more easily
    integrated with thisprotocol. This document describes the specification for transportingSPPP
    XML structures over SOAP and HTTP(s).</p>"
