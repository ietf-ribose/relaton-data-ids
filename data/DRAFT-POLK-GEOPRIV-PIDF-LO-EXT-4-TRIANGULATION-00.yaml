abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes how a Presentity Agent (PA) provides a
    \nLocation Information Server (LIS) with location specific measurement\ndata it
    observes, for example - how many satellites are visible to a\nPA, and at what
    angle are each currently, to aid the LIS in \ndetermining geographically where
    the PA is.  This is done within a \nSession Initiation Protocol subscription framework
    where the LIS \nsubscribes to the PA for its measurement data.  The LIS performs
    the\nlocation calculation, determining where the PA is.\n\t </p>\n      "
