abstract:
- content: <p>We are introducing a new method to calculate services KPIs and metrics
    in the network using TWAMP protocol. Services here ranging from Layer 4 to Layer
    7 services. Some of the examples are Http based services, Traffic load balancer,
    DPI, Video caching, real time streaming and IPSec. The KPIs MAY be service latency,
    liveliness of an application, number of flows and sessions per service, load balancer
    statistics. This draft outlines the methodology to calculate these parameters
    in the service plane in the real network using TWAMP protocol. Some of the existing
    fields extended to support new modes in the TWAMP protocol for calculating these
    KPIs. set of new messages are added in the control protocol between TWAMP client
    (session sender) and the TWAMP server (session reflector). There is a separate
    draft "draft-spv-ippm-monitor-implementation- services-kpi" that talks about implementation
    of monitoring these KPIs in the network using TWAMP. Monitoring of these KPIs
    in the service plane with in a network play a vital role in optimum usage of network
    resources and improving the overall performance and capacity.</p>
