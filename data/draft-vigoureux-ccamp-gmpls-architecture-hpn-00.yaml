abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Optical networks could have been reduced to point-to-point links
    buttechnology evolution led the way to an evolution trend. The conceptof optical
    transparency first took shape through the development ofphotonic switching fabrics
    and is now being reinforced by thecontinuous efforts produced to increase transmission
    distances.Optical networking obviously can not be left aside of suchevolutions
    and so it is for the (in particular, GMPLS-based)protocols that control these
    photonic networks. This documenthighlights the enhancements that seem to be necessary
    for GMPLS tocover these emerging trends (transparency, hybrid nodes) and fulfilits
    role of a generalized control plane.</p>"
