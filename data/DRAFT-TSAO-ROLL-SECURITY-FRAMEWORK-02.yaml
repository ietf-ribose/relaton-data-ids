abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents a security framework for routing over low\npower
    and lossy networks.  The development builds upon previous work\non routing security
    and adapts the assessments to the issues and\nconstraints specific to low power
    and lossy networks.  A systematic\napproach is used in defining and evaluating
    the security threats and\nidentifying applicable countermeasures.  These assessments
    provide\nthe basis of the security recommendations for incorporation into low\npower,
    lossy network routing protocols.  As an illustration, this\nframework is applied
    to RPL.\n\t </p>\n      "
