abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a passive performance measurement method for
    SRv6 network programming. In this method, performance measurement information
    can be carried in data packets by two ways. One way is carrying measurement information
    by used SIDs. Another way is carrying measurement information via related SRH
    TLVs.</p>"
