abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of
    standard\n   Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing\n
    \  communication.  The security needs for IoT systems are well-\n   recognized
    and many standardization steps to provide security have\n   been taken, for example,
    the specification of Constrained Application\n   Protocol (CoAP) secured with
    Datagram Transport Layer Security\n   (DTLS).  However, security challenges still
    exist, not only because\n   there are some use cases that lack a suitable solution,
    but also\n   because many IoT devices and systems have been designed and deployed\n
    \  with very limited security capabilities.  In this document, we first\n   discuss
    the various stages in the lifecycle of a thing.  Next, we\n   document the security
    threats to a thing and the challenges that one\n   might face to protect against
    these threats.  Lastly, we discuss the\n   next steps needed to facilitate the
    deployment of secure IoT systems.\n   This document can be used by IoT standards
    specifications as a\n   reference for details about security considerations applying
    to the\n   specified protocol.\n\n   This document is a product of the IRTF Thing-to-Thing
    Research Group\n   (T2TRG).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
