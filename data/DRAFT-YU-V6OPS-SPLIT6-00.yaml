abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the current TCP/IP architecture, the IPv6 address has a
    dual\n   meaning in semantics.  It not only represents the topological\n   location
    of the network node, but also the identity of the node,\n   which is usually referred
    to as the semantic overload problem of the\n   IP address.  The semantically overloaded
    IP address represents the\n   topological position of the network, and the topological
    position of\n   the network generally does not move, so the device entering the
    new\n   network environment needs to replace the new identity IP to adapt to\n
    \  the change of the topological position.  The semantic overload of IP\n   addresses
    is not conducive to supporting mobility and user identity\n   authentication,
    resulting in tight storage space for routing\n   equipment, lack of unified communication
    identification for network\n   equipment, and difficulties in network traceability
    and management.\n   In order to solve the problem of IP address semantic overload,
    this\n   project focuses on the separation technology SPLIT6 of IP address\n   identity
    and location.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
