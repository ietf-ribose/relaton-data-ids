abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document details concerns about how Internet of Things
    devices\n   use IP addresses and DNS names.  The issue becomes acute as network\n
    \  operators begin deploying RFC8520 Manufacturer Usage Description\n   (MUD)
    definitions to control device access.\n\n   This document explains the problem
    through a series of examples of\n   what can go wrong, and then provides some
    advice on how a device\n   manufacturer can best make deal with these issues.
    \ The\n   recommendations have an impact upon device and network protocol\n   design.\n\n
    \  {RFC-EDITOR, please remove.  Markdown and issue tracker for this\n   document
    is at https://github.com/mcr/iot-mud-dns-considerations.git\n   }\n\n\t </p>\n
