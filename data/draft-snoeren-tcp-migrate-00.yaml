abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a set of TCP options to support the migrationof
    an active TCP connection across IP addresses and TCP port numbers.Using this option,
    a TCP peer can open a migrateable connection,transfer one or more bytes on it,
    and continue the connection fromanother IP address/TCP port pair in an application-transparentfashion.
    The set of addresses or ports from where a connection mightbe continued need not
    be known in advance. Security againstconnection hijacking is achieved using a
    secret cryptographic cookienegotiated through an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
    [ANSI-X962]exchange during connection establishment. The initiation ofmigration
    can be done either by one of the communicating peers, or bya trusted third-party
    that presents the negotiated cryptographiccookie.</p>"
