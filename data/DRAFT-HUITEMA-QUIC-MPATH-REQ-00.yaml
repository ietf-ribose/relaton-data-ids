abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the requirement and plausible architecture
    of\n   QUIC multipath extensions.  While the first version of QUIC is not\n   scheduled
    to include multipath extensions, there are risks that\n   decisions made in this
    first version might preclude some options that\n   we may later find attractive.
    \ An early review of multipath extension\n   requirements and issues should minimize
    that risk.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
