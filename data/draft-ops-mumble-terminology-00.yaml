abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Policy Based Networking (PBN) is a topic of interest to many areaswithin
    the networking community. Initially considered for theimplementation and control
    of QoS services, several groups arelooking to deploy policy-based networks for
    a wider variety ofapplications, such as security and VPN. We have found, when
    tryingto coordinate efforts of the different groups, that there are somemisunderstandings
    among the groups, some of which can be attributedto the different terminology
    that has propagated through the groups.In this draft, we attempt to clear up some
    of thesemisunderstandings, concentrating on PBN for Policy Provisioning(rap),
    Differentiated Services (diffserv), IP Security (ipsp), andgeneral Policy Framework
    (policy). The terminology discussed here isnot meant to be an exhaustive list
    of PBN-related terms andconcepts, but it is intended to represent at least the
    four areasmentioned.It is NOT intended that this draft defines an architecture
    orframework for PBN _ each group is clearly qualified to define thesefor themselves.
    Instead, we identify the terminology common to allPBN applications and suggest
    definitions, which are meaningful anduseful, yet general enough to be applicable
    across all PBNapplications.</p>"
