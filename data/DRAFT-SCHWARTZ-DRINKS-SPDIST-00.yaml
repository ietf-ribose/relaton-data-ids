abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a protocol for distributing session\n
    \  establishment data from often centralized Session Data Registries or\n   SIP
    Service Provider data stores into local data repositories for\n   local querying
    of the data.  The distributed data is typically used\n   by various network elements
    for session peering.\n\n   This document describes the Session Peering Distribution
    Protocol\n   (SPDP) that should be seen as an extension to the session peering\n
    \  provisioning protocol defining the provisioning process itself.  The\n   document
    provides a set of guiding principles for the design of this\n   protocol including
    an extension of the SPPP basic data model for\n   distribution purposes and an
    associated extension XML Schema\n   Document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
