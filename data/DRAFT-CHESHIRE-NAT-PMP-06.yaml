abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a protocol for automating the process
    of\n   creating Network Address Translation (NAT) port mappings. Included in\n
    \  the protocol is a method for retrieving the external IPv4 address of\n   a
    NAT gateway, thus allowing a client to make this external IPv4\n   address and
    port known to peers that may wish to communicate with it.\n   From 2005 onwards
    this protocol was implemented in Apple products\n   including Mac OS X, Bonjour
    for Windows, and AirPort wireless base\n   stations. In 2012 NAT-PMP was superseded
    by the IETF Standards-Track\n   Port Control Protocol, which builds on NAT-PMP
    and uses a compatible\n   packet format, but adds a number of significant enhancements
    [PCP].\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
