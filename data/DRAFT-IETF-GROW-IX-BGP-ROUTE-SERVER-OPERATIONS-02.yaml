abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The popularity of Internet exchange points (IXPs) brings new\n
    \  challenges to interconnecting networks.  While bilateral eBGP\n   sessions
    between exchange participants were historically the most\n   common means of exchanging
    reachability information over an IXP, the\n   overhead associated with this interconnection
    method causes serious\n   operational and administrative scaling problems for
    IXP participants.\n\n   Multilateral interconnection using Internet route servers
    can\n   dramatically reduce the administrative and operational overhead of\n   IXP
    participation and these systems used by many IXP participants as\n   a preferred
    means of exchanging routing information.\n\n   This document describes operational
    considerations for multilateral\n   interconnections at IXPs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
