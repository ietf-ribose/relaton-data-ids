abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RTP Media Chains usually rely on piping encoder output directly
    to\n   packetizers.  Media packetization formats often support a specific\n   codec
    format and optimize RTP packets generation accordingly.  With\n   the development
    of Selective Forward Unit (SFU) solutions, RTP Media\n   Chains used in WebRTC
    solutions are increasingly relying on\n   application-specific transforms that
    sit between encoder and\n   packetizer on one end and between depacketizer and
    decoder on the\n   other end.  These transforms are typically encrypting media
    content\n   so that the media content is not readable from the SFU, for instance\n
    \  using [SFrame] or [WebRTCInsertableStreams].  In that context, RTP\n   packetizers
    can no longer expect to use packetization formats that\n   mandate media content
    to be in a specific codec format.  This\n   document provides a solution to that
    problem by describing a RTP\n   packetization format that can be used for many
    media content, and how\n   to negotiate use of this format.  This document also
    describes a\n   solution to allow SFUs to continue performing packet routing on
    top\n   of this RTP packetization format.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
