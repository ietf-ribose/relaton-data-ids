abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     Over time Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic \n
    \    engineered networks may be migrated to use Generalized MPLS \n     (GMPLS).
    This will allow the networks to benefit from many new \n     features that have
    been added to the GMPLS protocols. \n     Additionally, such migration will facilitate
    easy interworking \n     of packet networks that are controlled by IP/MPLS-TE
    protocols \n     and networks that are controlled by GMPLS protocols. \n      \n
    \    During this migration phase MPLS and GMPLS capable elements will  \n     have
    to co-exist and interwork. GMPLS signaling and routing \n     protocols are subtly
    different from the MPLS protocols and so \n     interworking and migration strategies
    are needed. \n\n     This document describes issues associated with interworking
    of \n     IP/MPLS-TE networks and GMPLS-based optical networks. Then it \n     describes
    possible migration scenarios, mechanisms to compensate \n     for the differences
    between MPLS and GMPLS protocols, and how to \n     apply those mechanisms in
    order to achieve migration from MPLS \n     to GMPLS.  \n\t </p>\n      "
