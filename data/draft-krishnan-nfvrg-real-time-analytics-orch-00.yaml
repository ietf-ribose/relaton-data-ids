abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the key goals of NFV is to optimize the infrastructure resource
    usage while driving operational simplicity. Real-time analytics providing insight
    into various components such as compute (e.g. dynamic CPU utilization), storage
    (e.g. dynamic capacity usage), network (e.g. dynamic bandwidth utilization), energy
    (e.g. dynamic power consumption) is key to not only providing visibility into
    the NFV infrastructure and thus driving operational simplicity but also optimizing
    resource usage for the purposes of orchestration. This draft focusses on a NFV
    architecture for real- time analytics and orchestration including Big Data predictive
    analytics for addressing the aforementioned requirements.</p>"
