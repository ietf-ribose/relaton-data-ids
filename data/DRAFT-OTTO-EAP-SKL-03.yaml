abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes EAP-SKL, an Extensible Authentication\n
    \  Protocol (EAP) method which provides mutual authentication and key\n   derivation
    based on a pre-shared secret.  EAP-SKL relies on the\n   cryptographic protocol
    SKEME (Secure Key Exchange MEchanism\n   protocol), and hence may benefit from
    its simplicity and the provable\n   security.  EAP-SKL complies with the mandatory
    requirements for an\n   EAP method which is intented for deployment in Wireless
    LAN\n   environments.\n\t </p>\n      "
