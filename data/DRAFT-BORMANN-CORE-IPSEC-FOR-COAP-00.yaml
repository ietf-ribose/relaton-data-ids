abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and\n
    \  networks.  Security for the protocol can be supplied in a number of\n   ways.
    \ The mandatory-to-implement security mode for CoAP makes use of\n   DTLS.  Other
    applications may want to use IPsec.\n\n   This document will discuss considerations
    for the use of IPsec with\n   CoAP.  It will be advanced on a timescale separate
    from the main CoAP\n   specification, as most experience in securing CoAP so far
    has been\n   made with DTLS.\n\n   The current version of this specification is
    a placeholder, built out\n   of text extracted from draft-ietf-core-coap-12.  It
    is meant to pick\n   up http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/core/trac/ticket/262 and
    provide a\n   home for its considerations.  It might be merged with other documents\n
    \  later.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
