abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an extension to the Interactive Connectivity\n
    \  Establishment (ICE) that enables ICE agents to dynamically change the\n   selected
    candidate pair of the controlled side by allowing the\n   controlling side to
    nominate different candidate pairs over time as\n   network conditions change.\n\n\t
