abstract:
- content: "<p>This use case document provides requirements for moving Content Distribution
    Networks (CDNs) from physical servers to a virtualized environment. This new kind
    of CDN, known as virtualized CDN (vCDN), allows for new constructs that simplify
    the CDN architecture. The main elements of the CDN are analyzed with regards to
    the degree of elasticity demanded from them in terms of computation, storage and
    network resources. This use case document provides resiliency requirements for
    virtualization of the Content Distribution Network, known as virtualized CDN (vCDN).</p>"
