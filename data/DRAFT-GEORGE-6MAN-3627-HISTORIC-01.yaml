abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document moves RFC3627 (Use of /127 Prefix Length Between\n
    \  Routers Considered Harmful) to HISTORIC status to reflect the updated\n   guidance
    contained in RFC6164 (Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter-\n   Router Links).
    \ While a standards track document already supersedes\n   an informational document
    and therefore RFC6164 is the appropriate\n   guidance to follow when the two documents
    are in conflict, this links\n   the two documents so that it is clearer that the
    IETF has updated\n   guidance on the matter.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
