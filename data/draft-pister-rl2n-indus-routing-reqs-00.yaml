abstract:
  content: "<p>Wireless, low power field devices enable industrial users tosignificantly
    increase the amount of information collected and thenumber of control points that
    can be remotely managed. Thedeployment of these wireless devices will significantly
    improve theproductivity and safety of the plants while increasing the efficiencyof
    the plant workers. For wireless devices to have a significantadvantage over wired
    devices in an industrial environment thewireless network needs to have three qualities:
    low power, highreliability, and easy installation and maintenance. The aim of
    thisdocument is to analyze the requirements for the routing protocol usedfor low
    power and lossy networks (L2N) in industrial environments.</p>"
