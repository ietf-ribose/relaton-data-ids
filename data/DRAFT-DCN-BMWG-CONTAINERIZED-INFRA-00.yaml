abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes benchmarking considerations for a containerized\n
    \  infrastructure.  In a containerized infrastructure, Virtualized\n   Network
    Functions(VNFs) are deployed on operating-system-level\n   virtualization platform
    by abstracting the user namespace as opposed\n   to virtualization using a hypervisor.
    \ Leveraging this, the system\n   configurations and networking scenarios for
    VNF benchmarking will be\n   partially changed by way of resource allocation and
    network port\n   binding between a physical host and VNFs.  In this draft we compare\n
    \  the state of the art in container networking architecture with\n   networking
    on VM-based virtualized systems, and provide several test\n   scenarios for network
    performance in containerized infrastructure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
