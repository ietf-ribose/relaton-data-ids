abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a trusted browser security model intended
    to\n    secure the mutual automated consent between the end-user and the\n    content
    provider before allowing a web browser to engage the\n    services of an arbitrary
    third-party add-on, extension or service.\n    Properly implemented, this proposed
    security model would create a\n    standardized API across all browsers to further
    the security of\n    e-commerce and other on-line transactions.\n\t </p>\n      "
