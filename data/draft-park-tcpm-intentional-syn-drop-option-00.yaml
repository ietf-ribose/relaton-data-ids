abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an option to mitigate SYN flooding attacks,
    called Intentional SYN Drop (ISD). This option can mitigate the SYN flooding attack
    by intentionally dropping the first SYN. It also includes a connection management
    mechanism to detect intelligent attackers who mimic normal clients. Therefore,
    it can effectively mitigate the SYN flooding DDoS attack.</p>"
