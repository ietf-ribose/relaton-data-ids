abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a few security concerns remaining within
    the\n   working group draft of the DKIM base document.  As the base document\n
    \  is a work-in-progress, some issues may have been already resolved.\n   As with
    many protocols, accommodations for convenience are balanced\n   against possible
    negative security repercussions.  This draft\n   attempts to expand upon some
    of these repercussions.  In addition,\n   some threat scenarios may have been
    considered too improbable to\n   warrant the inclusion of mechanisms exceeding
    prior strategies.  This\n   draft attempts to justify added precaution.  And lastly,
    some\n   considerations may have neglected a transformation occurring with the\n
    \  display of the email-address localpart and domain impacting a\n   recipient's
    recognition.  This draft offers minor remedies for these\n   security related
    issues.\n\t </p>\n      "
