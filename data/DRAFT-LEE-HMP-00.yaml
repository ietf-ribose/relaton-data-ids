abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft specifies a Hotspot Mitigation Protocol (HMP) for \nmobile
    ad hoc networks that use on-demand routing protocols and \nthe IEEE 802.11 MAC.
    Hotspots represent transient but highly \ncongested regions in wireless ad hoc
    networks that result in \nincreased packet loss, end-to-end delay, and out-of-order
    \npackets delivery. Using HMP, mobile nodes independently monitor \nlocal conditions
    (e.g., buffer occupancy, packet loss, and MAC \ncontention and delay) in a fully
    distributed manner, and take \nlocal actions in response to the emergence of hotspots,
    such as,       suppressing new route requests and rate controlling TCP flows.
    \nAs a result, HMP improves end-to-end throughput, delay, and \npacket loss, balances
    the resource consumption among neighboring \nnodes, and finally, improves the
    network connectivity by \npreventing premature network partitions.\n\t </p>\n
