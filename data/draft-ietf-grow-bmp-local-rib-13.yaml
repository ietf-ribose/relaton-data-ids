- content: "<p>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines access to local Routing Information
    Bases (RIBs). This document updates BMP (RFC 7854) by adding access to the Local
    Routing Information Base (Loc-RIB), as defined in RFC 4271. The Loc-RIB contains
    the routes that have been selected by the local BGP speaker's Decision Process.</p>"
