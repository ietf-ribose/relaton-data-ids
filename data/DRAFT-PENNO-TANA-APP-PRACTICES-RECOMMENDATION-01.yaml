abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Applications routinely open multiple TCP connections.  For example,
    \nP2P applications maintain connections to a number of different peers \nwhile
    web browsers perform concurrent download from the same web \nserver.  Application
    designers pursue different goals when doing so:  \n \n \n P2P apps need to maintain
    a well-connected mesh in the swarm while \nweb browsers mainly use multiple connections
    to parallelize requests \nthat involve application latency on the web server side.
    \ But this \npractice also has impacts to the host and the network as a whole.
    For \nexample, an application can obtain a larger fraction of the \nbottleneck
    than if it had used fewer connections. Although capacity \nis the most commonly
    considered bottleneck resource, middlebox state \ntable entries are also an important
    resource for an end system \ncommunication.  \n\nThis documents clarifies the
    current practices of application design \nand reasons behind them, and discusses
    the tradeoffs surrounding the \nuse of many concurrent TCP connections to one
    destination and/or to \ndifferent destinations. Other resource types may exist,
    and the \nguidelines are expected to comprehensively discuss them.  \n\nConventions
    used in this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119
    Error! \nReference source not found..\n\t </p>\n      "
