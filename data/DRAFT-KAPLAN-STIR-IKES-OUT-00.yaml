abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism and format for signing
    source\n   identity information of communication requests, in a manner capable\n
    \  of crossing multiple communication protocol types - even if the\n   origin's
    protocol type is unknown.  This is useful for providing\n   E.164 and other forms
    of Caller-ID reputability for various\n   communication protocols, such as SIP,
    XMPP, WebRTC, H.323, and\n   SS7/ISUP.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
