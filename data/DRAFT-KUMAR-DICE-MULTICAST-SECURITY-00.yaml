abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP and 6LoWPAN are fast emerging as the de-facto protocol
    standards\n   in the area of resource-constrained devices forming Low-power and\n
    \  Lossy Networks (LLNs).  Unicast communication in such networks are\n   secured
    at the transport layer using DTLS, as mandated by CoAP.  For\n   various applications,
    IP multicast-based group communications in such\n   networks provide clear advantages.
    \ However, at this point, CoAP does\n   not specify how to secure group communications
    in an interoperable\n   way.  This draft specifies two methods for securing CoAP-based
    group\n   communication at the transport layer and targets deployment scenarios\n
    \  that may require group authentication, respectively source\n   authentication.
    \ The specification leverages the fact that DTLS is\n   already used as the mechanism
    of choice to secure unicast\n   communications and allows group communications
    security to be\n   implemented as an extension of DTLS record layer processing,
    thereby\n   minimizing incremental implementation cost.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
