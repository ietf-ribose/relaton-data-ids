abstract:
- content: "<p>Many IETF protocols use cryptographic algorithms to provide confidentiality,
    integrity, authentication or digital signature. Communicating peers must support
    a common set of cryptographic algorithms for these mechanisms to work properly.
    This memo provides guidelines to ensure that protocols have the ability to migrate
    from one algorithm suite to another over time.</p>"
