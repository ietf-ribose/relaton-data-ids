abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) defined
    in\nthis document provides the mechanisms to create, change and delete\nobjects
    related to centralized conferences, including participants,\ntheir media and their
    roles.  The protocol relies on web services and\nSIP event notification as its
    infrastructure, but can control\nconferences that use any signaling protocol to
    invite users.  CCMP is\nbased on the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), with
    the data\nnecessary for the interactions specified via Web Services Description\nLanguage
    (WSDL).\n\t </p>\n      "
