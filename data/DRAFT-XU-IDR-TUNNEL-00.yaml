abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Virtual Aggregation (VA) is a mechanism for shrinking the size
    of the\nDFZ FIB in routers [I-D.francis-idr-intra-va].  VA can result in\nlonger
    paths and increased load on routers within the ISP that\ndeploys VA.  This document
    describes a mechanism that allows an AS\nthat originates a route to associate
    a tunnel endpoint terminating at\nitself with the route.  This allows routers
    in a remote AS to tunnel\npackets to the originating AS.  If transit ASes between
    the remote AS\nand the originating AS install the prefixes associated with tunnel\nendpoints
    in their FIBs, then tunneled packets that transit through\nthem will take the
    shortest path.  This results in reduced load for\nthe transit AS, and better performance
    for the customers at the\nsource and destination.\n\t </p>\n      "
