abstract:
- content: "<p>Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control allows each
    network element (NE) to perform resource discovery, routing and signaling in a
    distributed manner. On the other hand, with the development of software-defined
    transport networking technology, central controllers are introduced to transport
    networks to control a set of NEs. In transport networks, the GMPLS control has
    many mature mechanisms such as RSVP-TE, OSPF-TE, and LMP, so that GMPLS can be
    applied for the NE-level control in the centralized controller systems. This document
    describes how GMPLS control interworks with centralized controller systems (e.g.
    ACTN) in transport network.</p>"
