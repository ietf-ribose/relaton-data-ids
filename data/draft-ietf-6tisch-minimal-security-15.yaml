abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the minimal framework required for a new device,
    called a "pledge", to securely join a 6TiSCH (IPv6 over the Time-Slotted Channel
    Hopping mode of IEEE 802.15.4) network. The framework requires that the pledge
    and the JRC (Join Registrar/Coordinator, a central entity), share a symmetric
    key. How this key is provisioned is out of scope of this document. Through a single
    CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) request-response exchange secured by OSCORE
    (Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments), the pledge requests admission
    into the network, and the JRC configures it with link-layer keying material and
    other parameters. The JRC may at any time update the parameters through another
    request-response exchange secured by OSCORE. This specification defines the Constrained
    Join Protocol and its CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) data structures,
    and it describes how to configure the rest of the 6TiSCH communication stack for
    this join process to occur in a secure manner. Additional security mechanisms
    may be added on top of this minimal framework.</p>
