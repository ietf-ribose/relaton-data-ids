abstract:
  content: "<p>Based on overload and failure experience with link-state protocols,
    this draft identifies means to enable link-state protocols to:o avoid getting
    into congestion states wherever possibleo respond gracefully to network overloads
    and failureso gracefully recover from massive loss of topology database informationThe
    proposed mechanisms include the following:o throttle setups of link adjacencieso
    reduce the rate of flooding of link-state-advertisements(LSAs)o prioritized treatment
    of Hello &amp; LSA ack packetso database backup &amp; resynchronization for graceful
    recovery from loss of topology database information.</p>"
