abstract:
- content: "<p>A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information on
    the current network state, including: computed Label Switched Path (LSPs), reserved
    resources within the network, and pending path computation requests. This information
    may then be considered when computing new traffic engineered LSPs, and for associated
    and dependent LSPs, received from Path Computation Clients (PCCs). RFC 7470 defines
    a facility to carry vendor-specific information in PCEP. This document extends
    this capability for stateful PCE.</p>"
