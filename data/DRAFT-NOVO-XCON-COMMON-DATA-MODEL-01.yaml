abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document collects, organizes, and describes the conference\nvariables
    that have been introduced in various protocol drafts of the\nXCON and SIPPING
    working groups.  The goal of this document is to\nallow the conference control
    protocols to use a unified common\nconference information data model for XCON.
    \ This document formally\ndefines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema that
    represents\nthe common conference information in a conferencing server.  The\ninformation
    is modeled as a series of elements, each of which\ncontains a set of children
    and attributes.\n\t </p>\n      "
