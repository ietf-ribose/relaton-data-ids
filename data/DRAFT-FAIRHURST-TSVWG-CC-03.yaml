abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides guidance on the design of methods to
    avoid\n   congestion collapse and to provide congestion control.\n   Recommendations
    and requirements on this topic are distributed across\n   many documents in the
    RFC series.  This therefore seeks to gather and\n   consolidate these recommendations.
    \ It is intended to provide input\n   to the design of new congestion control
    methods in protocols, such as\n   IETF QUIC.\n\n   The present document is for
    discussion and comment by the IETF.  If\n   published, this plans to update the
    Best Current Practice in BCP 41,\n   which currently includes \"Congestion Control
    Principles\" provided in\n   RFC2914.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
