abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the protocol extension and procedure that are
    used to implement the fused service function chain. Fused service function chain
    means that two or more service function chains are fused to become a single service
    function chain from the view of data plane and control plane. Fused service function
    chain is a extension for service function chain.</p>"
