abstract:
- content: "<p>The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application
    to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner
    by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP
    service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own
    behalf. This specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described
    in RFC 5849. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
