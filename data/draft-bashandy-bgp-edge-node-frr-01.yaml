abstract:
- content: <p>Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the edge BGP speakers PE1,
    PE2,..., PEn know about a prefix P/p via the external routers CE1, CE2,..., CEm.
    If the edge router PEi crashes or becomes totally disconnected from the core,
    it desirable for a penultimate hop route "P" carrying traffic to the failed edge
    router PEi to immediately restore traffic by re-tunneling packets originally tunneled
    to PEi and destined to the prefix P/p to one of the other edge routers that advertised
    P/p, say PEj, until BGP re-converges. In doing so, it is highly desirable to keep
    the core BGP-free while not imposing restrictions on external connectivity. Thus
    (1) a core router should not be required to learn any BGP prefix, (2) the size
    of the forwarding and routing tables in the core routers should be independent
    of the number of BGP prefixes,(3) there should be no special router (or group
    of routers) that handles restoring traffic, and (4) there should be no restrictions
    on what edge routers advertise what prefixes. For labeled prefixes, (5) the penultimate
    hop router must swap the label advertised by the failed edge router PEi for the
    prefix P/p with the label advertised for the same prefix by the edge router PEj
    before re-tunneling the packet to PEj</p>
