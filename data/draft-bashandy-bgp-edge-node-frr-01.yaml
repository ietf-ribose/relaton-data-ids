abstract:
  content: <p>Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the edge BGP speakers PE1,PE2,...,
    PEn know about a prefix P/p via the external routers CE1,CE2,..., CEm. If the
    edge router PEi crashes or becomes totallydisconnected from the core, it desirable
    for a penultimate hop route"P" carrying traffic to the failed edge router PEi
    to immediatelyrestore traffic by re-tunneling packets originally tunneled to PEiand
    destined to the prefix P/p to one of the other edge routers thatadvertised P/p,
    say PEj, until BGP re-converges. In doing so, it ishighly desirable to keep the
    core BGP-free while not imposingrestrictions on external connectivity. Thus (1)
    a core router shouldnot be required to learn any BGP prefix, (2) the size of theforwarding
    and routing tables in the core routers should beindependent of the number of BGP
    prefixes,(3) there should be nospecial router (or group of routers) that handles
    restoring traffic,and (4) there should be no restrictions on what edge routersadvertise
    what prefixes. For labeled prefixes, (5) the penultimatehop router must swap the
    label advertised by the failed edge routerPEi for the prefix P/p with the label
    advertised for the same prefixby the edge router PEj before re-tunneling the packet
    to PEj</p>
