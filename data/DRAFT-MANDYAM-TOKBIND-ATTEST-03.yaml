abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Token binding allows HTTP servers to bind bearer tokens to
    TLS\n   connections.  In order to do this, clients or user agents must prove\n
    \  possession of a private key.  However, proof-of-possession of a\n   private
    key becomes truly meaningful to a server when accompanied by\n   an attestation
    statement.  This specification describes extensions to\n   the existing token
    binding protocol to allow for attestation\n   statements to be sent along with
    the related token binding messages.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
