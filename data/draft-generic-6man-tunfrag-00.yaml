abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the network.
    An exception to this requirement occurs when there is an IPv6/IPv4 protocol translator
    in the path, where in-the-network fragmentation may be unavoidable when the IPv4
    network path includes a restricting link. Unfortunately, recent investigations
    have shown that IPv6 Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) interacts poorly with tunnels
    to the point that tunneled packets can be best accommodated only when the tunnel
    ingress is permitted to perform fragmentation. This document therefore updates
    the IPv6 protocol specification to enable in-the-network fragmentation by routers
    that configure tunnel endpoints.</p>"
