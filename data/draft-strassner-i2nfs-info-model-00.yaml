abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an information model that defines the salient
    managed entities and their relationships in an Interface to Network Security Function
    (I2NSF) architecture. The information model is independent of platform, language,
    and protocol, and serves as a common consensual lexicon for the I2NFS architecture
    as well as clients using this architecture. This enables multiple application-
    specific data models (which are dependent on platform, language, and/or protocol)
    to be built from this information model. The advantage of doing so is to ensure
    that such data models will be able to share and reuse consensually defined concepts,
    thereby increasing interoperability.</p>"
