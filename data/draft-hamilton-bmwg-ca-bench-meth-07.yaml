abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to define a set of test scenarios which
    may be used to create a series of statistics that will help to better understand
    the performance of network devices that operate at nework layers above IP. More
    specifically, these scenarios are designed to most accurately predict performance
    of these devices when subjected to dynamic traffic patterns. This document will
    operate within the constraints of the Benchmarking Working Group charter, namely
    black box characterization in a laboratory environment.</p>"
