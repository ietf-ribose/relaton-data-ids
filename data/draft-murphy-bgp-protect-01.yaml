abstract:
  content: "\t <t>BGP, along with a host of other infrastructure protocols designed
    beforethe Internet environment became perilous, is designed with littleconsideration
    for protection of the information it carries. There areno mechanisms in BGP to
    protect against attacks that modify, delete,forge, or replay data, any of which
    has the potential to disrupt overallnetwork routing behavior.This internet draft
    discusses some of the security issues with BGProuting data dissemination, and
    possible security solutions and thecosts of those solutions. This internet draft
    does not discuss securityissues with forwarding of packets.</p>"
