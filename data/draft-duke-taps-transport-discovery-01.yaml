abstract:
- content: "<p>The Transport Services architecture decouples applications from the
    protocol implementations that transport their data. While it is often straightforward
    to connect applications with transports that are present in the host operating
    system, providing a means of discovering user-installed implementations dramatically
    enlarges the use cases. This document discusses considerations for the design
    of a discovery mechanism and an example of such a design. Discussion of this work
    is encouraged to happen on the TAPS IETF mailing list taps@ietf.org or on the
    GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/martinduke/draft-duke-taps-transport-
    discovery.</p>"
