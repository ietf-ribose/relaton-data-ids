abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In some inter-AS and inter-area deployment scenarios for LSP
    Ping and\n   Traceroute, a replying LSR may not have the available route to the\n
    \  initiator, and the Echo Reply message sent to the initiator would be\n   discarded
    resulting in false negatives or complete failure of\n   operation of LSP Ping
    and Traceroute.  This document describes\n   extensions to LSP Ping mechanism
    to enable the replying LSR to have\n   the capability to relay the echo response
    by a set of routable\n   intermediate nodes to the initiator during the traceroute
    process in\n   inter-AS and inter-area scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
