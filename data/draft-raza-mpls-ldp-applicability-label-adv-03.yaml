abstract:
- content: "<p>An LDP speaker negotiates the label advertisement mode with its LDP
    peer at the time of session establishment. Although different applications sharing
    the same LDP session may need different modes of label distribution and advertisement,
    there is only one type of label advertisement mode that is negotiated and used
    per LDP session. This document clarifies the use and the applicability of session's
    negotiated label advertisement mode, and categorizes LDP applications into two
    broad categories of negotiated mode-bound and mode-independent applications. The
    document also suggests an update to RFC 5036 and RFC 4447 to remove any ambiquity
    and conflict in the area of using correct label advertisement mode for a given
    application.</p>"
