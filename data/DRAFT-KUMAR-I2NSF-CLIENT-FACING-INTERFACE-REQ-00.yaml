abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a framework and information model for
    the\n   definition of northbound interfaces for a security controller.  The\n
    \  interfaces are based on user-intent instead of vendor-specific or\n   device-centric
    approaches that would require deep knowledge of vendor\n   products and their
    security features.  The document identifies the\n   common interfaces needed to
    enforce the user-intent based policies\n   onto network security functions (NSFs)
    irrespective of how those\n   functions are realized.  The function may be physical
    or virtual in\n   nature and may be implemented in networking or dedicated appliances.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
