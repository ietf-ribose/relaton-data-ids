abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the framework for Centralized Conferencing. The
    framework allows participants using various call signaling protocols, such as
    SIP, H.323, Jabber, Q.931 or ISDN User Part (ISUP), to exchange media in a centralized
    unicast conference. The Centralized Conferencing Framework defines logical entities
    and naming conventions. The framework also outlines a set of conferencing protocols,
    which are complementary to the call signaling protocols, for building advanced
    conferencing applications. The framework binds all the defined components together
    for the benefit of builders of conferencing systems. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
