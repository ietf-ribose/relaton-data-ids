abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>CELT is an open-source voice codec suitable for use in very low
    delay\naudio communication applications, including Voice over IP (VoIP).\nThis
    document describes the payload format for CELT generated bit\nstreams within an
    RTP packet.  Also included here are the necessary\ndetails for the use of CELT
    with the Session Description Protocol\n(SDP).  At the time of this writing, the
    CELT bit-stream has NOT been\nfinalized yet, and compatibility is usually broken
    with every new\nrelease of the codec.\n\t </p>\n      "
