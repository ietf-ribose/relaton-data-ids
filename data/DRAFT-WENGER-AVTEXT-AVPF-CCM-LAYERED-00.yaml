abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document fixes a shortcoming in the specification language
    of\n   the Codec Control Message Full Intra Request (FIR) as defined in\n   RFC5104
    when using with layered codecs.  In particular, a Decoder\n   Refresh Point needs
    to be sent by a media sender when a FIR is\n   received on any layer of the layered
    bitstream, regardless on whether\n   those layers are being sent in a single or
    in multiple RTP flows.\n   The other payload-specific feedback messages defined
    in RFC 5104 and\n   RFC 4585 as updated by RFC 5506 have also been analyzed, and
    no\n   corresponding shortcomings have been found.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
