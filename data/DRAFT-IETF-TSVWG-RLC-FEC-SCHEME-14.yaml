abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes two fully-specified Forward Erasure\n
    \  Correction (FEC) Schemes for Sliding Window Random Linear Codes\n   (RLC),
    one for RLC over the Galois Field (A.K.A.  Finite Field)\n   GF(2), a second one
    for RLC over the Galois Field GF(2^^8), each time\n   with the possibility of
    controlling the code density.  They can\n   protect arbitrary media streams along
    the lines defined by FECFRAME\n   extended to sliding window FEC codes, as defined
    in [fecframe-ext].\n   These sliding window FEC codes rely on an encoding window
    that slides\n   over the source symbols, generating new repair symbols whenever\n
    \  needed.  Compared to block FEC codes, these sliding window FEC codes\n   offer
    key advantages with real-time flows in terms of reduced FEC-\n   related latency
    while often providing improved packet erasure\n   recovery capabilities.\n\n\t
