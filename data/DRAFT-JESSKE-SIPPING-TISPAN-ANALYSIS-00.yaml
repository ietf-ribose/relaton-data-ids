abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document analyzes the requirements generated by ETSI to
    support \n   NGN simulation services implemented with SIP. The document analyzes
    \n   standard solutions that can meet the requirements. Where a standard \n   solution
    is not available, the document proposes one or more \n   solutions. The aim is
    to provoke discussion within the Internet \n   community and get early feedback.
