abstract:
  content: <p>This document describes how end users can become free from using zone
    identifiers for IPv6 link-local addresses. When users deal with IPv6 link-local
    addresses, it is thought that it is mandatory thing to specify accompanied zone
    identifiers. For end users, however, it is troublesome and nuisance thing to do
    it. Because it is very hard for normal end users to find appropriate zone identifiers
    for this purpose. From another viewpoint, the usage of IPv6 link-local addresses
    accompanied with zone identifiers is quite different from the usage of traditional
    global addresses, many problems are caused and new specifications are required
    to fix these problems. This document explores and describes a new mechanism that
    makes end users free from using zone identifiers for IPv6 link-local addresses.
    In order to achieve the mechanism, a new notion table that is called "Link-Local
    Route Cache" is introduced. This method is upper compatible with the current mechanism
    and harmless to the existing communications. By adding small improvement to neighbor
    discovery implementation, "Link-Local Route Cache" is easily implemented. With
    this method, end users will be released from using nuisance zone identifiers for
    IPv6 link-local addresses.</p>
