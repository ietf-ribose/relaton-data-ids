  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines new Transport Layer Security (TLS) Supported\n
    \  Groups to allow negotiation in TLS for encoding certain elliptic\n   curve
    public keys in a compressed form rather than the more verbose\n   method specified
    in [RFC8446] and [RFC8422].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
