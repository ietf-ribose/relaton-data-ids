abstract:
- content: "<p>The HASM system addresses some of the current limitations of end-to-end
    secure multicast. Specifically, the techniques used in HASM can achieve: (1) multiple
    autonomous administrative units, each with its own locally-managed authentication
    and authorization server, (2) efficiency in rekeying portions of a multicast group
    by using network elements to translate between keys (all without trusting any
    single network element to securely manage message text in the clear), and (3)
    defense against denial-of-service attacks by using a secure extension of IGMP.
    The HASM system makes use of (1) network support, including extensions to the
    Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), extended firewall functionality, and
    router support for encryption and decryption and (2) host operating system support,
    specifically extensions to IGMP.</p>"
