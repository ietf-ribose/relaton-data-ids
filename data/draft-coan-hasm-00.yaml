abstract:
  content: "<p>The HASM system addresses some of the current limitations ofend-to-end
    secure multicast. Specifically, the techniques used inHASM can achieve: (1) multiple
    autonomous administrative units, eachwith its own locally-managed authentication
    and authorization server,(2) efficiency in rekeying portions of a multicast group
    by usingnetwork elements to translate between keys (all without trusting anysingle
    network element to securely manage message text in the clear),and (3) defense
    against denial-of-service attacks by using a secureextension of IGMP. The HASM
    system makes use of (1) network support,including extensions to the Internet Group
    Management Protocol (IGMP),extended firewall functionality, and router support
    for encryption anddecryption and (2) host operating system support, specificallyextensions
    to IGMP.</p>"
