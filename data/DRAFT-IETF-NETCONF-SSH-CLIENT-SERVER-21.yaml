abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines three YANG modules: the first defines
    groupings\n   for a generic SSH client, the second defines groupings for a generic\n
    \  SSH server, and the third defines common identities and groupings\n   used
    by both the client and the server.  It is intended that these\n   groupings will
    be used by applications using the SSH protocol.\n\nEditorial Note (To be removed
