abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The protocol described in this document is designed to allow one
    \nLDAP server to replicate its directory content to another LDAP \nserver. The
    protocol is designed to be used in a replication \nconfiguration where multiple
    updateable servers are present. \nProvisions are made in the protocol to carry
    information that allows \nthe server receiving updates to apply a total ordering
    to all \nupdates in the replicated system. This total ordering allows all \nreplicas
    to correctly resolve conflicts that arise when LDAP clients \nsubmit changes to
    different servers that later replicate to one \nanother.\nAll protocol elements
    described here are LDAPv3 extended operations \nand controls. LDAPv3 is described
    in RFC 2251 [LDAPv3]. Some LDAPv3 \nextended operations and controls described
    here are LDAPv3 extended \noperations used to group related operations. The protocol
    elements \nused for grouping are described in LDAPv3: Grouping of Related \nOperations
    [GROUPING]. \nCertain terms used in this document are defined in the document
    \n'LDAP Replication Architecture' [ARCHITECTURE].\n\t </p>\n      "
