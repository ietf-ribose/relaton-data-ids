- content: "<p>As ALTO specification continues in the ALTO Working Group and some
    applications start to conduct integration with ALTO, more ISPs start to evaluate
    key issues in the deployment of ALTO in their networks. In this document, we discuss
    key issues that an ISP needs to consider when deploying ALTO. In particular, we
    discuss issues on how to configure ALTO information as well as how to monitor
    the effectiveness of ALTO.</p>"
