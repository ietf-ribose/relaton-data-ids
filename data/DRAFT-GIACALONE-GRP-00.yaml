abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a simple mechanism, termed gateway response\nprotocol
    (GRP), which permits hosts using Zero Configuration IPv4\nAddresses [1] to find
    and use a default gateway, thereby gaining\naccess to outside networks, including
    the Internet. GRP is fully\ncompliant with rules limiting Zero Configuration addresses
    to local\nnetworks and does not negate source/destination address assumptions.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
