abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes to advance a performance metric RFC along the standards
    track, specifically RFC 2679 on One-way Delay Metrics. Observing that the metric
    definitions themselves should be the primary focus rather than the implementations
    of metrics, this memo describes the test procedures to evaluate specific metric
    requirement clauses to determine if the requirement has been interpreted and implemented
    as intended. Two completely independent implementations have been tested against
    the key specifications of RFC 2679.</p>"
