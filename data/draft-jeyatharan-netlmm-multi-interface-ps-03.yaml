abstract:
  content: "<p>The specific mechanism described in the current PMIPv6 draft tosupport
    multihoming is such that a unique prefix is given to eachinterface of a Mobile
    Node (MN) that is attached to the PMIPv6domain. However, multihoming can also
    be provided using same uniqueprefix for all interfaces of MN similar to the MONAMI6
    (Mobile Nodesand Multiple Interfaces in IPv6) concept. This memo explores andhighlights
    lack of advanced multihoming support and other hand-offrelated issues where appropriate
    in three different mobilitymanagement protocol models for multiple interfaced
    mobile nodes.Firstly, when single prefix is allocated for all interfaces of MN
    inthe PMIPv6 domain. Secondly, when unique prefix is allocated foreach interface
    as in PMIPv6 standard protocol model. Thirdly, when amultiple interfaced node
    uses different mobility managementmechanisms for each of its interfaces.</p>"
