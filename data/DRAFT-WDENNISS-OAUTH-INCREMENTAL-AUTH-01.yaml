abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OAuth 2.0 authorization requests that include every scope the
    client\n   might ever need can result in over-scoped authorization and a sub-\n
    \  optimal end-user consent experience.  This specification enhances the\n   OAuth
    2.0 authorization protocol by adding incremental authorization,\n   the ability
    to request specific authorization scopes as needed, when\n   they're needed, removing
    the requirement to request every possible\n   scope that might be needed upfront.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
