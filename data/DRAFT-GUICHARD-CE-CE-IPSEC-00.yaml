abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a reference architecture that may be used
    to \ntightly integrate CE-CE [IPSec] encryption with the any-to-any \nconnectivity
    model of [RFC2547]. Using this mechanism, a Service \nProvider is able to provide
    an IP VPN service with data encryption \nbetween customer edge routers, but without
    the need of direct routing \nprotocol exchange, or IP-based tunnels such as provided
    by [GRE]. \n    \n\t </p>\n      "
