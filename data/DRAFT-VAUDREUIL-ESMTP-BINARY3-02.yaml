abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines two extensions to the SMTP service.  The first
    \nextension enables a SMTP client and server to negotiate the use of an \nalternative
    to the DATA command, called \"BDAT\", for efficiently \nsending large MIME messages.
    \ The second extension takes advantage of \nthe BDAT command to permit the negotiated
    sending of MIME messages \nthat employ the binary transfer encoding. This document
    is intended to \nobsolete RFC 3030. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
