abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
    records\n   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet\n
    \  traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document\n   discusses
    additional data fields and associated data types to be\n   added to the IOAM data
    fileds described in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].\n   In-situ OAM data fields can
    be encapsulated into a variety of\n   protocols such as NSH, Segment Routing,
    Geneve, IPv6 (via extension\n   header), or IPv4.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
