abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels (6to4-PMT) provide a framework
    which\n   can help manage 6to4 [RFC3056] tunnels operating in an anycast\n   [RFC3068]
    configuration.  The 6to4-PMT framework is intended to serve\n   as an option to
    operators to help improve the experience of 6to4\n   operation when conditions
    of the network may provide sub-optimal\n   performance or break normal 6to4 operation.
    6to4-PMT provides a\n   stable provider prefix and forwarding environment by utilizing\n
    \  existing 6to4 Relays with an added function of IPv6 Prefix\n   Translation.
    \ This operation may be particularly important in NAT444\n   infrastructures where
    a customer endpoint may be assigned a non-\n   RFC1918 address thus breaking the
    return path for anycast [RFC3068]\n   based 6to4 operation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
