abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes and discusses the textual encodings of the
    Public-Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX), Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS),
    and Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). The textual encodings are well-known,
    are implemented by several applications and libraries, and are widely deployed.
    This document is intended to articulate the de-facto rules that existing implementations
    operate by, and to give recommendations that will promote interoperability.</p>"
