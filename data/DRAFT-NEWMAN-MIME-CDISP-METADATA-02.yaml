abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     The Content-Disposition [CDISP] header defines two disposition\n
    \    types:  ``inline'' and ``attachment'' which can affect presentation\n     of
    a MIME [MIME-IMB] body part.  There have been a number of cases\n     where one
    MIME body part is ancillary or contains meta-data for\n     another MIME body
    part and is neither suitable for inline display\n     by itself, nor is it useful
    if treated as an independent attachment\n     and saved to a file by itself.  If
    the recipient UA is not familiar\n     with the specific media type, the user
    often is presented with a\n     useless unrecognizable attachment.  This memo
    proposes a third\n     disposition type, ``ancillary'', to address this situation.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
