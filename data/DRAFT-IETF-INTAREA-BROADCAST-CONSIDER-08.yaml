abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A number of application-layer protocols make use of IP broadcasts
    or\n   multicast messages for functions like local service discovery or name\n
    \  resolution.  Some of these functions can only be implemented\n   efficiently
    using such mechanisms.  When using broadcasts or\n   multicast messages, a passive
    observer in the same broadcast/\n   multicast domain can trivially record these
    messages and analyze\n   their content.  Therefore, designers of protocols that
    make use\n   broadcast/multicast messages need to take special care when designing\n
    \  their protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
