abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo introduces new header fields for use in Internet email,
    to\nallow the author of a message to specify primary (To) and secondary (Cc)\nrecipients
    who, in the author's opinion, should not be recipients of a\nreply to the message.
    \ These new fields are designed to be highly\ncompatible with pre-existing mail
    handling programs, and to facilitate a\ngraceful transition.\n\nIf this document
    is favorably received, it is the author's intent to\nsubmit this document (as
    an individual submission) for consideration for\nProposed Standard status.  Unless
    IESG directs otherwise, public\ndiscussion of this document should be on the ietf-822@imc.org
    mailing\nlist.  Comments may also be sent to the author.\n\t </p>\n      "
