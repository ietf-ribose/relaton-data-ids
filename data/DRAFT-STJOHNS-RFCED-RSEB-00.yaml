abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a revised model for the management,
    evolution\n   and improvement of the RFC Series led by an RFC Series Editor (RSE)\n
    \  assisted by an RFC Series Editorial Board (RSEB).  The model removes\n   the
    IAB and its appointed RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC) from\n   direct control
    of the RFC Series and the RFC Series Editor, replacing\n   them on the publication
    evolution side with the RSEB, and on the\n   financial and personnel management
    side with the IETF Administration\n   Limited Liability Company or its board as
    appropriate (LLC).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
