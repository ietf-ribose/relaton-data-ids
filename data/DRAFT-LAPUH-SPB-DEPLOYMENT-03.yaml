abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Based on many live deployments, including the Sochi Winter
    Olympics\n   2014 network and multiple interoperability events, this document
    has\n   been created to provide advice to network operators about best\n   practices
    when implementing IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB)\n   networks. It is
    principally addressed to system integrators, network\n   operators and solution
    providers, including those that do not yet\n   support SPB. Some advice to protocol
    implementers is also provided.\n   The intention of the advice is to facilitate
    multi vendor network\n   deployments as well as provide guidance for new installations.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
