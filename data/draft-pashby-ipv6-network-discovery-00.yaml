abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the draft is to provide mechanisms to discover all nodes
    and addresses on an IPv6 network. Network discovery is a key to network management
    and network security. In IPv4 the most effective way to discover what devices
    were attached to the network was to walk the entire network address space. While
    this was easily done in IPv4, it is impossible in IPv6, due to the large range
    of addresses on a network. Currently there is no effective way to discover the
    nodes on an IPv6 network. This document describes the changes that need to be
    made to allow for discovering nodes on an IPv6 network.</p>"
