abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines DHCP Relay Agent based prefix delegation\nsupport
    for a mobile network.  Mobile Router uses DHCPv6 prefix\ndelegation to dynamically
    request its Mobile Network Prefixes from\nDHCP Server.  DHCP Relay Agent located
    in MR enables MR to run the\nprefix delegation application with the same DHCP
    Server even after MR\nmoves to a different local network.\n\t </p>\n      "
