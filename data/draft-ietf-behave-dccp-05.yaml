abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of requirements for NATs handling the Datagram
    Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP). These requirements allow DCCP applications,
    such as streaming applications, to operate consistently, and they are very similar
    to the TCP requirements for NATs, which have already been published by the IETF.
    Ensuring that NATs meet this set of requirements will greatly increase the likelihood
    that applications using DCCP will function properly. This document specifies an
    Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
