abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Time-Scheduled reservation of traffic engineering (TE) resources
    can\n   be used to provide resource booking for TE Label Switched Paths so as\n
    \  to better guarantee services for customers and to improve the\n   efficiency
    of network resource usage into the future.  This document\n   provides a framework
    that describes and discusses the architecture\n   for the scheduled reservation
    of TE resources.  This document does\n   not describe specific protocols or protocol
    extensions needed to\n   realize this service.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
