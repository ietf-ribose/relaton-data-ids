abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an HTTP authentication scheme for use
    when\ncredentials are validated by an out-of-band mechanism (not defined\nhere)
    and later communicated to the server through the use of a\ncookie.  Which out-of-band
    mechanism should be used, and how, is\ndescribed by the 401 (Unauthorized) response
    body.  It is common\npractice that this mechanism is an HTML form, sending the
    user's\ncredentials with the use of an HTTP POST request to a tier URL which\nwill
    set a cookie in response; though this document doesn't preclude\nthe use of other
    mechanisms.\n\t </p>\n      "
