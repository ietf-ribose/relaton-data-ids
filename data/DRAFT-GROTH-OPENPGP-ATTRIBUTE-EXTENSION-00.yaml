abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A RFC was accepted extending TLS usage to include OpenPGP keys
    (RFC\n5081) as an alternative or in addition to X.509 certificates,\nhowever the
    author did not really standardise the way the\ninformation in OpenPGP keys was
    to be presented and this could be\ndetrimental or fragment efforts to utilise
    OpenPGP keys in this\nmanner.\n\nThe author didn't touch on the issue generating
    confidence scores\nbeyond potential use of Certificate Authorities.\n\t </p>\n
