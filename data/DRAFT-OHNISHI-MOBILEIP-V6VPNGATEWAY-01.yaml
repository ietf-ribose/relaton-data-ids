abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IPv6 [Mobile IPv6] provides mobility functions for IPv6.
    \ It\ncan also be used for public mobility services.  One of the most\nimportant
    services is the VPN service enabling users to access their\nIntranets from outside.
    \ Mobile IP does not work well with VPN,\nhowever, and this issue is being discussed
    in the Mobile IP WG [VPN\nproblem].  This document proposes a simple mechanism
    that combines\nVPN and Mobile IP functions. This mechanism uses a hierarchical
    HA\narchitecture and includes an HA with GW functions, called a Gateway\nHome
    Agent (GHA).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
