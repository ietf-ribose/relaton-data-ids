abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TLS session tickets enable stateless connection resumption
    for\n   clients without server-side, per-client, state.  Servers vend an\n   arbitrary
    number of session tickets to clients, at their discretion,\n   upon connection
    establishment.  Clients store and use tickets when\n   resuming future connections.
    \ This document describes a mechanism by\n   which clients can specify the desired
    number of tickets needed for\n   future connections.  This extension aims to provide
    a means for\n   servers to determine the number of tickets to generate in order
    to\n   reduce ticket waste, while simultaneously priming clients for future\n
    \  connection attempts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
