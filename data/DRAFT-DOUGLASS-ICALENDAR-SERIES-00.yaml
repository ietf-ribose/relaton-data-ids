abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification updates [RFC5545] by defining a new repeating
    set\n   of events known as a series.  This differs from recurrences in that\n
    \  each instance is a separate entity with a parent relationship to a\n   specified
    template entity.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
