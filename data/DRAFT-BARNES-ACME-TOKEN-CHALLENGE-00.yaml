abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an identifier and challenge type required
    to\n   enable the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) to\n   issue
    certificates using a token for the challenge response.  This\n   token is issued
    by a administrative authority with whom the\n   Certification Authority (CA) has
    a trust relationship.  The entity\n   requesting a certificate also has a relationship
    with the\n   administrative authority, such that the administrative authority\n
    \  assigns a unique code to the entity.  This entity code is included as\n   part
    of the token that the administrative authority issues.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
