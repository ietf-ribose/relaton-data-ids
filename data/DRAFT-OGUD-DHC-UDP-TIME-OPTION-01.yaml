abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many small inexpensive computing devices like home routers,
    Rasberry\n   Pi etc. do not have a battery to allow clock chip to keep track of\n
    \  time, thus the systems have no idea what the current time is upon\n   boot.
    \ Number of modern services take Time Synchronization for\n   granted, but operating
    systems do not allow the start of these\n   services to be deferred until after
    accurate clock has been\n   confirmed.\n\n   NTP provides accurate fine grain
    clock synchronization but in order\n   for NTP to succeed DNS needs to work.  DNSSEC
    resolvers will fail if\n   system clock is off by more than little bit.  This
    draft proposes a\n   mechanism to offer \"reasonable\" current time to devices
    upon boot via\n   DHCP, DHCPv6 and ND.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
