    application software distributors to work jointly andcooperatively to optimize
    application communications. The goals ofthis cooperation are to reduce network
    resource consumption and toaccelerate network applications. In this document,
    we specify howP4P allows ISPs to provide network guidance to applications, allowingclients
    to exchange data more effectively. The applications we focuson are those that
