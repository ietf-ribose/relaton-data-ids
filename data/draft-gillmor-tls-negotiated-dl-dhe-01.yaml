abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditional discrete logarithm-based Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange
    during the TLS handshake suffers from a number of security, interoperability,
    and efficiency shortcomings. These shortcomings arise from lack of clarity about
    which DH group parameters TLS servers should offer and clients should accept.
    This document offers a solution to these shortcomings for compatible peers by
    establishing a registry of DH parameters with known structure and a mechanism
    for peers to indicate support for these groups.</p>"
