abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes and discusses the textual encodings
    of the\n   Public-Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX), Public-Key Cryptography\n   Standards
    (PKCS), and Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).  The\n   textual encodings are
    well-known, are implemented by several\n   applications and libraries, and are
    widely deployed.  This document\n   is intended to articulate the de-facto rules
    that existing\n   implementations operate by, and to give recommendations that
    will\n   promote interoperability.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
