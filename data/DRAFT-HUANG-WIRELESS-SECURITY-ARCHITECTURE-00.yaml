abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     After analysis and comparison of domestic and international
    \ \n     wireless network secure schemes and standards, security threats  \n     for
    heterogeneous wireless network are investigated in theory and \n     practice.
    According to the comprehensive summing-up of current  \n     secure standards'
    application, existing secure vulnerabilities and \n     secure hidden troubles
    which may happen in future, \"network \n     layered,security classified and trusted
    domain departed\" secure \n     standard model is proposed, and corresponding
    standards for \n     heterogeneous wireless network security architecture are
    also put \n     forward. \n\t </p>\n      "
