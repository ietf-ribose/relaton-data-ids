abstract:
- content: "<p>The pseudowire (PW) encapsulation of Ethernet, as defined in RFC4448,
    specifies that the use of the control word (CW) is optional. In the absence of
    the CW an Ethernet pseudowire packet can be misidentified as an IP packet by a
    label switching router (LSR). This in turn may lead to the selection of the wrong
    equal-cost-multi-path (ECMP) path for the packet, leading in turn to the misordering
    of packets. This problem has become more serious due to the deployment of equipment
    with Ethernet MAC addresses that start with 0x4 or 0x6. The use of the Ethernet
    PW CW addresses this problem. This document recommends the use of the Ethernet
    pseudowire control word in all but exceptional circumstances. This document updates
    RFC4448.</p>"
