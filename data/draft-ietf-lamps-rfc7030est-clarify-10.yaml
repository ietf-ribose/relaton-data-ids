    resolve some errata that were reported and that have proven to cause interoperability
    issues when RFC 7030 was extended. This document deprecates the specification
    of "Content-Transfer-Encoding" headers for Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST)
    endpoints. This document fixes some syntactical errors in ASN.1 that were present.</p>'
