abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to achieve further slicing or traffic
    engineering\n   interoperability between vendors without the use of SRH.\n\n   Slicing
    or traffic engineering information is encapsulated as part of the SRv6 SID.\n
    \  Use of IP longest prefix match approach to identify the further slicing via
    sub-\n   slice identifier.\n\n   The traffic engineering from one end to another
    end is seen as segment by segment\n   approach. This approach could solve the
    scalability of traffic engineering tunnels\n   required in a huge network, which
    order of N^2 has be considered.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
