- content: "<p>This document describes MIME types as per the rules defined in RFC
    2048 [2] for application/SCCP and application/TCAP objects, for use in SIP applications.
    These MIME definitions will be typically used in deployments where interworking
    to the PSTN is required for call related and non-call related messages exchanged
    using services of SCCP and TCAP SS7 stack layers.</p>"
