abstract:
- content: "<p>Network level security bootstrapping and joining device level security
    bootstrapping mechanisms are described in this document. They are proposed for
    security bootstrapping of the Internet of Things networks, which implement IETF
    protocols (e.g. 6LoWPAN, 6lo, RPL, AODV, DSR) over IEEE 802.15.4. The network
    level security bootstrapping is useful at the very beginning of a newly deployed
    IoT network. It automatically and hierarchically adds all the devices to security
    domain and helps establish security communication. The joining device level security
    bootstrapping provides comprehensive mechanism for different IoT devices joining
    an existing IoT network.</p>"
