abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This note surveys the existing designs for Key Derivation Functions(KDFs),
    the purposes for which they are used, and their security andusability goals. Importantly,
    some important protocols use KDFs formultiple purposes. We offer conclusions to
    guide future standardswork and research on KDFs.</p>"
