abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to MPLS signaling required to support
    Generalized MPLS. Generalized MPLS extends MPLS to encompass time-division (e.g.
    SONET ADMs), wavelength (optical lambdas) and spatial switching (e.g. incoming
    port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber). This document presents a functional
    description of the extensions. Protocol specific formats and mechanisms are currently
    included in this draft but are expected to be split out into separate, per protocol
    documents.</p>"
