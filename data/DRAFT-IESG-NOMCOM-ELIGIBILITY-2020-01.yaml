abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The 2020-2021 Nominating Committee (NomCom) needs to be formed\n
    \  between IETF 107 and IETF 108, and the issue of eligibility of who\n   can
    serve on that NomCom needs clarification.  This document provides\n   a one-time
    interpretation of the eligibility rules that is required\n   for the exceptional
    situation of the cancellation of the in-person\n   IETF 107 meeting.  This document
    only affects the seating of the\n   2020-2021 NomCom and any rules that relate
    to NomCom eligibility or\n   process before IETF 108, and does not set a precedent
    for the future.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
