abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of privacy considerations related
    to user IP addresses. It includes an analysis of some current use cases for tracking
    of user IP addresses, mainly in the context of anti-abuse. It discusses the privacy
    issues associated with such tracking and provides input on mechanisms to improve
    the privacy of this existing model. It then captures requirements for proposed
    'replacement signals' for IP addresses from this analysis. In addition, existing
    and under-development techniques are evaluated for fulfilling these requirements.</p>"
