abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Flex Ethernet (FlexE) technology, which is defined by Optical\n
    \  Internetworking Forum (OIF), is a new kind of data plane technology\n   and
    can be used to provides a generic mechanism for supporting a\n   variety of Ethernet
    MAC rates that may or may not correspond to any\n   existing Ethernet PHY rate.
    \ This includes MAC rates that are greater\n   than (through bonding) and less
    than (through sub-rate and\n   channelization) the standard Ethernet PHY rates.\n\n
    \  Based on the applications/use cases given in the Flex Ethernet\n   Implementation
    Agreement [FlexE-IA], this document defines a\n   framework and control plane
    requirements for the application of\n   existing GMPLS architecture and control
    plane protocols to the\n   control of flexible Ethernet network.  The actual extensions
    to the\n   GMPLS protocols will be defined in companion documents.\n\n\t </p>\n
