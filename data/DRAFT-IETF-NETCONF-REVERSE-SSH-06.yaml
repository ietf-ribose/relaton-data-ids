abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a technique for a NETCONF server to
    request\n   that a NETCONF client initiates a SSH connection to the NETCONF\n
    \  server, a technique referred to as 'call home'.  Call home is needed\n   to
    support deployments where the NETCONF client is otherwise unable\n   to initiate
    a SSH connection to the NETCONF server directly.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
