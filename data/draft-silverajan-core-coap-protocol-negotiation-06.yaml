abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP has been standardised as an application-level REST-based protocol.
    When multiple transport protocols exist for exchanging CoAP resource representations,
    this document introduces a way forward for CoAP endpoints as well as intermediaries
    to agree upon alternate transport and protocol configurations as well as URIs
    for CoAP messaging. 2 mechanisms are proposed: The first by extending the CoRE
    Resource Directory with new parameter types and the second, by introducing a new
    CoAP Option with which clients can interact directly with servers without needing
    the Resource Directory.</p>"
