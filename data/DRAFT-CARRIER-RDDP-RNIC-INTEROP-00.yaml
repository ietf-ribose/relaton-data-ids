abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism for enabling RDMA Network
    \n   Interface Cards (RNICs) that implement both the IETF and RDMAC \n   versions
    of the DDP and RDMAP protocols to interoperate with legacy \n   RNICs that are
    based on the RDMAC version of the protocols.  The \n   proposed scheme uses MPA
    Request/Reply Frames to negotiate the \n   protocol version as well as MPA marker
    and MPA CRC.  A ULP or other \n   supporting entity must perform this negotiation
    on behalf of the \n   RDMAC RNIC because RDMAC MPA does not define an MPA connection
    \n   scheme using MPA Request/Reply frames. This draft also makes \n   specific
    recommendations for minor changes to the IETF MPA, DDP, and \n   RDMAP internet
    drafts to aid in interoperability.\n\t </p>\n      "
