abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbor discovery options, in addition to being used for Neighbor
    Discovery, are used to convey some forms of network configuration information
    to the hosts attached to a network. Some centrally managed networks, that do not
    wish to configure their routers to advertise these pieces of information, might
    use a DHCP server to configure there parameters. This document defines a generic
    DHCP option for carrying these parameters.</p>"
