abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines
    a\n   common XML format for document exchange, and Realtime Internetwork\n   Defense
    (RID) defines extensions to IODEF intended for the\n   cooperative handling of
    security incidents within consortia of\n   network operators and enterprises.
    \ This document specifies a\n   transport protocol for RID based upon the passing
    of RID messages\n   over HTTP/TLS.  This document updates the previous [RFC6046]
    to\n   change the intended status to Proposed Standard, and to reference the\n
    \  updated RID specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
