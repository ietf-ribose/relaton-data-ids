abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a flexible protocol that
    can be used in a wide range of applications, networks, and system topologies.
    That flexibility makes for wide applicability but can complicate the application
    design process. One particular design question that has received much attention
    is how to support multiple media streams in RTP. This memo discusses the available
    options and design trade-offs, and provides guidelines on how to use the multiplexing
    features of RTP to support multiple media streams.</p>"
