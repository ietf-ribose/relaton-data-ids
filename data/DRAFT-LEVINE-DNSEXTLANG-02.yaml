abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Adding new RRTYPEs to the DNS requires that DNS servers and\n
    \  provisioning software be upgraded to support each new RRTYPE in\n   Master
    files.  This document defines a DNS extension language\n   intended to allow most
    new RRTYPEs to be supported by adding a line\n   to a configuration file read
    by the DNS software, with no changed\n   software.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
