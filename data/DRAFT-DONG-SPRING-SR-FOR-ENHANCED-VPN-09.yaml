abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the mechanism to associate network
    resource\n   attributes to Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs).  Such SIDs are\n
    \  referred to as resource-aware SIDs in this document.  The resource-\n   aware
    SIDs retain their original forwarding semantics, but with the\n   additional semantics
    to identify the set of network resources\n   available for the packet processing
    action.  The resource-aware SIDs\n   can therefore be used to build SR paths with
    a set of reserved\n   network resources.  In addition, the resource-aware SIDs
    can also be\n   used to build SR based virtual networks, which provide the network\n
    \  topology and resource attributes required by customers or services.\n   The
    proposed mechanism is applicable to both segment routing with\n   MPLS data plane
    (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane\n   (SRv6).\n\n\n\t </p>\n
