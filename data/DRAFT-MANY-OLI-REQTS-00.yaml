abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The emergence of transparent optical switches, together with a
    \nmovement towards more dynamic, multi-vendor networks, has introduced \na need
    for information sharing between optical line systems and \nclient devices.  The
    information that needs to be shared includes \nlink status and link properties.
    \ We call this interface the Optical \nLink Interface (OLI).  In this document,
    we provide high-level \nrequirements for the OLI. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
