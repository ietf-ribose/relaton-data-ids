  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Link-Local addresses can be used by applications.  Doing
    so when\n   possible will provide robustness and security benefits to the\n   application.
    \ This memo describes the properties of Link-Local\n   addresses and the benefits
    and limitations of using them in\n   applications.  It then describes how to use
    them in applications that\n   use the Sockets API.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
