abstract:
  content: "<p>For domains sending or receiving mail, there is often a desire to publish
    policies indicating types of mail sent or accepted, and to specify the collateral
    Mail Channel to assist in these policies. The challenge is to allow the recipient
    a deterministic means for obtaining this information, while not creating additional
    burdens for normal mail use.</p>"
