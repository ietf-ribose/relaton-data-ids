abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This work derives itself from [1] which proposes a ECMP redirect
    from\n   a PIM upstream neighbor that instructs or advices the PIM downstream\n
    \  neighbor to choose another of its own ECMP links between the former\n   and
    the latter. What we propose in this document is a criterion based\n   on power
    consumed in the linecards that comprise the ECMP links\n   between the former
    and the latter. Also the multicast replication\n   capacity available within the
    said linecards which form the ECMP\n   links between the two is taken into consideration
    while making a ECMP\n   redirect.\n\n   A PIM router uses RPF procedure to select
    an upstream interface and\n   router to build forwarding state.  When there are
    equal cost multiple\n   paths (ECMP), existing implementations often use hash
    algorithms to\n   select a path.  Such algorithms do not allow the spread of traffic\n
    \  among the ECMPs according to administrative metrics.  This usually\n   leads
    to inefficient or ineffective use of network resources.  This\n   document introduces
    the ECMP Redirect, a mechanism to improve the RPF\n   procedure over ECMPs.  It
    allows ECMP path selection to be based on\n   administratively selected metrics,
    such as data transmission delays,\n   path preferences and routing metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t
