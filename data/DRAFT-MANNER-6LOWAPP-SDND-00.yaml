abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Finding out functionality, nodes or services, in general resources,\nin
    a network has a number of well-known solutions.  A sensor network\nhas inherent
    limitations and requires a solution that has a low\nfootprint and follows the
    networking concepts defined within 6LoWPAN.\nThis draft discusses two alternative
    solutions to service discovery\nin a sensor network.  Both approaches are based
    on the 6LowPAN\nNeighbor Discovery.\n\t </p>\n      "
