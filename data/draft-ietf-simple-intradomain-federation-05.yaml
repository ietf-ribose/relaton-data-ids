abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Presence and Instant Messaging (IM) bridging involves the sharing
    ofpresence information and exchange of IM across multiple systemswithin a single
    domain. As such, it is a close cousin to presenceand IM federation, which involves
    the sharing of presence and IMacross differing domains. Presence and IM bridging
    can be the resultof a multi-vendor network, or a consequence of a large organizationthat
    requires partitioning. This document examines different usecases and models for
    intra-domain presence and IM bridging. It ismeant to provide a framework for defining
    requirements andspecifications for presence and IM bridging. The document assumesSIP
    as the underlying protocl but many of the modles can fit otherprotocols as well.</p>"
