abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a protocol extension to RPL that enables
    to\n   install a limited amount of centrally-computed routes in a RPL graph,\n
    \  enabling loose source routing down a non-storing mode DODAG, or\n   transversal
    routes inside the DODAG.  As opposed to the classical\n   route injection by DAO
    messages, this draft projects the routes from\n   the root of the DODAG.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
