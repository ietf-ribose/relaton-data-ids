abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocol\nuses
    a core-based tree to forward multicast datagrams to members of\na multicast group.
    Currently there is no method for relocating the\ncore or Rendezvous Point (RP)
    for a group. Administratively chosen\nRP's lead to low performance as the sources
    and receivers in the\nmulticast group join and leave the group.\nThis draft presents
    a mechanism for dynamically relocating the RP to\na position that minimizes the
    tree cost and improves performance.\n\t </p>\n      "
