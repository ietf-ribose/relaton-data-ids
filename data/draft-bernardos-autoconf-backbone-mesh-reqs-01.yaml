abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This Internet Draft presents the multi-hop Backbone Wireless MeshNetwork
    scenario, summarising its basic characteristics anddescribing the requirements
    and desired properties of an IPAutoconfiguration mechanism aimed at being used
    in this kind ofnetworks.Once that the AUTOCONF WG has almost finalised the documents
    thatdescribe the general architecture of MANETs and the IPautoconfiguration problem
    statement in MANETs, the WG is expected tostart working on solutions. This document
    describes an ad-hocscenario that is getting a lot of attention from bothtelecommunication
    operators and end-users: Backbone/infrastructureWireless Mesh Networking. This
    document identifies and explains therequirements posed by this particular scenario
    to an IPautoconfiguration mechanism. The goal is to help the AUTOCONF WGidentify
    the requirements that need to be taken into account whendesigning IP autoconfiguration
    solution(s) suitable for this WirelessMesh environment.</p>"
