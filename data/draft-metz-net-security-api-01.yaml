abstract:
- content: "<p>This API is a means for sockets applications to request network security
    services from an operating system. It is designed to move most of the work and
    intelligence of security policy processing into the operating system so that the
    burden on application authors is light enough to encourage the use of network
    security. It is documented here for the benefit of others who might also adopt
    and use the API, thus providing increased portability of applications that use
    network security services (e.g., the IP Security ESP and AH protocols).</p>"
