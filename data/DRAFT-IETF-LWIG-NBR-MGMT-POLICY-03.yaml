abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the problems associated with neighbor
    cache\n   management in multihop networks involving resource-constrained\n   devices.
    \ Thereafter, it also presents a sample neighbor management\n   policy that allows
    efficient cache management in multihop LLNs (low-\n   power and lossy networks
    such as LoWPAN) with resource-constrained\n   devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
