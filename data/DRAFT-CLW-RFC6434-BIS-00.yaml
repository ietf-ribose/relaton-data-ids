abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines requirements for IPv6 nodes.  It is expected\n
    \  that IPv6 will be deployed in a wide range of devices and situations.\n   Specifying
    the requirements for IPv6 nodes allows IPv6 to function\n   well and interoperate
    in a large number of situations and\n   deployments.\n\n   This document obsoletes
    RFC 6434, and in turn RFC 4294.\n\n   NB.  This is a first -00 version of the
    update to RFC 6434.  We have\n   not yet edited original text from RFC 6434 apart
    from the author and\n   acknowledgement texts, which carry forward from the older
    versions.\n\n   We have indicated intended changes (additions, updates or deletion
    of\n   text at a high level in the sections below with text delimited by\n   **BIS
    ... ** comments, e.g.\n\n   **BIS Add discussion of the impact of RFC xxxx **\n\n
    \  **BIS Update reference of RFC 3484 and note new address selection\n   implications**\n\n
    \  etc.  These will become edits in future versions once the substance\n   of
    the changes is agreed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
