abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Intermediary Rule Markup Language (IRML) [2] is an XML-based
    \nlanguage that can be used to describe service-specific execution \nrules for
    network edge intermediaries under the Open Pluggable Edge \nServices (OPES) framework,
    as described in [3] and [4].  This memo \nillustrates examples of employing the
    IRML for Quality of Service \n(QoS) policing and control, and proposes a QoS sub-system
    extension \nto IRML for better QoS support in the OPES framework.\n\t </p>\n      "
