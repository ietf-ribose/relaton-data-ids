abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are many issues concerning the deployment and implementation,\nand
    to a lesser degree, specification of IPv6 multicast.  This memo\ndescribes known
    problems, trying to raise awareness.  Currently,\nglobal IPv6 interdomain multicast
    is completely impossible except\nusing SSM: there is no way to convey information
    about multicast\nsources between PIM RPs. Site-scoped multicast is also problematic\nwhen
    used alongside to global multicast because of that.  A few\npossible solutions
    are outlined or referred to.  In addition, an\nissue regarding link-local multicast-blocking
    Ethernet switches is\nbrought up.  Finally, a feature request for MLD snooping
    switches is\nnoted.\n\t </p>\n      "
