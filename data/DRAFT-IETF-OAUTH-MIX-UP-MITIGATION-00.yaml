abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines an extension to The OAuth 2.0\n
    \  Authorization Framework that enables the authorization server to\n   dynamically
    provide the client using it with additional information\n   about the current
    protocol interaction that can be validated by the\n   client and that enables
    the client to dynamically provide the\n   authorization server with additional
    information about the current\n   protocol interaction that can be validated by
    the authorization\n   server.  This additional information can be used by the
    client and\n   the authorization server to prevent classes of attacks in which
    the\n   client might otherwise be tricked into using inconsistent sets of\n   metadata
    from multiple authorization servers, including potentially\n   using a token endpoint
    that does not belong to the same authorization\n   server as the authorization
    endpoint used.  Recent research\n   publications refer to these as \"IdP Mix-Up\"
    and \"Malicious Endpoint\"\n   attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
