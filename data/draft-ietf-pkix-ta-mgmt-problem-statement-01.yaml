abstract:
  content: "<p>A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a publickey
    and associated data. The public key is used to verify digitalsignatures and the
    associated data is used to constrain the types ofinformation for which the trust
    anchor is authoritative. A relyingparty uses trust anchors to determine if a digitally
    signed object isvalid by verifying a digital signature using the trust anchor'spublic
    key, and by enforcing the constraints expressed in theassociated data for the
    trust anchor. This document describes someof the problems associated with the
    lack of a standard trust anchormanagement mechanism as well as problems that must
    be addressed bysuch a mechanism. This document discusses only public keys as trustanchors;
    symmetric key trust anchors are not considered.</p>"
