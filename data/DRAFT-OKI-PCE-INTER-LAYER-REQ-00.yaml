abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path
    \ncomputation in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label \nSwitching
    (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. \n    \nMPLS and GMPLS networks
    may be constructed from layered service \nnetworks. It is advantageous for overall
    network efficiency to \nprovide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple
    network layers. \nPCE is a candidate solution for such requirements. \n    \nGeneric
    requirements for a communication protocol between Path \nComputation Clients (PCCs)
    and PCEs are presented in \"PCE \nCommunication Protocol Generic Requirements\".
    This document \ncomplements the generic requirements and presents a detailed set
    of \nPCC-PCE communication protocol requirements for inter-layer traffic \nengineering.
