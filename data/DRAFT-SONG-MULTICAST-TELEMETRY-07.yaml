abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the requirement of on-path telemetry
    for\n   multicast traffic.  The existing solutions are examined and their\n   issues
    are identified.  Solution modifications are proposed to allow\n   the original
    multicast tree to be correctly reconstructed without\n   unnecessary replication
    of telemetry information.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
