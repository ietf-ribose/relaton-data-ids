abstract:
- content: "<p>A YANG device profile is primarily a group of YANG models that are
    appropriate for use with a particular class of device or in specific device roles.
    This document provides background and describes the rationale for a baseline data
    center switch device profile, e.g., for top-of-rack switches in data center converged
    infrastructure. This rationale is based on the reuse of YANG models by the DMTF
    Redfish standard for management of converged infrastructure, but the resulting
    YANG device profile is intended to be useable by any YANG- based network management
    approach or protocol, as opposed to being specific to Redfish.</p>"
