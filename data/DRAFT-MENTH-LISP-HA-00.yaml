abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Hybrid access (HA) allows simultaneous usage of multiple access\n
    \  links.  Advantages are increased bandwidth and improved resilience.\n   This
    document presents LISP Hybrid Access (LISP-HA), a mechanism to\n   provide HA
    based on LISP technology.  The document discusses\n   potential changes needed
    to perform dynamic load-balancing and per\n   packet load-balancing, which both
    increase the efficiency of HA.  To\n   that end, modified usage of some fields
    in the LISP header is\n   proposed.  Discussed use cases include the bundling
    of multiple\n   access technologies for mobile devices and residential access\n
    \  routers.  Additionally, we provide some considerations how LISP-HA\n   can
    be deployed by providers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
