abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is maintained in order to publish all necessary\n
    \  information needed to develop interoperable applications based on the\n   OpenPGP
    format.  It is not a step-by-step cookbook for writing an\n   application.  It
    describes only the format and methods needed to\n   read, check, generate, and
    write conforming packets crossing any\n   network.  It does not deal with storage
    and implementation questions.\n   It does, however, discuss implementation issues
    necessary to avoid\n   security flaws.\n\n   OpenPGP software uses a combination
    of strong public-key and\n   symmetric cryptography to provide security services
    for electronic\n   communications and data storage.  These services include\n
    \  confidentiality, key management, authentication, and digital\n   signatures.
    \ This document specifies the message formats used in\n   OpenPGP.\n\n\t </p>\n
