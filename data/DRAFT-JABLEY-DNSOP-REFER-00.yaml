abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Domain Name System (DNS) incorporates a namespace that
    is\n   comprised, in practice, of multiple so-called zones.  Each zone is,\n   in
    principal, a finite tree structure which can be administered\n   autonomously,
    and is connected to exactly one parent zone and zero or\n   more child zones.
    \ These connection points are known as zone cuts; a\n   parent zone contains information
    that allows the servers responsible\n   for the child zone to be found.\n\n   The
    current DNS specification encodes that information about child\n   zones using
    an \"NS\" resource record set in the parent zone, and a\n   corresponding \"NS\"
    resource record set in the child zone.  These two\n   resource record sets have
    identical owner names, class, and resource\n   record type but can differ in other
    respects such as the time-to-live\n   (TTL) attribute, the resource record data
    associated with each set\n   and the availability of cryptographic signatures.
    \ This property of\n   being similar, related but potentially different has led
    to\n   operational complexity.\n\n   This document proposes a change to how zone
    cuts are encoded in the\n   parent zone, allowing the resource records in the
    parent and the\n   child zone to be more clearly distinguished and protected separately\n
    \  using cryptographic signatures.\n\n   It is not at all clear that this is a
    good idea.  To restate in\n   stronger terms, the goal of the experiment described
    in this document\n   is to determine just how bad an idea this is.\n\n\t </p>\n
