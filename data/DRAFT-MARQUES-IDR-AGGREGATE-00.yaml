abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a mechanism which allows more-specific IP\naddress
    prefixes to be aggregated when they are topologically\nequivalent or less preferable
    than a less-specific advertisement.\n\nIt is designed to allow multi-homed sites
    to use \"Provider\nAggregatable\" (PA) addresses and obtain both redundancy and
    local\ntraffic optimizations when using multiple service providers.\n\t </p>\n
