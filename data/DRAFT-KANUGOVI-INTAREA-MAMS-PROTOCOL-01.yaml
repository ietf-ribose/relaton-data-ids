abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A communication network includes an access network element
    that\n   delivers data to/from the user and an associated core network element\n
    \  providing connectivity with the application servers.\n   Multiconnectivity
    scenarios are common where a device can be\n   simultaneously connected to multiple
    communication networks based on\n   different technology implementations and network
    architectures like\n   WiFi, LTE, DSL.  A smart combination and selection of access
    and core\n   network paths that can dynamically adapt to changing network\n   conditions
    can improve quality of experience for a user in a\n   multiconnectivity scenario
    and improve overall network utilization\n   and efficiency.  This document presents
    the problem statement and\n   proposes solution principles.  It specifies the
    requirements and\n   reference architecture for a multi access management services\n
    \  framework that can be used to flexibly select the best combination of\n   uplink
    and downlink access and core network paths, ensuring better\n   network efficiency
    and enhanced application performance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
