abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the reservation of Autonomous System Numbers
    (ASNs) that are for Private Use only, known as Private Use ASNs, and provides
    operational guidance on their use. This document enlarges the total space available
    for Private Use ASNs by documenting the reservation of a second, larger range
    and updates RFC 1930 by replacing Section 10 of that document.</p>"
