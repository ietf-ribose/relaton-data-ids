abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the transition requirements for an
    IPv6\n   Customer Edge (CE) router.  Specifically, this document extends the\n
    \  \"Minimum Requirements for IPv6-only Customer Edge Routers\" (draft-\n   palet-v6ops-rfc7084-bis2)
    in order to allow the provisioning of IPv6\n   transition services for the hosts
    attached to it and the support of\n   HNCP ([RFC7788]) for automated provisioning
    of downstream routers.\n   The document covers several transition technologies,
    either for\n   delivering IPv6 in IPv4-only access networks and specially for\n
    \  delivering IPv4 \"as a service\" as required in a world where IPv4\n   addresses
    are no longer available, so hosts in the customer LANs with\n   IPv4-only or IPv6-only
    applications or devices, requiring to\n   communicate with IPv4-only services
    at the Internet, are able to do\n   so.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
