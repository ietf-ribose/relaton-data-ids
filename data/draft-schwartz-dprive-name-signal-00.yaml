abstract:
- content: "<p>Some recent proposals to the DPRIVE working group rely on the use of
    SVCB records to provide instructions about how to reach an authoritative nameserver
    over an encrypted transport. These proposals will be difficult to deploy until
    the parent domain's delegation software has been modified to support these records.
    As an interim solution for these domains, this draft proposes encoding relevant
    signals in the child's NS-name.</p>"
