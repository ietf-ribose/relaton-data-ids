abstract:
- content: "<p>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics compared
    with traditional wired and ad-hoc networks. Low Latency Deterministic Networks(LLDN)
    is specified in IEEE 802.15.4e which is for deterministic applications in the
    industrial environment. Some routing metrics and constraints has been described
    in [RFC6551], [RFC5867] [RFC5826], [RFC5673], and [RFC5548]. There are several
    special characteristics and requirements in the industrial environment. This document
    defines a new Link Metric/Constraint Object-Scheduling Waiting Time to make RPL
    support deterministic scheduling mechanism, which could improve the determinacy
    and reliability of the LLNs in industrial environment.</p>"
