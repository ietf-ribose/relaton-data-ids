abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Alternate Marking method, as presented in RFC 8321, can
    be\n   applied only to point-to-point flows because it assumes that all the\n
    \  packets of the flow measured on one node are measured again by a\n   single
    second node.  This document aims to generalize and expand this\n   methodology
    to measure any kind of unicast flows, whose packets can\n   follow several different
    paths in the network, in wider terms a\n   multipoint-to-multipoint network.  For
    this reason the technique here\n   described is called Multipoint Alternate Marking.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
