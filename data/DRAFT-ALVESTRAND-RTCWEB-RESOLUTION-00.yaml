abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft offers a proposal for a fragment of the SDP usage
    rules\n   for RTCWEB: Requirements for supporting resolution negotiation.\n\n
    \  It proposes to use SDP both for initial and within-call resolution\n   configuration,
    and suggests that COP should be mentioned as an\n   optional, not mandatory, mechanism.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
