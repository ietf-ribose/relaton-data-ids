abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   While autonomic functions are often pre-installed and integrated
    with\n   the network elements they manage, this is not a mandatory condition.\n
    \  Allowing autonomic functions to be dynamically installed and to\n   control
    resources remotely enables more versatile deployment\n   approaches and enlarges
    the application scope to virtually any legacy\n   equipment.  The analysis of
    autonomic functions deployment schemes\n   through the installation, instantiation
    and operation phases allows\n   constructing a unified life-cycle and identifying
    new required\n   functionality.  Thus, the introduction of autonomic technologies
    will\n   be facilitated, the adoption much more rapid and broad.  Operators\n
    \  will benefit from multi-vendor, inter-operable autonomic functions\n   with
    homogeneous operations and superior quality, and will have more\n   freedom in
    their deployment scenarios.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
