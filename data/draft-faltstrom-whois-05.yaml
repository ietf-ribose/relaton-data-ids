abstract:
  content: "<p>This document presents extensions to the Whois protocol outputformat
    which enables a possibility for the server to send referalinformation to the Whois
    client. This referal mechanism can be usedfor example in a situation with a registrar/registry
    model, wherethe registrars all have their own Whois databases, and together theyserve
    a whole TLD. It can also be used when implementing aroot-whois service on top
    of all whois servers in the world, andthis way enable the possibility of creating
    advanced proxy services.For the latter, a registration procedure is also suggested,
    whereWhois services can be registered.Discussion on this Internet-Draft is to
