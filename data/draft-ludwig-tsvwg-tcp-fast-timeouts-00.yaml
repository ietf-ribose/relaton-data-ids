abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A 'fast timeout' occurs if the retransmission timer expires, andafterwards
    the TCP sender receives the duplicate ACK that would havetriggered a fast retransmit
    of the oldest outstanding segment. Inthis case, staying in slow start is an unnecessarily
    drastic responseto the congestion indication. Instead, we believe it is safe to
    backout of the slow start phase but instead go into the fast recoveryphase. One
    benefit of this approach is that the potentially followingduplicate ACKs can be
    exploited for advanced loss recoveryalgorithms.</p>"
