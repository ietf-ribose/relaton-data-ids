abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Telnet is a protocol that may be operated in either a peer-to-peer,\nfully
    symmetric mode, or asymmetrically, in a host-terminal mode.\nAlthough the original
    intention for the NVT mode of operation was both\nasymmetric and half-duplex,
    where neither the host nor the terminal\nechoed characters back to one another,
    the most common mode of usage has\ncome to be one of asymmetric full-duplex communications,
    where all\nterminal characters are first transmitted to the host computer and
    then\nechoed back to the terminal before being displayed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
