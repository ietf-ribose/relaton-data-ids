abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In 2018, the IETF began the transition to a new administrative\n
    \  structure and updated its IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)\n   to
    a new \"IASA 2.0\" structure.  In addition to more substantive\n   changes that
    are described in other documents, the transition to the\n   2018 IETF Administrative
    Support structure changes several position\n   titles and organizational relationships
    that are referenced\n   elsewhere.  Rather than reissue those referencing documents\n
    \  individually, this specification provides updates to them and\n   deprecates
    some now-obsolete documents to ensure that there is no\n   confusion due to these
    changes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
