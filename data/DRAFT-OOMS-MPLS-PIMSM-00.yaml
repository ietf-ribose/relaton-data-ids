abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the issues which rise when PIM-SM ([ESTR])
    is\n   chosen as the protocol for IP multicast deployment in an MPLS\n   environment.
    \ The relevant characteristics of PIM-SM are further\n   explored and a trigger
    for the establishment of LSPs for multicast\n   trees is proposed.\n\n\t </p>\n
