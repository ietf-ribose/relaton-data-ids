abstract:
- content: "<p>In traditional telecommunication system, operators usually provide
    general and limited security protection service for users during access (e.g.
    AKA in 3G/4G network). Now, with the development of network virtualization technology
    and data center, the physical network device is became a network function software
    which is running on virtual machine of server and the network functions can be
    flexible and elastic. So operators can provide more flexible security function
    to users. In order to provide more flexible security service, interfaces between
    operator's network and user should be needed. These interfaces will be used to
    request/achieve operate (Virtual) Network Security Functions from operator's network.
    This draft describes use cases for using the interface in operator's network environment.</p>"
