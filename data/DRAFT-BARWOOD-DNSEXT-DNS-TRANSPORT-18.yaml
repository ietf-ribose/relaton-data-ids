abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a new transport protocol for DNS.\nIP
    fragmentation is avoided, blind spoofing, amplification attacks\nand other denial
    of service attacks are prevented. Latency for a \ntypical DNS query is a single
    round trip, after a setup handshake.\nNo per-client server state is required between
    transactions.\nPackets may optionally be encrypted and authenticated.\nThe protocol
    may have other applications.\n\t </p>\n      "
