abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Session Initiation Protocol is the Internet Engineering Task Force'sstandard
    for multimedia communications in an IP network.Authentication in SIP has been
    a major concern and most of theexisting authentication mechanisms in SIP are dependent
    on public keyinfrastructure (PKI) or shared secrets (passwords).This documentproposes
    new authentication schemes in SIP using identity-basedsignature and signcryption
    schemes. This approach provides securitycomparable to that of certificate-based
    authentication whilepreserving the operational simplicity of shared-secret techniques.</p>"
