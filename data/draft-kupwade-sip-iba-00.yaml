abstract:
- content: "<p>Session Initiation Protocol is the Internet Engineering Task Force's
    standard for multimedia communications in an IP network. Authentication in SIP
    has been a major concern and most of the existing authentication mechanisms in
    SIP are dependent on public key infrastructure (PKI) or shared secrets (passwords).This
    document proposes new authentication schemes in SIP using identity-based signature
    and signcryption schemes. This approach provides security comparable to that of
    certificate-based authentication while preserving the operational simplicity of
    shared-secret techniques.</p>"
