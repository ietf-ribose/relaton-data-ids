abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.
    \ A node\n   steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called\n
    \  \"segments\".  A segment can represent topological or service based\n   instructions.
    \ A segment can further be associated with network\n   resources allocated for
    executing the instruction.  Such a segment is\n   called resource-aware SID.\n\n
    \  Resource-aware SIDs may be used to build SR paths with a set of\n   reserved
    network resources.  In addition, resource-aware SIDs may be\n   used to build
    SR based virtual underlay networks, which can provide\n   the customized network
    topology and resource attributes required by\n   different customers and/or services.
    \ Such virtual networks are\n   called SR based Virtual Transport Networks (VTNs).
    \ The SR based VTNs\n   can be used as the underlay network to enable services
    with required\n   topology and resource characteristics.  This document describes
    a\n   suggested use of resource-aware SIDs to build SR based VTNs.\n\n\t </p>\n
