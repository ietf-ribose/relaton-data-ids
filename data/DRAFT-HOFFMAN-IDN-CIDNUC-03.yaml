abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This protocol describes a transformation method for representing
    non-\nASCII characters in domain names in a fashion that is completely\ncompatible
    with the current DNS. It meets the many requirements for\ninternationalization
    of domain names.\n\nNote: this protocol is quite experimental and should not be
    deployed in\nthe Internet until it reaches standards track in the IETF.\n\t </p>\n
