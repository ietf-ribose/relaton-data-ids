abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The cryptographic algorithm and key size requirements included
    when DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) was designed a decade ago are functionally
    obsolete and in need of immediate revision.  This document updates DKIM requirements
    to those minimally suitable for operation with currently specified algorithms.\n\t
