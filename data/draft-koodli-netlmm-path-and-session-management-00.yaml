abstract:
- content: "<p>In a distributed network environment such as a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain,
    it is often necessary to know that a peer is alive and, if not, detect quickly
    that a peer has failed and subsequently re- started. It is also necessary to detect
    failures where only a subset of the existing mobility sessions are affected. Furthermore,
    failure indication should be possible without waiting for an explicit query from
    a peer. This document outlines a protocol to address such path and session reliability
    for Proxy Mobile IPv6.</p>"
