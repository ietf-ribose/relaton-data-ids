abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for a user agent client
    to\n   request the marking of a previously sent Instant Message as\n   cancelled.
    \ From a user's perspective, the user agent server, or\n   other proxies or relay
    points in the network, can effectively remove\n   the first message, giving the
    impression the first message was\n   cancelled.  This document describes the utility
    of such a function,\n   as well as the futility of attempting to create a true
    message\n   cancellation feature.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
