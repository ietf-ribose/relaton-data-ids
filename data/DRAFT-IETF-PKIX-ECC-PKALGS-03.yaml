abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document gives additional algorithms and associated ASN.1\n
    \  identifiers for elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) used with the\n   Internet
    X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and\n   Certificate Revocation List
    (CRL) Profile (PKIX).  The algorithms\n   and identifiers here are consistent
    with both ANSI X9.62-2005 and\n   X9.63-2001, and shall be consistent with the
    forthcoming revisions\n   of these documents.  Consistency shall also be maintained
    with SEC1\n   and SEC2, and any revisions or successors of such documents.\n\t
