abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) operates over UDP and TCP.
    Whenused with UDP, responses to requests are returned to the sourceaddress the
    request came from, but from the port written into thetopmost Via header of the
    request. This behavior is not desirable inmany cases, most notably, when the client
    is behind a NAT. Thisextension defines a new parameter for the Via header, called
    rport,that allows a client to request that the server send the responseback to
    the source IP address and port where the request came from.</p>"
