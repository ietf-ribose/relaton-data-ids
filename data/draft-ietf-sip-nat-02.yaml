abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) operates over UDP and TCP. When
    used with UDP, responses to requests are returned to the source address the request
    came from, but from the port written into the topmost Via header of the request.
    This behavior is not desirable in many cases, most notably, when the client is
    behind a NAT. This extension defines a new parameter for the Via header, called
    rport, that allows a client to request that the server send the response back
    to the source IP address and port where the request came from.</p>"
