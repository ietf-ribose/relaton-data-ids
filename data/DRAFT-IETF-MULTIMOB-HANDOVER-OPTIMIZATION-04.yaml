abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an experimental multicast handover\n
    \  optimization mechanism for Proxy Mobile IPv6 to accelerate the\n   delivery
    of multicast traffic to mobile nodes after handovers.  The\n   mechanism is based
    on speeding up the acquisition of mobile nodes'\n   multicast context by the mobile
    access gateways.  To do that,\n   extensions to the current Proxy Mobile IPv6
    protocol are proposed.\n   These extensions are not only applicable to the base
    solution for\n   multicast support in Proxy Mobile IPv6, but they can also be
    applied\n   to other solutions developed to avoid the tunnel convergence problem.\n
    \  Furthermore, these extensions are also independent of the role played\n   by
    the mobile access gateway within the multicast network (either\n   acting as multicast
    listener discovery proxy or multicast router).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
