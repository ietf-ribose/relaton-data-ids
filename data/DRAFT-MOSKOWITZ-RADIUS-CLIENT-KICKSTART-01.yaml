abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RADIUS servers [2] require foreknowledge of the IP address of
    the\n   RADIUS clients, as the shared secret is bound to the address.  This\n
    \  has been a manageable situation when the RADIUS Clients were just\n   NASs
    (Network Access Servers).  With the advent of IEEE 802.1x [3],\n   there is a
    significant increase in RADIUS clients in organizations\n   not prepared to have
    the RADIUS Clients use fixed IP addresses and\n   manage the shared secret.  To
    address the concerns of the IEEE 802.1\n   and 802.11 Task Groups a level of indirection
    is added; a Master\n   secret bound to the name of the RADIUS client.  This Master
    secret\n   is created by the Shared Secret Provisioning Protocol [4].  For\n   RADIUS
    Client Kickstart, SSPP is run over SNMP [5].  The Master\n   Secret is used in
    an initial RADIUS exchange to create a session\nsecret that is used as the normal
    RADIUS client shared secret.  SSPP\n   can be used to change the Master Secret
    whenever required.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
