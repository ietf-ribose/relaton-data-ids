abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an update to the advice given in RFC 3819. Subsequent
    research has altered understanding of buffer sizing and queue management. Therefore
    this document significantly revises the previous recommendations on buffering.
    The advice applies to all packet buffers, whether in network equipment, end hosts
    or middleboxes such as firewalls or NATs. And the advice applies to packet buffers
    at any layer: whether subnet, IP, transport or application.</p>"
