abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a mechanism to deliver streams of network usage information
    which follow the Internet Protocol Detail Records (IPDR) format. This format provides
    an extensible means to exchange usage information between systems. The model of
    extension is based on the use of a subset of the XML Schema specification language,
    in conjunction with a well defined mapping to a binary format based on the eXtensible
    Data Record (XDR).</p>"
