abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes key exchange algorithms based on Elliptic Curve
    Cryptography (ECC) for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. In particular,
    it specifies the use of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement in
    a TLS handshake and the use of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
    as a new authentication mechanism.</p>"
