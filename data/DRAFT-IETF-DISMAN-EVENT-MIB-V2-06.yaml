abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information \n
    \  Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet \n   community.
    \ In particular, it describes managed objects that can be \n   used to manage
    and monitor MIB objects and take action through \n   events.  This document obsoletes
    RFC 2981. \n     \n   The Event MIB provides the ability to monitor MIB objects
    on the \n   local system or on a remote system and take simple action when a \n
    \  trigger condition is met. \n\t </p>\n      "
