abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes a two-tier resource management model for\ndifferentiated
    services networks. Following the approach taken by\nthe Internet routing architecture,
    we propose that bilateral service\nagreements are made for aggregate border-crossing
    traffic between\nneighboring administrative domains. We also propose that\nadministrative
    domains individually make their own decision on\nstrategies and protocols to use
    for internal resource management and\nQoS support, both to meet internal client
    needs and to fulfill\nexternal commitments.\n \nWe sketch out one specific realization
    of this two-tier model by\nhaving a Bandwidth-Broker (BB) as the resource manager
    for each\ndomain and a BB-to-BB protocol, equivalent to BGP in routing, for\ninter-domain
    resource management.  We believe that this two-tier\nresource management\nmodel
    matches the direction of, and complement the work by, the\ndiffserv effort.  We
    also expect this two-tier model to scale well\nin the global, heterogeneous Internet.\n
