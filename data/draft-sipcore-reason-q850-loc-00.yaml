abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP Reason header field is defined for carrying ISUP cause values
    as well as SIP response codes. Some services in SIP networks may need to know
    the ISUP location where the call was released in the PSTN network to correctly
    interpret the reason of release.</p>"
