abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Artificial intelligence based IoT applications demand more
    massive\n   computing resource through networks for the process of AI tasks.  To\n
    \  support these applications, some new technologies based an edge\n   computing
    and fog computing are emerging.  Especially, the\n   computation-intensive and
    latency-sensitive IoT applications such as\n   augmented reality, virtual reality
    and AI based inference application\n   is deployed with an edge computing and
    fog computing which are\n   connected with cloud computing.  Recently, cluster-based
    edge system\n   is deployed to extend computation capacity of an edge server.
    \ The\n   cluster-based edge system has the advantage that can enhace the\n   resource
    scalability and availability in edge computing and fog\n   computing.  In this
    draft, we present cluster-based edge system\n   architecture and multi-cluster
    edge network topology that consists of\n   multi-cluster edge system and core
    cloud.  Also, we define the\n   network functions and network node to configurate
    and operate multi-\n   cluster edge network collaboratively.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
