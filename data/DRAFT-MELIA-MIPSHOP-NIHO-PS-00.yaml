abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is a first document describing the rational about network\n
    \  support for decision making and execution of handovers.  Starting\n   from
    existing technologies and considering new trends from mobile\n   operators, we
    draw potential deployment scenarios and derive a set of\n   associated functionalities.
    \ These functionalities and associated\n   assumptions are listed in the document.
    \ Application areas for\n   network initiated handovers are then illustrated specifying
    a set of\n   goals and non-goals to be addressed in a future version.\n\t </p>\n
