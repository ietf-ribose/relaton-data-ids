abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Operators worldwide are in various stages of preparing for,
    or\n   deploying IPv6 into their networks.  The operators often face\n   challenges
    related to both IPv6 introduction along with a growing\n   risk of IPv4 run out
    within their organizations.  The overall problem\n   for many of there operators
    will be to meet the simultaneous needs of\n   IPv6 connectivity and continue support
    for IPv4 connectivity for\n   legacy devices and systems with a depleting supply
    of IPv4 addresses.\n   The overall transition will take most networks form an
    IPv4-Only\n   environment to a dual stack network environment and potentially
    an\n   IPv6-Only operating mode.  This document helps provide a framework\n   for
    Wireline providers who may be faced with many of these challenges\n   as they
    consider what IPv6 transition technologies to use, how to use\n   the selected
    technologies and when to use them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
