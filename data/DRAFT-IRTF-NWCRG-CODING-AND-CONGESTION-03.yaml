abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   FEC coding is a reliability mechanism that is distinct and
    separate\n   from the loss detection of congestion controls.  Using FEC coding
    can\n   be a useful way to deal with transfer tail losses or with networks\n   having
    non-congestion losses.  However, FEC coding mechanisms should\n   not hide congestion
    signals.  This memo offers a discussion of how\n   FEC coding and congestion control
    can coexist.  Another objective is\n   to encourage the research community to
    also consider congestion\n   control aspects when proposing and comparing FEC
    coding solutions in\n   communication systems.\n\n   This document is the product
    of the Coding for Efficient Network\n   Communications Research Group (NWCRG).
    \ The scope of the document is\n   end-to-end communications: FEC coding for tunnels
    is out-of-the scope\n   of the document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
