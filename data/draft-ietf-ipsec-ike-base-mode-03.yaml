abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new Phase I mode for IKE [RFC-2409] based
    on the ISAKMP [RFC-2408] Base Exchange. The purpose of this new exchange is to
    allow support of all authentication methods with fixed and non-fixed IP addresses,
    while offering protection against a denial of service attack aimed at costly operations.
    It also enables negotiation capabilities beyond those offered by Aggressive Mode
    (DH/EC group). The exchange consists of only four messages and therefor is useful
    when performance is crucial.</p>"
