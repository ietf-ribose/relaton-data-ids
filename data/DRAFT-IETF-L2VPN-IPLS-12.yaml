abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [VPLS] is used to interconnect\n
    \  systems across a wide-area or metropolitan-area network, making it\n   appear
    that they are on a private LAN.  The systems which are\n   interconnected may
    themselves be LAN switches.  If, however, they\n   are IP hosts or IP routers,
    certain simplifications to the operation\n   of the VPLS are possible.  We call
    this simplified type of VPLS an\n   \"IP-only LAN Service\" (IPLS).  In an IPLS,
    as in a VPLS, LAN\n   interfaces are run in promiscuous mode, and frames are forwarded\n
    \  based on their destination MAC addresses.  However, the maintenance\n   of
    the MAC forwarding tables is done via signaling, rather than via\n   the MAC address
    learning procedures specified in [IEEE 802.1D].\n   This draft specifies the protocol
    extensions and procedures for\n   support of the IPLS service.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
