abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  One of the treaties administered by the International\n  Telecommunications
    Union is the International Telecommunications\n  Regulations (ITRs), whose purpose
    is to promote the development of\n  telecommunication services.  The 1988 version
    of the ITRs opened the\n  way for privatisation, liberalization, and the growth
    of the Internet\n  and mobile networks. [Hill-2013a, p. 8]  Given the subsequent\n
    \ significant structural and technological changes, the ITU Member\n  States agreed
    to meet in 2012 to revise the ITRs.  While consensus\n  was found on an overwhelming
    majority of the treaty text, some\n  provisions proved to be controversial, leading
    to a split in the\n  membership and sharp criticism of selected provisions.\n\n
    \ As a result, some ITU Member States did not sign the treaty.  This\n  document
    analyses that criticism and attempts to place it in context;\n  it identifies
    problems that may arise if states to not accede\n  to the treaty, and suggests
    a way forward, concluding that not\n  acceding may have undesirable results for
    the citizens of\n  non-signatory countries and for interoperability in general.\n\n\t
