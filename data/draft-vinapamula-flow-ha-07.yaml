abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for a host to signal via Port Control
    Protocol (PCP) which connections should be protected against network failures.
    These connections will be elected to be subject to high availability mechanisms
    enabled at the network side. This approach assumes that applications/users have
    more visibility about sensitive connections rather than any heuristic that can
    be enabled at the network side to guess which connections should be secured.</p>"
