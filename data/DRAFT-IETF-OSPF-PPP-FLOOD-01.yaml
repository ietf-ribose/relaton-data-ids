abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The OSPF routing protocol synchronizes its link-state database
    over\nall links. However, when multiple point-to-point links connect a\npair of
    OSPF routers, it is only necessary to flood over one of the\nparallel links. This
    can be done in a backward-compatible fashion,\nwithout requiring negotiation between
    neighboring routers, as\ndescribed in this memo.\n\t </p>\n      "
