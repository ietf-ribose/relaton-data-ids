abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS label format and encoding method are specified in\n
    \  [RFC3032], the label value is represented using the 20-bit space and\n   supports
    up to 1 million of instances. As exponential Internet growth\n   continues there
    are specific network deployment scenarios where a\n   clear need to represent
    more than one million entities is required.\n\n   This document describes the
    MPLS deployment scenarios, use\n   cases, and requirements, where the current
    20-bit label will no\n   longer be sufficient.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
