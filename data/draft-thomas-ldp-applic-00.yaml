abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a method for forwardingpackets
    that uses short, fixed-length values carried by packets,called labels, to determine
    packet nexthops ([MPLS-FRAMEWORK],[MPLS-ARCH]). A fundamental concept in MPLS
    is that two LabelSwitching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels
    usedto forward traffic between and through them. This commonunderstanding is achieved
    by using a set of procedures, called alabel distribution protocol, by which one
    LSR informs another oflabel bindings it has made. This document describes theapplicability
    of a set of such procedures called LDP (for LabelDistribution Protocol) [LDP].</p>"
