abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for link-state routing protocols
    to prevent local transient forwarding loops in case of link failure. This mechanism
    proposes a two-step convergence by introducing a delay between the convergence
    of the node adjacent to the topology change and the network wide convergence.
    As this mechanism delays the IGP convergence it may only be used for planned maintenance
    or when fast reroute protects the traffic between the link failure time and the
    IGP convergence. The proposed mechanism is limited to the link down event in order
    to keep the mechanism simple. Simulations using real network topologies have been
    performed and show that local loops are a significant portion (&gt;50%) of the
    total forwarding loops.</p>"
