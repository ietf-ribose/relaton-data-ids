abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This OAuth 2.0 authorization flow for browserless and input\n
    \  constrained devices, often referred to as the device flow, enables\n   OAuth
    clients to request user authorization from devices that have an\n   Internet connection,
    but don't have an easy input method (such as a\n   smart TV, media console, picture
    frame, or printer), or lack a\n   suitable browser for a more traditional OAuth
    flow.  This\n   authorization flow instructs the user to perform the authorization\n
    \  request on a secondary device, such as a smartphone.  There is no\n   requirement
    for communication between the constrained device and the\n   user's secondary
    device.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
