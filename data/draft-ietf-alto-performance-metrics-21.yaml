abstract:
- content: <p>The cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO), and different applications may use different types of cost metrics. Since
    the ALTO base protocol (RFC 7285) defines only a single cost metric (namely, the
    generic "routingcost" metric), if an application wants to issue a cost map or
    an endpoint cost request in order to identify a resource provider that offers
    a better delay performance, the base protocol does not define the cost metric
    to be used. This document addresses this issue by extending the specification
    to provide a variety of network performance metrics, including network delay,
    delay variation (a.k.a, jitter), packet loss rate, hop count, and bandwidth. There
    are multiple sources (e.g., estimation based on measurements or service-level
    agreement) to derive a performance metric. This document introduces an additional
    "cost-context" field to the ALTO "cost-type" field to convey the source of a performance
    metric.</p>
