- content: "<p>This document specifies a set of questions that authors should be prepared
    to answer as part of a solution to multihoming with IPv6. The questions do not
    assume that multihoming is the only problem of interest, nor do they demand a
    more general solution. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
