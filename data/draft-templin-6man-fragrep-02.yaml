abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) provides a fragmentation and reassembly
    service for end systems allowing for the transmission of packets that exceed the
    path MTU. However, loss of just a single fragment requires retransmission of the
    original packet in its entirety, with potentially devastating effects on performance.
    This document specifies an IPv6 fragment retransmission scheme that matches the
    loss unit to the retransmission unit. The document further specifies an update
    to Path MTU Discovery that distinguishes hard link size restrictions from reassembly
    congestion events.</p>"
