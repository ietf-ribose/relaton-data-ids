abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With IP protocols now generalizing to constrained networks,
    users\n   expect to be able to Operate, Administer and Maintain them with the\n
    \  familiar tools and protocols they already use on less constrained\n   networks.\n\n
    \  OAM uses specific messages sent into the data plane to measure some\n   parameters
    of a network.  Most of the time, no explicit values are\n   sent is these messages.
    \ Network parameters are obtained from the\n   analysis of these specific messages.\n\n
    \  This can be used:\n\n   *  To detect if a host is up or down.\n\n   *  To measure
    the RTT and its variation over time.\n\n   *  To learn the path used by packets
    to reach a destination.\n\n   OAM in LPWAN is a little bit trickier since the
    bandwidth is limited\n   and extra traffic added by OAM can introduce perturbation
    on regular\n   transmission.\n\n   Two scenarios can be investigated:\n\n   *
    \ OAM coming from internet.  In that case, the NGW should act as a\n\t </p>\n
