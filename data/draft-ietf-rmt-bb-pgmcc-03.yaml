abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes PGMCC, a single rate multicastcongestion
    control scheme which is TCP-friendly and achievesscalability, stability and fast
    response to variations innetwork conditions. PGMCC is suitable for both non-reliableand
    reliable data transfers. It is mainly designed for NAK-based multicast protocols,
    and uses a window-based, TCP-likecontrol loop using positive ACKs between one
    representative ofthe receiver group (the ACKER) and the sender. The ACKER isselected
    dynamically and may change over time.PGMCC is made of two components: a window-based
    control loop,which closely mimics TCP behaviour, and a fast and low-overhead procedure
    to select (and track changes of) the ACKER.The scheme is robust to measurement
    errors, and supports fastresponse to changes in the receiver set and/or networkconditions.</p>"
