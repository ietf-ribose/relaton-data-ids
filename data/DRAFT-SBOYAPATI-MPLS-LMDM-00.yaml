abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network. MPLS
    can carry\nany data payload which gives the flexibility to the service provider
    to provision new\nservice with any expense. As loss and delay sensitive applications
    such as Voice and Video are\nrunning on MPLS network, they may suffer delays in
    packet transmission and delivery. So Voice and Video traffic\non MPLS network
    needs low loss and delay LSP's to transfer Voice and Video packets.\nThis draft
    is proposing a solution to selection of Low loss and latency LSP's for\nVoice
    and Video applications using MPLS Loss and Delay measurement parameters.\n\n\nThe
    benefit of this technology results in delivery voice and video packets with\nbest
    possible lsp i.e. LSP's with less loss and delay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t
