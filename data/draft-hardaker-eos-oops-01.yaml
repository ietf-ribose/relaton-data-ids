abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft specifies some new PDU operations intended to optimizeSNMP
    requests for performance.This draft is not a complete specification, but merely
    is intendedto illustrate concepts which can then be discussed within the EoSworking
    group. A complete specification will be completed after theagreed features and
    packet structure is fairly well solidified sothe author doesn't have to rewrite
    large portions of stuff ;-).There are no error handling codes or elements of procedures
    definedyet. The concepts, however, have been thought out about a lot.Feedback
    on what you see within would be greatly appreciated at thispoint.</p>"
