abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on
    the\nability to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet loss\nand one-way
    and two-way delay, as well as related metrics such as\ndelay variation and channel
    throughput.  This capability, in\naddition, provides operators with greater visibility
    into the\nperformance characteristics of their networks, thereby facilitating\nplanning,
    troubleshooting, and evaluation.  This document specifies\nprotocol mechanisms
    to enable the efficient and accurate measurement\nof these performance metrics
    in MPLS networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
