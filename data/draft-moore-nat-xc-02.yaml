abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a mechanism called NAT-XC (for NAT withExplicit
    Control) for translating between IPv4 and IPv6. NAT-XC isdistinguished from other
    IPv4/IPv6 translations schemes in that itseparates the translation between IPv4
    and IPv6 from the managementof address bindings for such a translation; and is
    designed to allowapplications to be explicitly aware of, and control, their addressbindings.
    NAT-XC can be used by both IPv4 clients wishing tocommunicate via IPv6, and IPv6
    clients wishing to communicate viaIPv4. NAT-XC appears to be usable in a wide
    variety of scenariosrequiring communication across IPv4/IPv6 boundaries.</p>"
