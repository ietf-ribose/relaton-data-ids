abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IETF meetings are held physically in various geographic regions
    of\n   the world. One of the criteria for choosing a location is the amount\n
    \  of participation by the people in that region. Additionally,\n   questions
    arise as to whether holding a physical meeting in a\n   location increases the
    amount of participation by local attendees.\n   Participation in the IETF process
    may occur in a number of different\n   ways: email lists, writing drafts, physical
    or remote attendance at a\n   meeting, chairing Working Groups and so on. This
    document defines the\n   metrics and terms which may be used to measure participation
    both\n   before and after an IETF meeting.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
