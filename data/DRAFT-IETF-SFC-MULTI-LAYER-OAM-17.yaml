abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A set of requirements for active Operation, Administration,
    and\n   Maintenance (OAM) of Service Function Chains (SFCs) in a network is\n
    \  presented in this document.  Based on these requirements, an\n   encapsulation
    of active OAM messages in SFC and a mechanism to detect\n   and localize defects
    are described.\n\n   This document updates RFC 8300.  Particularly, it updates
    the\n   definition of O (OAM) bit in the Network Service Header (NSH) (RFC\n   8300)
    and defines how an active OAM message is identified in the NSH.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
