abstract:
- content: <p>The specification for HTTP API Home Documents provides a JSON syntax
    only. This specification provides an XML syntax for the same data model, so that
    the concept of Home Documents can be consistently exposed in both JSON- and XML-based
    HTTP APIs. It also defines the link relation type "home" so that applications
    can identify links to home documents.</p>
