abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) being specified jointly by
    IETFand ITU-T includes requirements documents and framework documents.The framework
    documents define the basic architecture that is neededin order to support various
    aspects of the required behavior. Thisdocument addresses the functionality described
    in the MPLS-TPSurvivability Framework document and defines a protocol that may
    beused to fulfill the function of the Protection State Coordination forlinear
    protection, as described in that document.This document is a product of a joint
    Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
    TelecommunicationsStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS TransportProfile
    within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support thecapabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network asdefined by the ITU-T.Status of this MemoThis Internet-Draft
    is submitted to IETF in full conformance with theprovisions of BCP 78 and BCP
    79.Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet EngineeringTask Force
