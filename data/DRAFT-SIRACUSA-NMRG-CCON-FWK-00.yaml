abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The increased complexity in the management of highly heterogeneous\n
    \  optical networks is recently forcing vendors and providers to look\n   for
    novel mechanisms which diminish the manual intervention by\n   favoring the autonomous
    execution of several operational tasks,\n   especially when dealing with network
    congestion or failure events.\n   The adoption of cognitive techniques in networking
    envisions a\n   network which is able to adapt itself to current or forecasted\n
    \  conditions by taking into account previous history, and which is\n   able to
    act proactively, rather than reactively, in order to avoid\n   problems before
    they arise. In this document, a novel architectural\n   framework that introduces
    cognitive techniques in the optical\n   networking domain is described, and several
    use cases provided to\n   emphasize its effectiveness.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
