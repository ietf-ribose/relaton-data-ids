abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery) normally discloses information about
    both the devices offering services and the devices requesting services. This information
    includes host names, network parameters, and possibly a further description of
    the corresponding service instance. Especially when mobile devices engage in DNS
    Service Discovery over Multicast DNS at a public hotspot, a serious privacy problem
    arises. We propose to solve this problem by a two-stage approach. In the first
    stage, hosts discover Private Discovery Service Instances via DNS-SD using special
    formats to protect their privacy. These service instances correspond to Private
    Discovery Servers running on peers. In the second stage, hosts directly query
    these Private Discovery Servers via DNS-SD over TLS. A pairwise shared secret
    necessary to establish these connections is only known to hosts authorized by
    a pairing system.</p>"
