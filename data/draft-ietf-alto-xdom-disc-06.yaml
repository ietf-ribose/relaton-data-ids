abstract:
- content: <p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
    guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of
    candidates capable of providing a desired resource. ALTO is realized by a client-server
    protocol. Before an ALTO client can ask for guidance, it needs to discover one
    or more ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance. In some deployment scenarios,
    in particular if the information about the network topology is partitioned and
    distributed over several ALTO servers, it may be necessary to discover an ALTO
    server outside of the ALTO client's own network domain, in order to get appropriate
    guidance. This document details applicable scenarios, itemizes requirements, and
    specifies a procedure for ALTO cross-domain server discovery. Technically, the
    procedure specified in this document takes one IP address or prefix and a U-NAPTR
    Service Parameter (typically, "ALTO:https") as parameters. It performs DNS lookups
    (for NAPTR resource records in the "in-addr.arpa." or "ip6.arpa." trees) and returns
    one or more URIs of information resources related to that IP address or prefix.</p>
