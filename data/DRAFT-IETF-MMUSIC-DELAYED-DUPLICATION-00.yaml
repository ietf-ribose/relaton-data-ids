abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A straightforward approach to provide protection against packet\n
    \  losses due to network outages with a longest duration of T time units\n   is
    to simply duplicate the original packets and send each copy\n   separated in time
    by at least T time units.  This approach is\n   commonly referred to as Time-shifted
    Redundancy, Temporal Redundancy\n   or simply Delayed Duplication.  This document
    defines an attribute to\n   indicate the presence of temporally redundant media
    streams and the\n   duplication delay in the Session Description Protocol.\n\n\t
