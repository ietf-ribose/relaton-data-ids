abstract:
- content: <p>A network may contain links with variable discrete bandwidth, e.g.,
    microwave and copper. The bandwidth of such links may change discretely in response
    to a changing external environment. The word "availability" is typically used
    to describe such links during network planning. This document defines a new type
    of Generalized Switching Capability-Specific Information (SCSI) TLV to extend
    the Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Open Shortest Path First
    (OSPF) routing protocol. The extension can be used for route computation in a
    network that contains links with variable discrete bandwidth. Note that this document
    only covers the mechanisms by which the availability information is distributed.
    The mechanisms by which availability information of a link is determined and the
    use of the distributed information for route computation are outside the scope
    of this document. It is intended that technology-specific documents will reference
    this document to describe specific uses.</p>
