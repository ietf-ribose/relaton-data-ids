abstract:
- content: "<p>The CLUE protocol is an application protocol conceived for the description
    and negotiation of a telepresence session. The design of the CLUE protocol takes
    into account the requirements and the framework defined within the IETF CLUE working
    group. A companion document delves into CLUE signaling details, as well as on
    the SIP/ SDP session establishment phase. CLUE messages flow upon the CLUE data
    channel, based on reliable and ordered SCTP over DTLS transport. Message details,
    together with the behavior of CLUE Participants acting as Media Providers and/or
    Media Consumers, are herein discussed.</p>"
