abstract:
  content: "<p>Access concentrators that act as DHCP relay agents need to determinethe
    endpoint locations of IP addresses across public broadband accessnetworks such
    as cable, DSL, and wireless networks. Because ARPbroadcasts are undesirable in
    public networks, many accessconcentrator implementations 'glean' location information
    from DHCPmessages forwarded by its relay agent function. Unfortunately, thetypical
    access concentrator loses its gleaned information when theaccess concentrator
    is rebooted or is replaced. This memo proposesthat when gleaned DHCP information
    is not available, the accessconcentrator/relay agent obtains the location information
    directlyfrom the DHCP server(s) using a new, lightweight DHCPLEASEQUERYmessage.</p>"
