abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The evolving technologies for real-time conversation over the
    Internet\nrequire URLs to provide user contact information.  As there are many\nprotocols
    (including some that are not Internet based) that can be used\nfor inter-user
    conversation, this document describes a two stage\ntransaction process for obtaining
    a URL that can be used to initiate\nconversation.  The first stage involves retrieving
    a list of protocol\nspecific URLs in a MIME encoded file.  The MIME type enables
    an\nappropriate application to be launched which will analyse the presented\nURLs
    and select the most appropriate one.  The second stage involves\ninterpreting
    the protocol specific URL and initiating the conversation.\nThe protocol specific
    URLs are encoded in a URL form so that they can be\nembedded directly into HTML
    pages.  This allows the first stage to be\nomitted.  The document describes the
    format of the MIME encoded list of\nURLs, and the format of a number of protocol
    specific URLs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
