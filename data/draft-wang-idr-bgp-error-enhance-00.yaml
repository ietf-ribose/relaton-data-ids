abstract:
- content: "<p>This document supplements and revises RFC7606. According to RFC 7606,
    when an UPDATE packet received from a neighbor contains an attribute of incorrect
    format, the BGP session cannot be reset directly. Instead, the BGP session must
    be reset based on the specific problem. Error packets must minimize the impact
    on routes and do not affect the correctness of the protocol. Different error handling
    methods are used. The error handling methods include discarding attributes, withdrawing
    routes, disabling the address family, and resetting sessions. RFC 7606 specifies
    the error handling methods of some existing attributes and provides guidance for
    error handling of new attributes. This document supplements the error handling
    methods for common attributes that are not specified in RFC7606, and provides
    suggestions for revising the error handling methods for some attributes. The general
    principle remains unchanged: Maintain established BGP sessions and keep valid
    routes updated. However, discard or delete incorrect attributes or packets to
    minimize the impact on the current session.</p>"
