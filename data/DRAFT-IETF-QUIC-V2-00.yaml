abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies QUIC version 2, which is identical
    to QUIC\n   version 1 except for some trivial details.  Its purpose is to combat\n
    \  various ossification vectors and exercise the version negotiation\n   framework.
    \ It also serves as a template for the minimum changes in\n   any future version
    of QUIC.\n\n   Note that \"version 2\" is an informal name for this proposal that\n
    \  indicates it is the second standards-track QUIC version.  The\n   protocol
    specified here will receive a version number other than 2\n   from IANA.\n\n   Discussion
    of this work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF\n   mailing list quic@ietf.org
    or on the GitHub repository which contains\n   the draft: https://github.com/quicwg/quic-v2.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
