abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2116] requires a reliable\ntransport
    for end-to-end communication.  While historically TCP has\nbeen used for this
    purpose, this document proposes an alternative --\nthe Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960].  Similar\nto TCP, SCTP offers a reliable end-to-end
    transport connection to\napplications.  Additionally, SCTP offers other innovative
    services\nunavailable in TCP.  The objectives of this draft are three-fold: (i)\nto
    highlight SCTP services that better match HTTP's needs than TCP,\n(ii) to propose
    a design for persistent and pipelined HTTP 1.1\ntransactions over SCTP's multistreaming
    service, and (iii) to share\nsome lessons learned from implementing HTTP over
    SCTP.  Finally, open\nissues warranting more discussion and/or investigation are
    listed.\n\t </p>\n      "
