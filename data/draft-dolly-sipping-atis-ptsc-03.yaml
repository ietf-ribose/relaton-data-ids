abstract:
- content: "<p>At the 67th San Diego IETF Meeting it is anticipated that the Real-time
    Applications and Infrastructure Area will meet and its ongoing work program will
    be an item for discussion. This Internet Draft has been prepared to share the
    relevant portions of the PTSC current work program with the IETF. It is hoped
    that awareness of the Packet Technologies Systems Committee (PTSC) work program
    will allow for more informed discussion.</p>"
