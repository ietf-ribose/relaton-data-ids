abstract:
  content: "<p>In any Network-Based VPN (NBVPN) scheme, the Provider Edge (PE)routers
    attached to a common VPN must exchange certain informationas a prerequisite to
    establish VPN-specific connectivity. In[RFC2547-bis], VPN-specific routes are
    exchanged, along with theinformation needed to enable a PE to determine which
    routes belongto which VPNs. In [VPN-VR], VR addresses must be exchanged, alongwith
    the information needed to enable the PEs to determine which VRsare in the same
    VPN ('membership'), and which of those VRs are tohave VPN connectivity ('topology').
    Once the VRs are reachablethrough the tunnels, routes ('reachability') are then
    exchanged byrunning existing routing protocol per VPN basis. The purpose of thisdraft
    is to define a common BGP based auto-discovery mechanism usedfor both the virtual
    router [VPN-VR] and [RFC2547-bis]architectures. Each scheme uses the mechanism
    to automaticallydiscover the information needed by that particular scheme.Interworking
    scenarios between [RFC2547-bis] and the virtual routermodels are also discussed.</p>"
