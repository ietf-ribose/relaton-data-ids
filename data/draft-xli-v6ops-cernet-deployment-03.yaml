- content: "<p>This document presents the China Education and Research Network (CERNET)'s
    IPv4 as a Service (IPv4aaS) design, deployment and operation experience. The techniques
    used are IPv4/IPv6 stateless translation both in the forms of single translation
    (IVI, for IPv6-only servers) and double translation (MAP-T, for dual-stack clients).</p>"
