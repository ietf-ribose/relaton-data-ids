abstract:
- content: "<p>Vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the
    need for a reliable and secure firmware update mechanism suitable for devices
    with resource constraints. Incorporating such an update mechanism is a fundamental
    requirement for fixing vulnerabilities, but it also enables other important capabilities
    such as updating configuration settings and adding new functionality. In addition
    to the definition of terminology and an architecture, this document provides the
    motivation for the standardization of a manifest format as a transport-agnostic
    means for describing and protecting firmware updates.</p>"
