abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Generic Multiparty Protocol (swift) is a peer-to-peer based\n
    \  transport protocol for content dissemination. It can be used for\n   streaming
    on-demand and live video content, as well as conventional\n   downloading. In
    swift, the clients consuming the content participate\n   in the dissemination
    by forwarding the content to other clients via a\n   mesh-like structure.  It
    is a generic protocol which can run directly\n   on top of UDP, TCP, HTTP or as
    a RTP profile. Features of swift are\n   short time-till-playback and extensibility.
    Hence, it can use\n   different mechanisms to prevent freeriding, and work with
    different\n   peer discovery schemes (centralized trackers or Distributed Hash\n
    \  Tables). Depending on the underlying transport protocol, swift can\n   also
    use different congestion control algorithms, such as LEDBAT, and\n   offer transparent
    NAT traversal. Finally, swift maintains only a\n   small amount of state per peer
    and detects malicious modification of\n   content. This documents describes swift
    and how it satisfies the\n   requirements for the IETF Peer-to-Peer Streaming
    Protocol (PPSP)\n   Working Group's peer protocol.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
