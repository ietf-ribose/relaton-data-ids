abstract:
- content: "<p>Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies with
    characteristics such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth, possibly very small
    packet and application layer data sizes and long battery life operation. This
    memo is an informational overview of the set of LPWAN technologies being considered
    in the IETF and of the gaps that exist between the needs of those technologies
    and the goal of running IP in LPWANs.</p>"
