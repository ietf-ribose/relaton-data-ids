abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to secure pairwise Routing Protocol
    associations using the IKEv2 Key Management Protocol (KMP). Most of the pairwise
    Routing Protocols (RPs) are TCP-based but the framework described here is applicable
    to other pairwise RPs, which not necessarily use the TCP at transport layer. A
    Gatekeeper mechanism is introduced to allow all pairwise RPs to coordinate with
    IKEv2 Protocol to pass the policy, get the keying material and to maintain the
    security associations. The Gatekeeper also allows pairwise RPs which use TCP-AO
    to coordinate with IKEv2 without fundamental modification to either.</p>"
