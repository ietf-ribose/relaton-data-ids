abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely used security protocol\n
    \  that offers communication security services at the transport layer.\n   The
    initial design of TLS was focused on the protection of\n   applications running
    on top of the Transmission Control Protocol\n   (TCP), and was a good match for
    securing the Hypertext Transfer\n   Protocol (HTTP).  The Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP), as\n   a more recent connection-oriented transport protocol,
    also benefits\n   from TLS support.  Subsequent standardization efforts lead to
    the\n   publication of the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol,\n
    \  which allows TLS payloads to be exchanged on top of the User Datagram\n   Protocol
    (UDP), and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).\n\n   TLS can be customized
    in a variety of ways and every feature has a\n   certain cost.  To offer input
    for implementers and system architects\n   this document provides guidance for
    the usage of TLS and DTLS\n   features for smart objects and constraint node networks.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
