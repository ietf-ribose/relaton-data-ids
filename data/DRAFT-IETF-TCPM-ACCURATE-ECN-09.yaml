abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where
    network\n   nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate\n   incipient
    congestion to the end-points.  Receivers with an ECN-\n   capable transport protocol
    feed back this information to the sender.\n   ECN is specified for TCP in such
    a way that only one feedback signal\n   can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time
    (RTT).  Recent new TCP\n   mechanisms like Congestion Exposure (ConEx), Data Center
    TCP (DCTCP)\n   or Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) need more accurate\n
    \  ECN feedback information whenever more than one marking is received\n   in
    one RTT.  This document specifies an experimental scheme to\n   provide more than
    one feedback signal per RTT in the TCP header.\n   Given TCP header space is scarce,
    it allocates a reserved header bit,\n   that was previously used for the ECN-Nonce
    which has now been\n   declared historic.  It also overloads the two existing
    ECN flags in\n   the TCP header.  Supplementary feedback information can optionally
    be\n   provided in a new TCP option, which is never used on the TCP SYN.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
