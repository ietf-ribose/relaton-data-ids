abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Intermediate System To Intermediate System (IS-IS) provides
    efficient\n   and reliable flooding of information to its peers.  However the\n
    \  current flooding scopes are limited to either area wide scope or\n   domain
    wide scope.  There are existing use cases where support of\n   other flooding
    scopes are desirable.  This document defines new\n   Protocol Data Units (PDUs)
    which provide support for new flooding\n   scopes as well as additional space
    for advertising information\n   targeted for the currently supported flooding
    scopes.  This document\n   also defines extended TLVs and sub-TLVs which are encoded
    using 16\n   bit fields for type and length.\n\n   The protocol extensions defined
    in this document are not backwards\n   compatible with existing implementations
    and so must be deployed with\n   care.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
