abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a solution that is able to handle SIPsignaling
    together with NAT enabled firewalls. The intent is to showthat existing firewalls
    do not have to be replaced by 'SIP enabled'ones, instead they will only have to
    be reconfigured slightly.The main feature of this solution is using MGCP from
    a sessioncontrol proxy to open/close holes in an RTP proxy which then enablesRTP
    traffic to flow between interconnected networks.Worth noting is that this solution
    will not only work for SIP, itwill also work for other protocols, such as H.323
    or Real Audio. Itdoes not even have to be RTP that is passed through the RTP proxy,though
    this draft assumes that the RTP stream is accompanied byRTCP. The solution will
    work for any protocol that wishes toopen/close ports dynamically in the RTP proxy
    (maybe it should becalled Forwarding Engine in the general case).</p>"
