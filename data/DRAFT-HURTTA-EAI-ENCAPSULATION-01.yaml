abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   The Email Address Internationalization (EAI) is implemented
    by\n   allowing UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail headers.  To\n   deliver
    email which uses UTF-8 in email headers through EAI non-\n   compliant environment
    converting (i.e downgrading) or encapsulation\n   mechanism is required.  Some
    UTF-8 email may sign email headers or\n   email header fields.  This document
    describes mechanism for\n   encapsulation when converting can not be used because
    of signed email    headers.  Encapsulation may also be used to forward EAI email
    through\n   EAI non-compliant environment that way that original EAI email can
    be\n   recovered.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
