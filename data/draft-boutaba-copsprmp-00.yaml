abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In COPS-PR, the (clients of the) PEPs use special structures, calledPolicy
    Information Bases (PIBs) that store the policies that aresent by the PDPs. PIBs
    are well-defined structures that are notmeant to be modified to adapt to the needs
    of each network. Thismakes COPS-PR PEPs rigid and inflexible. This document describes
    anextension of the COPS-PR protocol that allows the PEPs to storemeta-policies
    that control the content of their PIBs. The set ofmeta-policies that the PEPs
    can store is not predefined andcustomized policies can be supported. The use of
    meta-policiespushes intelligence towards the PEPs and makes them more self-dependent.
    In this way, the model becomes more distributed, scalableand fault-tolerant, while
    the bandwidth consumption and the (real-time) processing load of the PDP are reduced.</p>"
