abstract:
- content: "<p>Group communication with the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    can be secured end-to-end using Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful
    Environments (Group OSCORE), also across untrusted intermediary proxies. However,
    this sidesteps the proxies' abilities to cache responses from the origin server(s).
    This specification restores cacheability of protected responses at proxies, by
    introducing consensus requests which any client in a group can send to one server
    or multiple servers in the same group.</p>"
