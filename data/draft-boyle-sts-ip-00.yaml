abstract:
  content: "<p>A proposal is made to carry Synchronous Transport Signal(STS-N) services
    over packetized networks, in particular over IPnetworks. This has the potential
    to dramatically lower the price,ease the provisioning and grooming, and improve
    managability ofdelivering these types of circuits. Two proposals are put forth
    fordiscussion on how STS services could be transported over an IPnetwork. The
    first proposal, referred to as SPE1/IP, is to break OC-Nsignals down into their
    STS-1 blocks, identify the SPE components andpacketize these for transmission
    across a packet network. The secondproposal, referred to as STSc/IP breaks down
    the STS signal into theunderlying concatenated services and transports configurable
    lengthsegments of the signal to the far end of the data network. Witheither of
    these approaches, different STS-N services on a given portcan be connected to
    different ports across the network and thenetwork will groom them onto the most
    optimal path available.</p>"
