abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a simplified mechanism to use Bidirectional\n
    \  Forwarding Detection (BFD) with large portions of negotiation aspects\n   eliminated,
    thus providing benefits such as quick provisioning as\n   well as improved control
    and flexibility to network nodes initiating\n   the path monitoring.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
