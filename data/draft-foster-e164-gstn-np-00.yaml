abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document provides an overview of E.164 telephone numberportability
    (NP) in the Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN).There are three types of
    number portability: service provider numberportability (SPNP), location portability,
    and service portability.Service provider portability, the focus of the present
    draft, is aregulatory imperative in many countries seeking to liberalize localtelephony
    service competition, by enabling end-users to retain pre-existing telephone numbers
    while changing service providers.Implementation of NP within national GSTN entails
    potentiallysignificant changes to numbering administration, network elementsignaling,
    call routing and processing, billing, service management,and other functions.
    NP changes the fundamental nature of a dialedE.164 number from a hierarchical
    physical routing address to avirtual address, thereby requiring the transparent
    translation ofthe later to the former. In addition, there are various regulatoryconstraints
    which establish relevant parameters for NPimplementation, most of which are not
    network technology specific.Consequently, the implementation of NP behavior consistent
    withapplicable regulatory constraints, as well as the need forinteroperation with
    the existing GSTN NP implementations, arerelevant topics for numerous areas of
    IP telephony work-in-progressat IETF.</p>"
