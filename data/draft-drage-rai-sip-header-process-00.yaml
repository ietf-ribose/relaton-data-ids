abstract:
  content: "<p>RFC 3427 currently defines the process for defining and registeringnew
    SIP header fields. This document proposes that prefixs to headerfield names should
    be discontinued, and that an additional categoryof experimental header field should
    be created. This document alsorelaxes the requirement that response codes are
    defined by standardstrack RFCs, also allowing them to be defined by experimental
    RFCs.</p>"
