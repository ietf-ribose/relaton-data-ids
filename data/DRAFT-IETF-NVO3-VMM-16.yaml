abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes virtual machine (VM) mobility\n   solutions
    commonly used in data centers built with an overlay\n   network. This document
    is intended for describing the\n   solutions and the impact of moving VMs, or
    applications, from\n   one rack to another connected by the overlay network.\n\n
    \  For layer 2, it is based on using an NVA (Network\n   Virtualization Authority)
    to NVE (Network Virtualization\n   Edge) protocol to update ARP (Address Resolution
    Protocol)\n   tables or neighbor cache entries after a VM moves from an old\n
    \  NVE to a new NVE.  For Layer 3, it is based on address and\n   connection migration
    after the move.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
