abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a modular metric calculation system termed Scored\nFair
    Metric Calculation (SFMC). SFMC can be integrated with Link\nState and Distance
    Vector routing protocols and their extensions\n[1,4,5,6,7], enabling them to find
    network paths that support the\nhighest possible number of best metrics across
    a network. SFMC makes\nit possible to support and mix large sets of heterogeneous
    network\nfeatures and capabilities.\nSFMC solves many of the issues inherent in
    routing protocols that\nattempt to use complex sets of metrics by decoupling raw
    metric data\nfrom the input side of routing protocols. Unlike the past, SFMC\nregards
    all metrics all the time, while treating all metrics equally\n(by default).\nAdditionally,
    the SFMC architecture provides a simple and flexible\ninterface for extensive
    manipulation of path selection.\nPlease send comments to ospf@discuss.microsoft.com.\n\n\t
