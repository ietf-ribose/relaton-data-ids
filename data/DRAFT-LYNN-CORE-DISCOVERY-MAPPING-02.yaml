abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Resource and service discovery are complimentary.  Resource
    discovery\n   provides fine-grained detail about the content of a server, while\n
    \  service discovery can provide a scalable method to locate servers in\n   large
    networks.  This document defines a method for mapping between\n   CoRE Link Format
    attributes and DNS-Based Service Discovery fields to\n   allow either method to
    be used to locate service interfaces down to\n   the granularity of function sets
    in mixed HTTP/CoAP environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
