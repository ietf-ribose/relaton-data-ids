abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n
    \  protocol provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without\n   configuration
    in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology, safe\n   forwarding even during
    periods of temporary loops, and support for\n   multipathing of both unicast and
    multicast traffic. TRILL\n   accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System
    to Intermediate\n   System) link state routing and by encapsulating traffic using
    a\n   header that includes a hop count. Since the TRILL base protocol was\n   approved
    in March 2010, active development of TRILL has revealed a\n   few errata in the
    original RFC 6325 and some cases that could use\n   clarifications or updates.\n\n
    \  RFC 6327 and RFC 6439 provide clarifications and updates with respect\n   to
    Adjacency and Appointed Forwarders. This document provide other\n   known clarifications,
    corrections, and updates to RFC 6325, RFC 6327,\n   and RFC 6439.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
