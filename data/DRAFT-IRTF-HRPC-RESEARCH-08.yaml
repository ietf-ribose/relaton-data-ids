abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document aims to propose guidelines for human rights\n
    \  considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for\n   privacy
    considerations [RFC6973].  This is achieved by providing a\n   proposal for a
    vocabulary to discuss the relation between human\n   rights and Internet protocols,
    an overview of the discussion in\n   technical and academic literature and communities,
    a proposal for the\n   mapping of the relation between human rights and technical
    concepts,\n   as well as guidelines.\n\n   If you want to see how to apply this
    work to your own, you can\n   directly go to Section 6.  The rest of the document
    explains the\n   background of the guidelines and how they were developed.\n\n
    \  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\n   published
    for informational purposes.\n\n   This document is a product of the Internet Research
    Task Force\n   (IRTF).  The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-related research\n
    \  and development activities.  This documents aims to be a consensus\n   document
    of the Human Rights Protocol Consideration Research Group of\n   the Internet
    Research Task Force (IRTF).\n\n   Discussion of this draft at: hrpc@irtf.org //\n
