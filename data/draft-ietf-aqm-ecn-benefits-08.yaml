abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of this document is to describe the potential benefits of
    applications using a transport that enables Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).
    The document outlines the principal gains in terms of increased throughput, reduced
    delay, and other benefits when ECN is used over a network path that includes equipment
    that supports Congestion Experienced (CE) marking. It also discusses challenges
    for successful deployment of ECN. It does not propose new algorithms to use ECN
    nor does it describe the details of implementation of ECN in endpoint devices
    (Internet hosts), routers, or other network devices.</p>"
