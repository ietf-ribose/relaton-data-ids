abstract:
  content: "<p>The SIMPLE working group has been debating the issue of the IMsession
    model for quite some time. The primary issue is whattransport to use for the IMs
    once the session is established withSIP. Proposals have included the SIP MESSAGE
    request itself, IMSX,and a SIP spin-off, called IMTP. The usage of SIP MESSAGE,
    the veryfirst proposal, had been rejected by the group because of severaltechnical
    issues. This document revists that decision, based on therecent enhancements made
    to SIP itself. We believe that SIP MESSAGEnow represents the ideal transport choice
    for the IM session model.</p>"
