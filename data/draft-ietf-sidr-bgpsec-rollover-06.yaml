abstract:
- content: "<p>BGPsec will need to address the impact from regular and emergency rollover
    processes for the BGPsec End-Entity (EE) certificates that will be performed by
    Certificate Authorities (CAs) participating at the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI). Rollovers of BGPsec EE certificates must be carefully managed in order
    to synchronize distribution of router public keys and the usage of those pubic
    keys by BGPsec routers. This document provides general recommendations for that
    process, as well as describing reasons why the rollover of BGPsec EE certificates
    might be necessary.</p>"
