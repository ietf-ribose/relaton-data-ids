abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a REST interface based on the RATS architecture\n
    \  that can be used to retrieve attested system state, for example the\n   reading
    of a security critical sensor.  The objective is to present a\n   common vocabulary
    of data formats and basic protocol transactions\n   that can be pieced together
    into a cohesive interface that is capable\n   of serving different attestation
    workflows.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
