abstract:
- content: "<p>The dominant protocol for name resolution on the Internet is the Domain
    Name System (DNS). However, other protocols exist that are fundamentally different
    from the DNS, and may or may not share the same namespace. When an end-user triggers
    resolution of a name on a system that supports multiple, different protocols (or
    resolution mechanisms), it is desirable that the protocol used is unambiguous,
    and that requests intended for one protocol are not inadvertently answered using
    another. RFC 6761 introduced a framework by which a particular domain name could
    be acknowledged as being special. Various challenges have become apparent with
    this application of the guidance provided in RFC 6761. This document aims to document
    those challenges in the form of a problem statement in order to facilitate further
    discussion of potential solutions.</p>"
