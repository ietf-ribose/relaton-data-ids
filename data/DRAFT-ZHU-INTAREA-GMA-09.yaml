abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Today, a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple\n
    \  networks, e.g. Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, and DSL. It is desirable to combine\n   them
    seamlessly below transport layer (L4) to improve quality of\n   experience for
    applications that do not have such (multi-path)\n   capability built in. Such
    optimization requires additional control\n   information, e.g. Sequence Number,
    in each (IP) data packet. This\n   document presents a new light weight and flexible
    encapsulation\n   protocol for this need. The solution has been developed by the\n
    \  authors based on their experiences in multiple standards bodies\n   including
    the IETF and 3GPP, is not an Internet Standard and does\n   not represent the
    consensus opinion of the IETF. This document\n   will enable other developers
    to build interoperable\n   implementations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
