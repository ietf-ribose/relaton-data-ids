abstract:
- content: "<p>VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP, wherein the
    packet header is at least 40 bytes, while the voice payload is typically no more
    than 30 bytes. VoIP header compression can significantly reduce the VoIP overhead
    through various compression mechanisms. This is important on access links where
    bandwidth is scarce, and can be important on backbone facilities, especially where
    costs are high (e.g., some global cross-sections). In this draft we propose to
    re-use the methods in cRTP to determine the header compression context and to
    use the cRTP session context ID to route a compressed packet between the ingress
    and egress routers.</p>"
