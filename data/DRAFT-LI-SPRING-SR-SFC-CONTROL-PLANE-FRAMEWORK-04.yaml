abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end\n
    \  paths by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, called\n   \"segments\".
    \ Segment routing architecture can be implemented over an\n   MPLS data plane
    as well as an IPv6 data plane.\n\n   Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides
    support for the creation of\n   composite services that consist of an ordered
    set of Service\n   Functions (SF) that are to be applied to packets and/or frames\n
    \  selected as a result of classification.\n\n   SFC can be implemented based
    on several technologies, such as Network\n   Service Header (NSH) and SR.  This
    document describes a framework for\n   constructing SFC based on Segment Routing.
    \ The document reviews the\n   control plane solutions for route distribution
    of service function\n   instance and service function path, and steering packets
    into a\n   service function chain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
