abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPv6 Multihoming design help host(s) in a site to switch dynamically\nbetween
    multiple attached global internet without impacting\ntransport and application
    layer protocol whenever failure occur.\nBasic issue on this design when ipv-to-ipv6
    Network prefix\ntranslations not being used are:-\n1. Source addresses selection,
    2. Next hop selection and\n3. DNS resolution.\nEven though Ipv6-to-Ipv6 Network
    prefix translation (NPTv6) solve\nabove mention problems, NPTv6 not ideal as it's
    not achieve\nEnd-to-End transparency of connectivity .Alternatively by using\npolicy
    at End host to select source address and next hop also\nsolve above mention issues.\nThis
    document proposes solution which defines how automatically a\npolicy can be enforced
    on host by first hop router using router\nadvertisement. That's reduced administrative
    effort of updating policy\non all hosts in site. This document not obsolete any
    of the previous\nwork, only propose how policy on End-host can be enforce from
    router\nby mapping destination prefix with DNS via Router Advertisement.\n\n\n\n\t
