abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks, network performance data such as packet
    loss,\n   delay and delay variation (jitter) is a critical measure for traffic\n
    \  engineering (TE).  This data provides operators the characteristics\n   of
    their networks for performance evaluation that is required to\n   ensure the Service
    Level Agreements (SLAs).  Performance measurement\n   (PM) mechanisms can be employed
    to monitor these metrics for TE Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs) in real-time.
    \ This document describes Path\n   Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) extensions
    for reporting such\n   performance measurements to an Active Stateful PCE.\n\n\n\t
