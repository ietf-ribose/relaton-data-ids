abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Hosts experiencing rapid link-layer changes may require further\n
    \  configuration change detection procedures than more traditional fixed\n   hosts.
    \ Detecting Network Attachment is a set of strategies for\n   determining configuration
    validity in wireless or rapidly changing\n   environments.  This document details
    best current practice for\n   Detecting Network Attachment in IPv6 hosts using
    Neighbor Discovery\n   procedures.\n\t </p>\n      "
