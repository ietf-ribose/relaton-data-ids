  content: "\n\t <p>   Inband Flow Analyzer (IFA) records flow specific information
    from an\n   end station and/or switches across a network.  This document\n   discusses
    the method to collect data on a per hop basis across a\n   network and perform
    localized or end to end analytics operations on\n   the data.  This document also
    describes a transport-agnostic header\n   definition that may be used for tunneled
    and non-tunneled flows\n   alike.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
