abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) is used to convey
    path\ncomputation requests and responses between Path Computation Clients\n(PCCs)
    and Path Computation Elements (PCEs), and also between\ncooperating PCEs. In PCEP
    the path computation requests carry details\nof the constraints and objective
    functions that the PCC wishes the\nPCE to apply in its computation.\n\nThe mechanisms
    defined for indicating objective functions include\nthe capability to convey vendor-specific
    objective functions. This\ndocument defines a facility to carry vendor-specific
    constraints in\nPCEP.\n\t </p>\n      "
