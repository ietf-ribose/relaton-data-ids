abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo specifies 6rd's multicast component so that IPv6 hosts can
    receive multicast data from IPv6 servers. In AMT based encapsulation solution,
    AMT Gateway at the 6rd Customer Edge router uses AMT protocol to establish a tunnel
    interface with AMT Relay at the 6rd Border Relay and this tunnel is used to exchange
    MLD messages to establish multicast state at AMT Relay so that AMT Relay can tunnel
    IPv6 multicast data to IPv6 hosts connected to AMT Gateway. In 6rd Translation
    Multicast based solution, the protocol is based on proxying MLD at the 6rd Customer
    Edge router and then translating MLD messages to IGMP messages and sending them
    upstream to a network which supports IPv4 multicast. 6rd Border Relay is multicast
    router and IGMP-MLD translator. It translates IGMP join back to MLD join message
    and sends it to multicast source. IPv6 Multicast data received at 6rd Border Relay
    is translated into IPv4 multicast data and then sent to IPv4 multicast tree downstream
    to 6rd Customer Edge which translates back to IPv6 multicast data then delivers
    to the hosts.</p>"
