abstract:
- content: <p>JMAP ([RFC8620] - JSON Meta Application Protocol) is a generic protocol
    for synchronising data, such as mail, calendars or contacts, between a client
    and a server. It is optimised for mobile and web environments, and aims to provide
    a consistent interface to different data types. JMAP for Mail ([RFC8621] - The
    JSON Meta Application Protocol (JMAP) for Mail) specifies a data model for synchronising
    email data with a server using JMAP. Clients can use this to efficiently search,
    access, organise, and send messages. MDN are defined in [RFC8098] and are used
    as "read receipts", "acknowledgements", or "receipt notifications". MDN have a
    specific format that must be parsed or generated. The goal of this document is
    to specify a data model for handling MDN messages with a server using JMAP.</p>
