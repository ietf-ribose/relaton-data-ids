abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Authorization is a key component in conference policy.  Authorization\n
    \  rules specify who is allowed to join a conference, see floors and\n   request
    them, subscribe to conference-information and so on.  This\n   document proposes
    an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document format\n   for conference authorization
    rules.\n\n   This draft is intended for discussion purposes only, and in case
    this\n   approach is taken, it would need to be merged with the on-going\n   Conference
    Policy Control Protocol (CPCP) work.\n\t </p>\n      "
