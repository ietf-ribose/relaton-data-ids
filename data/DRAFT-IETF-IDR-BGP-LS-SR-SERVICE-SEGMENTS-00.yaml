abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service functions are deployed as, physical or virtualized
    elements\n   along with network nodes or on servers in data centers.  Segment\n
    \  Routing (SR) brings in the concept of segments which can be\n   topological
    or service instructions.  Service segments are SR\n   segments that are associated
    with service functions.  SR Policies are\n   used for the setup of paths for steering
    of traffic through service\n   functions using their service segments.\n\n   BGP
    Link-State (BGP-LS) enables distribution of topology information\n   from the
    network to a controller or an application in general so it\n   can learn the network
    topology.  This document specifies the\n   extensions to BGP-LS for the advertisement
    of service functions along\n   their associated service segments.  The BGP-LS
    advertisement of\n   service function information along with the network nodes
    that they\n   are attached to, or associated with, enables controllers compute
    and\n   setup service paths in the network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
