    IP for providing seamless mobility in the Internet. By use ofSCTP (Stream Control
    Transmission Protocol) and some of its currentlyproposed extensions a seamless
    handover can be fully accomplished inthe mobile client without any provisions
    in the network, onlyassisted by functions embedded in Mobile SCTP enabled servers.Client
    mobility management based on Mobile SCTP seems not to requireany new protocol
    development. It is a particular application of SCTPeventually solving the requirements
    of transport layer mobility inthe Internet.</p>"
