abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CUBIC is a standard TCP congestion control algorithm that uses
    a\n   cubic function instead of the linear window increase function on the\n   sender
    side to improve scalability and stability over fast and long-\n   distance networks.
    \ CUBIC has been adopted as the default TCP\n   congestion control algorithm by
    the Linux, Windows, and Apple stacks.\n\n   This document updates the specification
    of CUBIC to include\n   algorithmic improvements based on these implementations
    and recent\n   academic work.  Based on the extensive deployment experience with\n
    \  CUBIC, it also moves the specification to the Standards Track,\n   obsoleting
    RFC 8312.  This also requires updating RFC 5681, to allow\n   for CUBIC's occasionally
    more aggressive sending behavior.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
