abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [I-D.peng-teas-network-slicing] defines an unified TN-slice\n
    \  identifier, i.e., AII(administrative instance identifier) and related\n   processing
    combined with Segment Routing technology, for the purpose\n   of unified identification
    of topology, computing, storage resources,\n   unified partition of L2 and L3
    link resources, unified basis of\n   underlay path selection within or between
    domains, and unified flow\n   steering rule with SR policy color scheme.  This
    document describes\n   the ISIS extensions required to support Packet Network
    Slicing over\n   IPv6 dataplane.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
