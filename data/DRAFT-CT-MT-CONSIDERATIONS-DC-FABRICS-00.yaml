  content: "\n\t <p>   This document analyzes IS-IS Multi Topology (MT) considerations
    in\n   general and specific to layer-3 Data Center (DC) proposals based on\n   IS-IS
    protocol.  This document explores various IS-IS address\n   families, topologies
    and considerations while choosing the right\n   combination for a specific DC
    deployment.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
