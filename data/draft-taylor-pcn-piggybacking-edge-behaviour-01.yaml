abstract:
  content: <p>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality ofservice
    for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. Theoverall PCN architecture
    is described in RFC 5559. This memodescribes a behaviour for PCN egress nodes
    known as the"piggybacking" edge behaviour, because it "piggybacks" PCNinformation
    in resource signalling messages. This version of thememo describes two alternatives,
    where piggybacking is derived fromthe CL edge behaviour and where it is derived
    from the SM edgebehaviour. The SM and CL edge behaviours are specified in companiondocuments.</p>
