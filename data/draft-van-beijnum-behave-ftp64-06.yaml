abstract:
  content: "<p>The File Transfer Protocol has a very long history, and despite thefact
    that today, other options exist to perform file transfers, FTPis still in common
    use. As such, it is important that in thesituation where some client computers
    are IPv6-only while manyservers are still IPv4-only and IPv6-to-IPv4 translators
    are used tobridge that gap, FTP is made to work through these translators asbest
    it can.FTP has an active and a passive mode, both as original commands thatare
    IPv4-specific, and as extended, IP version agnostic commands.The only FTP mode
    that works without changes through an IPv6-to-IPv4translator is extended passive.
    However, many existing FTP serversdon't support this mode, and some clients don't
    ask for it. Thisdocument describes server, client and middlebox (if any) behaviorthat
    minimizes this problem.</p>"
