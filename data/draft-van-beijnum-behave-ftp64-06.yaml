abstract:
- content: "<p>The File Transfer Protocol has a very long history, and despite the
    fact that today, other options exist to perform file transfers, FTP is still in
    common use. As such, it is important that in the situation where some client computers
    are IPv6-only while many servers are still IPv4-only and IPv6-to-IPv4 translators
    are used to bridge that gap, FTP is made to work through these translators as
    best it can. FTP has an active and a passive mode, both as original commands that
    are IPv4-specific, and as extended, IP version agnostic commands. The only FTP
    mode that works without changes through an IPv6-to-IPv4 translator is extended
    passive. However, many existing FTP servers don't support this mode, and some
    clients don't ask for it. This document describes server, client and middlebox
    (if any) behavior that minimizes this problem.</p>"
