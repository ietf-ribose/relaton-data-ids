abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary\n
    \  to be able to manipulate some RTP parameters, while still providing\n   strong
    end-to-end security guarantees.  This document defines SRTP\n   procedures that
    use two separate but related cryptographic operations\n   to provide hop-by-hop
    and end-to-end security guarantees.  Both the\n   end-to-end and hop-by-hop cryptographic
    algorithms can utilize an\n   authenticated encryption with associated data scheme
    or take\n   advantage of future SRTP transforms with different properties.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
