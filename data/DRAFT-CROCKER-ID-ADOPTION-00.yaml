abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The productive output of IETF working groups is documents,
    as\n   mandated by the working group's charter.  Working groups develop\n   these
    documents based on initial input of varying levels of maturity.\n   An initial
    working group draft might be a document already in wide\n   use, or it might be
    a blank sheet, wholly created by the workiing\n   group, or it might represent
    any level of maturity in between.  This\n   document discusses the process of
    creating formal working group\n   drafts that are targeted for publication.\n\n\t
