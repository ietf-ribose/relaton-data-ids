abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a system for the forwarding of encrypted
    HTTP\n   messages.  This allows a client to make multiple requests of a server\n
    \  without the server being able to link those requests to the client or\n   to
    identify the requests as having come from the same client.\n\nDiscussion Venues\n\n
    \  This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Source for this
    draft and an issue tracker can be found at\n   https://github.com/unicorn-wg/oblivious-http.\n\n\t
