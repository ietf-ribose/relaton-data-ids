abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo proposes a secure multicast plane between PIM-SM domains
    \nthrough a MSDP bridge. The MSDP bridge is the MSDP peering topology \nwith a
    GRE tunnel associated with each pair of MSDP routers. A \nmulticast protocol such
    as DVMRP, PIM-DM or BGMP runs over the MSDP \nbridge to forward secure multicast
    data in the global key space. As \na RP, each security broker in an interested
    domain translates the \ndata from the MSDP bridge to the local domain and forwards
    the data \nin the local key space. \nThis approach is perceived as a transitional
    solution to the \nmulticast security between PIM-SM domains. It will enable group
    \nsecurity association to differ from one shared tree to another, and \nwill essentially
    facilitate group key distribution.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
