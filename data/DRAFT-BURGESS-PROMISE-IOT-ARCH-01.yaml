abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes architectural recommendations for a unified\n
    \  concept of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things, based on tried and\n   tested
    principles from infrastructure science.  We describe a\n   functional service
    architecture that may be applied in the manner of\n   a platform, from the smallest
    scale to the largest scale, using\n   vendor agnostic principles.  The current
    draft is rooted in the\n   principles of Promise Theory[Bergstra1] and voluntary
    cooperation.\n\t </p>\n      "
