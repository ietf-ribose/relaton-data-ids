abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for DNS names of
    Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as appliances and sensors. By this scheme,
    the DNS name of an IoT device can be autoconfigured with the device's category
    and model in a network such as home network and office network. This DNS name
    lets IoT users (e.g., home residents) easily identify each device for monitoring
    and remote-controlling it in the network.</p>"
