abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cryptographic operations like hashing and signing requires
    that the\n   original data does not change during serialization or parsing.  One\n
    \  way addressing this issue is creating a canonical form of the data.\n   Canonicalization
    also permits data to be exchanged in its original\n   form on the \"wire\" while
    still being subject to secure cryptographic\n   operations.  The JSON Canonicalization
    Scheme (JCS) provides\n   canonicalization support for data in the JSON format
    by building on\n   the strict serialization methods for JSON primitives defined
    by\n   ECMAScript, constraining JSON data to the I-JSON subset, and through\n
    \  a deterministic property sorting scheme.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
