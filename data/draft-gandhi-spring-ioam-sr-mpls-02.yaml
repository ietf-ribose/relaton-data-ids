abstract:
- content: "<p>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
    operational and telemetry information in the data packet while the packet traverses
    a path between two nodes in the network. Segment Routing (SR) technology leverages
    the source routing paradigm. This document defines how IOAM data fields are transported
    with the Segment Routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) encapsulation. The procedures
    defined are also equally applicable to all other MPLS data plane encapsulations.</p>"
