abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines the Passive Performance Metrics sub-registry
    of the\n   Performance Metric Registry.  This sub-registry will contain Passive\n
    \  Performance Metrics, especially those defined in RFCs prepared in the\n   IP
    Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF, and possibly\n   applicable
    to other IETF metrics.\n\n   IPPM Passive metric registration is meant to allow
    wider adoption of\n   common metrics in an inter-operable way.  There are challenges
    with\n   metric interoperability and adoption (to name a few) due to flexible\n
    \  input parameters, confusion between many similar metrics, and varying\n   output
    formats.\n\n   This memo proposes a way to organize registry entries into columns\n
    \  that are well-defined, permitting consistent development of entries\n   over
    time (a column may marked NA if it is not applicable for that\n   metric).  The
    design is intended to foster development of registry\n   entries based on existing
    reference RFCs, whilst each column serves\n   as a check-list item to avoid omissions
    during the registration\n   process.  Every entry in the registry, before IANA
    action, requires\n   Expert review as defined by concurrent IETF work in progress\n
    \  \"Registry for Performance Metrics\" (draft-manyfolks-ippm-metric-\n   registry).\n\n
    \  The document contains example entries for the Passive Performance\n   Metrics
    sub-registry: a registry entry for a passive metric based on\n   octetTotalCount
    as defined in RFC5102 and a protocol specific passive\n   metric based on RTP
    packets lost as defined in RFC3550.  The examples\n   are for Informational purposes
    and do not create any entry in the\n   IANA registry.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
