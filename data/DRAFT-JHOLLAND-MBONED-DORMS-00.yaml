abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines DORMS (Discovery Of Restconf Metadata
    for\n   Source-specific multicast), a method to discover and retrieve\n   extensible
    metadata about source-specific multicast channels using\n   RESTCONF.  The reverse
    IP DNS zone for a multicast sender's IP\n   address is configured to use SRV resource
    records to advertise the\n   hostname of a RESTCONF server that publishes metadata
    according to a\n   new YANG module with support for extensions.  A new service
    name and\n   the new YANG module are defined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
