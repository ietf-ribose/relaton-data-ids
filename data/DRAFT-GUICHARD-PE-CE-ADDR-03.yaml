abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes to allocate a block of globally unique
    IPv4   \naddresses for the exclusive use of Service Providers that provide   \n[L3VPN]
    based Services. The Service Provider may use these addresses   \nfor the provisioning
    of IP addresses to the links that connect   \nCustomer Edge (CE) routers with
    Provider Edge (PE) routers (PE-CE   \nlinks), and/or for the IP addressing of
    attached CE routers.  \nThe main motivation for this proposal is to simplify the
    Service \nProviders' operations in the scenario where they monitor PE-CE links,
    \nand/or CE-routers, while at the same time conserving IPv4 address \nspace.  \nThis
    addressing scheme is not intended for use by VPNs that span    \nmore than one
    Service Provider, unless co-operation of addressing   \nstructure is maintained
    to ensure uniqueness of addresses between   \nproviders. Furthermore, although
    the main reference within this draft \nis related to services provided by [L3VPN],
    the recommendations \nformulated herein may also apply to other Layer-2 or Layer-3
    VPN \narchitectures.\n\t </p>\n      "
