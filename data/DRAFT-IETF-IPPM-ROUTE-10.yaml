abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo introduces an advanced unidirectional route assessment\n
    \  (AURA) metric and associated measurement methodology, based on the IP\n   Performance
    Metrics (IPPM) Framework RFC 2330.  This memo updates RFC\n   2330 in the areas
    of path-related terminology and path description,\n   primarily to include the
    possibility of parallel subpaths between a\n   given Source and Destination pair,
    owing to the presence of multi-\n   path technologies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
