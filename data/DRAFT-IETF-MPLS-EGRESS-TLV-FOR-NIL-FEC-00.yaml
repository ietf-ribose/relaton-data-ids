abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MPLS ping and traceroute mechanism as described in RFC 8029
    and\n   related extensions for SR as defined in RFC 8287 is very useful to\n   precisely
    validate the control plane and data plane synchronization.\n   There is a possibility
    that all intermediate or transit nodes may not\n   have been upgraded to support
    these validation procedures.  A simple\n   mpls ping and traceroute mechanism
    comprises of ability to traverse\n   any path without having to validate the control
    plane state.  RFC\n   8029 supports this mechanism with Nil FEC.  The procedures
    described\n   in RFC 8029 are mostly applicable when the Nil FEC is used as\n
    \  intermediate FEC in the label stack.  When all labels in label stack\n   are
    represented using single Nil FEC, it poses some challenges.\n\n   This document
    introduces new TLV as additional extension to exisiting\n   Nil FEC and describes
    mpls ping and traceroute procedures using Nil\n   FEC with this additional extensions
    to overcome these challenges.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
