abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization (ALTO), and different applications may use different\n   cost
    metrics.  Since the ALTO base protocol (RFC 7285) defines only a\n   single cost
    metric (i.e., the generic \"routingcost\" metric), if an\n   application wants
    to issue a cost map or an endpoint cost request to\n   determine the resource
    provider that offers better delay performance,\n   the base protocol does not
    define the cost metric to be used.\n\n   This document addresses the issue by
    introducing network performance\n   metrics, including network delay, jitter,
    packet loss rate, hop\n   count, and bandwidth.\n\n   There are multiple sources
    (e.g., estimation based on measurements or\n   service-level agreement) to derive
    a performance metric.  This\n   document introduces an additional \"cost-context\"
    field to the ALTO\n   \"cost-type\" field to convey the source of a performance
    metric.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
