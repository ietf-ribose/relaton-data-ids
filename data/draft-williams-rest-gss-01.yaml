abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a method for application-layer authentication
    in Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) applications using Generic Security Services
    Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) mechanisms via, for simplicity, the
    Simple Authentication and Security Layers (SASL) mechanism bridge known as "GS2".
    This approach to authentication allows for pluggability, mutual authentication,
    and channel binding, all with no changes to HTTP nor the Transport Layer Security
    (TLS). We hope that the use of mutual authentication and channel binding at the
    application layer will make phishing more difficult. We hope that the use of authentication
    at the application layer will make REST-GSS deployable.</p>
