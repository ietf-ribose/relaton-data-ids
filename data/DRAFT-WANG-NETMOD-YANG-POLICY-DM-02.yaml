abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a YANG data model for network policies
    using\n   Language Abstractions defined in RFC6095.  The model intends to be\n
    \  applied to deliver various different network services by controlling\n   the
    policies that enable features such as QoS, Security, etc.  In\n   future, the
    core data model could be augmented by additional YANG\n   data modules modeling
    and configuring policy-related protocols and\n   functions.  The policy data model
    described in this document provides\n   common building blocks for such extensions.\n\n
    \  Earlier revisions of this document were written to trigger discussion\n   with
    operator community at IETF-92 in Dallas.  This document has been\n   updated to
    reflect the limited conclusions of those discussions and\n   record them for archival
    purposes.  There is no intent to advance\n   this document any further toward
    publication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
