abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Group communication over the Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP)\n   can be secured by means of Object Security for Constrained RESTful\n
    \  Environments (OSCORE).  At deployment time, devices may not know the\n   exact
    OSCORE groups to join, the respective Group Manager, or other\n   information
    required to perform the joining process.  This document\n   describes how CoAP
    endpoints can use the CoRE Resource Directory to\n   discover OSCORE groups and
    acquire information to join them through\n   their respective Group Manager.  This
    approach is consistent with,\n   but not limited to, the joining of OSCORE groups
    based on the ACE\n   framework for Authentication and Authorization.\n\n\t </p>\n
