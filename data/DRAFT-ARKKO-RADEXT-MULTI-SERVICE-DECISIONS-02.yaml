abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft relates to the use of Authentication, Authorization,
    and\n   Accounting (AAA) where the same user credentials can be used on many\n
    \  different types of devices, ranging from wireless access points to\n   Virtual
    Private Network (VPN) gateways.  This draft discusses how to\n   use existing
    AAA and authentication protocols and extensions to\n   determine what service
    was provided, agree about this among all the\n   participating parties, and use
    this information as a basis for policy\n   decisions.\n\t </p>\n      "
