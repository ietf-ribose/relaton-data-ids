abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many large-scale service provider networks use some form of
    scale-out\n   architecture at peering sites.  In such an architecture, each\n
    \  participating Autonomous System (AS) deploys multiple independent\n   Autonomous
    System Border Routers (ASBRs) for peering, and Equal Cost\n   Multi-Path (ECMP)
    load balancing is used between them.  There are\n   numerous benefits to this
    architecture, including but not limited to\n   N+1 redundancy and the ability
    to flexibly increase capacity as\n   needed.  A cost of this architecture is an
    increase in the amount of\n   state in both the control and data planes.  This
    has negative\n   consequences for network convergence time and scale.\n\n   In
    this document we describe how to mitigate these negative\n   consequences through
    configuration of the routing protocols, both BGP\n   and IGP, to utilize what
    we term the \"Abstract Next-Hop\" (ANH).  Use\n   of ANH allows us to both reduce
    the number of BGP paths in the\n   control plane and enable rapid path invalidation
    (hence, network\n   convergence and traffic restoration).  We require no new protocol\n
    \  features to achieve these benefits.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
