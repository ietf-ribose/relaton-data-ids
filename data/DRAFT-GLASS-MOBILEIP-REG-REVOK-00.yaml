abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>During the original design of Mobile IP, the potential need for
    an\nadministrative domain to be able to actively revoke a current Mobile\nIP registration
    was recognized.  Due to the lack of a specific\nscenario requiring such a mechanism,
    it was decided that a passive\nmechanism, namely short registration lifetimes,
    and the denial of a\nsubsequent registration from a MN, would be sufficient for
    this\npurpose.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
