abstract:
- content: <p>Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) provides a service for transmission
    of IPv6 packets larger than 65,535 octets known as "jumbograms". Such large packets
    are not eligible for fragmentation, and the current specification forbids the
    inclusion of a fragment header of any kind. However, some implementations may
    wish to include an Identification value with each jumbogram; hence this document
    proposes the transmission of IPv6 jumbograms as "atomic fragments".</p>
