abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization (ALTO), and different applications may use different\n   types
    of cost metric.  Since the ALTO base protocol (RFC 7285)\n   defines only a single
    cost metric (namely, the generic \"routingcost\"\n   metric), if an application
    wants to issue a cost map or an endpoint\n   cost request in order to identify
    a resource provider that offers a\n   better delay performance, the base protocol
    does not define the cost\n   metric to be used.\n\n   This document addresses
    this issue by extending the specification to\n   provide a variety of network
    performance metrics, including network\n   delay, delay variation (jitter), packet
    loss rate, hop count, and\n   bandwidth.\n\n   There are multiple sources (e.g.,
    estimation based on measurements or\n   service-level agreement) to derive a performance
    metric.  This\n   document introduces an additional \"cost-context\" field to
    the ALTO\n   \"cost-type\" field to convey the source of a performance metric.\n\n\n\t
