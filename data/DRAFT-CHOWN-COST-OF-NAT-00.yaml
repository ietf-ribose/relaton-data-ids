abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The deployment of IP Network Address Translators (NATs) for IPv4
    has\nbecome very pervasive in the last 10-12 years.  The original goal of\nNAT
    was to conserve IP address space, but the technology has now\nbecome very popular
    in home and SOHO type networks, as well as many\nlarger organisations, for a variety
    of reasons.  At the same time,\nthe introduction of NAT adds a cost for application
    and service\ndevelopers.  This document presents a brief overview of the history\nof
    NAT, alongside a list of ongoing work related to NAT workarounds\nfor current
    IETF protocol designs.  The document intends to present a\nneutral view of the
    cost of NAT for discussion in the IETF and wider\ncommunity.\n\t </p>\n      "
