abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Perhaps the most intrusive form of Internet mail abuse, the\n
    \  unsolicited mail problem is a chronic aggravation that users are\n   generally
    powerless to stop or prevent.  Many forums have played\n   host to endless criticism
    of the problem, particularly leveled\n   against those who engage in the activity
    and their tactics, but few\n   solutions have come to the forefront that provide
    users an adequate\n   defense.  While economic and social influences define the
    human\n   side of the problem, the permissiveness of the Internet mail\n   architecture
    with regard to the freedoms it grants senders, as well\n   as the fixed relationship
    between mailbox and address, are the\n   critical factors that provide opportunity
    to those who would abuse\n   it.\n\t </p>\n      "
