abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes how to provide enhanced Internet connectivityto
    mobile ad hoc networks. To achieve this goal, we borrow theconcept of Mobile IPv6
    and make the most use of available multiplegateways. Specifically, our scheme
    makes a global address being usedby Upper layer reachable by peer Internet node
    by registering anotherglobal address as a locator with corresponding gateway for
    theaddress being cared while the gateway can not obtain host routeinformation
    for the cared address because of frequent partitions.We introduce stateful auto-configuration
    for acquisition of globaladdress in mobile ad-hoc networks because it can avoid
    duplicateaddress problem and help prevent traffics from going outside a manetor
    unnecessary control traffic by route discovery of reactive routingprotocols from
    being issued. In addition, it can support for ourscheme since our scheme requires
    some security guarantee to registera locator with a gateway as Mobile IPv6 requires
    for Binding Updates.Basically, our extended support and stateful configuration
    of globaladdress are devised to extend AODV, but the concept is alsoapplicable
    for proactive routing protocols such as OLSR, TBRPF.Further, our extended support
    can be useful for a mobile node(MN) inMobile IPv6 to maintain its reachability
    from the Internet byutilizing multi-hop manet extension as a virtual link since
    it canhelp determine intelligently when current CoA should be changed andBinding
    Update with new CoA be performed while it can make thecurrent CoA reachable from
    Internet even when the GW which assignedthe CoA is not reachable from the manet
    node any more.</p>"
