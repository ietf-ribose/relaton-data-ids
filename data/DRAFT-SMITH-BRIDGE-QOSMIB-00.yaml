abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes a SMIv2 MIB module for a device implementing\nbridging
    functions with Quality-of-Service mechanisms similar to those\ndescribed for the
    Differentiated Services Architecture [DSARCH] which\nare described in detail by
    the Differentiated Services Router Conceptual\nModel [MODEL].  A MIB module for
    routers, the Diffserv MIB [DSMIB], has\nbeen developed that uses this model. The
    MIB module defined in this memo\nis designed to work in conjunction with that
    module: it defines usage\nfor objects in that module and defines some new objects
    specific to MAC-\nlayer bridges (a.k.a. Layer-2 switches). Specifically, if defines\nlayer-2
    classifier and packet marking functionality.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
