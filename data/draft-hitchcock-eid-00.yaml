abstract:
- content: "<p>There has been an ongoing debate on the Big Internet list over the
    past year over whether abstracting the concept of Endpoint Identifier (EID) from
    the concept of address which has significance in the topology of the network.
    This draft attempts to summarize the arguments pro and con as well as some discussion
    of whether the EID should be in the network layer or elsewhere. This draft also
    contains a specific proposal for EID format with a discussion of the pros and
    cons of this choice.</p>"
