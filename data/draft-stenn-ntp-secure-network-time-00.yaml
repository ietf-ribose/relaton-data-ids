abstract:
- content: "<p>The proposal specifies a means for NTP instances that can establish
    a TCP connection between themselves to create secure ephemeral keys. With the
    known weaknesses of the public-key security protocol, Autokey, which is defined
    by RFC 5906 [RFC5906], a replacement for Autokey that supports at least Client/Server
    and Symmetric modes must be provided.</p>"
