abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines several mechanisms which can be used
    by a\n   client such as a Mail User Agent or Mail Submission Agent, to query\n
    \  an SMTP server which is configured to accept incoming mail for a mail\n   domain,
    to obtain information associated with an email address based\n   in that domain.
    \ Among other purposes, these mechanisms are intended\n   to facilitate discovery
    of senders' and/or recipients' public keys\n   for use in automatic verification
    of whole-message digital signatures\n   and automatic whole-message encryption
    of email sent to recipients.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
