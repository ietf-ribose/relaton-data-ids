abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a framework for a protocol to enable devices
    in a telepresence conference to interoperate.  The protocol enables communication
    of information about multiple media streams so a sending system and receiving
    system can make reasonable decisions about transmitting, selecting, and rendering
    the media streams.  This protocol is used in addition to SIP signaling and Session
    Description Protocol (SDP) negotiation for setting up a telepresence session.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
