abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Route Leaks are propagation of BGP prefixes which violate assumptions\n
    \  of BGP topology relationships; e.g. passing a route learned from one\n   peer
    to another peer or to a transit provider, passing a route\n   learned from one
    transit provider to another transit provider or to a\n   peer.  Today, approaches
    to leak prevention rely on marking routes\n   according to some configuration
    options without any check of the\n   configuration corresponds to that of the
    BGP neighbor, or enforcement\n   that the two BGP speakers agree on the relationship.
    \ This document\n   enhances BGP Open to establish agreement of the (peer, customer,\n
    \  provider, internal) relationship of two BGP neighboring speakers to\n   enforce
    appropriate configuration on both sides.  Propagated routes\n   are then marked
    with a flag according to agreed relationship allowing\n   detection and mitigation
    of route leaks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
