abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The problems with the WebPKI have received the attention by
    the\n   Internet security community when DigiNotar, a Dutch certification\n   authority,
    had a security breach in 2011 and in the same year a\n   Comodo affiliate was
    compromised.  Both cases led to fraudulent\n   issuance of certificates and raise
    questions regarding the strength\n   of the WebPKI used by so many applications.\n\n
    \  Almost 2 years have passed since these incidents and various\n   standardization
    activities have happened in the meanwhile offering\n   new technical solutions
    to make the public key infrastructure more\n   resilient.\n\n   The important
    question, however, is which of the technical solutions\n   will get widespread
    deployment?  In this document we compare the\n   different technical solutions
    in an attempt to engage the impacted\n   stakeholders to trigger deployment actions
    to improve the status quo.\n   This document does not include any recommendations
    what techniques to\n   use.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
