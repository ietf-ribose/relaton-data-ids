abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes a digital signature system based on cryptographic
    hash functions, following the seminal work in this area of Lamport, Diffie, Winternitz,
    and Merkle, as adapted by Leighton and Micali in 1995. It specifies a one-time
    signature scheme and a general signature scheme. These systems provide asymmetric
    authentication without using large integer mathematics and can achieve a high
    security level. They are suitable for compact implementations, are relatively
    simple to implement, and naturally resist side-channel attacks. Unlike most other
    signature systems, hash-based signatures would still be secure even if it proves
    feasible for an attacker to build a quantum computer.</p>"
