abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   QUIC encrypts its Initial Packets using keys derived from well-known\n
    \  constants, meaning that observers can inspect the contents of these\n   packets
    and successfully spoof them.  This document proposes a new\n   version of QUIC
    that encrypts Initial Packets more securely by\n   leveraging a Public Key distributed
    via the Domain Name System (DNS)\n   or other out-of-band system.\n\n\t </p>\n
