abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes three new subTLVs for egress routers to advertise
    the AppMetaData of the directly attached edge services (ES). The AppMetaData can
    be used by the ingress routers in the 5G Local Data Network to make path selection
    not only based on the routing cost but also the running environment of the edge
    services. The goal is to improve latency and performance for 5G edge services.
    The extension enables an edge service at one specific location to be more preferred
    than the others with the same IP address (ANYCAST) to receive data flows from
    a specific source (UE).</p>"
