abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OpenPGP is a message format for email (and file) encryption
    that\n   lacks a standardized lookup mechanism to securely obtain OpenPGP\n   public
    keys.  DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (\"DANE\") is\n   a method for
    publishing public keys in DNS.  This document specifies\n   a DANE method for
    publishing and locating OpenPGP public keys in DNS\n   for a specific email address
    using a new OPENPGPKEY DNS Resource\n   Record.  Security is provided via Secure
    DNS, however the OPENPGPKEY\n   record is not a replacement for verification of
    authenticity via the\n   \"Web Of Trust\" or manual verification.  The OPENPGPKEY
    record can be\n   used to encrypt an email that would otherwise have to be sent\n
    \  unencrypted.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
