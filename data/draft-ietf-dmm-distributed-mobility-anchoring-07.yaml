abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines distributed mobility anchoring in terms of the
    different configurations, operations and parameters of mobility functions to provide
    different IP mobility support for the diverse mobility needs in 5G Wireless and
    beyond. A network may be configured with distributed mobility anchoring functions
    according to the needs of mobility support. In the distributed mobility anchoring
    environment, multiple anchors are available for mid-session switching of an IP
    prefix anchor. To start a new flow or to handle a flow not requiring IP session
    continuity as a mobile node moves to a new network, the flow can be started or
    re-started using a new IP address configured from the new IP prefix which is anchored
    to the new network. For a flow requiring IP session continuity, the anchoring
    of the prior IP prefix may be moved to the new network. The mobility functions
    and their operations and parameters are general for different configurations.
    The mobility signaling may be between anchors and nodes in the network in a network-based
    mobility solution. It may also be between the anchors and the mobile node in a
    host-based solution. The mobile node may be a host, but may also be a router carrying
    a network requiring network mobility support.</p>"
