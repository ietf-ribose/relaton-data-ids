abstract:

    experiment conducted in Yeti DNS project. In the experiment IXFR client is designed
    to pull the zone from three IXFR servers who used their own key to sign the zone
    and produce different RRSIG records intentionally. The configuration of multiple
    signers cause the failure of IXFR in client side. REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: The
    source of the document is currently placed at GitHub [xml-file]. Comments and
