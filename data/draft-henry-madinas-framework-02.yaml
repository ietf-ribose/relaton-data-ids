abstract:
- content: "<p>To limit the association between a device traffic and its user, client
    vendors have started implementing MAC address rotation. When such rotation happens,
    some in-network states may break, which may affect network efficiency and the
    user experience. At the same time, devices may continue sending other stable identifiers,
    defeating the MAC rotation purposes. This document lists various network environements
    and a set of network services that may be affected by such rotation. This document
    then examines settings where the user experience may be affected by in-network
    state disruption, and settings where other machine identifiers may expose the
    user privacy. Last, this document examines solutions to maintain user privacy
    while preserving user quality of experience and network operation efficiency.</p>"
