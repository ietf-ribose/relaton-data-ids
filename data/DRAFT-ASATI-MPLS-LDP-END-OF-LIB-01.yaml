abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are situations following LDP session establishment where
    it\n   would be useful for an LDP speaker to know when its peer has\n   advertised
    all of its labels.  These include session establishment\n   when LDP-IGP sync
    is in use and session re-establishment following\n   loss of an LDP session when
    LDP graceful restart is in use.  The LDP\n   specification provides no mechanism
    for an LDP speaker to notify a\n   peer when it has completed its initial label
    advertisements to that\n   peer.  This document specifies means for an LDP speaker
    to signal\n   completion of its initial label advertisements following session\n
    \  establishment.\n\t </p>\n      "
