abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the DNS Resolver Discovery Protocol (DRDP)
    that enables a DNS client to discover various available local and global resolving
    service. The discovery is primarily initiated by a DNS client, but a resolving
    service may also inform the DNS client other resolving services are available
    and eventually preferred.</p>"
