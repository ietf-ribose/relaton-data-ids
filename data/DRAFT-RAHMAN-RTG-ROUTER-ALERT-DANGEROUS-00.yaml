abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides guidelines to address security concerns
    which \narise with the use of IP Router Alert option [RFC2113] and [RFC2711].
    \nRSVP,[RFC2205] and [RFC3209], and IGMP [RFC3376] are some of the \nprotocols
    which make use of the IP Router Alert option. IP datagrams \ncarrying the Router
    Alert option are usually examined in a router's \n\"slow path\" and an excess
    of such datagrams can cause performance \ndegradation or packet drops in a router's
    \"slow path\". \n\t </p>\n      "
