abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies two additions to the File Transfer Protocol\n(FTP).
    \ These additions (new Server commands) would give FTP \nServers the ability to
    generate (or otherwise obtain) and return \nMD5 checksums for the files it has
    available for transfer.\nIt is the author's belief that this would provide a great
    benefit\nto the Internet community, because it would allow automated\ntransfer
    agents, as well as Web Browsers and other\n'click-to-download' applications to
    be able to automatically verify\nthe data of a downloaded file, and hence be able
    to detect any data\ntampering and/or corruption that may occurred while 'on the
    wire',\nor possibly while the file was on the Server (a virus infection).\n\t
    </p>\n      "
