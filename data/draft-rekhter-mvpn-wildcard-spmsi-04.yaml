abstract:
  content: "<p>The current MVPN specifications do not define encoding and proceduresfor
    advertising in a single route binding of multiple multicaststreams of a given
    MVPN customer to a single provider's tunnel. Thisdocument defines such encoding
    and procedures. These procedures allowin certain situations to reduce MVPN control
    plane load (note thoughthat these procedures have no impact on the data plane
    load). Theprocedures specified in this document assume that BGP is used fortransmission
    of MVPN customers' routing information within theservice provider(s) infrastructure.</p>"
