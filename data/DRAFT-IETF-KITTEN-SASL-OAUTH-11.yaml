abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OAuth enables a third-party application to obtain limited access
    to a\n   protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by\n   orchestrating
    an approval interaction, or by allowing the third-party\n   application to obtain
    access on its own behalf.\n\n   This document defines how an application client
    uses credentials\n   obtained via OAuth over the Simple Authentication and Security
    Layer\n   (SASL) to access a protected resource at a resource serve.  Thereby,\n
    \  it enables schemes defined within the OAuth framework for non-HTTP-\n   based
    application protocols.\n\n   Clients typically store the user's long-term credential.
    \ This does,\n   however, lead to significant security vulnerabilities, for example,\n
    \  when such a credential leaks.  A significant benefit of OAuth for\n   usage
    in those clients is that the password is replaced by a shared\n   secret with
    higher entropy, i.e., the token.  Tokens typically\n   provide limited access
    rights and can be managed and revoked\n   separately from the user's long-term
    password.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
