abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a profile for compressing SCTP/IP using the Robust
    Header Compression Formal Notation. The RObust Header Compression [1] scheme is
    designed to compress packet headers over error prone channels. It is built around
    an extensible core framework that can be tailored to compress new protocol stacks
    by adding additional ROHC profiles. This profile describes a new profile for ROHC
    which will allow SCTP/ IP headers to be compressed.</p>"
