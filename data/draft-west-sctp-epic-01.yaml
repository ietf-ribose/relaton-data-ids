abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft describes a profile for compressing SCTP/IP using theRobust
    Header Compression Formal Notation.The RObust Header Compression [1] scheme is
    designed to compresspacket headers over error prone channels. It is built around
    anextensible core framework that can be tailored to compress newprotocol stacks
    by adding additional ROHC profiles.This profile describes a new profile for ROHC
    which will allow SCTP/IP headers to be compressed.</p>"
