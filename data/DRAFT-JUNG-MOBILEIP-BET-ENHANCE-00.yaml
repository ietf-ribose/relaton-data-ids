abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To support real-time services such as VoIP in Mobile IPv4/v6,
    several\nfast handover methods have been proposed. The fast handover method\nusing
    BET is one of them and was chosen as an alternate protocol to\nFMIPv6 version
    4. BET has advantage in reducing the handover latency\nbecause it does not perform
    the layer 3 registration. However, the\nlong BET in certain situation could be
    not acceptable. In that case,\na mechanism is needed to limit the tunnel length
    of BET. In this\ndraft, we propose to group the ARs by predefined value to limit
    the\ntunnel length of BET. An anchor router is changed whenever a MN\nchanges
    its associated group.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
