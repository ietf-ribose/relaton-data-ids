abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SHREQ specification describes how the JSON Web Signature
    (JWS)\n   specification combined with the JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS),\n
    \  can be utilized to support HTTP based applications needing digitally\n   signed
    requests.  SHREQ is specifically tailored for Web applications\n   using JSON
    as data interchange format.  There is also a SHREQ scheme\n   for HTTP requests
    that do not have a body (\"payload\") like GET.\n   SHREQ was designed to be agnostic
    with respect to REST concepts\n   versus traditional GET/POST schemes.\n\n\t </p>\n
