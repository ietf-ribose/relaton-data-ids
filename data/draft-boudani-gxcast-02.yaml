abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently several multicast mechanisms were proposed that scale better
    with the number of multicast groups than traditional multicast does. These proposals
    are known as small group multicast (SGM) or explicit multicast (Xcast). Explicit
    multicast protocols, such as the Xcast protocol, encode the list of group members
    in the Xcast header of every packet. If the number of members in a group increases,
    routers may need to fragment an Xcast packet. Fragmented packets may not be identified
    as Xcast packets by routers. In this paper, we show that the Xcast protocol does
    not support the IP fragmentation and we show also that avoiding fragmentation
    induces hard-coded limits inside the protocol itself in terms of group size. First,
    we describe the Xcast protocol, the Xcast+ protocol (which is an extension of
    Xcast) and we compare these two protocols with traditional multicast protocols.We
    propose then a generalized version of the Xcast protocol, called GXcast, intended
    to permit the Xcast packets fragmentation and to support the increasing in the
    number of members in a multicast group.</p>"
