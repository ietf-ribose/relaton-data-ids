abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Recently several multicast mechanisms were proposed that scale betterwith
    the number of multicast groups than traditional multicast does.These proposals
    are known as small group multicast (SGM) or explicitmulticast (Xcast). Explicit
    multicast protocols, such as the Xcast protocol, encode the list of group members
    in the Xcast header of every packet. If the number of members in a group increases,
    routersmay need to fragment an Xcast packet. Fragmented packets may not be identified
    as Xcast packets by routers. In this paper, we show that the Xcast protocol does
    not support the IP fragmentation and we showalso that avoiding fragmentation induces
    hard-coded limits inside theprotocol itself in terms of group size. First, we
    describe the Xcastprotocol, the Xcast+ protocol (which is an extension of Xcast)
    and wecompare these two protocols with traditional multicast protocols.Wepropose
    then a generalized version of the Xcast protocol, calledGXcast, intended to permit
    the Xcast packets fragmentation and tosupport the increasing in the number of
    members in a multicastgroup.</p>"
