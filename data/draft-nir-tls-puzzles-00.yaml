abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a mechanism for mitigating denial of service
    (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on TLS servers. Attackers
    are limited in their ability to cause resource waste on the server by requiring
    proof of work by the client before these CPU resources are expended.</p>"
