abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are several problems that arise in the standard\n   Registrant/Registrar/Registry
    model when the operator of a zone is\n   neither the Registrant nor the Registrar
    for the delegation.\n   Historically the issues have been minor, and limited to
    difficulty\n   guiding the Registrant through the initial changes to the NS records\n
    \  for the delegation.  As this is usually a one time activity when the\n   operator
    first takes charge of the zone it has not been treated as a\n   serious issue.\n\n
    \  When the domain hand uses DNSSEC it necessary to make regular\n   (sometimes
    annual) changes to the delegation, updating DS record(s)\n   in order to track
    KSK rollover.  Under the current model this is\n   prone to delays and errors,
    as the Registrant must participate in\n   updates to DS records.\n\n   This document
    describes a simple protocol that allows a third party\n   DNS operator to update
    DS and NS records for a delegation, in a\n   trusted manner, without involving
    the Registrant for each operation.\n   This same protocol can be used by Registrants.\n\n\t
