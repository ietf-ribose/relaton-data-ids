abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Suppose you want TCP implementations to be able to fill a 155
    Mb/s\n   path.  Further suppose that the path includes a satellite in a\n   geosynchronous
    orbit, so the round trip delay through the path is at\n   least 500 ms, and the
    delay-bandwidth product is 9.7 megabytes or\n   more.\n \n   If we further assume
    the TCP implementations support TCP Large\n   Windows and PAWS (many do), so they
    can manage 9.7 MB TCP window,\n   then we can be sure the TCP will eventually
    start sending at full\n   path rate (unless the satellite channel is very lossy).
    \ But it may\n   take a long time to get the TCP up to full speed.\n\t </p>\n
