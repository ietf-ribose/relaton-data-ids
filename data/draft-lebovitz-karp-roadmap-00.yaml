abstract:
  content: <p>In the March of 2006 the IAB held a workshop on the topic of"Unwanted
    Internet Traffic". The report from that workshop isdocumented in RFC 4948 [RFC4948].
    Section 8.2 of RFC 4948 calls for"[t]ightening the security of the core routing
    infrastructure." Fourmain steps were identified for improving the security of
    the routinginfrastructure. One of those steps was "securing the routingprotocols'
    packets on the wire." One mechanism for securing routingprotocol packets on the
    wire is the use of per-packet cryptographicmessage authentication, providing both
    peer authentication andmessage integrity. Many different routing protocols exist
    and theyemploy a range of different transport subsystems. Therefore theremust
    necessarily be various methods defined for applyingcryptographic authentication
    to these varying protocols. Manyrouting protocols already have some method for
    accomplishingcryptographic message authentication. However, in many cases theexisting
    methods are dated, vulnerable to attack, and/or employcryptographic algorithms
    that have been deprecated. This documentcreates a roadmap of protocol specification
    work for the use ofmodern cryptogrpahic mechanisms and algorithms for messageauthentication
    in routing protocols. It also defines the frameworkfor a key management protocol
    that may be used to create and managesession keys for message authentication and
    integrity. This roadmapreflects the input of both the security area and routing
    area inorder to form a jointly agreed upon and prioritized work list for theeffort.
    This version is actually the fourth version, but is recentlyrenamed from "-kmart-roadmap"
    to "-karp-roadmap" to follow the newworking group name.Status of this MemoThis
