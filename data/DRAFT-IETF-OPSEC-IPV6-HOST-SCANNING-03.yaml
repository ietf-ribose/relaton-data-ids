abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4\n
    \  counterpart.  The standard /64 IPv6 subnets can (in theory)\n   accommodate
    approximately 1.844 * 10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a\n   much lower host density
    (#hosts/#addresses) than is typical in IPv4\n   networks, where a site typically
    has 65,000 or less unique addresses.\n   As a result, it is widely assumed that
    it would take a tremendous\n   effort to perform address scanning attacks against
    IPv6 networks, and\n   therefore brute-force IPv6 address scanning attacks have
    been\n   considered unfeasible.  This document updates RFC 5157 by providing\n
    \  further analysis on how traditional address scanning techniques apply\n   to
    IPv6 networks, and exploring some additional techniques that can\n   be employed
    for IPv6 network reconnaissance.  In doing so, this\n   document formally obsoletes
    RFC 5157.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
