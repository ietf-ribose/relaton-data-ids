abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a prefix assignment mechanism for home
    networks.\n   It is expected that home gateway routers are assigned an IPv6 prefix\n
    \  through DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (PD).  This prefix needs to be\n   divided
    among the multiple subnets in a home network.  This memo\n   describes a mechanism
    for such division via OSPFv3.  This is an\n   alternative design to using DHCPv6
    PD also for the prefix assignment.\n   The memo is input to the working group
    so that it can make a decision\n   on which type of design to pursue.  It is expected
    that a routing-\n   protocol based assignment uses a minimal amount of prefixes.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
