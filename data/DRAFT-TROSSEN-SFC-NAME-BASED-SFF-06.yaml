abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Adoption of cloud and fog technology allows operators to deploy
    a\n   single \"Service Function\" to multiple \"Execution locations\".  The\n
    \  decision to steer traffic to a specific location may change\n   frequently
    based on load, proximity etc.  Under the current SFC\n   framework, steering traffic
    dynamically to the different execution\n   end points require a specific 're-chaining',
    i.e., a change in the\n   service function path reflecting the different IP endpoints
    to be\n   used for the new execution points.  This procedure may be complex and\n
    \  take time.  In order to simplify re-chaining and reduce the time to\n   complete
    the procedure, we discuss separating the logical Service\n   Function Path from
    the specific execution end points.  This can be\n   done by identifying the Service
    Functions using a name rather than a\n   routable IP endpoint (or Layer 2 address).
    \ This draft describes the\n   necessary extensions, additional functions and
    protocol details in\n   SFF (Service Function Forwarder) to handle name based
    relationships.\n   This document is an Independent Submission to the RFC Editor.
    \ It is\n   not an output of the IETF SFC WG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
