abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  The Multicast File Transfer Protocol (MFTP) is a protocol that\n
    \ operates above UDP in the application layer to provide a reliable\n  means for
    transferring files from a sender to up to thousands\n  (potentially millions with
    network ''aggregators'' or relays) of\n  multiple receivers simultaneously over
    a multicast group in a\n  multicast IP enabled network.  The protocol consists
    of two parts; an\n  administrative protocol to set up and tear down groups and
    sessions,\n  and a data transfer protocol used to send the actual file reliably
    and\n  simultaneously to the multiple recipients residing in the group .\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
