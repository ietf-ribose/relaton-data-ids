abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses some of the issues posed by firewalls
    and \n   other intermediaries to deployment of some basic IETF technologies.   \n
    \   \n   The intent of this document is to track such issues, explore possible
    \n   approaches elegant or not that have been proposed so far to address \n   them
    and initiate discussion on how such issues should be \n   appropriately addressed
    by IETF. \n    \n   This first version 00 is provided to initiate discussion.
    Most of the \n   content should be considered as initial place holders.\n\t </p>\n
