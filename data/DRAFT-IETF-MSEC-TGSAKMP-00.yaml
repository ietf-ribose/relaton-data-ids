abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Tunneled Group Secure Association Key Management Protocol\n(T-GSAKMP)
    provides a security framework for creating cryptographic\ngroups on a network.
    \ It is designed to provide key distribution\nservices under the cryptographic
    protection of a pairwise SA,\nlike IPSec.  T-GSAKMP relies on the pairwise SA
    to provide data\nconfidentiality services for policy, DoS mitigation services,\nand
    protection from 'man-in-the-middle' attacks.  It provides\nmechanisms to disseminate
    group security policy, perform access\ncontrol based upon PKI certificates, generate
    group keys,\nand recover from compromise.  This framework addresses group\nscalability
    issues by facilitating delegation of process-intensive\nactions in a secure and
    controlled manner.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
