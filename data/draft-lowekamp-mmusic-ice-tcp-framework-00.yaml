abstract:
- content: "<p>The ICE-TCP mechanism is currently regarded as of limited usefulness
    due to the low success rate of TCP simultaneous open for NAT traversal. This document
    presents a vision of the ICE-TCP document as an extensible framework for negotiating
    a variety of approaches for establishing a TCP connection between NATed hosts.
    This document further proposes significantly extending the current set of collection
    mechanisms to encompass a wide variety of technologies that are currently available,
    including UPnP, SOCKS, and Teredo. Because several of these technologies are already
    widely deployed, the direct connection rate should be significantly higher than
    using straight TCP alone. We envision that as future TCP connection establishment
    techniques are developed, they too will specify an ICE encoding that will allow
    their negotiation.</p>"
