abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The ICE-TCP mechanism is currently regarded as of limited usefulnessdue
    to the low success rate of TCP simultaneous open for NATtraversal. This document
    presents a vision of the ICE-TCP documentas an extensible framework for negotiating
    a variety of approachesfor establishing a TCP connection between NATed hosts.
    This documentfurther proposes significantly extending the current set ofcollection
    mechanisms to encompass a wide variety of technologiesthat are currently available,
    including UPnP, SOCKS, and Teredo.Because several of these technologies are already
    widely deployed,the direct connection rate should be significantly higher than
    usingstraight TCP alone. We envision that as future TCP connectionestablishment
    techniques are developed, they too will specify an ICEencoding that will allow
    their negotiation.</p>"
