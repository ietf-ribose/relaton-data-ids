abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The NETCONF protocol defines a subtree filtering mechanism to
    allow\nan client to select particular XML subtrees to be included in the\n&lt;rpc-reply&gt;
    for a &lt;get&gt; or &lt;get-config&gt; operation.  In some aspects,\nsubtree
    filtering has some disadvantages.  This document defines an\nextended subtree
    filtering to solve these disadvantages.\n\t </p>\n      "
