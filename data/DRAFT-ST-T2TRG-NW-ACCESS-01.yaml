abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method for enabling and configuring
    network\n   access for IoT devices that are first authenticated at a server.\n
    \  This server may be run by the manufacturer of the IoT device as an\n   online
    cloud service.  This specification is intended for off-the-\n   shelf IoT devices
    that have just been purchased by the user.  Many of\n   these devices have only
    limited user interfaces that can be used for\n   configuring network access credentials.
    \ The device configuration is\n   also made more challenging by the fact that
    these devices may exist\n   in large numbers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
