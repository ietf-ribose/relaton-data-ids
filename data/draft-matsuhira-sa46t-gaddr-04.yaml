abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes Stateless Automatic IPv4 over IPv6 Encapsulation
    / Decapsulation Technology (SA46T) Global Address Format. SA46T can apply to organization's
    network individually, but if coordination between the organizations made, the
    total number of times of encapsulations and decapusulations can be reduced. That
    coordination is achieved by using same SA46T address format, that is Global address.
    This document proposes SA46T Global address format. SA46T is a gateway technology,
    not protocol. But SA46T Global Address needs IANA assignment, so this document
    should be categorized standard track or experimental.</p>"
