abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the operation of IP over tunnel virtual links
    using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO). Nodes attached to AERO links
    can exchange packets via trusted intermediate routers that provide forwarding
    services to reach off-link destinations and redirection services for route optimization.
    AERO provides an IPv6 link-local address format known as the AERO address that
    supports operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol and links IPv6
    ND to IP forwarding. Admission control, address/prefix provisioning and mobility
    are supported by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), and
    route optimization is naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates.
    Although DHCPv6 and IPv6 ND messaging are used in the control plane, both IPv4
    and IPv6 are supported in the data plane. AERO is a widely-applicable tunneling
    solution especially well suited to mobile Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and
    other applications as described in this document.</p>"
