abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimental protocol for publicly logging
    the existence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates as they are issued
    or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit certificate authority (CA)
    activity and notice the issuance of suspect certificates as well as to audit the
    certificate logs themselves. The intent is that eventually clients would refuse
    to honor certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing CAs to
    add all issued certificates to the logs. Logs are network services that implement
    the protocol operations for submissions and queries that are defined in this document.</p>"
