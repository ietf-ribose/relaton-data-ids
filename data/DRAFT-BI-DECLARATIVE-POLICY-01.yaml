abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a declarative (also called intent based)
    policy\nmodel    to describe the user's intent on network policy. The intent policy
    model is\na    specific data model specifies the desired state of the network
    system. It\nhelps    the service management in Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions
    (SUPA) to\nmodel    the policy (a set of states described by constraints) that
    defines the\nfinal    results of a VPN service without specifying how it is monitored
    and managed\n   during its lifecycle. One application for Distributed Data Center
    (DDC)\n   scenarios with policy enforcement is provided with details of how to
    convert\n   high level intent policy into lower level configurations.\n\n\t </p>\n
