abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the Session\n
    \  Initiation Protocol (SIP) as they define and impact policies on call\n   routing,
    rendezvous, and other call features.  However, there is\n   currently no standard
    mechanism by which a proxy can influence\n   session policies such as the codecs
    or media types to be used.  This\n   document specifies a framework for SIP session
    policies.  It defines\n   two types of session policies, session-specific and
    session-\n   independent policies and introduces a model, an overall architecture\n
    \  and the protocol components needed for session policies.\n\t </p>\n      "
