abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of TCP enhancements in diverse fields as congestion control,
    loss recovery or side-band signaling could be improved by allowing both ends of
    a TCP session to interpret the value carried in the Timestamp option. Further
    enhancements are enabled by changing the receiver side processing of timestamps
    in the presence of Selective Acknowledgements. This document updates RFC1323 and
    specifies a backward-compatible method for negotiating for additional capabilities
    for the Timestamp option, and lists a number of benefits and drawbacks of this
    approach.</p>"
