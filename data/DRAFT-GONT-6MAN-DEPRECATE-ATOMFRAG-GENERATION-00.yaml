abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The core IPv6 specification requires that when a host receives
    an\n   ICMPv6 \"Packet Too Big\" message reporting a \"Next-Hop MTU\" smaller\n
    \  than 1280, the host includes a Fragment Header in all subsequent\n   packets
    sent to that destination, without reducing the assumed Path-\n   MTU.  The simplicity
    with which ICMPv6 \"Packet Too Big\" messages can\n   be forged, coupled with
    the widespread filtering of IPv6 fragments,\n   results in an attack vector that
    can be leveraged for Denial of\n   Service purposes.  This document briefly discusses
    the aforementioned\n   attack vector, and formally deprecates the generation of
    IPv6 atomic\n   fragments, such that the aforementioned attack vector is eliminated.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
