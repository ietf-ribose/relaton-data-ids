abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is an early, work-in-progress draft - a start at getting
    some of\n   the ideas from the mailing list and email exchanges on paper.\n\n
    \  This draft is intended to provide guidance to operators of end-\n   systems,
    operators of networks, and researchers in order to ensure\n   reasonable fairness
    between L4S and Classic flows sharing a single-\n   queue RFC3168 bottleneck link.
    \ This draft identifies opportunites to\n   prevent and/or detect and resolve
    fairness problems in such networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
