abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are increasing requests for a variety IPv6 hop-by-hop
    options\n   but such IPv6 options and all IPv4 options, are poorly handled,\n
    \  particularly by high-speed routers in the core Internet where packets\n   having
    options are commonly discarded. This document proposes a\n   simple method of
    transiently hiding such options for part of a\n   packet's path to protect the
    packet from discard.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
