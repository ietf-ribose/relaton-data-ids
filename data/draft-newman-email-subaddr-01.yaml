    can be used to assist categorizing incoming email. One way ofdoing this is to
    divide the local-part of an email address into userand detail parts. The user
    part is used to route the message withinthe specified domain and the detail part
    is used to route the messageaccording to a particular user's wishes.This specification
    formalizes the de-facto standard for subaddressingin use today and includes advice
    and requirements for final deliveryagents, MUAs and mail list servers which wish
    to supportsubaddressing.</p>"
