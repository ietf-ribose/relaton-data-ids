abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The new Smart Energy (SE) Version 2 (SE 2) is aimed at providing
    end-to-end connectivity between energy providers, energy consumers, andtheir respective
    equipment. This effort has been recognized as partof the Smart Grid roadmap by
    the US National Institute of Standardsand Technology (NIST). Whereas SE 1 was
    based on a proprietaryZigBee stack, SE 2 will is based on IPv6 with support for
    IEEE802.15.4, HomePlug and use across the Internet. The work in 6LowAppon application
    protocols and commissioning is an important componentof SE 2. This document introduces
    SE 2 along with requirementsidentified for 6LowApp and considerations for future
    work.</p>"
