abstract:
- content: "<p>The new Smart Energy (SE) Version 2 (SE 2) is aimed at providing end-
    to-end connectivity between energy providers, energy consumers, and their respective
    equipment. This effort has been recognized as part of the Smart Grid roadmap by
    the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Whereas SE 1 was
    based on a proprietary ZigBee stack, SE 2 will is based on IPv6 with support for
    IEEE 802.15.4, HomePlug and use across the Internet. The work in 6LowApp on application
    protocols and commissioning is an important component of SE 2. This document introduces
    SE 2 along with requirements identified for 6LowApp and considerations for future
    work.</p>"
