abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Draft is intended as a standards track document, obsoleting\nRFC
    1036, which itself dates from 1987.\nThis Standard defines the format of Netnews
    articles and specifies\nthe requirements to be met by software which originates,
    distributes,\nstores and displays them.\nSince the 1980s, Usenet has grown explosively,
    and many Internet and\nnon-Internet sites now participate. In addition, the Netnews\ntechnology
    is now in widespread use for other purposes.\nBackward compatibility has been
    a major goal of this endeavour, but\nwhere this standard and earlier documents
    or practices conflict, this\nstandard should be followed. In most such cases,
    current practice is\nalready compatible with these changes.\n\t </p>\n      "
