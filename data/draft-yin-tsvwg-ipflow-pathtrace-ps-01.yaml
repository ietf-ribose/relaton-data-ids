abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the requirements of IP flow path trace. Network
    administrators need to get the real IP flow path information, of which a specific
    IP flow goes through heterogeneous network environments. It is also desired for
    more information relevant to the IP flow path. Based on the information, network
    administrators can locate possible faults of the network quickly or optimize network
    resource for better network performance.</p>"
