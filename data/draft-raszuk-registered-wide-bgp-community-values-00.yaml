abstract:
- content: "<p>Communicating various routing policies via route tagging plays an important
    role in external BGP peering relations. The most common tool used today to attach
    various information about routes is realized with the use of BGP communities.
    Such information is important for the peering AS to perform some mutually agreed
    actions without the need to maintain a separate offline database for each pair
    of prefix and an associated with it requested set of action entries. This document
    proposes to establish a new IANA maintained registry of most commonly used Wide
    BGP Communities by network operators. Such public registry will allow for easy
    refernece and clear interpretation of the actions associated with received community
    values.</p>"
