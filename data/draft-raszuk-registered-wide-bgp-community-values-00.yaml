abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Communicating various routing policies via route tagging plays animportant
    role in external BGP peering relations. The most commontool used today to attach
    various information about routes isrealized with the use of BGP communities. Such
    information isimportant for the peering AS to perform some mutually agreed actionswithout
    the need to maintain a separate offline database for eachpair of prefix and an
    associated with it requested set of actionentries.This document proposes to establish
    a new IANA maintained registry ofmost commonly used Wide BGP Communities by network
    operators. Suchpublic registry will allow for easy refernece and clearinterpretation
    of the actions associated with received communityvalues.</p>"
