abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A method for mutual network endpoint assessment is introduced in
    thisdocument. In current NEA requirements, only the assessment performedby network
    owner is described. However, for some applications likeonline business and file
    sharing, the unilateral assessment is notenough to ensure the two communication
    parties are both secureEspecially in P2P application, the endpoints perform equalresponsibility
    and hence the mutual network endpoint assessment seemsmore necessary. each endpoint
    may configure its security assessmentpolicy based on its own security concerns.
