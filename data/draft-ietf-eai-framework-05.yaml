abstract:
- content: "<p>Full use of electronic mail throughout the world requires that people
    be able to use their own names, written correctly in their own languages and scripts,
    as mailbox names in email addresses. This document introduces a series of specifications
    that define mechanisms and protocol extensions needed to fully support internationalized
    email addresses. These changes include an SMTP extension and extension of email
    header syntax to accommodate UTF-8 data. The document set also includes discussion
    of key assumptions and issues in deploying fully internationalized email. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
