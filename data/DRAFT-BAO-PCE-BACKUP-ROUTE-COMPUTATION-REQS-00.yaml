abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Backup route is another route for a service which will be used
    when\nworking path fails.  Traditionally, this route is configured by\noperator
    manually and can't be updated when LSA changes.  This\ndocument improves this
    traditional usage, and PCE (Path Computation\nElement) is applied for backup route.\n\t
