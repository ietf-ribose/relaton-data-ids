abstract:
  content: <p>There is debate on the topic of "Commit/Rollback of Offer/Answer onUnsuccessful
    re-INVITE". The reason of the confusion is someapplication/session usages of offer/answer
    imply the nesttransaction(mean transaction theory, not mean sip transaction)concept,
    but whitout unambiguous definition. This paper reveal theconcept of nest transactions
    in current RFC and other well knownapplication/session usages. And then clarify
    that there is noambiguous state of session modification using current RFC definition.</p>
