abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism for use in conjunction with
    link\nstate routing protocols which prevents the transient loops which\nwould
    otherwise occur during topology changes.  It does this by\ncorrectly sequencing
    the FIB updates on the routers.\n\nThis mechanism can be used in the case of non-urgent
    link or node\nshutdowns and restarts or link metric changes.  It can also be used\nin
    conjunction with a fast re-route mechanism which converts a sudden\nlink or node
    failure into a non-urgent topology change.  This is\npossible where a complete
    repair path is provided for all affected\ndestinations.\n\nAfter a non-urgent
    topology change, each router computes a rank that\ndefines the time at which it
    can safely update its FIB.  A method for\naccelerating this loop-free convergence
    process by the use of\ncompletion messages is also described.\n\nThe technology
    described in this document has been subject to\nextensive simulation using real
    network topologies and costs, and\npathological convergence behaviour.  A variant
    of the technology\ndescribed here has been experimentally deployed in a production\nnetwork.\n\t
