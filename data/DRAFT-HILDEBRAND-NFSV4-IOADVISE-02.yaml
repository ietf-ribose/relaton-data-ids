abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a new IO_ADVISE operation for NFSv4.2
    that\n   clients can use to communicate expected I/O behavior to the server.\n
    \  By communicating future I/O behavior such as whether a file will be\n   accessed
    sequentially or randomly, and whether a file will or will\n   not be accessed
    in the near future, servers can optimize future I/O\n   requests for a file by,
    for example, prefetching or evicting data.\n   This operation can be used to support
    the posix_fadvise function as\n   well as other applications such as databases
    and video editors.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
