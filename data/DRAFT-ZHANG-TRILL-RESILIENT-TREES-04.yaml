abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL protocol provides layer 2 multicast data forwarding using
    IS-IS\n   link state routing. Distribution trees are computed based on the link\n
    \  state information through Shortest Path First calculation. When a\n   link
    on the distribution tree fails, a campus-wide recovergence of\n   this distribution
    tree will take place, which can be time consuming\n   and may cause considerable
    disruption to the ongoing multicast\n   service.\n\n   This document proposes
    to build the backup distribution tree to\n   protect links on the primary distribution
    tree. Since the backup\n   distribution tree is built up ahead of the link failure,
    when a link\n   on the primary distribution tree fails, the pre-installed backup\n
    \  forwarding table will be utilized to deliver multicast packets\n   without
    waiting for the campus-wide recovergence, which minimizes the\n   service disruption.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
