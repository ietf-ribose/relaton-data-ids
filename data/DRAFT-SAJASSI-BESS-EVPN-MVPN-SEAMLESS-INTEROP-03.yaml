abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution is becoming\n
    \  pervasive for Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) services in data\n   center
    (DC) networks and as the next generation VPN services in\n   service provider
    (SP) networks.\n\n   As service providers transform their networks in their COs
    toward\n   next generation data center with Software Defined Networking (SDN)\n
    \  based fabric and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), they want to\n   be
    able to maintain their offered services including Multicast VPN\n   (MVPN) service
    between their existing network and their new Service\n   Provider Data Center
    (SPDC) network seamlessly without the use of\n   gateway devices. They want to
    have such seamless interoperability\n   between their new SPDCs and their existing
    networks for a) reducing\n   cost, b) having optimum forwarding, and c) reducing
    provisioning.\n   This document describes a unified solution based on RFCs 6513
    &amp; 6514\n   for seamless interoperability of Multicast VPN between EVPN and
    MVPN\n   PEs. Furthermore, it describes how the proposed solution can be used\n
    \  as a routed multicast solution in data centers with only EVPN PEs.\n\n\n\t
