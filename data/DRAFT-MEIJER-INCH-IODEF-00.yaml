abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of the Incident Object Description and Exchange Format
    is\nto define a common data format for describing and exchanging incident\ninformation
    between collaborating Computer Security Incident Response\nTeams (CSIRTs). The
    specific goals and requirements of the IODEF are\ndescribed in [2]. One of the
    design principles in the IODEF is\ncompatibility with the Intrusion Detection
    Message Exchange Format\n(IDMEF) [3] developed for intrusion detection systems.
    For this\nreason, IODEF is heavily based on the IDMEF and provides upward\ncompatibility
    with it.\n\t </p>\n      "
