abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) introduced a mechanism whereby
    a\n   mail operator can affix a signature to a message that validates at\n   the
    level of the signer's domain name.  It specified two possible\n   ways of converting
    the message body to a canonical form, one\n   intolerant of changes and the other
    tolerant of simple changes to\n   whitespace within the message body.\n\n   The
    provided canonicalization schemes do not tolerate changes in a\n   message such
    as conversion between transfer encodings or addition of\n   new message content.
    \ It is useful to have these capabilities to\n   allow for transport through gateways,
    and also for transport through\n   handlers (such as mailing list services) that
    might add content that\n   would invalidate a signature generated using the existing\n
    \  canonicalization schemes.\n\n   This document presents a mechanism for declaring
    that a message\n   underwent any of a handful of well-defined transformations
    prior to\n   being re-signed by a mediator, so that a verifier might rewind such\n
    \  modification(s) and thereby confirm that the original signature still\n   verifies
    against the original content.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
