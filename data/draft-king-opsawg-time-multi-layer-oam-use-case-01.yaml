abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies and discusses use-cases and high level requirements
    for transport technology independent OAM that need to interface multi-layer or
    multi-domain transport networks to cover heterogeneous networking technologies.
    As providers face multi-layer networks and diverse transport technologies, generic
    and integrated OAM is desirable for simplifying network operations and maintenance.</p>"
