abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the procedure of data packet triggered binding
    creation, which is suitable for DHCP assigned addresses, stateless addresses and
    manually configured addresses. This procedure can help minimize loss of legitimate
    packets as well as prevent the use of forged or spoofed addresses.</p>"
