abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     The Real-time Transfer Protocol, RTP (RFC1889 and currently
    under\n     revision) includes basic support for conveying some predefined\n     membership
    information types within a session using its control\n     protocol (RTCP). This
    document describes a proposal for extending\n     these membership types with
    additional membership information for\n     user nickname, personal information
    web page reference, personal\n     image reference and currently active media
    in session.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
