abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For a Traffic Engineered (TE) point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label\n
    \  Switched Path (LSP), it is preferable in some cases to re-evaluate\n   and
    re-optimize the entire P2MP-TE LSP by re-signaling all its\n   Source-to-Leaf
    (S2L) sub-LSP(s).  Existing mechanisms, a mechanism\n   for an ingress Label Switched
    Router (LSR) to trigger a new path re-\n   evaluation request and a mechanism
    for a mid-point LSR to notify an\n   availability of a preferred path, operate
    on an individual or a sub-\n   group of S2L sub-LSP(s) basis only.\n\n   This
    document defines RSVP-TE signaling extensions to allow an\n   ingress node of
    a P2MP-TE LSP to request the re-evaluation of the\n   entire LSP tree containing
    one or more S2L sub-LSPs whose paths are\n   loose (or abstract) hop expanded,
    and for a mid-point LSR to notify\n   to the ingress node that a preferable tree
    exists for the entire\n   P2MP-TE LSP.  This document also defines markers to
    indicate\n   beginning and end of a S2L sub-LSP descriptor list when RSVP message\n
    \  needs to be fragmented due to large number of S2L sub-LSPs when\n   performing
    re-optimization.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
