abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>TIST is an application of the RSVP protocol to the problem of
    com-\nmunicating application requests, such as pinhole openings and NAT\ntable
    entries, to NATs and firewalls.  By using RSVP we avoid the\nproblem of having
    to locate these devices in the network and estab-\nlish trusted relationships
    with each one we would like to influ-\nence.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
