abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of link-state routing protocols on
    classical links in Quantum Networks. It contains proposals for additions to the
    IS-IS and OSPF protocols in order for them to transport relevant information for
    a Quantum Network, specifically, for the creation and manipulation of entangled
    pairs. The document will describe some of the necessary attributes and some suggestions
    of how this information may be used. No Schrodinger's cats were harmed in the
    creation of this document.</p>"
