abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains registries
    to track codepoints used by protocols defined by the IETF and documented in RFCs
    developed on the IETF Stream. The Independent Submissions Stream is another source
    of documents that can be published as RFCs. This stream is under the care of the
    Independent Submissions Editor (ISE). This document updates RFC 4846 by describing
    how the current ISE will handle documents in the Independent Submissions Stream
    that request actions from the IANA. Nothing in this document changes existing
    IANA registries and their allocation policies.</p>"
