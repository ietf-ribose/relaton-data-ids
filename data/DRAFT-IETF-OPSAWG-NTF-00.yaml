abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an architectural framework for network\n
    \  telemetry to address the current and future network operation\n   challenges
    and requirements.  As evidenced by the defining\n   characteristics and industry
    practice, network telemetry covers\n   technologies and protocols beyond the conventional
    network\n   Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM).  Network telemetry\n
    \  promises better flexibility, scalability, accuracy, coverage, and\n   performance
    and allows automated control loops to suit both today's\n   and tomorrow's network
    operation requirements.  This document\n   clarifies the terminologies and classifies
    the modules and components\n   of a network telemetry system.  The framework and
    taxonomy help to\n   set a common ground for the collection of related work and
    provide\n   guidance for future technique and standard developments.\n\n\t </p>\n
