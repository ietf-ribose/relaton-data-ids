abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) policies, have different\n
    \  views regarding the recommendation of the prefix to be assigned to\n   end-sites.
    \ However, all them allow up to a /48 without further\n   justification and clearly
    state that the exact choice of how much\n   address space should be assigned to
    end-sites is a decision of each\n   operator.  In fact, the operational community
    has recently developed\n   a document with also covers this topic \"Best Current
    Operational\n   Practice for Operators: IPv6 prefix assignment for end-users -\n
    \  persistent vs non-persistent, and what size to choose\".\n\n   This document
    reviews the architectural and operational\n   considerations of end-site assignments,
    and reiterates that\n   assignment policy and guidelines belong to the RIR community.
    \ This\n   revision is being made to emphasize that IPv6 protocol evolution\n
    \  requires an ever increasing availability of subnets at the end-site\n   and
    so, policy should reflect that assignment of a single subnet is\n   no longer
    appropriate unless the recipient explicitly agrees to the\n   limitations implied
    by such an assignment.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC6177 (IPv6 Address Assignment
    to End\n   Sites).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
