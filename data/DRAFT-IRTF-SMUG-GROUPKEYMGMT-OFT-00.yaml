abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We present and implement a scalable method for establishing\ngroup
    session keys for secure large, dynamic groups such as\nmulticast sessions.  Our
    method is based on a novel application\nof One-Way Function Trees (OFTs).  The
    number of keys stored by\ngroup members, the number of keys broadcast to the group
    when\nnew members are added or evicted, and the computational efforts\nof group
    members, are logarithmic in the number of group members.\nThe method provides
    perfect forward and backward security:\nevicted members cannot read future messages,
    even with collusion\nby arbitrarily many evicted members, and newly admitted group\nmembers
    cannot read previous messages.  In comparison with the\nLogical Key Hierarchy
    (LKH) of Wallner et al., our algorithm\nroughly halves the number of bits that
    need to be broadcast to\nmembers in order to re-key after a member is added or
    evicted.\nIn addition, and unlike LKH, our algorithm has the option of being\nmember
    contributory in that members can be allowed to contribute\nentropy to the group
    key.  Running on a Pentium with 64 MB of RAM,\nour prototype has handled groups
    with up to 100,000 members.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
