abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many Internet applications have a need for object-based security\n
    \  mechanisms in addition to security mechanisms at the network layer or\n   transport
    layer.  In the past, the Cryptographic Message Syntax has\n   provided a binary
    secure object format based on ASN.1.  Over time,\n   the use of binary object
    encodings such as ASN.1 has been overtaken\n   by text-based encodings, for example
    JavaScript Object Notation.\n   This document defines a set of use cases and requirements
    for a\n   secure object format encoded using JavaScript Object Notation, drawn\n
    \  from a variety of application security mechanisms currently in\n   development.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
