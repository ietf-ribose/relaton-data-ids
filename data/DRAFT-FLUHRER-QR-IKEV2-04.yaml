abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The possibility of quantum computers pose a serious challenge
    to\n   cryptography algorithms widely today.  IKEv2 is one example of a\n   cryptosystem
    that could be broken; someone storing VPN communications\n   today could decrypt
    them at a later time when a quantum computer is\n   available.  It is anticipated
    that IKEv2 will be extended to support\n   quantum secure key exchange algorithms;
    however that is not likely to\n   happen in the near term.  To address this problem
    before then, this\n   document describes an extension of IKEv2 to allow it to
    be resistant\n   to a Quantum Computer, by using preshared keys.\n\n\t </p>\n
