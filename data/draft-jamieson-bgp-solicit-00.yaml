abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to BGP-4 which may be used by
    a BGP-4 speaker to solicit Virtual Private Network (VPN) reachability information
    from other IBGP speakers. The motivation of the proposed technique is to provide
    a means of reducing the memory requirements of routers which use BGP-4 to distribute
    VPN reachability information as described in [1] and [4]. The extension is backward
    compatible in that a router which supports the extension can interoperate with
    a router which doesn't.</p>"
