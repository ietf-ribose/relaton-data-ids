abstract:
- content: "<p>Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) enable Relying Parties to put
    trust in the trustworthiness of a remote Attester and therefore to decide if to
    engage in secure interactions with it - or not. Evidence about trustworthiness
    can be rather complex, voluminous or Attester-specific. As it is deemed unrealistic
    that every Relying Party is capable of the appraisal of Evidence, that burden
    is taken on by a Verifier. In order to conduct Evidence appraisal procedures,
    a Verifier requires not only fresh Evidence from an Attester, but also trusted
    Endorsements and Reference Values from Endorsers, such as manufacturers, distributors,
    or owners. This document specifies Concise Reference Integrity Manifests (CoRIM)
    that represent Endorsements and Reference Values in CBOR format. Composite devices
    or systems are represented by a collection of Concise Module Identifiers (CoMID)
    and Concise Software Identifiers (CoSWID) bundled in a CoRIM document.</p>"
