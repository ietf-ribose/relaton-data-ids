    been proposed. Some have been implemented, and some are advancing toward standardization.
    It is likely that additional enhancements will be proposed in the future. This
    document defines a mechanism for advertising LDP enhancements at session initialization
    time, as well as a mechanism to enable and disable enhancements after LDP session
    establishment. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
