abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A mobile node will change its access router frequently during
    a \nDiameter session and the relevant AAA parameters may also be \ntransferred
    between the access routers. However, the home AAA server \ndoes not know the movement
    of the mobile node before the mobile node \nre-authenticates, and a request from
    the home AAA server will always \nbe forwarded to the former realm. Therefore,
    an efficient way is \nneeded to forward the request to the new access router.
    \n    \n\t </p>\n      "
