abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes AuCPace which is an augmented PAKE
    protocol\n   for two parties.  The protocol was tailored for constrained devices\n
    \  and smooth migration for compatibility with legacy user credential\n   databases.
    \ It is designed to be compatible with any group of both\n   prime- and non-prime
    order and comes with a security proof providing\n   composability guarantees.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
