abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Section 4.1 of BCP 26 (RFC 5226) discusses possible IANA registration\n
    \  policies that might be used in documents with IANA actions, and\n   defines
    some well-known policy terms.  This document clarifies the\n   usage of these
    terms, and discourages the use of overly restrictive\n   registration policies.\n\n
    \  The author is working with IANA on an update to BCP 26, and this\n   document's
    contents will be folded into that effort.  While that's in\n   process, this draft
    will be kept alive for reference.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
