abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CBOR Signing And Encrypted Message (COSE) structure uses\n
    \  references to keys in general.  For some algorithms, additional\n   properties
    are defined which carry parameters relating to keys as\n   needed.  The COSE Key
    structure is used for transporting keys outside\n   of COSE messages.  This document
    extends the way that keys can be\n   identified and transported by providing attributes
    that refer to or\n   contain X.509 certificates.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
