abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to provide a discussion of the potential
    problems of using private, RFC1918, or non-globally- routable addressing within
    the core of an SP network. The discussion focuses on link addresses and to a small
    extent loopback addresses. While many of the issues are well recognised within
    the ISP community, there appears to be no document that collectively describes
    the issues.</p>"
