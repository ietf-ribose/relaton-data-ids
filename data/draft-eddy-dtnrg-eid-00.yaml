abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The architecture for Delay Tolerant Networking includes a type ofaddress
    called an Endpoint Identifier. This document describes someof the remaining issues
    regarding Endpoint Indentifiers, and how theycan be configured and used in bundle
    forwarding. These either implydirections for future work or highlight clarifications
    that should bemade in the current architecture and protocol documents.</p>"
