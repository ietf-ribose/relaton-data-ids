abstract:
- content: "<p>Connectivity is the basic stuff from which the Internet is made. Therefore,
    metrics determining whether pairs of hosts (IP addresses) can reach each other
    must form the base of a measurement suite. We define several such metrics, some
    of which serve mainly as building blocks for the others.</p>"
