abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC may not
    have a normative reference to another standards track document at a lower maturity
    level or to a non standards track specification (other than specifications from
    other standards bodies). For example, a standards track document may not have
    a normative reference to an informational RFC. Exceptions to this rule are sometimes
    needed as the IETF uses informational RFCs to describe non-IETF standards or IETF-specific
    modes of use of such standards. This document defines the procedure used in these
    circumstances. This document merges and updates, and thus obsoletes, RFC 3967,
    RFC 4897, and RFC 8067.</p>"
