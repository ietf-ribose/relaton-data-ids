abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks defines
    a\n   generic Distance Vector protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks,\n   many
    of which exhibit strongly asymmetrical characteristics.  This\n   draft proposes
    an extension for that optimizes RPL operations whereby\n   upwards and downwards
    direction-optimized RPL instances are\n   associated.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
