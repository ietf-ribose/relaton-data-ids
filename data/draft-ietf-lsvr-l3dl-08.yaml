abstract:
- content: "<p>In Massive Data Centers, BGP-SPF and similar routing protocols are
    used to build topology and reachability databases. These protocols need to discover
    IP Layer-3 attributes of links, such as neighbor IP addressing, logical link IP
    encapsulation abilities, and link liveness. This Layer-3 Discovery and Liveness
    protocol collects these data, which may then be disseminated using BGP-SPF and
    similar protocols.</p>"
