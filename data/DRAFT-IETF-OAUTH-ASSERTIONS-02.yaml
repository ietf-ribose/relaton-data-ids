abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification provides a general framework for the use
    of\n   assertions as client credentials and/or authorization grants with\n   OAuth
    2.0.  It includes a generic mechanism for transporting\n   assertions during interactions
    with a token endpoint, as wells as\n   rules for the content and processing of
    those assertions.  The intent\n   is to provide an enhanced security profile by
    using derived values\n   such as signatures or HMACs, as well as facilitate the
    use of OAuth\n   2.0 in client-server integration scenarios where the end-user
    may not\n   be present.\n\n   This specification only defines abstract message
    flow and assertion\n   content.  Actual use requires implementation of a companion
    protocol\n   binding specification.  Additional profile documents provide standard\n
    \  representations in formats such as SAML and JWT.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
