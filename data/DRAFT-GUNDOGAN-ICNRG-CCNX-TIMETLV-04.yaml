abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CCNx utilizes delta time for a number of functions.  When using
    CCNx\n   in environments with constrained nodes and/or bandwidth constrained\n
    \  networks, it is valuable to have a compressed representation of delta\n   time.
    \ In order to do so, either accuracy or dynamic range has to be\n   sacrificed.
    \ Since the current uses of delta time do not require both\n   simultaneously,
    one can consider a logarithmic encoding such as that\n   specified in [IEEE.754.2019].
    \ This document updates _CCNx messages\n   in TLV Format_ (RFC8609) to specify
    this alternative encoding.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
