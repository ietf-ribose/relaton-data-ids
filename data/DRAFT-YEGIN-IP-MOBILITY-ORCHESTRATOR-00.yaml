abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Host stacks can support mobility at multiple layers.  Mobility\n
    \  protocols operating at different layers constitute alternate\n   solutions
    with various pros and cons, and they can also have adverse\n   affects on each
    other when used simultaneously.  Optimal results in\n   terms of seamless handover
    and data-path optimization can be achieved\n   when execution of these protocols
    are coordinated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
