abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Often, connections created across the Internet have multiple
    options\n   of how to communicate: address families, specific IP addresses,\n
    \  network attachments, and application and transport protocols.  This\n   document
    describes how an implementation can race multiple options\n   during connection
    establishment, and expose this functionality\n   through an API.\n\n\t </p>\n
