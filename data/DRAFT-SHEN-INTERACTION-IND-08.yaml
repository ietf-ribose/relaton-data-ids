abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In SIP-based networks, a SIP session MAY involve several application\nservers
    on the originating and terminating side.  In a certain case,\nan application server
    needs to set some indications in SIP message to\nindicate service information
    (what are invoked, what can be allowed\nand what should blocked).  This kind of
    information will be also\nrequired for composition of SIP applications.  There
    is a need to\nprovide indicators for service interaction between SIP application\nservers
    or other SIP endpoints.\n\nThis document describes a mechanism of service interaction
    indicator\nfor the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that enhances service\ninteraction
    between SIP application servers in a trusted network.\n\t </p>\n      "
