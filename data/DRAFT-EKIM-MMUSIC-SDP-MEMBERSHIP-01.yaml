abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a set of Session Description Protocol
    \n   (SDP)attributes that allow SDP to provides tightly controlled \n   membership
    information. Some multimedia conferencing applications may \n   require strict
    membership control policies. A group session creator \n   describes basic membership
    information in SDP, and it can be \n   negotiated by the Offer / Answer model.
