abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses DoT/DoH deployment considerations for home
    networks. It particularly sketches the required steps to use DoT/DoH capabilities
    provided by local networks. One of the goals of this document is to assess to
    what extent existing tools can be used to provide a DoT/DoH service. As an outcome,
    new DHCP and Router Advertisement Options are specified in order to convey a DNS
    Authentication Domain Name.</p>"
