abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a general notary service and the protocols
    to\nbe used when communicating with it.  The Notary Authority is a Trusted\nThird
    Party (TTP) that can be used as one component in building reliable\nnon-repudiation
    services (see [ISONR]).  We also give an example of how\nto use the notary to
    extend the lifetime of a signature beyond key\nexpiry or revocation.\n\t </p>\n
