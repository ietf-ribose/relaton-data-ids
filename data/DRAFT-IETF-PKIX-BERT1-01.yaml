abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>More and more, standards agencies that use PKI technologies \ndeveloped
    and promulgated through the efforts of the IETF have come \nto ask for a finite
    method of representing a discrete instant in \ntime as a referable event. The
    present document establishes defined \ndata structures for requesting a Basic
    Event Representation Token \n(BERT), after it has been issued by a Trusted Timebase
    provider.\n\t </p>\n      "
