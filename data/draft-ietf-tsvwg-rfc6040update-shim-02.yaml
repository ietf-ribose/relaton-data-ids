abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 6040 on "Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion Notification" made the
    rules for propagation of ECN consistent for all forms of IP in IP tunnel. This
    specification extends the scope of RFC 6040 to include tunnels where two IP headers
    are separated by at least one shim header that is not sufficient on its own for
    packet forwarding. It surveys widely deployed IP tunnelling protocols separated
    by a shim and updates the specifications of those that do not mention ECN propagation
    (L2TPv2, L2TPv3, GRE and Teredo). The specification also updates RFC 6040 with
    configuration requirements needed to make any legacy tunnel ingress safe.</p>
