abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC8231 describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful\n
    \  control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS Label Switched Paths(LSPs) via PCEP.\n   One of
    the extensions is the LSP object which includes a Flag field\n   and the length
    is 12 bits.  However, 11 bits of the Flag field has\n   been assigned in RFC8231,
    RFC8281 and RFC8623 respectively.\n\n   This document updates RFC8231 by defining
    a new LSP-EXTENDED-FLAG TLV\n   for LSP object to extend the length of the flag.\n\n\t
