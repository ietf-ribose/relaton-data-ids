abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IS-IS protocol exchanges Link State Packet (LSP) to exchange\n
    \  routing information.  The lifetime of this LSP is located in the LSP\n   header
    and is neither protected from corruption by the Fletcher\n   checksum nor by cryptographic
    authentication.  So the LSP lifetime\n   may be altered, either accidentally or
    maliciously any time.\n\n   The lifetime field of the LSP is an important field
    for the correct\n   operation of IS-IS.  Corruption of this LSP lifetime may cause\n
    \  flooding storm with severe impact in the network.\n\n   This draft documents
    the problem statement and calls for a solution.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
