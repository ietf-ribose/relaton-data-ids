abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mobile IPv6 protocol is being adopted by various Standards Development
    Organizations (SDO) for mobility across wide area networks. Some of the architectures
    developed by these SDOs require some of the access links to be home link for mobile
    node. The belief is that if the mobile node thinks it is attached to the home
    link, there will not be additional packet overhead due to Mobile IPv6 tunneling.
    Many of these links where the mobile node is supposed to be attached to the home
    link are point-to-point links. There are some issues with making these point-to-point
    links appear like home link to the mobile node. This document captures some of
    the issues related to this, and analyzes possible solutions.</p>"
