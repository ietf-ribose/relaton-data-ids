abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft presents some notes on Constraint-Based Routing. The mainpurpose
    is to standardize the terminology used, and define thesemantics of the various
    constructs used in Constraint-Based Routingso that implementations from a wide
    variety of vendors will have (atleast to the first order) similar results in path
    selection. Asecondary goal is to define the semantics of optimization, which wedefine
    as the recalculation of routes that have already been computedand established.</p>"
