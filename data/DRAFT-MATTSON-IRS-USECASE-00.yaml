abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes use-cases for IRS to provide a lightweight\n
    \  method for common management and control state for typical operations\n   and
    workflows of multilayer networks involving both IP and sub-IP\n   transport. IRS
    provides a lightweight, streaming interface between\n   routing systems and external
    applications. By extending the IRS model\n   to transport systems, multi-layer
    networks can be managed and used\n   more efficiently. IRS may enable the integration
    of IP and transport\n   maintenance workflows leading to a reduction in operational
    costs.\n   IRS server having visibility into both Optical Transport and IP\n   domains
    will also be able to make optimal use of transport\n   infrastructure.\n\n\t </p>\n
