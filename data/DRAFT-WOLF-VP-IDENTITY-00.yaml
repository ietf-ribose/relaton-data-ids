abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A virtual presence client needs information to display people
    who \n   meet. It needs a name, an image, maybe an animated avatar, and more.
    \n   This document describes the storage and exchange of public user \n   identity
    data. The virtual presence identity data format is optimized \n   for VP applications,
    where many people need the public data of their \n   peers, some only once, some
    repeatedly, where changes happen \n   frequently and must be propagated quickly
    with minimum bandwidth. \n\t </p>\n      "
