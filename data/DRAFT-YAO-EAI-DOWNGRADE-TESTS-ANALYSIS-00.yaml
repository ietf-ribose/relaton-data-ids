abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The protocols specified in current EAI documents such as RFC5335,\nRFC5336
    and RFC5504 are in experimental category.  Many organizations\nhave implemented
    and tested the internationalized email systems.\nRecently, many discussions focus
    on the issues of downgrading\nimplementation and testing.  This memo provides
    some analysis in\ndepth about downgrade testing, which will help us deploy the
    EAI\nsystem and the re-charter work of the working group in the near\nfuture.\n\t
