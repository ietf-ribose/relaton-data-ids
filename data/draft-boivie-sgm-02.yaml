abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Multicast has become increasingly important with the emergence ofnetwork-based
    applications such as IP telephony and videoconferencing. The Internet community
    has done a significant amountof work on IP multicast over the last decade [1-10]
    and as aresult, there are a number of multicast applications that are usedtoday
    on the Mbone, the multicast-capable virtual network that islayered on top of (portions
    of) the Internet [10]. However, whiletoday's multicast schemes are scaleable in
    the sense that they cansupport very large multicast groups, there are scalability
    issueswhen a network needs to support a very large number of distinctmulticast
    groups. This document describes a new scheme formulticast that complements the
    existing schemes. Whereas theexisting schemes can support a limited number of
    very largemulticast groups, the scheme described here can support a verylarge
    number of small multicast groups.</p>"
