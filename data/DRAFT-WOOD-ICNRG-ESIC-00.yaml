abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to transport CCNx packets inside
    an\n   encrypted session between peers - a sender and receiver - that share\n
    \  a traffic secret, such as that which is derived from [CCNxKE].  The\n   peers
    create an outer naming context to identify the encryption\n   session in one direction
    between the sender and the receiver.  The\n   sender issues encrypted Interest
    messages to the receiver, who\n   responds with encrypted Content Objects.  Inside
    the outer context,\n   the sender sends Interests with different names, for which
    the\n   receiver may reply to or send InterestReturns in response.  There\n   does
    not need to be a naming relationship between the outer names and\n   the inner
    names.  The inner content is still protected by normal CCNx\n   authentication
    mechanisms and possibly encrypted under other schemes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
