abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the air interface of the Metropolitan
    Beacon \n   System (MBS) system.   \n           \n   MBS provides a high precision,
    reliable, consistent positioning system \n   indoors and in urban canyons, where
    GNSS solutions are degraded or denied.  \n           \n          In addition to
    the high 2-D accuracy, the MBS system architecture also \n          provides for
    high resolution and accuracy in the vertical dimension, with \n          the aid
    of embedded sensors.  \n           \n          MBS technology provides a very
    fast time to first fix (TTFF), on the order \n          of ~6 seconds under cold
    start conditions.  \n           \n          Similar to GNSS, MBS technology allows
    computation of the location on the \n          device without any network dependence
    thus enabling a wide variety of \n          standalone applications.  \n               \n\t
