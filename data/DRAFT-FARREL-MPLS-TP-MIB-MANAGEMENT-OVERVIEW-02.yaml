abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A range of Management Information Base (MIB) modules has been\ndeveloped
    to help model and manage the various aspects of\nMultiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) networks.  These MIB modules are\ndefined in separate documents that focus
    on the specific areas of\nresponsibility of the modules that they describe.\n\nThe
    MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of MPLS\nfunctionality specific
    to the construction of packet-switched\ntransport networks.\n\nThis document describes
    the MIB-based management architecture for\nMPLS-TP and indicates the interrelationships
    between the different\nMIB modules used for MPLS-TP network management.\n\nThis
    document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) / International
    Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\nStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort
    to include an MPLS Transport\nProfile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
    to support the\ncapabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network
    as\ndefined by the ITU-T.\n\nThis Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving
    IETF\nConsensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an IETF\nLast
    Call.\n\n[RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and\ninsert
    the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published\nRFC has IETF Consensus.]\n\n\n\n\nFarrel
    &amp; King, et al.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[page 1]\ndraft-farrel-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-01.txt\n\nSeptember
