abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document records a format whereby a network operator can
    publish\n   a mapping of IP address ranges to simplified geolocation information,\n
    \  colloquially termed a geolocation \"feed\".  Interested parties can\n   poll
    and parse these feeds to update or merge with other geolocation\n   data sources
    and procedures.\n\n   Some technical organizations operating networks that move
    from one\n   conference location to the next have already experimentally published\n
    \  small geolocation feeds.  At least one consumer (Google) has\n   incorporated
    these ad hoc feeds into a geolocation data pipeline.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
