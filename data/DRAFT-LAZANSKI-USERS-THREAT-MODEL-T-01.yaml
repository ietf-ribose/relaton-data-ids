abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RFC 3552 introduces a threat model that does not include endpoint\nsecurity.
    Yet increasingly protocol development is making assumptions\nabout endpoint security
    capabilities which have not been defined. RFC\n3552 is 17 years old and threat
    landscape has changed. Security issues\nand cyber attacks have increased and there
    are more devices, users, and\napplications on the endpoint than ever. This draft
    proposes a new\napproach to the Internet threat model which will include endpoint\nsecurity,
    focus on users and provide an update to the threat model in\nRFC 3552. It brings
    together Security Considerations for Protocol\nDesigners draft-lazanski-protocol-sec-design-model-t-01
    which is a\ncomprehensive document that lists threats, attack vectors, examples
    and\nconsiderations for designing protocols, as well as draft-taddei-smart-\ncless-introduction-02
    which lays out security concerns, capabilities\nand limitations for endpoints
    in general and draft-mcfadden-smart-\nendpoint-taxonomy-for-cless-01 which outlines
    a clear taxonomy for\nendpoint security and identifies changes in technology,
    economic and\nprotocol development that has impacted and changed endpoint security.\nTaken
    together these drafts reflect a comprehensive and clear set of\nsecurity threats
    and design considerations for the Internet.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
