abstract:
  content: "<p>When a large number of clients register with a SIP registrar serverat
    approximately the same time, the server may become overloaded.Near-simultaneous
    floods of SIP SUBSCRIBE and PUBLISH requests mayhave similar effects. Such request
    avalanches can occur, forexample, after a power failure and recovery in a metropolitan
    area.This document describes how to avoid such overload situations. Underthis
    mechanism, a server estimates an avalanche restart backoffinterval during its
    normal operation and conveys this interval to itsclients through a new Restart-Timer
    header in normal responsemessages. Once an avalanche restart actually occurs,
    the clientsperform backoff based on the previously received Restart-Timer headervalue
    before sending out the first request attempt. Thus, themechanism spreads all the
    initial client requests and prevents themfrom overloading the server.</p>"
