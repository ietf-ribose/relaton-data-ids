abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft addresses the need for a common, advanced, clientprogramming
    interface to mainframe host data. Applicationdevelopers, in particular third party
    application vendors, useAPI's provided by client emulator programs to write applicationsthat
    access host data. Currently, the defacto standard HLLAPI isthe interface most
    commonly provided by these programs and the oneused by the third party application
    vendors. However, HLLAPI isplagued by the fact that it doesn't exploit modern
    programmingtechniques and is fragmented by multiple, proprietaryimplementations.
    Client vendors have, over the last couple of years,developed more advanced interfaces
    that exploit modern programmingadvances. However no effort has been put into standardizing
    theseinterfaces and application developers have been forced to eitherchose to
    stay with HLLAPI or perform costly re-implementation oftheir products to support
    each competing advanced client API.</p>"
