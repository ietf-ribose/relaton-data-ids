abstract:
  content: "<p>Based on the QoS architecture and the DS codepoints defined inRFC2474
    and RFC2475 we define an application that creates a trustedenvironment. We introduce
    the notion of Trusted Networks (TN) anetwork that has to satisfy a set of rules
    that can be specified byeach network owner. Packets originating from this or another
    TN canbe treated with higher confidence and higher QoS than packets fromuntrusted
    networks. The basic tool of our proposal is ingressfiltering RFC2827. This approach
    may apply to both IPv4 and IPv6.</p>"
