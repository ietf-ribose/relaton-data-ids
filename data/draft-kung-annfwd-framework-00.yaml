abstract:
  content: "<p>There are a number of situations in the Internet where it would beuseful
    to be able to have an application be able to send traffic to adestination without
    revealing the IP address of the destination tothe source, or the IP address of
    the source to the destination, orboth. One way to do this is to have a network
    resident set ofservers which can forward packets, with encryption and decryptionapplied
    to their source and destination addresses when appropriate.We will call this server
    an anonymizing forwarder. The anonymizingforwarding server intends to contribute
    to the goal of supportinganonymity at the IP layer [NymIP].</p>"
