abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes a distributed Control Element for SDN\n
    \  implementations. This document describes various complexities\n   associated
    with data-center management on adoption of new\n   technologies in data center
    networking. While Server vitalization,\n   cloud computing have very much increased
    the networking complexities\n   while OpenFlow/SDN gives a different perspective
    which could provide\n   solution.  Network virtualisation is next thing in happening.\n
    \  Traditional methods of managing each data-center element are\n   increasing
    management complexities. The key to reduce the management\n   complexity, and
    have automated infrastructure in very highly scaled\n   data center network is
    to have orthogonal management and control\n   network to the Data network. A distributed
    CE yet with a single\n   manager orchestrating the networks will give much needed
    intelligence\n   to OF controller.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
