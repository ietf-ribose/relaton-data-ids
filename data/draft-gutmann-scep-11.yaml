abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Simple Certificate Enrolment Protocol (SCEP),
    a PKI protocol that leverages existing technology by using CMS (formerly known
    as PKCS #7) and PKCS #10 over HTTP. SCEP is the evolution of the enrolment protocol
    sponsored by Cisco Systems, which enjoys wide support in both client and server
    implementations, as well as being relied upon by numerous other industry standards
    that work with certificates.</p>"
