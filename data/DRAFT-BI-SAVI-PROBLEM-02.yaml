abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IETF Source Address Validation Improvements (SAVI) working
    group is\n   chartered for source address validation within the first hop from
    the\n   end hosts, i.e. preventing a node from spoofing the IP source address\n
    \  of another node in the same IP link.  For source address validation\n   beyond
    the first hop (SAVI-BF), Ingress Filtering [BCP38]/[BCP84] is\n   the best current
    practice.  However Ingress Filtering may drop\n   legitimate packets (false positive)
    or fail to recognize spoofing\n   packets (false negative) in case of asymmetric
    routing, which is not\n   rare under SAVI-BF scenario.\n\n   This document states
    the possible scenarios in which Ingress\n   Filtering may have problems (false
    positive or false negative).  We\n   claim that the reason of the problems is
    that the routers are lack of\n   sufficient routing information to predict the
    incoming direction of a\n   packet, since source address validation beyond the
    first hop should\n   act consistently with the behavior of the routing system.
    \ We also\n   discuss the availability of the needed routing information under\n
    \  different routing environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
