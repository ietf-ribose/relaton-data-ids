abstract:
- content: "<p>In PIM-SM networks PIM Register messages are sent by the Designated
    Router (DR) to the Rendezvous Point (RP) to signal the presence of Multicast sources
    in the network. There are periodic PIM Null- Registers sent from the DR to the
    RP to keep the state alive at the RP as long as the source is active. The PIM
    Null-Register message carries information about a single Multicast source and
    group. This document defines a standard to send multiple multicast source and
    group information in a single PIM Null-Register message, in a packed format. This
    document also discusses the interoperability between the PIM routers which do
    not understand the packed message format with multiple multicast source and group
    details.</p>"
