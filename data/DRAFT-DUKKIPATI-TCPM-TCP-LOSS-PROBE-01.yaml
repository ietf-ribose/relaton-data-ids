abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Retransmission timeouts are detrimental to application latency,\n
    \  especially for short transfers such as Web transactions where\n   timeouts
    can often take longer than all of the rest of a transaction.\n   The primary cause
    of retransmission timeouts are lost segments at the\n   tail of transactions.
    \ This document describes an experimental\n   algorithm for TCP to quickly recover
    lost segments at the end of\n   transactions or when an entire window of data
    or acknowledgments are\n   lost.  Tail Loss Probe (TLP) is a sender-only algorithm
    that allows\n   the transport to recover tail losses through fast recovery as
    opposed\n   to lengthy retransmission timeouts.  If a connection is not receiving\n
    \  any acknowledgments for a certain period of time, TLP transmits the\n   last
    unacknowledged segment (loss probe).  In the event of a tail\n   loss in the original
    transmissions, the acknowledgment from the loss\n   probe triggers SACK/FACK based
    fast recovery.  TLP effectively avoids\n   long timeouts and thereby improves
    TCP performance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
