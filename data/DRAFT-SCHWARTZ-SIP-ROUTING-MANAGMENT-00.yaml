abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>While much attention has been given in Session Initiation Protocol\n(SIP)
    to the process of securing caller identity end-to-end, SIP \nrouting headers (e.g.
    via, route etc) have not garnered the same \nattention and have gone largly unchanged
    since RFC 3261. Since SIP \npromotes the routing directives to the application
    layer it is \nimperative that these decisions not be tampered with by a malicious
    \nparty. Specifically, Route and Via headers are passed \"in the clear\" \nwithout
    any security mechanism to insure the integrity of the \ninformation. This draft
    summarizes the problems with the existing \n\n\t </p>\n      "
