abstract:
  content: "<p>This file is a proposal for location and discovery of filter resources
    selected by search-conditions. The peers,which are virtually grouped,construct
    n-tuple overlay virtual hierarchical tree overlay network.With cached addresses
    of peers, the overload of traffic in treestructure can be avoided. The resources
    are classified into hierarchicaldomains, and registered into the peers which are
    located in the samedomain virtual groups as the resources'. This proposal supportsflexible
    queries by a SQL-like query statement.</p>"
