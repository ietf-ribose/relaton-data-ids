abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) supports grouping media
    lines.\nSDP also has semantics defined for grouping the associated source and\nForward
    Error Correction (FEC)-based repair flows.  However, the\nsemantics that were
    defined in RFC 4756 generally fail to provide the\nspecific grouping relationships
    between the source and repair flows\nwhen there are more than one source and/or
    repair flows in the same\ngroup.  Furthermore, the existing semantics also do
    not support\nadditive repair flows and prioritization among the repair flows\nprotecting
    one or more source flows.  This document addresses these\nissues by introducing
    new FEC grouping semantics.\n\t </p>\n      "
