abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Delegated namespaces underpin almost every Internet-scale system
    -\n   domain name management, IP address allocation, Public Key\n   Infrastructure,
    etc. - but are centrally managed by entities with\n   unilateral revocation abilities
    and no common interface.  This draft\n   specifies a generalized scheme for delegation
    that supports explicit\n   time-bound guarantees and limits misuse.  Mappings
    may be secured by\n   any general purpose distributed consensus protocol; clients
    can query\n   the local state of any number of participants and receive the correct\n
    \  result barring a compromise at the consensus layer.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
