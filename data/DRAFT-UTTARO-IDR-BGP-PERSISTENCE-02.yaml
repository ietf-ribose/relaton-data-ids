abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document we introduce a new BGP capability termed \"Long-lived\n
    \  Graceful Restart Capability\" so that stale routes can be retained for\n   a
    longer time upon session failure.  In addition a new BGP community\n   \"LLGR_STALE\"
    is introduced for marking stale routes retained for a\n   longer time.  We also
    specify that such long-lived stale routes be\n   treated as the least-preferred,
    and their advertisements be limited\n   to BGP speakers that have advertised the
    new capability.  Use of this\n   extension is not advisable in all cases, and
    we provide guidelines to\n   help determine if it is.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
