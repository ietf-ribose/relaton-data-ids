abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document analyzes a set of solution candidates which have
    been\n   proposed to mitigate some of the issues encountered when address\n   sharing
    is used.  In particular, this document focuses on means to\n   reveal a host identifier
    when a Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) or\n   application proxies are involved in the
    path.  This host identifier\n   must be unique to each host under the same shared
    IP address.\n\n   The ultimate goal is to assess the viability of proposed solutions\n
    \  and hopefully to make a recommendation on the more suitable\n   solution(s).\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
