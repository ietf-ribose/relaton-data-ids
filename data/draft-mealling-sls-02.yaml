abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Developing technology to allow for truly internationalized Internetidentifiers
    is proving a hard nut to crack within the framework ofthe existing DNS. At the
    same time, the DNS continues to do anexcellent job at serving its original mandate

    that can handle the more human oriented identificationservices it is now being
