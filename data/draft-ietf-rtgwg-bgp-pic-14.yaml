abstract:
  content: "<p>In the network comprising thousands of iBGP peers exchanging millionsof
    routes, many routes are reachable via more than one next-hop.Given the large scaling
    targets, it is desirable to restore trafficafter failure in a time period that
    does not depend on the number ofBGP prefixes. In this document we proposed an
    architecture by whichtraffic can be re-routed to ECMP or pre-calculated backup
    paths in atimeframe that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. Theobjective
    is achieved through organizing the forwarding datastructures in a hierarchical
    manner and sharing forwarding elementsamong the maximum possible number of routes.
    The proposed techniqueachieves prefix independent convergence while ensuring incrementaldeployment,
    complete automation, and zero management and provisioningeffort. It is noteworthy
    to mention that the benefits of BGP-PIC arehinged on the existence of more than
    one path whether as ECMP orprimary-backup.</p>"
