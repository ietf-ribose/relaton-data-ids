abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document extends BFD mechanism to support detection function
    for\npackets with variable lengths.  Through dynamically changing the\nlength
    of BFD packets, it can detect both traditional faults such as\nlink failure or
    route fault, as well as non-forwarding problem for\npackets with a length in a
    special range, which maybe caused by\nequipment's internal defects.\n\t </p>\n
