abstract:
- content: "<p>Header Compression has proven to be essential for using RTP over bandwidth
    limited links. While all of these links have only a limited bandwidth, some are
    additional extremely unreliable, e.g. wireless links. It is shown, that existing
    Header Compression schemes, that work well over reliable links, perform very bad,
    if many errors occur. This led to the development of a new robust Header Compression
    mechanism, that is introduced in this paper. The core idea is the definition of
    keyword packets, which reduces the amount of discarded packets at the decompressor.
    The Header Compression scheme, the used packet formats and the decompression algorithm,
    are described in detail.</p>"
