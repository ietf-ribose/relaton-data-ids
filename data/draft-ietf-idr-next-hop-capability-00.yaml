abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5492 defines capabilities advertisement for the BGP peer. In addition,
    it is useful to be able to advertise BGP Next-Hop dependant capabilities, in particular
    for forwarding plane features. RFC 5492 is not applicable because the BGP peer
    may be different from the BGP Next-Hop, in particular when BGP Route Reflection
    is used. This document defines a mechanism to advertise such BGP Next Hop dependant
    Capabilities. This document defines a new BGP non-transitive attribute to carry
    Next-Hop Capabilities. This attribute is deleted or possibly modified when the
    BGP Next Hop is changed. This document also defines a Next-Hop capability to advertise
    the ability to handle the MPLS Entropy Label defined in RFC 6790. It updates RFC
    6790 with regard to this BGP signaling.</p>"
