abstract:
- content: "<p>Various proposals have been submitted to the ROHC working group for
    enabling the use of ROHC [RFC3095] header compression over Ethernet, 802.11 and
    other 802-based links. Previous proposals generally suffered from a lack of systems
    perspective on 802 networks. The present document attempts to supply some systems
    perspective and provides a rough outline for a solution. This is a submission
    to the IETF ROHC WG. Please direct discussion to its mailing list, rohc@ietf.org
    $Revision: 1.9 $</p>"
