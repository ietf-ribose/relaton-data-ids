abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the MultiPoint Relay Flooding (MPRF) protocol
    for maintenance of efficient flooding structures in mobile ad-hoc networks. The
    protocol is an adaptation of the classical flooding algorithm, with the difference
    that many nodes are relieved of the responsibility to relay flooded messages while
    still ensuring that all nodes receive the messages. The key concept used in the
    protocol is that of multipoint relays (MPRs). MPRs are selected nodes which are
    the only nodes needed to forward messages during the flooding process. This technique
    substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to the more straightforward
    and well-known flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message just
    once, upon receiving the first copy of the message. The protocol is particularly
    suitable for dense networks.</p>"
