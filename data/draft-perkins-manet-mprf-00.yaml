abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the MultiPoint Relay Flooding (MPRF) protocolfor
    maintenance of efficient flooding structures in mobile ad-hocnetworks. The protocol
    is an adaptation of the classical floodingalgorithm, with the difference that
    many nodes are relieved of theresponsibility to relay flooded messages while still
    ensuring thatall nodes receive the messages. The key concept used in the protocolis
    that of multipoint relays (MPRs). MPRs are selected nodes whichare the only nodes
    needed to forward messages during the floodingprocess. This technique substantially
    reduces the message overheadas compared to the more straightforward and well-known
    floodingmechanism, where every node retransmits each message just once, uponreceiving
    the first copy of the message. The protocol is particularlysuitable for dense
    networks.</p>"
