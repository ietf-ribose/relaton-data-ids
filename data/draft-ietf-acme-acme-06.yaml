abstract:
- content: "<p>Certificates in PKI using X.509 (PKIX) are used for a number of purposes,
    the most significant of which is the authentication of domain names. Thus, certificate
    authorities in the Web PKI are trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate
    legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the certificate. Today, this verification
    is done through a collection of ad hoc mechanisms. This document describes a protocol
    that a certification authority (CA) and an applicant can use to automate the process
    of verification and certificate issuance. The protocol also provides facilities
    for other certificate management functions, such as certificate revocation.</p>"
