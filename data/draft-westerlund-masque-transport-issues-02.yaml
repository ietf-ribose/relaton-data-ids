abstract:
- content: "<p>The HTTP Connect method uses back-to-back TCP connections to and from
    a proxy. Such a solution takes care of many transport aspects as well as IP Flow
    related concerns. With UDP and IP proxying on the other hand, there are several
    per-packet and per-flow aspects that need consideration to preserve the properties
    of end- to-end IP/UDP flows. The aim of this document is to highlight and provide
    solutions for these issues related to UDP and IP proxying.</p>"
