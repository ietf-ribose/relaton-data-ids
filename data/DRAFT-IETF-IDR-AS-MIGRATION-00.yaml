abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft discusses common methods of managing an ASN migration\n
    \  using some BGP feaures that while commonly-used are not formally part\n   of
    the BGP4 protocol specification and may be vendor-specific in\n   exact implementation.
    \ It is necessary to document these de facto\n   standards to ensure that they
    are properly supported in future BGP\n   protocol work such as BGPSec.\n\n\t </p>\n
