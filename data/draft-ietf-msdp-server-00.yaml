abstract:
- content: "<p>The MSDP protocol is based on the assumption that there is one or a
    few RPs in the PIM domain. In the presence of potential numerous RPs in the context
    of multicast security, Source Active messages will be flooded unnecessarily to
    the RPs that are not responsible for the concerning group in the messages.</p>"
