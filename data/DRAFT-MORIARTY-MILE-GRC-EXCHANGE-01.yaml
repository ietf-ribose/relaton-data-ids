abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) programs provide oversight\n
    \  (governance) of risks and compliance initiatives within an\n   organization.
    \ GRC reports are increasingly provided in an XML\n   format.  This specification
    defines a common method to securely\n   transport GRC and other XML reports.  The
    defined messaging\n   capability provides policy options and markings in an XML
    schema,\n   options for confidentiality at the document/report level, and\n   security
    for the end-to-end communication.  XML reports may be shared\n   between service
    providers and clients, enterprises, or within\n   enterprises.  Reports may also
    be exchanged for official purposes\n   such as business report filings, compliance
    report filings, and the\n   handling of legal incidents (eWarrant, eDiscovery,
    etc.)  This work\n   is a generalized format derived from the secure exchange
    of incident\n   information defined by RFC6045-bis, Real-time Inter-network Defense\n
    \  (RID).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
