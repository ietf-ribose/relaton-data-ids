abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an authentication service that uses EAP transported
    employing CoAP messages with following purposes: 1) Authenticate a CoAP-enabled
    device that enters a new security domain managed by a domain Controller, 2) Derive
    key material to protect CoAP messages exchanged between them, enabling the establishment
    of a security association between them, and 3) Optionally, to generate key material
    for other types of Security Associations. Generally speaking, this document is
    specifying an EAP lower layer based on CoAP, to bring the benefits of EAP to IoT.</p>"
