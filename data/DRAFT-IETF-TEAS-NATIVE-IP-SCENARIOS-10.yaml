abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Requirements for providing the End to End(E2E) performance
    assurance\n   are emerging within the service provider network.  While there are\n
    \  various technology solutions, there is no one solution which can\n   fulfill
    these requirements for a native IP network.  One universal\n   (E2E) solution
    which can cover both intra-domain and inter-domain\n   scenarios is needed.\n\n
    \  One feasible E2E traffic engineering solution is the addition of\n   central
    control in a native IP network.  This document describes\n   various complex scenarios
    and simulation results when applying the\n   Path Computation Element (PCE) in
    a native IP network.  This\n   solution, referred to as Centralized Control Dynamic
    Routing (CCDR),\n   integrates the advantage of using distributed protocols and
    the power\n   of a centralized control technology.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
