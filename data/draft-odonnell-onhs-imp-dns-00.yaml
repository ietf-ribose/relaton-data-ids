abstract:
- content: "<p>An Open Network Handle System (ONHS) provides an intermediate level
    of service between IP numbers and domain names. A handle adheres permanently to
    an owner, who may assign and reassign it to dif- ferent addresses at will. But
    a handle is a number, carrying no significance in natural language. Any user desiring
    a handle may generate one from a public key. This memo describes a simple imple-
    mentation of an Open Network Handle System using the security extensions to the
    Domain Name System (DNSSEC).</p>"
