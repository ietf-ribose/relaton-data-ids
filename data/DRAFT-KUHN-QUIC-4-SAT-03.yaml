abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   QUIC has been designed for use across Internet paths.  Initial\n
    \  designs of QUIC have focussed on common deployment scenarios for web\n   traffic
    and have not focussed on the performance when using a path\n   with a large Bandwidth-Delay
    Product (BDP).  A path can combine\n   satellites network segment together with
    a wide variety of other\n   network technologies (Ethernet, cable modems, WiFi,
    cellular, radio\n   links, etc): this complicates the characteristics of the end-to-end\n
    \  path.  One example of such a scenario occurs when a satellite\n   communication
    (SATCOM) system is used to provide all or a part of the\n   end-to-end path.  If
    this is not addressed, the end-to-end quality of\n   experience can be degraded.\n\n
    \  This memo identifies the characteristics of a SATCOM link that impact\n   the
    operation of the QUIC transport protocol.  It proposes regression\n   tests to
    evaluate QUIC over SATCOM links.  It discusses how to ensure\n   acceptable protocol
    performance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
