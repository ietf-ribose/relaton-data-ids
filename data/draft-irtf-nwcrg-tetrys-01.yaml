abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Tetrys, an On-The-Fly Network Coding (NC) protocol
    that MAY be used to transport delay and loss-sensitive data over a lossy network.
    Tetrys MAY recover from erasures within an RTT-independent delay, thanks to the
    transmission of coded packets. This document is a record of the experience gained
    by the authors while developing and testing in real conditions the Tetrys protocol.
    This document is a product of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications
    Research Group (NWCRG). It conforms to the NWCRG taxonomy[RFC8406].</p>"
