abstract:
  content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) allows a flexible definition of end-to-end paths
    within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological subpaths called
    "segments". These segments are advertised by the link-state routing protocols
    (IS-IS and OSPF). This document describes the OSPFv3 extensions required for Segment
    Routing with the MPLS data plane.</p>
