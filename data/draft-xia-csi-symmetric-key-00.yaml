abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In this document, a method for provisioning a shared key from therouter
    to the host is defined to protect Neighbor Discovery(ND)signaling between the
    router and the host. The host sends a RouterSolicitation(RS) message with ND Shared
    Key Request Option to therouter. The router encrypts a ND shared key using the
    host's SEcureNeighbor Discovery(SEND) public key and sends it back to the hostthrough
    a Router Advertisement(RA) message. The host decrypts the NDshared key using the
    matching private key. The Neighbor Discoveryshared key is then used for protecting
    the following NeighborDiscovery signaling between the router and the host. The
    RouterSolicitation and Router Advertisement message exchanges are requiredto have
    SEND security.</p>"
