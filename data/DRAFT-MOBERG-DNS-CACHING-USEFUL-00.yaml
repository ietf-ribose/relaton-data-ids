abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p> This memo suggests that the usage of very small TTL values in
    SOA RRs\n [1] for dynamic environments such as when using DHCP with DNS dynamic\n
    updates [2] will affect the performance of the DNS as a whole in a\n negative
    manner and should therefore be avoided.\n \n However, this memo is in no way meant
    to be an exhaustive analysis\n of the issue, more of an invitation to discuss
    how to avoid\n future scalability issues while still providing expected service.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
