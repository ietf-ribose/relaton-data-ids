abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo reclassifies the address block 240.0.0.0/4 as usable\n
    \  address space.  While the community has not concluded whether the\n   block
    should be considered public or private, given the current\n   consumption rate,
    it is clear that the block should not be left\n   unused.  This document also
    makes several recommendations on ways\n   that current implementations of the
    IP protocol stack will need to be\n   modified to make this address space usable.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
