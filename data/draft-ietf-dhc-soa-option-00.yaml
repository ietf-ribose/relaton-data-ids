abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new option in DHCPv6 for Service-Oriented
    Address assignment for a particular type of service that DHCPv6 Clients provide.
    The Service-Oriented Address can be either Anycast/Shared Unicast or a Well-known
    Unicast Address. This address assignment is much similar to other address type
    assignments, except that Service-Oriented Address assignment requires the specification
    of Service Type of the node that is requesting the address.</p>"
