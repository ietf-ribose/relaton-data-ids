abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network Time Protocol Version 4 (NTPv4) defines the optional\n
    \  usage of extension fields. An extension field is an optional field\n   that
    resides at the end of the NTP header, and can be used to add\n   optional capabilities
    or additional information that is not conveyed\n   in the standard NTP header.
    The current definition of extension\n   fields in NTPv4 is somewhat ambiguous
    regarding the connection\n   between extension fields and the presence of a Message
    Authentication\n   Code (MAC). This draft clarifies the usage of extension fields
    in the\n   presence and in the absence of a MAC, while maintaining\n   interoperability
    with existing implementations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
