abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN), Bundle Agents form
    an\noverlay network that forwards DTN bundles between their source and\ndestination
    applications.  This document describes a mechanism that\nBundle Agents can use
    to discover when they are in contact with one\nanother and optionally provide
    information on the additional\nproperties of current or future contacts, such
    as duration and\ncapabilities.  This information can be used to trigger bundle\nforwarding
    or make future bundle scheduling decisions.\n\t </p>\n      "
