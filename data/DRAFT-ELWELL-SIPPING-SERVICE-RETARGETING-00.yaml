abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This contains motivation, requirements and a proposed solution
    for \n   indicating service retargeting information in SIP requests and \n   responses.
    Retargeting of a request can be considered to be service \n   retargeting when
    it goes beyond \"normal\" routing and might be of \n   interest to applications
    at the UAS or UAC. \n\t </p>\n      "
