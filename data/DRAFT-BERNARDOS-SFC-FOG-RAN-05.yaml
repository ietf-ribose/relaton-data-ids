abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Fog Radio Access Networks (RAN) refers to the part of the RAN
    that is\n   virtualized at the very edge of the network, even at the end-user\n
    \  device.  Fog RAN support is considered critical for the 5G mobile\n   network
    architectures currently being developed in various research,\n   standardization
    and industry forums.  Since fog RAN builds on top of\n   virtualization and can
    involve several virtual functions running on\n   different virtualized resources,
    Service function chaining (SFC)\n   support for the fog RAN will be critical.
    \ This document describes\n   the overall fog RAN approach and also gives some
    use cases.  Finally\n   it proposes some requirements to be considered in the
    development of\n   the SFC architecture and related protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
