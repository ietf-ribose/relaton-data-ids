abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step,
    file\n   transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a\n
    \  remote host.  One of its primary uses is the early stages of nodes \n   booting
    from a Local Area Network. TFTP has been always used because\n   it is very simple
    to implement. However, the choice of a lock-step\n   schema is not the most efficient
    for use on a LAN.\n\n   This document describes a TFTP option which allows the
    client and\n   server to negotiate a windowsize of consecutive blocks to send
    \n   as an alternative for replacing the single block lock-step schema. \n   The
    TFTP Option Extension mechanism is described in [2].\n\t </p>\n      "
