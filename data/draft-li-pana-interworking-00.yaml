abstract:
  content: "\t <t>EAP is a lower layer dependant protocol that has 802.1X and PANA
    tocarry it over link layer and network layer respectively. 802.1Xcannot go through
    any nodes, while PANA can carry EAP through thenetwork over network layer. 802.1X
    is popular on legacy terminals,but it is painful to upgrade all these terminals
    to support PANA.This document introduces a PANA interworking function that enableslegacy
    802.1X terminals get authentication and access to PANA networkwithout upgrading
    its software or hardware.</p>"
