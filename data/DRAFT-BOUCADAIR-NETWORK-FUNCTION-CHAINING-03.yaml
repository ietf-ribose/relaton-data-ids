abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IP networks rely more and more on the combination of advanced\n
    \  functions (besides the basic routing and forwarding functions).  This\n   document
    defines a solution to enforce Service Function Chaining\n   (SFC) with minimum
    requirements on the underlying network.\n\n   The proposed solution allows for
    Differentiated Forwarding\n   (DiffForward): packets are classified and marked
    at the entry point\n   of an SFC-enabled network, and are then forwarded on a
    per SFC map\n   basis.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
