abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Autonomic systems were first described in 2001.  The fundamental
    goal\n   is self-management, including self-configuration, self-optimization,\n
    \  self-healing and self-protection.\n\n   This document applies the concepts
    of autonomic systems to a network,\n   and describes the definitions and design
    goals of Autonomic\n   Networking.  The goal is a network where nodes have minimal\n
    \  dependencies on human administrators or centralized management\n   systems.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
