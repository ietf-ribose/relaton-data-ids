abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) performance as described in Terminology document [5]. The methodology
    and terminology are to be used for benchmarking signaling plane performance with
    varying signaling and media load. Both scale and establishment rate are measured
    by signaling plane performance. The SIP Devices to be benchmarked may be a single
    device under test (DUT) or a system under test (SUT). Benchmarks can be obtained
    and compared for different types of devices such as SIP Proxy Server, SBC, P-CSCF,
    and Server paired with a Firewall/NAT device.</p>"
