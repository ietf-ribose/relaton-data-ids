abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the methodology for benchmarking SessionInitiation
    Protocol (SIP) performance as described in Terminologydocument [5]. The methodology
    and terminology are to be used forbenchmarking signaling plane performance with
    varying signaling andmedia load. Both scale and establishment rate are measured
    bysignaling plane performance. The SIP Devices to be benchmarked maybe a single
    device under test (DUT) or a system under test (SUT).Benchmarks can be obtained
    and compared for different types ofdevices such as SIP Proxy Server, SBC, P-CSCF,
    and Server paired witha Firewall/NAT device.</p>"
