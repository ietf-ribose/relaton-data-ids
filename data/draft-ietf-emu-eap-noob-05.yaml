abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple
    authentication methods. This document defines the EAP-NOOB authentication method
    for nimble out-of-band (OOB) authentication, and key derivation. The EAP method
    is intended for bootstrapping all kinds of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that
    have no pre-configured authentication credentials. The method makes use of a user-assisted
    one-directional OOB message between the peer device and authentication server
    to authenticate the in-band key exchange. The device must have a non-network input
    or output interface, such as a display, microphone, speaker, or blinking light,
    which can send or receive dynamically generated messages of tens of bytes in length.</p>"
