abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The REGISTER function is used in a SIP system primarily to associate\na
    temporary contact address with an address-of-record.  This contact\nis generally
    in the form of a URI, such as Contact:\n&lt;sip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com&gt; and
    is generally dynamic and associated\nwith the IP address or hostname of the SIP
    UA.  The problem is that\nnetwork topology may have one or more SIP proxies between
    the UA and\nthe registrar, such that any request travelling from the user's home\nnetwork
    to the registered UA must traverse these proxies.  The\nREGISTER method does not
    give us a mechanism to discover and record\nthis sequence of proxies in the registrar
    for future use.  This\ndocument defines an extension header field, 'Path' which
    provides\nsuch a mechanism\n\t </p>\n      "
