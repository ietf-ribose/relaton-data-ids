abstract:
- content: "<p>The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol is used to carry data
    on behalf of other services using the Opaque Link State Advertisements. The protocol's
    flooding mechanism is well suited to cover the data propagation requirements of
    services such as Traffic Engineering. However, the current mechanism cannot scale
    for a large number of services nor satisfy some of their new set of requirements.
    This document describes a new mechanism in OSPF to support service and data distribution
    for a large number of services, computation of preferred service access points
    and a controlled service data exchange.</p>"
