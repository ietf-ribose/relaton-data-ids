abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We discuss security architectural design considerations for\n
    \    general-purpose multi-hop ad-hoc networks. The security\n     architecture
    fits extremely constrained wireless environments,\n     such as sensor networks,
    while remaining uniform and general\n     enough to fit any wireless network.
    The design is tailored towards\n     low overall implementation cost, supports
    semi-automatic lifecycle\n     management, including ease of installation and
    configuration,\n     scalability, survivability, mobility, and is adaptable towards\n
    \    network topology changes and towards different trust models\n     underlying
    network operations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
