abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Security Extensions define a process for validating received
    data and assert them authentic and complete as opposed to forged. This document
    is focused clarifying the scope and responsibilities of DNSSEC Resolver Operators
    (DRO) as well as operational recommendations that DNSSEC validators operators
    SHOULD put in place in order to implement sufficient Trust that makes DNSSEC validation
    output accurate. The recommendations described in this document include, provisioning
    mechanisms as well as monitoring and management mechanisms.</p>"
