abstract:
- content: "<p>A simple method of enhancing Domain Name System (DNS) with network
    awareness is discussed. This enables DNS system responses that are dependent on
    communication service requirements such as QoS or path without changes in the
    format of DNS protocol messages or application program interfaces (APIs). The
    different enhancement methods and use cases are discussed.</p>"
