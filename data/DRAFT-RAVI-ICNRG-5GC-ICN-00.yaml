abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The proposed 3GPP's 5G core nextgen architecture (5GC) offers\n
    \  flexibility to introduce new user and control plane function within\n   the
    context of network slicing that allows greater flexibility to\n   handle heterogeneous
    devices and applications.  In this draft, we\n   provide a short description of
    the proposed 5GC, followed by\n   extensions to 5GC's control and user plane to
    support packet data\n   unit (PDU) sessions from information-centric networks.
    \ The value of\n   enabling ICN in 5GC is discussed using two service scenarios
    which\n   include mobile edge computing and support for seamless mobility for\n
    \  ICN sessions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
