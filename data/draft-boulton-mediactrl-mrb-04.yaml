abstract:
  content: "<p>The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF is currently proposing anarchitecture
    for controlling media services. The Session InitiationProtocol (SIP) will be used
    as the signalling protocol which providesmany inherent capabilities for message
    routing. In addition to suchsignalling properties, a need exists for intelligent,
    applicationlevel media service selection based on non-static signallingproperties.
    This is especially true when considered in conjunctionwith deployment architectures
    that include 1:M and M:M combinationsof Application Servers and Media Servers.</p>"
