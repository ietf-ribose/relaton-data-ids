abstract:
  content: "<p>To provide a robust model for modifying documents and data within adistributed
    World Wide Web authoring environment, it is necessary tofurnish a methodology
    which controls access to objects. Access controlmay include the ability to read
    an object, modify an object, or performother more advanced functions upon an object.
    Access control isnecessary to prevent unauthorized access or modification of objectswithin
    the authoring environment which could lead to unintended loss,damage or disclosure
    of data. This document proposes requirements for the support of access controlwithin
    a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) environment.It describes a
    model for the representation and interpretation of accesscontrol policies, and
    a set of operations needed to manage policies inthat form. It is intended that
    these requirements be supported withinthe framework of the proposed WebDAV extensions
    [WEBDAV1] to HTTP[HTTP], in the form of additional protocol operations and compliancerequirements
    for clients and servers</p>"
