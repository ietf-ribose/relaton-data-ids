abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a CBOR encoding and profiling of X.509
    public\n   key certificate suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) deployments.\n
    \  The full X.509 public key certificate format and commonly used ASN.1\n   DER
    encoding is overly verbose for constrained IoT environments.\n   Profiling together
    with CBOR encoding reduces the certificate size\n   significantly with associated
    known performance benefits.\n\n   The CBOR certificates are compatible with the
    existing X.509\n   standard, enabling the use of profiled and compressed X.509\n
    \  certificates without modifications in the existing X.509 standard.\n\n\t </p>\n
