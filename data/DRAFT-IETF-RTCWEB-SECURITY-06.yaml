abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-Time Communications on the Web (RTCWEB) working group
    is\n   tasked with standardizing protocols for real-time communications\n   between
    Web browsers, generally called \"WebRTC\".  The major use cases\n   for WebRTC
    technology are real-time audio and/or video calls, Web\n   conferencing, and direct
    data transfer.  Unlike most conventional\n   real-time systems (e.g., SIP-based
    soft phones) WebRTC communications\n   are directly controlled by a Web server,
    which poses new security\n   challenges.  For instance, a Web browser might expose
    a JavaScript\n   API which allows a server to place a video call.  Unrestricted
    access\n   to such an API would allow any site which a user visited to \"bug\"
    a\n   user's computer, capturing any activity which passed in front of\n   their
    camera.  This document defines the WebRTC threat model and\n   analyzes the security
    threats of WebRTC in that model.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
