abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 3552 introduces a threat model that does not include endpoint\n
    \  security. RFC 3552 is 15 years old and in those 15 years the threat\n   landscape
    has changed. Security issues and cyber attacks have\n   increased and there are
    more devices, users, and applications on the\n   endpoint than ever. This draft
    proposes a new approach to the\n   Internet threat model which will include endpoint
    security, focus on\n   users and provide an update to the threat model in RC 3552.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
