abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Providing an existing scalable authorization infrastructure for
    mobilenodes is needed for IPv6-based mobility. SIM Authentication providesa protocol
    for authenticating and authorizing services. It uses anauthorizing home domain
    defined by the Subscriber Identity Module(SIM). The protocol is an Internet Control
    Message Protocol for IPv6(ICMPv6) extension. It can leverage the existing SIM
    authorizationinfrastructure for automatic bootstrapping of security associationbetween
    the mobile node and a service, where the service can bee.g. authorized last-hop
    VPN setup for network access or Mobile IPv6mobile-home security association setup.</p>"
