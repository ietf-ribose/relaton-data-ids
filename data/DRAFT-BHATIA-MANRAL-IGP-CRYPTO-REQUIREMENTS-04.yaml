abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The interior gateway routing protocols Open Shortest Path First
    \n   version 2 (OSPFv2) [RFC2328], Intermediate System to Intermediate \n   System
    (IS-IS) [ISO] [RFC1195] and Routing Information Protocol (RIP) \n   [RFC2453]
    currently define Clear Text and Message Digest 5 (MD5) \n   [RFC1321] algorithms
    for authenticating their protocol packets. There \n   have recently been documents
    adding support of the Secure Hash \n   Algorithm (SHA) family of hash functions
    for authenticating routing \n   protocol packets for RIP [RFC4822], IS-IS [ISIS-HMAC]
    and OSPF [OSPF-\n   HMAC]. \n    \n   To ensure interoperability between disparate
    implementations, it is \n   imperative that we specify a set of mandatory-to-implement
    algorithms \n   thereby ensuring that there is at least one algorithm that all
    \n   implementations will have available.   \n    \n   This document defines the
    current set of mandatory-to-implement \n   algorithms to be used for the cryptographic
    authentication of these \n   routing protocols as well as specifying the algorithms
    that should be \n   implemented because they may be promoted to mandatory at some
    future \n   time.\n\t </p>\n      "
