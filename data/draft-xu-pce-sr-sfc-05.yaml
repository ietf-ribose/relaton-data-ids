abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS-SPRING (a.k.a., MPLS Segment Routing) could be leveraged to realize
    a unified source routing mechanism across MPLS, IPv4 and IPv6 data planes by using
    a unified source routing instruction set while preserving backward compatibility
    with MPLS-SPRING. More specifically, the source routing instruction set information
    contained in a source routed packet could be uniformly encoded as an MPLS label
    stack no matter the underlay is IPv4, IPv6 or MPLS. The unified source routing
    mechanism could be leveraged to realize a transport-independent service function
    chaining by encoding the service function path information or service function
    chain information as an MPLS label stack. This document describes extensions to
    the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a PCE to compute and instantiate
    service function paths in the unifed source routing based service function chaining
    context. The extensions specified in this document are applicable to both the
    stateless PCE model and the stateful PCE model.</p>"
