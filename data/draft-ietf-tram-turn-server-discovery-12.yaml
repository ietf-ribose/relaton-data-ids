abstract:
- content: "<p>Current Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) server discovery mechanisms
    are relatively static and limited to explicit configuration. These are usually
    under the administrative control of the application or TURN service provider,
    and not the enterprise, ISP, or the network in which the client is located. Enterprises
    and ISPs wishing to provide their own TURN servers need auto-discovery mechanisms
    that a TURN client could use with minimal or no configuration. This document describes
    three such mechanisms for TURN server discovery. This document updates RFC 5766
    to relax the requirement for mutual authentication in certain cases.</p>"
