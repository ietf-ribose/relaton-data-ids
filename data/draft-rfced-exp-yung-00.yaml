abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, filetransfer
    protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto aremote host. This document
    describes a new TFTP option. This new option will allowthe multiple client to
    receive the same file concurrently through theuse of Multicast packets. The TFTP
    Option Extension mechanism isdescribed in [2]. Often when similar computers are
    booting remotely they will eachdownload the same image file. By adding multicast
    into the TFTP optionset, two or more computers can download a file concurrently,
    thusincreasing network efficiency. This document assumes that the reader is familiar
    with the terminologyand notation of both [1] and [2].</p>"
