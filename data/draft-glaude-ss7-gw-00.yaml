abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo defines an architectural framework for transporting SS7signaling
    information over Internet Protocol networks. It describes aSignaling Gateway which
    acts as a bridge between the SS7 and IPnetworks. The Signaling Gateway can be
    configured as an SS7 end-nodeor as a Signal Transfer Point (STP) deployed singly
    or in a mated pairconfiguration. An application program interface (API) allows
    multipleremote devices, such as Media Gateways and Media Gateway Controllers,to
    register with the Signaling Gateway using TCP or UDP. The APIconsists of MTP and
    SCCP primitives which remote devices can use tosend and receive ISUP and TCAP
    messages to effect PSTN call control andaccess Intelligent Network databases.
    The MTP and SCCP primitivesensure that application states (available, unavailable
    or congested)are propagated into the SS7 network. This memo also identifies some
    functional and performance requirementsfor SS7 signaling transport to IP-based
    application processes residingon one or more client hosts.</p>"
