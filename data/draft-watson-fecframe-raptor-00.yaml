abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction(FEC)
    Schemes for the Raptor code and its application to reliabledelivery of media streams
    in the context of FEC Framework. TheRaptor code is a systematic code, where a
    number of repair symbolsare generated from a set of source symbols and sent in
    one or morerepair flows in addition to the source symbols that are sent to thereceiver(s)
    within a source flow. The Raptor code offers a close tooptimal protection against
    arbitrary packet losses at a lowcomputational complexity. Two FEC Schemes are
    defined, one forprotection of arbitrary packet flows and another for protection
    of asingle flow that already contains a sequence number. Repair data maybe sent
    over arbitrary datagram transport (e.g. UDP) or using RTP.An RTP Payload Type
    is defined for this latter case.</p>"
