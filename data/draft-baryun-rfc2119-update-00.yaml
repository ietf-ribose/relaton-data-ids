abstract:
- content: <p>In many standards track documents conditional words are used to signify
    the requirements in the specification. These words are prefered to be capitalized.
    This document defines these conditional words as they should be interpreted in
    IETF documents. Authors who follow these guidelines should incorporate this phrase
    near the beginning of their document. The additional key words to words described
    in RFC2119 are; "IF, THEN", "ELSE IF", "ELSE".</p>
