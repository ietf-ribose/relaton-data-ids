abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>At the 51st IETF meeting in London, there was much disagreement
    in \nthe MIDCOM working group about the need for topology information in \nthe
    MIDCOM requirements. It was decided that there should be a \n'contest of champions'
    in which interested parties write drafts \ndescribing their solution to the problem.
    \nThis document presents a proposal for the inclusion of minimal \ntopological
    information in the MIDCOM protocol by the use of \nabstract realms.\n\t </p>\n
