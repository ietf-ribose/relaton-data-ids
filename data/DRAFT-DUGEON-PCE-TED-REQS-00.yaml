abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   During the past 4 years, Path Computation Element (PCE) WG
    has\n   produced a set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path\n   Computation
    Element as a tool to help MPLS-TE LSP tunnels placement.\n   In the PCE architecture,
    a main assumption has been done concerning\n   the information that the PCE needs
    to perform its computation: the\n   Traffic Engineering Database (TED) contains
    all pertinent and\n   suitable information regarding the networks that is in the
    scope of a\n   PCE.  Nevertheless, requirements and inventory of TED information\n
    \  have not been formalized.  In addition, some recent RFC (like BRPC\n   RFC
    5441) or WG draft (like draft-ietf-pce-hierarchy ...) suffer from\n   a lack of
    information coming from the TED resulting to a non optimal\n   result or some
    difficulties to deploy them.  This memo tries to\n   identity all TED requirements
    for the PCE as well as provides some\n   helps to operators to fulfill the PCE
    TED.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
