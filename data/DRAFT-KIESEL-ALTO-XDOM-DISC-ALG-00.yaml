abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is
    to\n   provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several\n   hosts
    from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired\n   resource.  ALTO is
    realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an\n   ALTO client can ask for guidance
    it needs to discover one or more\n   ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance.\n\n
    \  This document contains a strawman proposal for an ALTO Cross-Domain\n   Server
    Discovery procedure (also known as Third-Party Discovery).\n   Technically, the
    algorithm specified in this document takes one\n   IP address and a U-NAPTR Service
    Parameter (i.e., \"ALTO:http\" or\n   \"ALTO:https\") as parameters.  It performs
    several DNS lookups (for\n   U-NAPTR and SOA resource records) and returns one
    or more URI(s) of\n   information resources related to that IP address.\n\n   The
    functionality has been validated in a lab environment.  However,\n   the feasibility
    and possible side-effects of Internet-wide\n   \"production use\" are not yet
    understood.  The purpose of this\n   document is to foster further discussion
    within the ALTO working\n   group.  Readers of this document should exercise caution
    in\n   evaluating its value for implementation and deployment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
