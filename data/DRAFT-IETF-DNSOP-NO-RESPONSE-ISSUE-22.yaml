abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS is a query / response protocol.  Failing to respond
    to\n   queries, or responding incorrectly, causes both immediate operational\n
    \  problems and long term problems with protocol development.\n\n   This document
    identifies a number of common kinds of queries to which\n   some servers either
    fail to respond or else respond incorrectly.\n   This document also suggests procedures
    for zone operators to apply to\n   identify and remediate the problem.\n\n   The
    document does not look at the DNS data itself, just the structure\n   of the responses.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
