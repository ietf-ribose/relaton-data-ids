abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   6LoWPAN networks rely on application protocols like CoAP to
    enable\n   RESTful communications in constrained environments.  Many of these\n
    \  networks make use of \"Sleepy Nodes\": battery powered devices that\n   switch
    off their (radio) interface during most of the time to\n   conserve battery energy.
    \ As a result of this, Sleepy Nodes cannot be\n   reached most of the time.  This
    fact prevents using normal\n   communication patterns as specified in the CoRE
    group, since the\n   server-model is not applicable to these devices.  This document\n
    \  discusses and specifies an architecture to support Sleepy Nodes such\n   as
    battery-powered sensors in 6LoWPAN networks with the goal of\n   guiding and stimulating
    the discussion on Sleepy Nodes support for\n   CoAP in the CoRE WG.\n\n\t </p>\n
