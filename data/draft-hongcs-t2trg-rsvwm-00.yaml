abstract:
  content: "<p>Wireless network virtualization is one of the auspiciousapproach to
    address the increasingdemand of mobile data services. It enables logically decouplingthe
    traditional cellular network into infrastructure providers(InPs) and mobile virtual
    network operators (MVNOs). It alsooffers a virtualized wireless network (VWN),
    efficient resourceutilization, and isolation between network slices (i.e., MVNOs).
    Inthis paper, we consider wireless network slicing fora single InPwho owns radio
    resources and multiple MVNOs who need radioresources to provide specific services
    to their mobile users. Oneof the challenges in wireless network slicing is how
    toefficiently allocate the limited radio resources available at theInP to the
    MVNOs. In this paper, we addressthe problem of efficient allocation of the InP
    radioresources to the MVNOs which aims to maximize thetotal network capacity of
    the InP. To this end,we decompose our considered problem into two phases. Thefirst
    phase is an efficient allocation of the InP radioresources (bandwidth) to the
    MVNOs, and the second phaseis an optimal allocation of MVNOs resources gained
    fromthe InP to their mobile users. We then proposea Generalized Kelly Mechanism
    framework and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to solve the first and thesecond
    phase of our resource allocation problem, respectively.</p>"
