abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the model for application and network interaction
    in reaction to Application Area Architecture Workshop held on February 11 and
    12, 2008. There is not completed mechanism for collaboration between application
    and network yet even though a solution is required. The model proposed in this
    document is designed without a layer violation.</p>"
