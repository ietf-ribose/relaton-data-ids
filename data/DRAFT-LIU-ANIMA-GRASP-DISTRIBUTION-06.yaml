abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the requirement of capability of information\n
    \  distribution among autonomic nodes in autonomic networks. In general,\n   information
    distribution can be categorized into two different modes:\n   1) one autonomic
    node instantly sends information to other nodes in\n   the domain; 2) one autonomic
    node can publish some information and\n   then some other interested nodes can
    subscribe the published\n   information. In the former case, information data
    will be generated\n   and consumed instantly. In the latter case, however, information
    data\n   shall be stored in the network and retrieved when necessary.\n\n   These
    capabilities are fundamental and basic to a network system and\n   an autonomic
    network infrastructure (ANI) should consider to\n   integrate them, rather than
    assisted by other transport or routing\n   protocols (HTTP, BGP/IGP as bearing
    protocols etc.).  Thus, this\n   document clarifies possible use cases and requirements
    to ANI so that\n   information distribution can be natively supported. Possible
    options\n   realizing the information distribution function are also briefly\n
    \  discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
