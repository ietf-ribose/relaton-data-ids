abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a revised version of the global HAHA
    protocol\n   specification.  Global HAHA allows the deployment of Home Agents
    over\n   the Internet for reliability, scalability and performance purposes.\n
    \  This version clarifies several issues that were vague in the original\n   specification.
    \ Global HAHA makes use of the signaling defined by the\n   Home Agent Reliability
    protocol (HARP) although it is not designed to\n   operate in conjunction with
    HARP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
