abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>LIP is an extension of MPLS for use in Lossy and Low power Networks\n(LLN).
    \ Use of MPLS allows rapid response to local topology changes\nwithin an LLN,
    while still using full IP routing both within the LLN\nand for packets that cross
    into other domains.  LIP has optional RIP\ncommands for discovering and maintaining
    label switched tree routes.\nTo support local route repair, labeled packets include
    a path metric\nused to detect loops in label-switched paths.  Labeled messages
    may\noptionally include a source route or route record at the label level\nin
    order to allow their use without losing the advantages of label\nswitching.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
