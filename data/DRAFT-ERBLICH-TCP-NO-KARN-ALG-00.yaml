abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Karn's algorithm specifies acknowledgements that are the\nresult
    of segment retransmits should be ignored, not timed,\nand should not contribute
    to the smoothed round-trip-time\n(SRTT) because they are considered \"ambiguous\".
    \ It is also\nstated in Karn's paper that \"If an acknowledgement arrives\nafter
    the RTO has expired, it is highly likely to come very\nshortly after wards.\"
    In time, we have added the \"fast retransmit\"\nfunctionality, so we are not solely
    dependent on RTO for\nretransmits.  Common sense dictates that if we receive an\nacknowledgement
    \"very shortly after wards\", that those\nacknowledgments should not be considered
    \"ambiguous\". These\nnon-ambiguous acknowledgments should be added to the SRTT
    and\ntrigger us to return to our previous non-congestion behavior.\n\n\t </p>\n
