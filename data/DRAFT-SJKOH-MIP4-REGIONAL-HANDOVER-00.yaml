abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document addresses how to support fast handover in regional
    MIPv4 \nnetworks (Regional Hanover). The proposed regional handover scheme is
    \ndesigned based on the existing MIPv4 Post-Registration scheme in a \nmore effective
    way that the regional MIPv4 features are exploited. In \nthe proposed regional
    handover scheme, the GFA acts as an anchor FA \nand thus the bi-directional handover
    tunnels are established between \nGFA and nFA, not between oFA and nFA.  \n\t
