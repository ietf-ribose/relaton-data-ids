abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BGP specification describes a Decision Process for selecting
    the\n   best route.  This process uses a series of steps, made up of path\n   attributes
    and other values, to first determine the Degree of\n   Preference of a route and
    later as tie breakers.  While existing\n   mechanisms may achieve some of the
    same results described in this\n   document, they can only do so through extensive
    configuration such as\n   matching communities to explicit policy and/or route
    preference\n   configurations present on each BGP speaker within their\n   administrative
    domain (autonomous system).  Implementing some\n   specific fine grained policies
    through such mechanisms is cumbersome,\n   if even possible.\n\n   This document
    defines a new Extended Community, called the Cost\n   Community, which may be
    used as part of the Decision Process.  The\n   end result is a local Custom Decision
    Process.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
