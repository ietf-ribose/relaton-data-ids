abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the problem of distributed data discovery
    in\n   edge computing.  Increasing numbers of IoT devices and sensors are\n   generating
    a torrent of data that originates at the very edges of the\n   network and that
    flows upstream, if it flows at all.  Sometimes that\n   data must be processed
    or transformed (transcoded, subsampled,\n   compressed, analyzed, annotated, combined,
    aggregated, etc.) on edge\n   equipment, particularly in places where multiple
    high bandwidth\n   streams converge and where resources are limited.  Support
    for edge\n   data analysis is critical to make local, low-latency decisions (e.g.,\n
    \  regarding predictive maintenance, the dispatch of emergency services,\n   identity,
    authorization, etc.).  In addition, (transformed) data may\n   be cached, copied
    and/or stored at multiple locations in the network\n   on route to its final destination.
    \ Although the data might originate\n   at the edge, for example in factories,
    automobiles, video cameras,\n   wind farms, etc., as more and more distributed
    data is created,\n   processed and stored, it becomes increasingly dispersed throughout\n
    \  the network.  There needs to be a standard way to find it.  New and\n   existing
    protocols will need to be identified/developed/enhanced for\n   distributed data
    discovery at the network edge and beyond.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
