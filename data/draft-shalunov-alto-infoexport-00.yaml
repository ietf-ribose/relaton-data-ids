abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The ALTO Information Export Service is a simple way to convey ISProuting
    policy preferences to applications. Applications that coulduse this service are
    those that have a choice in connectionendpoints. Examples of such applications
    are peer-to-peer andcontent delivery networks.Applications already have access
    to great amount of underlyingtopology information. For example, views of the Internet
    routingtable are easily available at looking glass servers and entirelypractical
    to download to every client. What is missing is therouting policy information
    -- what does the local ISP actuallyprefer?This document describes a very simple
    mechanism that would allow toexport such information to applications. While such
    service wouldprimarily be provided by the network, i.e., the local ISP, thirdparties
    could also operate this service.1. Requirements notationThe key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",
    \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in thisdocument are to be interpreted
    as described in [RFC2119].2. OverviewEach network region can choose to support
    the ALTO service. (Anetwork region in this context is an Autonomous System, an
    ISP, orperhaps a smaller region -- the details depend on the mechanism ofdiscovery.)The
    service works as follows:1. The ISP prepares the ALTO information. This maps some
    IP prefixes or AS numbers into priority values. Higher priority values indicate
    higher desirability of the prefix. There is a default treatment for IP numbers
    that are in none of the prefixes or AS numbers.2. The ISP serializes the information
    into a sequence of octets (Section 4).3. The application, running on a given host,
    discovers the resource and fetches the serialized ALTO information (Section 3).4.
    The application makes use of the information by preferring IP numbers with higher
    priority (Section 5).The part of the ISP MAY be implemented, to give a few examples
    thatdo not preclude other implementation options,by running a script connecting
    to existing equipment, fetchingrouting information, and then generating and uploading
    therequisite file;by running a database-backed application that is obtains routinginformation
    from existing equipment and generates the requisitefile dynamically;by modifying
    the software or hardware of existing equipment tosupport these functions; orby
    using new equipment for the purpose of operating this networkservice.3. DiscoveryDiscovery
    per se is out of scope for this document and will behandled separately.The necessary
    property of discovery is that a client, starting fromnothing on today's Internet
    that does not yet universally supportglobal-scope multicast and may include NATs,
    can find a URL thatdescribes the location of the local ALTO service, as configured
    bythe ISP.Subsequent sections assume that this URL is found. So that maximumnumber
    of clients can use the ALTO service, the URL schema SHOULD be\"http\" or \"https\".</p>"
