abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a limited common set of Diffserv PHBs
    and\n   codepoints (DSCPs) to be applied at (inter)connections of two\n   separately
    administered and operated networks, and explains how this\n   approach can simplify
    network configuration and operation.  Many\n   network providers operate MPLS
    using Treatment Aggregates for traffic\n   marked with different Diffserv PHBs,
    and use MPLS for interconnection\n   with other networks.  This document offers
    a simple interconnection\n   approach that may simplify operation of Diffserv
    for network\n   interconnection among providers that use MPLS and apply the Short-\n
    \  Pipe tunnel mode.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
