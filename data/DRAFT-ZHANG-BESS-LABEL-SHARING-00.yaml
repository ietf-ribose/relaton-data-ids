abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to be used by VPN (Virtual
    Private\n   Network) Service Providers to provide multi-homed CEs with fast\n
    \  protection of egress PEs. Egress PEs in a redundant group always\n   share
    the same label in distribution of VPN routes of a VRF. A\n   virtual Next Hop
    (vNH) in the IGP/MPLS backbone is created as the\n   common end of LSP tunnels
    which would otherwise terminate at each\n   egress PE. Primary and backup LSP
    tunnels ended at the vNH are set up\n   by MPLS on the basis of existing Interior
    Gateway Protocol (IGP) Fast\n   ReRoute (FRR) mechanisms. If the primary egress
    PE fails, the backup\n   egress PE can recognize the \"shared\" VPN route label
    carried by the\n   data packets.  Therefore, the failure affected data packets
    can be\n   smoothly rerouted to the backup PE for delivery without changing\n
    \  their VPN route label.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
