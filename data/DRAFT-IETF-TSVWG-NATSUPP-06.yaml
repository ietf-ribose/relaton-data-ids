abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable\n
    \  communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to\n   TCP
    [RFC0793].  With the widespread deployment of Network Address\n   Translators
    (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT for TCP\n   that allows multiple
    hosts to reside behind a NAT and yet use only a\n   single globally unique IPv4
    address, even when two hosts (behind a\n   NAT) choose the same port numbers for
    their connection.  This\n   additional code is sometimes classified as Network
    Address and Port\n   Translation (NAPT).  To date, specialized code for SCTP has
    not yet\n   been added to most NATs so that only pure NAT is available.  The end\n
    \  result of this is that only one SCTP capable host can be behind a\n   NAT.\n\n
    \  This document describes the protocol extensions required for the SCTP\n   endpoints
    to help NATs provide similar features of NAPT in the\n   single-point and multi-point
    traversal scenario.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
