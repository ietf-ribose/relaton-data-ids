abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network-based security solutions are used by enterprises, the
    public\n   sector, internet-service providers, and cloud-service providers to\n
    \  both complement and enhance host-based security solutions.  As TLS is\n   a
    widely deployed protocol to secure communication, these network-\n   based security
    solutions must necessarily interact with it.  This\n   document describes this
    interaction for current operational security\n   practices and notes the impact
    of TLS 1.3 on them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
