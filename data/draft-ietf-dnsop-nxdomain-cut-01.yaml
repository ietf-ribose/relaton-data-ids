abstract:
- content: "<p>This document states clearly that when a DNS resolver receives a response
    with response code of NXDOMAIN, it means that the domain name which is thus denied
    AND ALL THE NAMES UNDER IT do not exist. REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: this document
    should be discussed in the IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) group, through its mailing
    list. The source of the document, as well as a list of open issues, is currently
    kept at Github [1]. This documents clarifies RFC 1034 and modifies a bit RFC 2308
    so it updates both of them.</p>"
