abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC6265 by defining a \"First-Party-Only\"\n
    \  attribute which allows servers to assert that a cookie ought to be\n   sent
    only in a \"first-party\" context.  This assertion allows user\n   agents to mitigate
    the risk of cross-site request forgery attacks,\n   and other related paths to
    cross-origin information leakage.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
