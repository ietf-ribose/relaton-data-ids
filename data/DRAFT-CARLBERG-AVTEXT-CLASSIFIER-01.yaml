abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new RTP header extension. The purpose
    of the\n   extension is to provide additional information that further\n   distinguishes
    the RTP datagram (and its payload) from other datagrams\n   containing the same
    type of payload.  The information may be used to\n   assist functions performed
    by application layer gateways (such as\n   Session Border Controller or MCUs)
    and/or by routers/switches through\n   deep packet inspection. Examples of these
    functions include intelligent\n   dropping of packets or (re)setting the IP header
    diff-serv code points\n   at ingress/egress boundaries of a diff-serv domain.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
