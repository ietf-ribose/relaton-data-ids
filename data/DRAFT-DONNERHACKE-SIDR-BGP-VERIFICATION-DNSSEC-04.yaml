abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an infrastructure for real time verification\nof
    routes reveived via BGP4.  Some DNS query types are introduced to\ncheck the origin
    of a prefix and validity of the AS path. The crypto\npart can be offloaded from
    the routing engine by sending a DNS query\nand checking the AD bit in the DNS
    response. The proposal depends on\nthe DNS scalability and caching mechanisms
    as well as PKI introduced\nby DNSSEC.\n\t </p>\n      "
