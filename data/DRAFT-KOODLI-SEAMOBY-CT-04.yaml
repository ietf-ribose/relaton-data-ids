abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile nodes enhance the performance of their connections\nacross
    wireless media by establishing various kinds of state\n(context), in order to
    use the available bandwidth securely and\neconomically.  During handover from
    one access router to another, a\nbandwidth-constrained mobile node needs to have
    state information\npassed from the previous router to the new one.  This document\nproposes
    a framework for control structures that enable authorized\ncontext transfers.
    \ We demonstrate how the proposed framework could\nbe applied during handovers
    so that the applications running on\nthe mobile node could operate with minimal
    disruption, by reducing\nlatency and packet losses\n\t </p>\n      "
