abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the multipriority scheduling technology
    for\n   the interconnection between industrial field and cloud data in the\n   application
    of 5G communication.  The technology includes spectrum\n   resource scheduling
    based on 5G slice in the process of accessing\n   industrial data and task collaborative
    scheduling based on edge\n   computing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
