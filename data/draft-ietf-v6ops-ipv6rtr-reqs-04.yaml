abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet is not one network, but rather a collection of networks.
    The interconnected nature of these networks, and the nature of the interconnected
    systems that make up these networks, is often more fragile than it appears. Perhaps
    "robust but fragile" is an overstatement, but the actions of each vendor, implementor,
    and operator in such an interconnected environment can have a major impact on
    the stability of the overall Internet (as a system). The widespread adoption of
    IPv6 could, particularly, disrupt network operations, in a way that impacts the
    entire system. This time of transition is an opportune time to take stock of lessons
    learned through the operation of large-scale networks on IPv4, and consider how
    to apply these lessons to IPv6. This document provides an overview of the design
    and architectural decisions that attend IPv6 deployment, and a set of IPv6 requirements
    for routers, switches, and middleboxes deployed in IPv6 networks. The hope of
    the editors and contributors is to provide the necessary background to guide equipment
    manufacturers, protocol implementors, and network operators in effective IPv6
    deployment.</p>
