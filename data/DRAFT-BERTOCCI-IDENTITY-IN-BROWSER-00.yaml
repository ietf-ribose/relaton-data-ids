abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This informational document aims to gather in a single place
    all the\n   most important scenarios in which identity protocols in current use\n
    \  leverage web browser features to achieve their goals and deliver\n   their
    intended user experience.  The purpose of compiling this\n   scenario collection
    is to make it easier for the identity community\n   to engage with the browser
    vendors, and in particular to preserve (or\n   enhance) user experience and expressive
    power of the identity\n   protocols in mainstream use as browsers introduce new
    privacy\n   preserving restrictions and new identity tailored features.  By\n
    \  providing a single artifact, listing scenarios in a consistent\n   format,
    we hope to anchor the conversation on concrete outcomes and\n   impact of changes
    on end users, developers, providers and in general\n   everyone contributing to
    identity in the industry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
