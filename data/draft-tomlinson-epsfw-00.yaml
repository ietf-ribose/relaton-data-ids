abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In today's Internet, caching proxies that intermediate betweenHTTP
    (and increasingly streaming media) clients and serversprovide enhanced performance
    for Web page access. Both clientsand servers are increasingly looking to the network
    foradditional services that can't be provided directly on theclient or server,
    and Web proxies are an attractive place forlocating these services. In fact, some
    such services (contentassembly for advertising) are already being offered by Webproxies
    for servers, but in a nonstandard way. This documentdescribes the problem and
    solution requirements for astandardized, open and extensible service environment
    oncaching proxies which enables them to provide general servicesthat mediate,
    modify, and monitor object requests andresponses. It introduces an architectural
    framework along witha set of core requirements necessary to design standardizedimplementations
    for this application domain, taking intoaccount relevant IETF RFCs and IETF work-in-progress.
    Thearchitecture and requirements described here are mindful ofthe success of end-to-end
    nature of Internet client/serverinteractions, and the consequences of the proposedarchitectural
    changes on end-to-end semantics are discussed.</p>"
