abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>For conversational multimedia to take off, many important aspects\nhave
    still to be fully investigated. The security framework is one of\nthem. While
    some proposals on how to secure the media traffic have\nappeared, a key management
    solution has still to be developed. It\nshould take into account the conversational
    multimedia type of\nscenario and an heterogeneous communication environment, in
    which\nthin clients are used. Such a scenario will result in a number of\nchallenging
    requirements. The purpose of this document is to describe\nthe scenario and to
    list constraints and requirements on a key\nmanagement scheme for media traffic
    in conversational multimedia.\n\t </p>\n      "
