abstract:
- content: "<p>BIER introduces a novel multicast architecture. It does not require
    a signaling protocol to explicitly build multicast distribution trees, nor does
    it require intermediate nodes to maintain any per- flow state. Babel defines a
    distance-vector routing protocol that operates in a robust and efficient fashion
    both in wired as well as in wireless mesh networks. This document defines a way
    to carry necessary BIER signaling information in Babel.</p>"
