abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a hierarchical model for stateful PCE-\n
    \  initiated LSPs, based on the PCE association group mechanism.  It\n   defines
    two new association types, and introduces a generic mechanism\n   for stateful
    PCE to use P2P LSPs as component LSPs (i.e. sub-LSPs) to\n   construct and set
    up TE LSPs with complex path topology, including\n   P2MP, MP2P, and MP2MP TE
    LSPs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
