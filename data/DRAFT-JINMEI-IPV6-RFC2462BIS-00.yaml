abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the steps a host takes in deciding how
    to\n   autoconfigure its interfaces in IP version 6. The autoconfiguration\n   process
    includes creating a link-local address and verifying its\n   uniqueness on a link,
    determining what information should be\n   autoconfigured (addresses, other information,
    or both), and in the\n   case of addresses, whether they should be obtained through
    the\n   stateless mechanism, the stateful mechanism, or both.  This document\ndefines
    the process for generating a link-local address, the process\n   for generating
    site-local and global addresses via stateless address\n   autoconfiguration, and
    the Duplicate Address Detection procedure. The\n   details of autoconfiguration
    using the stateful protocol are\n   specified elsewhere.\n\t </p>\n      "
