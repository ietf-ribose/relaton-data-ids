abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The stateless as well as stateful address autoconfiguration\n
    \  Protocols, as specified by the IETF, supports links with different\n   properties.
    \ However, often these protocols assume specific\n   properties and behavior from
    the underlying link type, as for example\n   link-layer multicasting.  The solution
    designer and implementers\n   consider these specific link behavior while designing
    or extending\n   these protocols.  IETF Autoconf WG goal is to standardize mechanism\n
    \  for address autoconfiguration of nodes in a Mobile Ad Hoc Network\n   (MANET).
    \ Before designing such protocol, the link model for MANET as\n   seen by the
    IP needs to be clearly understood .  However, there is no\n   document describing
    IP link model for MANET.  This document is an\n   attempt to bridge this gap.\n\t
