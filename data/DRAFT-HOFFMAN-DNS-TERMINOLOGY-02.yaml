abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS is defined in literally dozens of different RFCs.  The\n
    \  terminology used in by implementers and developers of DNS protocols,\n   and
    by operators of DNS systems, has sometimes changed in the decades\n   since the
    DNS was first defined.  This document gives current\n   definitions for many of
    the terms used in the DNS in a single\n   document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
