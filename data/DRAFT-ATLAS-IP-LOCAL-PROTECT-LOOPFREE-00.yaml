abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an architecture and selection process
    for\n   providing local protection for IP unicast and/or LDP traffic in the\n
    \  event of a single link or node failure until the router has\n   converged.
    \ When computing the primary next-hop for a prefix, a\n   router S also determines
    an alternate next-hop which can be used if\n   the primary next-hop fails.  The
    alternate next-hop is said to be a\n   loop-free alternate, which goes to a neighbor
    whose shortest path to\n   the prefix does not go back through the router S.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
