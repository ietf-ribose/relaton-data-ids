abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for the
    global\n   (or local) DNS names of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as\n
    \  appliances and sensors.  By this scheme, the DNS name of an IoT\n   device
    can be autoconfigured with the device's category and model in\n   wired and wireless
    target networks (e.g., home, office, shopping\n   mall, smart grid, and road network).
    \ This DNS name lets IoT users\n   (e.g., home residents and customers) in the
    Internet (or local\n   network) easily identify each device for monitoring and
    remote-\n   controlling it in the target network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
