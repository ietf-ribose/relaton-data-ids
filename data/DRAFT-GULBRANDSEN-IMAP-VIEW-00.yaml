abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    The VIEW extension allows an [IMAP] client to create and manipulate\n
    \   mailbox views (persistent searches).\n\n    All [IMAP] clients can access
    a view, as if it were an ordinary\n    mailbox.  Clients which implement the VIEW
    extension can create\n    views. Clients which implement both VIEW and [LISTEXT]
    can find and\n    modify existing views.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
