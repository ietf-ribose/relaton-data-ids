abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS over TLS (DoT) has been gaining attention, primarily as
    a means\n   of communication between stub resolvers and recursive resolvers.\n
    \  There have also been discussions and experiments involving the use of\n   DoT
    to communicate with authoritative nameservers (Authoritative DNS\n   over TLS
    or \"ADoT\"), including communication between recursive and\n   authoritative
    resolvers.  However, we have identified a number of\n   operational concerns with
    ADoT.  These operational concerns need to\n   be addressed prior to ADoT's deployment
    at scale by DNS operators in\n   order to maintain the stability and resilience
    of the global DNS.\n   The document also provides some suggested next steps to
    advance the\n   operator community's understanding of ADoT's operational impact.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
