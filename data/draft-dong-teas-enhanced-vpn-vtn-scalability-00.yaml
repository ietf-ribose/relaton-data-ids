abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support the
    needs of new applications, particularly including the applications that are associated
    with 5G services. An enhanced VPN could be used for transport network slicing
    in 5G, and will also be of use in more generic scenarios. I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn
    describes the framework and candidate component technologies for providing enhanced
    VPN services. This document describes the scalability considerations in the control
    plane and data plane to enable VPN+ services, some optimization mechanisms are
    also described.</p>"
