abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>End-to-end provisioning of quality of service guarantees is nowadays
    one\nof the most basic and crucial issues. Towards this end, the inter-domain
    \nresource control architecture for DiffServ networks described in [1],\ntries
    to address this issue by applying a scalable and efficient \nsignaling approach.
    Based on this architecture, this paper tries to \nprovide an analysis and a performance
    study of the introduced quiet \ngrafting mechanisms.\n\t </p>\n      "
