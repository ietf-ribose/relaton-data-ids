abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice.\nBut
    in practice, there is.\nJan L.A. van de Snepscheut\n\nThis document discusses
    a number of differences between the IS-IS\nprotocol as described in ISO 10589
    [1] and RFC 1195 [3] and the\nprotocol as it is deployed today.  These differences
    are discussed as\na service to those implementing, testing, and deploying the
    IS-IS\nProtocol to route IP traffic.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
