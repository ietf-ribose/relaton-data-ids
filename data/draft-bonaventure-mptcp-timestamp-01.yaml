abstract:
- content: "<p>The TCP timestamps defined in [RFC1323] were designed to improve round-trip-time
    estimations and provide protection against wrapped sequence numbers (PAWS). This
    draft clarifies the utilisation of timestamps by Multipath TCP and proposes a
    new timestamp option that better suits the needs of Multipath TCP.</p>"
