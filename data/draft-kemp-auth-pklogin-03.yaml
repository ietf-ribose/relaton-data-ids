abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines the Public Key Login (PKL) protocol, a challenge-response
    authentication mechanism using digital signatures. It providesstart-of-session
    authentication for firewall proxies, dial-up NetworkAccess Servers, remote email
    servers, and interactive protocols such asTelnet and FTP. It provides functionality
    similar to One Time Passwordsand handheld authentication tokens, and it supports
    both one-way andmutual authentication. PKL uses the authentication exchanges specifiedin
    ISO/IEC 9798-3 and NIST FIPS Pub 196. The PKL protocol provides strong authentication
    at the beginning of asession, but does not by itself provide communication channel
    integrityor confidentiality. PKL should be used in conjunction with a channelintegrity
    mechanism, for example to provide authentication of individualusers over (host-keyed)
    Virtual Private Network connections. This Internet Draft is intended to be the
    last version of the PKLspecification prior to publication as an Informational
    RFC. Comments arerequested no later than the expiration date of this draft.</p>"
