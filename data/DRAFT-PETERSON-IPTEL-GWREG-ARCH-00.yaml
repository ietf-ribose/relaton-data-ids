abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents a framework in which gateways (points of\ninterconnection
    between the Public Switched Telephone Network and\nInternet-based telephone systems)
    register themselves with a location\nservice in order to communicate their own
    availability and the\navailability of the resources and services they provide.
    \ Unlike\nprevious approaches to this problem, this document considers trunk\ngroups
    as a resource which gateways register.\n\t </p>\n      "
