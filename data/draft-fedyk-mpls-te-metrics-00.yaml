abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There has recently been a lot of activity in defining the componentsfor
    MPLS-based traffic engineering. This includes the recentextensions of the Interior
    Gateway Protocols (IGPs) to carry metricsand resource class information about
    links. This memo exploresadditional metrics that are useful for traffic engineering.
    We alsodescribe some of the subtleties associated with the use of theresource
    class (or color) vector that has been defined in the IGPextensions.</p>"
