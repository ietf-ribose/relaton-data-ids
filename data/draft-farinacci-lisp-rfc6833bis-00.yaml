abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the Control-Plane and Mapping Service for the
    Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP), implemented by two new types of LISP-speaking
    devices -- the LISP Map-Resolver and LISP Map-Server -- that provides a simplified
    "front end" for one or more Endpoint ID to Routing Locator mapping databases.
    By using this control-plane service interface and communicating with Map-Resolvers
    and Map-Servers, LISP Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs) and Egress Tunnel Routers
    (ETRs) are not dependent on the details of mapping database systems, which facilitates
    experimentation with different database designs. Since these devices implement
    the "edge" of the LISP infrastructure, connect directly to LISP-capable Internet
    end sites, and comprise the bulk of LISP-speaking devices, reducing their implementation
    and operational complexity should also reduce the overall cost and effort of deploying
    LISP.</p>
