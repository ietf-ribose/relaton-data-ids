abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Aggregation has been proposed as one possible solution to the\n
    \  scalability problem of the Internet Integrated Services. The current\n   suggestions
    for aggregation are based on measurement-based admission\n   control, which allows
    for the omission of RSVP soft state in the\n   interior routers of an aggregating
    domain.\n \n   However, measurement-based admission control has certain flaws
    which\n   may lead to over-reservations on links in the network under certain\n
    \  conditions. This can result in packet losses for reserved traffic.\n   Hence,
    we believe that it will be necessary to discuss the\n   possibility of using parameter-based
    admission control with\n   aggregation.\n \n   In this document, we present a
    technique for using parameter-based\n   admission control with aggregation as
    a basis for further\n   discussions, and we evaluate possible advantages and disadvantages.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
