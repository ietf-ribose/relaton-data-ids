abstract:
- content: "<p>When an IP address is shared among several subscribers -- with a NAT
    or with an application-level proxy -- it is impossible for the server to differentiate
    between different clients. Such differentiation is valuable in several scenarios.
    This memo describes a technique to differentiate TCP clients sharing an IP address.
    The proposed method uses a TCP option, which avoids altering the application-level
    payload and works well with SSL-protected connections.</p>"
