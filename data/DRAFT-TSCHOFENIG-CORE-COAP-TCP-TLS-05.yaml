abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) was designed with TCP
    as the\n   underlying transport protocol.  The Constrained Application Protocol\n
    \  (CoAP), while inspired by HTTP, has been defined to make use of UDP\n   instead
    of TCP.  Therefore, reliable delivery and a simple congestion\n   control and
    flow control mechanism are provided by the message layer\n   of the CoAP protocol.\n\n
    \  A number of environments benefit from the use of CoAP directly over a\n   reliable
    byte stream such as TCP, which already provides these\n   services.  This document
    defines the use of CoAP over TCP as well as\n   CoAP over TLS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
