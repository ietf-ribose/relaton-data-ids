abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Neighbor Discovery (ND) is an integral part of IPv6 first-hop.
    Due\n   to limitation of certain L2 media's support to ND, a number of\n   issues
    can happen in certain scenarios. The corresponding solutions\n   for these issues
    have also been designed. These issues and solutions\n   are summarized in RFC3756,
    RFC6583, OPSECv27.  However, there is no\n   guideline on how to avoid the issues
    or how to select the proper\n   solutions.\n\n   This document analyzes existing
    solutions and summarizes the wisdoms\n   embedded in these solutions into an insight:
    isolating hosts in L2\n   and L3 can be effective in preventing ND issues. In
    deployment\n   scenarios where the ND issues can occur, this prevention approach\n
    \  can be more effective than deploying various solutions to solve the\n   issues.
    Based on this insight, a set of guidelines is proposed for\n   future ND deployments.
    These guidelines describe where and when to\n   isolate hosts in L2 and L3 to
    prevent ND issues, and how to select\n   suitable solutions for the remaining
    issues. This will likely\n   simplify ND deployments. The impact of the guidelines
    to other\n   components of IPv6 first-hop is also analyzed and appears small.\n
    \  Therefore, the guidelines will likely simplify the overall IPv6\n   first-hop
    deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
