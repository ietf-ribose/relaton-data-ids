abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is no capability negotiation done for Label Distribution\n
    \  Protocol (LDP) applications that setup Label Switched Paths (LSPs)\n   for
    IP prefixes or that signal Point-to-point (P2P) Pseudowires\n   (PWs) for Layer
    2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs). When an LDP\n   session comes up, an LDP
    speaker may unnecessarily advertise its\n   local state for such LDP applications
    even when the peer session is\n   established for some other applications like
    Multipoint LDP (mLDP)\n   or Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol (ICCP). This
    document\n   defines a solution by which an LDP speaker announces to its peer
    its\n   disinterest in such non-negotiated applications, thus disabling the\n
    \  unnecessary advertisement of corresponding application state, which\n   would
    have otherwise be advertised over the established LDP session.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
