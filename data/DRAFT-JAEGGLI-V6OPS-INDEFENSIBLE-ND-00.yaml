abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NDP resource exhastion is a problem which cannot fundamently
    be\n   addressed through limited protocol changes or implementation tweaks;\n
    \  mitigations proposed in RFC 6583 [RFC6583] may well prevent the\n   outright
    failure of a device under durress.  This draft discusses\n   some mitigations
    which have or can be employeed by networks looking\n   to reduce or eliminate
    the exposure of the Neighbor Discovery\n   Process.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
