abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes a new mechanism for multipoint-to-multipoint\n(mp2mp)
    communication in IP networks, namely Connectionless Multicast\n(CLM).  Instead
    of a group address, a list of member addresses is\nencoded in the data packets.\nThe
    traditional Host Group Model [DEER] for IP multicast requires a\nglobally unique
    address for each session.  To support this model,\nmulticast routing protocols
    create state per group in the routers.\nLike any connection oriented protocol,
    it suffers from scalability\nproblems in backbone networks where the number of
    groups to be\nmaintained can be huge.  CLM does not have this problem, and\nadditionally
    has some other advantages.  Its limitation lies in the\nnumber of members per
    multicast session, not in the number of\nsessions.  CLM will not replace the traditional
    multicast model.  CLM\noffers an alternative for mp2mp communication in the cases
    that\ntraditional multicast becomes problematic.\nThe pros and cons of CLM are
    described and suggestions are made to\nalleviate the disadvantages.  Furthermore
    different modes of\noperation are described: an end-to-end mode in close conjunction
    with\nSIP (Session Initiation Protocol [HAND]), as well as an interworking\nmode
    with PIM-SM and Simple Multicast.  Both IPv4 and IPv6 are\nconsidered.\n\t </p>\n
