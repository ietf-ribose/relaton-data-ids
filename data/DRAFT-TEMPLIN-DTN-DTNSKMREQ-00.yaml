abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces a network
    model\n   in which communications may be subject to long delays and/or\n   intermittent
    connectivity.  These challenges render traditional\n   security key management
    mechanisms infeasible since round trip delays\n   may exceed the duration of communication
    opportunities.  This\n   document therefore proposes requirements and outlines
    a design for\n   security key management in DTNs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
