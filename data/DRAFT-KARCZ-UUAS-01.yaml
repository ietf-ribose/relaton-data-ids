abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   User-Agent is a HTTP request-header field. It contains information\n
    \  about the user agent originating the request, which is often used by\n   servers
    to help identify the scope of reported interoperability\n   problems, to work
    around or tailor responses to avoid particular user\n   agent limitations, and
    for analytics regarding browser or operating\n   system use. Over the years contents
    of this field got complicated\n   and ambiguous. That was the reaction for sending
    altered version of\n   websites to web browsers other than popular ones. During
    the\n   development of the WWW, authors of the new web browsers used to\n   construct
    User-Agent strings similar to Netscape's one. Nowadays\n   contents of the User-Agent
    field are much longer than 15 years ago.\n   This Memo proposes the Uniform User-Agent
    String as a way to simplify\n   the User-Agent field contents, while maintaining
    the previous\n   possibility of their use.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
