abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a minimal initiator version of the
    Internet\n   Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol.  IKEv2 is a component of\n
    \  IPsec used for performing mutual authentication and establishing and\n   maintaining
    Security Associations (SAs).  IKEv2 includes several\n   optional features, which
    are not needed in minimal implementations.\n   This document describes what is
    required from the minimal\n   implementation, and also describes various optimizations
    which can be\n   done.  The protocol described here is interoperable with a full
    IKEv2\n   implementation using shared secret authentication (IKEv2 does not\n
    \  require the use of certificate authentication).  This minimal\n   initiator
    implementation can only talk to a full IKEv2 implementation\n   acting as responder,
    thus two minimal initiator implementations\n   cannot talk to each other.\n\n
    \  This document does not update or modify RFC 7296, but provides more\n   compact
    description of the minimal version of the protocol.  If this\n   document and
    RFC 7296 conflicts then RFC 7296 is the authoritative\n   description.\n\n\t </p>\n
