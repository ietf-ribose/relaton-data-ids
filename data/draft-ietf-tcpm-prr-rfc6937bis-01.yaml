abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates the experimental Proportional Rate Reduction
    (PRR) algorithm, described RFC 6937, to standards track. PRR potentially replaces
    the Fast Recovery and Rate-Halving algorithms. All of these algorithms regulate
    the amount of data sent by TCP or other transport protocol during loss recovery.
    PRR accurately regulates the actual flight size through recovery such that at
    the end of recovery it will be as close as possible to the ssthresh, as determined
    by the congestion control algorithm.</p>"
