abstract:
- content: "<p>Current specifications of Mobile IPv6 does not provide Home Agent Reliability
    in the home link. The aim of this draft is to introduce Virtual Home Agent Reliability
    Protocol as the solution. In this protocol multiple Home Agents coexist on the
    same home link and share the same Global IP address. Only one of them is active
    at a time and serves the Mobile Node. The Home Agent failure and failover mechanisms
    are completely transparent to the Mobile Node which is required for minimal service
    interruption time. This protocol does not introduce any new Mobile IPv6 message
    over the air interface and thus helps reducing the overall overhead. Current specifications
    of Mobile IPv6 does not provide Home Agent Reliability in the home link. The aim
    of this draft is to introduce Virtual Home Agent Reliability Protocol as the solution.
