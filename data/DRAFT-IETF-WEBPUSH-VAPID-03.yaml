abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An application server can use the method described to voluntarily\n
    \  identify itself to a push service.  This identification information\n   can
    be used by the push service to attribute requests that are made\n   by the same
    application server to a single entity.  An application\n   server can include
    additional information that the operator of a push\n   service can use to contact
    the operator of the application server.\n   This identification information can
    be used to restrict the use of a\n   push subscription a single application server.\n\n\t
