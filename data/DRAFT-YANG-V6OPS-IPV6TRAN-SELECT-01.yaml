abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Nowadays, many IPv6 transition technologies has been proposed,
    such\n   as Dual-Stack, DS-Lite, 6rd and so on.  An CPE may support some of\n
    \  them instead of only one.  But ISPs usually deploy just an unique\n   transition
    technology in an area, for example, under a BRAS/SR or in\n   a MAN.  So they
    must control all the CPEs to ues the exact transition\n   tech through the CPEs'
    management system or configuring them before\n   issuing to the customers.  Another
    question is that if subscriber buy\n   a new CPE from supermarket to substitute
    the one received from the\n   ISP, he may not access internet because of the wrong
    configuration.\n\n   To solve these problems,this document defines a new DHCP/DHCPv6\n
    \  option named TRAN_TYPE which can control CPEs to select the\n   appropriate
    IPv6 transition technology which ISP deployed instend of\n   the CPEs' default
    configration.  This method can also solve the\n   configurating problem when various
    CPEs work together without a\n   uniform configuration in advance.\n\n\t </p>\n
