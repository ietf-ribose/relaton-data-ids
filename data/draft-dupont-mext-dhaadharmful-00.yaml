abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery (DHAAD) mechanism isdescribed
    in the Mobile IPv6 specification. This mechanism ismandatory in any compliant
    Mobile IPv6 implementation and so in anyMIPv6 based protocols too. On the other
    hand, DHAAD was the only onemechanism to discover a potential Home Agent for a
    Mobile Node in thepast. This is no longer the case today. This document analyzes
    thesecurity of the different existing home agent discovery mechanismsand promotes
    the remove of DHAAD from the future Mobile IPv6standard, in light of this security
    analysis.</p>"
