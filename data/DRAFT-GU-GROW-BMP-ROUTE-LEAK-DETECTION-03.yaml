abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   According to RFC7908 [RFC7908], Route leaks refer to case that
    the\n   delivery range of route advertisements is beyond the expected range.\n
    \  For many current security protection solutions, the ISPs (Internet\n   Service
    Providers) are focusing on finding ways to prevent the\n   happening of route
    leaks.  However, the real-time route leak\n   detection if any occurs is important
    as well, and serves as the basis\n   for leak mitigation.  This document extends
    the BGP Monitoring\n   Protocol (BMP) [RFC7854] to provide a routing security
    scheme\n   suitable for ISPs to detect BGP route leaks at the prefix level.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
