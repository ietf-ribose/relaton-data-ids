abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies one method for autoconfiguration for the\nOptimized
    Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for stand-alone ad hoc\nnetworks.  OLSR is
    a routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks,\ndesigned for use in multi-hop
    wireless ad hoc networks ; and as such\nit specifies how individual nodes can
    construct routes to each other.\nTo achieve this, it relies on preliminary assignment
    of unique IP\naddresses to OLSR interfaces ; hence the task of generating\naddresses,
    checking their uniqueness and assigning them to interfaces\nis defined externally.
    \ This document proposes a complementary\nmethod, called \"No Overhead Autoconfiguration
    for OLSR\" (NOA-OLSR),\nto perform this task of ensuring uniqueness of addresses
    which have\nbeen generated.  It also performs to ensure uniqueness of addresses\nwhich
    have been assigned and used when network merger occurs.  This\nmethod consists
    of modifications in the OLSR specification.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
