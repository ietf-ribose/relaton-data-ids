abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework, use cases, and requirements for
    security services based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) using a common interface
    to Network Security Functions (NSF). It specifies objectives and requirements
    in SDN-based security services using an interface to NSF (I2NSF). Also, it proposes
    two use cases, such as centralized firewall system and centralized DDoS-attack
    mitigation system.</p>"
