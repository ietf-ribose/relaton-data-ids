abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>DNA solution consists of 1)link identity detection with a single
    RA\n   and 2)quick RA acquisition.  This draft presents the first component\n
    \  based on Link Identifier.  It describes a way for link identity\n   detection
    with prefix based Link Identifier, 'linkid prefix'.  While\n   this document doesn't
    include the second component, any quick RA\n   acquisition scheme will work with
    the proposal.  The draft is the\n   result of DNA DT discussion.\n\t </p>\n      "
