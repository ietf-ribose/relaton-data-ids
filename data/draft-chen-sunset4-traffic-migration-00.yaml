abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to make a graceful IPv4 sunset, this memo described a method
    helping traffic migration to IPv6. With the growth of IPv6 traffic, operators
    could safely turn off IPv4 and evolve to IPv6-only network. In order to achieve
    the goal, new traffic-migration options have been proposed in DHCPv6 and PCP.
    IPv6 traffic steering could be performed using those configurations.</p>"
