abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this document we provide methods to discover and connect native\nIPV6
    clouds that are separated by IPV4 Internet. BGP-MP [2] is used\nas protocol to
    discover IPV6 relay routers. BGP-MP(BGP4+) [3] is\nused to distribute IPV6 routes.
    Encapsulation of IPV6 presented in\n[4] is used to tunnel IPv6 traffic across
    IPV4 Internet. The method\npresented here is known as 6in4 as opposed to 6to4
    [4] or 6over4[5].\n\t </p>\n      "
