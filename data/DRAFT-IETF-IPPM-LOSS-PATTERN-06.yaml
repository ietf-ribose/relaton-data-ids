abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Internet exhibits certain specific types of behavior (e.g.,\nbursty
    packet loss) that can affect the performance seen by the users\nas well as the
    operators.  The loss pattern or loss distribution is a\nkey parameter that determines
    the performance observed by the users\nfor certain real-time applications such
    as packet voice and video.\nFor the same loss rate, two different loss distributions
    could\npotentially produce widely different perceptions of performance.\nUsing
    the base loss metric defined in RFC 2680, this document defines \ntwo derived
    metrics 'loss distance' and 'loss period', and the \nassociated statistics that
    together capture loss patterns experienced\nby packet streams on the Internet.\n\t
