abstract:
  content: "<p>As the DNS Security (DNSSEC) specifications have evolved, thesyntax
    and semantics of the DNSSEC resource records (RRs) havechanged. Many deployed
    nameservers understand variants of thesesemantics. Dangerous interactions can
    occur when a resolver thatunderstands an earlier version of these semantics queries
    anauthoritative server that understands the new delegation signersemantics, including
    at least one failure scenario that will causean unsecured zone to be unresolvable.
    This document proposes thatthese interactions be avoided by changing the type
    codes andmnemonics of the DNSSEC RRs (SIG, KEY, and NXT).</p>"
