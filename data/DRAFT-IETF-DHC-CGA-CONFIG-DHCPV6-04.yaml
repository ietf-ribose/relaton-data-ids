abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Cryptographically Generated Address is an IPv6 addresses
    binding\n   with a public/private key pair. However, the current CGA\n   specifications
    are lack of procedures to enable proper management of\n   the usage of CGAs. This
    document analyzes the parameters required for\n   the generation of CGA from network
    configuration and management\n   perspective. The configuration procedures of
    many CGA-relevant\n   parameters with existing mechanisms are described in the
    document.\n   Only Sec value has no suitable mechanism to be configured by network\n
    \  admin. A new DHCPv6 option is defined accordingly. This document also\n   analyses
    the configuration of the parameters, which are used to\n   generate CGAs, using
    DHCPv6. Although the document does not define\n   new DHCPv6 option to carry these
    parameters for various reasons, the\n   configuration procedure is described.\n\n\t
