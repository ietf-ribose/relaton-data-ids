abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB)\nfor use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.\nIn
    particular it defines objects for managing MAC bridges based on\nthe IEEE 802.1D-1990
    standard between Local Area Network (LAN)\nsegments.  Provisions are made for
    support of transparent bridging.\nProvisions are also made so that these objects
    apply to bridges\nconnected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.\n\n\t </p>\n
