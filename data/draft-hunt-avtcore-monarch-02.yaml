abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTCP with a new
    RTCPXR (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding mediatransmission
    or reception quality, as proposed in RFC5968. This memosuggests that a new block
    should contain a single metric or a smallnumber of metrics relevant to a single
    parameter of interest orconcern, rather than containing a number of metrics which
    attempt toprovide full coverage of all those parameters of concern to aspecific
    application. Applications may then \"mix and match\" tocreate a set of blocks
    which covers their set of concerns. Wherepossible, a specific block should be
    designed to be re-usable acrossmore than one application, for example, for all
    of voice, streamingaudio and video.</p>"
