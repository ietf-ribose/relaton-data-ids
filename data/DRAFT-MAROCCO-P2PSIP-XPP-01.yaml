abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines the Extensible Peer Protocol (XPP), a\nlightweight
    binary protocol for end-to-end sessions between peers in\ndistributed overlay
    networks.  One of the main goals while creating\nthis protocol was support for
    nodes located behind firewalls and\nNATs.  XPP therefore uses UDP and allows endpoints
    to simultaneously\ninitiate sessions.  Given the choice of the underlying protocol\n(UDP),
    XPP also defines mechanisms for message fragmentation and\nreliability.\n\t </p>\n
