abstract:
- content: "<p>End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is an application of cryptography in communications
    systems between endpoints. E2EE systems are unique in providing features of confidentiality,
    integrity and authenticity for users. Improvements to E2EE strive to maximise
    the system's security while balancing usability and availability. Users of E2EE
    communications expect trustworthy providers of secure implementations to respect
    and protect their right to whisper.</p>"
