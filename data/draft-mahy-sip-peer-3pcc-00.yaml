abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The 3rd party call control draft [2] demonstrates a usage of SIP
    [3]with some of the enhancements of RFC2543bis [4]. This usagerequires that a
    3pcc controller remain in the signaling path andmaintain state for the duration
    of the call. While this isnecessary in certain situations (ex: protocol translation:
    H.323 [5]to SIP, SIP to RTSP [6], HTTP [7] to SIP), it is sub-optimal in pureSIP
    environments. This draft demonstrates a usage of the REFERmethod [8] and SIP for
    presence [9] to allow authorized peers toparticipate in call control.</p>"
