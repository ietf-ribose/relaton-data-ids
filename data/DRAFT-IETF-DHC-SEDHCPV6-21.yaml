abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DHCPv6 includes no deployable security mechanism that can protect\n
    \  end-to-end communication between DHCP clients and servers.  This\n   document
    describes a mechanism for using public key cryptography to\n   provide such security.
    \ The mechanism provides encryption in all\n   cases, and can be used for authentication
    based on pre-sharing of\n   authorized certificates.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
