abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet
    access\n   (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a\n
    \  captive portal mode.  This highly restricts what the customer can do\n   until
    the customer has authenticated.\n\n   This document describes a DHCP option (and
    a Router Advertisement\n   (RA) extension) to inform clients that they are behind
    some sort of\n   captive-portal device, and that they will need to authenticate
    to get\n   Internet access.  It is not a full solution to address all of the\n
    \  issues that clients may have with captive portals; it is designed to\n   be
    used in larger solutions.  The method of authenticating to, and\n   interacting
    with the captive portal is out of scope of this document.\n\n   RFC7710 used DHCP
    code point 160.  Due to a conflict, this document\n   specifies TBD.\n\n   [ This
    document is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/capport-wg/7710bis.
    \ The most recent version of\n   the document, open issues, etc should all be
    available here.  The\n   authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.  Text in square
    brackets\n   will be removed before publication. ]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
