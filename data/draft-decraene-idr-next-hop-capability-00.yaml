abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5492 defines capabilities advertisement for the BGP peer. In addition,
    it's useful to know the capabilities of the BGP Next-Hop, in particular for forwarding
    plane features. RFC 5492 is not applicable because the BGP peer may be different
    from the BGP Next- Hop, in particular when BGP Route Reflection is used. This
    document defines a mechanism to advertise such BGP Next Hop Capabilities. This
    document defines a new BGP non-transitive attribute to carry Next-Hop Capabilities.
    This attribute is deleted when the BGP Next Hop is changed. This document also
    defines a Next-Hop capability to advertise the ability to handle the Entropy Label
    defined in RFC 6790.</p>"
