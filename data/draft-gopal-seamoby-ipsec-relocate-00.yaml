abstract:
  content: "<p>Seamless offering of security to a Mobile Node (MN) during handovers
    iscrucial for enabling a variety of application services in the MobileInternet.
    Handovers also imply that a terminal such as a MN may performnetwork access authentication
    in order to obtain connectivity and accessto network features such as QoS, header
    compression etc. Securitycontext associated with several Security Associations
    (SA) may need tobe transferred in order to achieve this. This enables the MN to
    regainauthenticated connectivity and establish new SAs without having toreinitiate
    time-consuming operations.</p>"
