abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work
    through\n   a consensus process, taking into account the different views among\n
    \  IETF participants and coming to (at least rough) consensus on\n   technical
    matters.  In particular, the IETF is supposed not to be run\n   by a \"majority
    rule\" philosophy.  This is why we engage in rituals\n   like \"humming\" instead
    of voting.  However, more and more of our\n   actions are now indistinguishable
    from voting, and quite often we are\n   letting the majority win the day, without
    consideration of minority\n   concerns.  This document is a collection of thoughts
    on what rough\n   consensus is, how we have gotten away from it, and the things
    we can\n   do in order to really achieve rough consensus.\n\n      Note (to be
    removed before publication): This document is quite\n      consciously being put
    forward as Informational.  It does not\n      propose to change any IETF processes
    and is therefore not a BCP.\n      It is simply a collection of principles, hopefully
    around which\n      the IETF can come to (at least rough) consensus.\n\n\t </p>\n
