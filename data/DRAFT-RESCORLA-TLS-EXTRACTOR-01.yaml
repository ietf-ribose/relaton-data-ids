abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A number of protocols wish to leverage Transport Layer Security
    (TLS)\n   to perform key establishment but then use some of the keying material\n
    \  for their own purposes.  This document describes a general mechanism\n   for
    allowing that.\n\t </p>\n      "
