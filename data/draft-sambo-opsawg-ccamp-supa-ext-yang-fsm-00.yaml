abstract:
- content: "<p>Network operators and service providers are facing the challenge of
    deployment of systems from different vendors while looking for a trade-off among
    transmission performance, network device reuse, and capital expenditure without
    the need of being tied to single vendor equipment. The deployment and operation
    of more dynamic and programmable transport optical network infrastructures can
    be driven by adopting model-driven and software-defined control and management
    paradigms. In this context, YANG enables to compile a set of consistent vendor-neutral
    data models for optical networks and components based on actual operational needs
    emerging from heterogeneous use cases. This document extends YANG from data to
    functional modeling in order to describe events, operations, and finite state
    machine of YANG-defined network elements. The proposed models can be applied in
    the context of optical networks to pre- instruct data plane devices (e.g., an
    optical transponder) on the actions to be performed (e.g., code adaptation) in
    case some events, such as physical layer degradations, occur.</p>"
