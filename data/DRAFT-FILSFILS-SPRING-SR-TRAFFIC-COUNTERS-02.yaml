abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) allows a headend node to steer a packet
    flow\n   along any path.  Intermediate per-flow states are eliminated thanks\n
    \  to source routing.  Traffic accounting plays a critical role in\n   network
    operation.  A traffic account solution is required for SR\n   networks that provides
    the necessary functionality without creating\n   any additional per SR path states
    in the fabric.\n\n   This document describes counters for traffic accounting in
    SR\n   networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
