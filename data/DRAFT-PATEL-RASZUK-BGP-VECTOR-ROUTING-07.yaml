abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network architectures have begun to shift from pure destination
    based\n   routing to service aware routing.  Operator requirements in this\n   space
    include forcing traffic through particular service nodes (e.g.\n   firewall, NAT)
    or transit nodes (e.g. segments).  This document\n   proposes an enhancement to
    BGP to accommodate these new requirements.\n\n   This document proposes a pure
    control plane solution which allows\n   traffic to be routed via an ordered set
    of transit points (links,\n   nodes or services) on the way to traffic's destination,
    with no\n   change in the forwarding plane.  This approach is in contrast to\n
    \  other proposal in this space which provide similar capabilities via\n   modifications
    to the forwarding plane.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
