abstract:
  content: "<p>While IP was designed around the notion that the network would beinvisible
    to the applications that run on them, an increasinglycomplex service environment
    along with the compartmentalization of'policy' into administrative domains has
    led to a proliferation oftypes of middleboxes for policy enforcement, and those
    middleboxesare interfering with applications. Applications now need to influ-ence
    the behavior of middleboxes, but violating network layeringprinciples by establishing
    explicit communication channels fromapplications to network-layer middleboxes
    introduces a new set ofproblems related to topology and discovery as well as consequentproblems
    that ripple out from those. This paper is an introductoryexamination of whether
    or not there is a better way.</p>"
