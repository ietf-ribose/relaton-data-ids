abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Function Virtualization (NFV) system designers and
    operators\n   continuously grapple with the problem of qualifying performance
    of\n   network services realised with software Network Functions (NF)\n   running
    on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) servers.  One of the main\n   challenges is
    getting repeatable and portable benchmarking results\n   and using them to derive
    deterministic operating range that is\n   production deployment worthy.\n\n   This
    document specifies benchmarking methodology for NFV services\n   that aims to
    address this problem space.  It defines a way for\n   measuring performance of
    multiple NFV service instances, each\n   composed of multiple software NFs, and
    running them at a varied\n   service \"packing\" density on a single server.\n\n
    \  The aim is to discover deterministic usage range of NFV system.  In\n   addition
    specified methodology can be used to compare and contrast\n   different NFV virtualization
    technologies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
