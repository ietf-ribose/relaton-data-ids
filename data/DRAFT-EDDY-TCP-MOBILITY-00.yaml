abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Once a TCP connection is established, there are no mechanisms
    for\n   dynamically rebinding the connection to new IP addresses or port\n   numbers.
    \ During the lifetime of a TCP connection, a mobile host's\n   transition between
    networks (and the corresponding change in its IP\n   address) will break any established
    TCP connections.  As a remedy,\n   this document presents an extension of TCP
    with support for dynamic\n   bindings of IP addresses and port numbers.  Compatibility
    with\n   existing TCP implementations is maintained, and reasonable steps are\n
    \  taken to prevent remote-redirction attacks.\n\t </p>\n      "
