abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the framework for guiding the functionality\n
    \  provided by I2NSF. Network security functions (NSFs) are packet-\n   processing
    engines that inspect and optionally modify packets\n   traversing networks, either
    directly or in the context of sessions\n   in which the packet is associated.
    This document provides an\n   overview of how NSFs are used, and describes how
    NSF software\n   interfaces are controlled and monitored using rulesets. The design\n
    \  of these software interfaces must prevent the creation of implied\n   constraints
    on NSF capability and functionality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
