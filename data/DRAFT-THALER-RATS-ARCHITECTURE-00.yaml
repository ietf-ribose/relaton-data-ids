abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In network protocol exchanges, it is often the case that one
    entity\n   (a relying party) requires evidence about the remote peer (and system\n
    \  components [RFC4949] thereof), in order to assess the trustworthiness\n   of
    the peer.  This document describes an architecture for such remote\n   attestation
    procedures (RATS), which enable relying parties to decide\n   whether to consider
    a remote system component trustworthy or not.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
