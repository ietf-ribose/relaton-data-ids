abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv4 fragmentation is not sufficiently robust for general use
    in\n   today's Internet. The 16-bit IP identification field is not large\n   enough
    to prevent frequent missassociated IP fragments and the TCP\n   and UDP checksums
    are insufficient to prevent the resulting corrupted\n   data from being delivered
    to higher protocol layers.  In this note we\n   describe some easily reproduced
    experiments demonstrating the problem\n   and estimate the scale the data corruption
    in the presence of ever\n   growing data rates.\n\t </p>\n      "
