abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-\n
    \  Defined Networking (SDN) systems.\n\n   A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC)
    can simplify the processing of\n   a distributed control plane by blending it
    with elements of SDN and\n   without necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus,
    the LSP can be\n   calculated/set up/initiated and the label forwarding entries
    can also\n   be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network device\n
    \  along the path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much\n   as
    possible.\n\n   This document specifies the procedures and PCEP extensions when
    a\n   PCE-based controller is also responsible for configuring the\n   forwarding
    actions on the routers, in addition to computing the paths\n   for packet flows
    in a segment routing (SR) network and telling the\n   edge routers what instructions
    to attach to packets as they enter the\n   network.  PCECC is further enhanced
    for SR-MPLS SID (Segment\n   Identifier) allocation and distribution.\n\n\t </p>\n
