abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Core
    Optical\n   Networks (CORONET) program has laid out a vision for the next\n   evolution
    of IP and optical commercial and government networks, with\n   a focus on highly
    dynamic and resilient multi-terabit core networks.\n   It anticipates the need
    for rapid (sub-second) setup and SONET/SDH-\n   like restoration times for high-churn
    (up to tens of requests per\n   second network-wide and one second to one minute
    holding times) on-\n   demand wavelength, sub-wavelength and packet services for
    a variety\n   of applications (e.g., grid computing, cloud computing, data\n   visualization,
    fast data transfer, etc.).  This must be done while\n   meeting stringent call
    blocking requirements, and while minimizing\n   the use of resources such as time
    slots, switch ports, wavelength\n   conversion and wavelength-km.\n\n   This document
    discusses the requirements for extensions to\n   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
    Switching (GMPLS) signaling for\n   expediting the control of Label Switched Paths
    (LSPs), including sub-\n   wavelengths (e.g., OTN ODUs) and full wavelengths,
    in order to\n   satisfy application requirements laid out in this program.\n\n\t
