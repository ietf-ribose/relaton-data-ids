abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an identifier and challenge type required to
    enable the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) to issue certificates
    using a token for the challenge response. This token is issued by a administrative
    authority with whom the Certification Authority (CA) has a trust relationship.
    The entity requesting a certificate also has a relationship with the administrative
    authority, such that the administrative authority assigns a unique code to the
    entity. This entity code is included as part of the token that the administrative
    authority issues.</p>"
