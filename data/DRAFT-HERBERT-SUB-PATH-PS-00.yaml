abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents the problem statement and use cases
    for a sub-\n   path transport layer. A sub-path is a portion of a network path
    that\n   has localized characteristics that are of interest to an operator to\n
    \  manage. The  structure for managing a sub-path is the \"sub-path\n   transport
    layer\". A sub-path transport layer can provide transport\n   layer mechanisms,
    such as reliability and congestion control, over\n   the aggregate of packets
    traversing the sub-path. Additionally, a\n   sub-path transport layer can provide
    performance measurements of\n   traffic over a sub-path which in turn can be input
    to operations and\n   management. The sub-path transport layer implies the possibility
    that\n   traffic may be subject to two transport layer control loops, that of\n
    \  the sub-path and that of a higher layer transport protocol, any such\n   solution
    must consider the ramifications of that.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
