abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP Fast Open (TFO) allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK
    packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial connection handshake,
    thus saving up to one full round trip time (RTT) compared to the standard TCP,
    which requires a three-way handshake (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged.
    However TFO deviates from the standard TCP semantics in that the data in the SYN
    could be replayed to an application in some rare circumstances. Applications should
    not use TFO unless they can tolerate this issue, which is detailed in the Applicability
    section. Terminology</p>"
