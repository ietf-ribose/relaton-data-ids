abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to support applications that require a large number
    of\n   addresses or address space, a host may be assigned an aggregate IPv6\n
    \  prefix rather than one or more discrete IPv6 addresses.  This\n   document
    briefly describes cases where this may occur, and specifies\n   an extension to
    TCP Fast Open [RFC7413] to allow a client to use a\n   single TCP Fast Open cookie
    for an IPv6 prefix.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
