abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n
    \  (DMARC) permits a domain-controlling organization to express domain-\n   level
    policies and preferences for message validation, disposition,\n   and reporting,
    which a mail-receiving organization can use to improve\n   mail handling.\n\n
    \  DMARC distinguishes the portion of a name that is a Public Suffix\n   Domain
    (PSD), below which organizational domain names are created.\n   The basic DMARC
    capability allows organizational domains to specify\n   policies that apply to
    their subdomains, but it does not give that\n   capability to PSDs.  This document
    describes an extension to DMARC to\n   fully enable DMARC functionality for PSDs.\n\n
    \  Some implementations of DMARC consider a PSD to be ineligible for\n   DMARC
    enforcement.  This specification addresses that case.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
