abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport-layer\n
    \  protocol that provides upper layers with the ability to use non-\n   reliable
    congestion-controlled flows.  DCCP is not widely deployed in\n   the Internet,
    and the reason for that can be defined as a typical\n   example of a chicken-egg
    problem.  Even if an application developer\n   decided to use DCCP, the middle-boxes
    like firewalls and NATs would\n   prevent DCCP end-to-end since they lack support
    for DCCP.  Moreover,\n   as long as the protocol penetration of DCCP does not
    increase, the\n   middle-boxes will not handle DCCP properly.  To overcome this\n
    \  challenge, NAT/NATP traversal and UDP encapsulation for DCCP is\n   already
    defined.  However, the former requires special middle-box\n   support and the
    latter introduces overhead.  The recent proposal of a\n   multipath extension
    for DCCP further underlines the challenge of\n   efficient middle-box passing
    as its main goal is to be applied over\n   the Internet, traversing numerous uncontrolled
    middle-boxes.  This\n   document introduces a new solution which disguises DCCP
    during\n   transmission as UDP without requiring middle-box modification or\n
    \  introducing any overhead.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
