abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A common argument against the use of TLS is that it adds overhead.\n
    \  In this document we illustrate in detail how much (or little)\n   processing,
    latency, and traffic overhead TLS adds.  Transition to\n   more secure cipher
    suites (TLS 1.2 with AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305)\n   actually reduces both traffic
    and processing overhead.  AES-GCM\n   combines security, low traffic overhead,
    and great performance on\n   modern hardware.  On platforms without hardware support
    for AES-GCM,\n   ChaCha20-Poly1305 gives the same benefits.  For everything but
    very\n   short connections, TLS is not inducing any major traffic overhead\n   (nor
    CPU or memory overhead).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
