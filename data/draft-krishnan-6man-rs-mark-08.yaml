abstract:
  content: "<p>In Ethernet based aggregation networks, several subscriber premises
    may be logically connected to the same interface of an edge router. This document
    proposes a method for the edge router to identify the subscriber premises using
    the contents of the received Router Solicitation messages. The applicability is
    limited to the N:1 VLAN allocation model.</p>"
