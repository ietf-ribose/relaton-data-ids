abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are a number of situations in the Internet where it would
    be\nuseful to be able to have an application be able to send traffic to a\ndestination
    without revealing the IP address of the destination to\nthe source, or the IP
    address of the source to the destination, or\nboth.  One way to do this is to
    have a network resident set of\nservers which can forward packets, with encryption
    and decryption\napplied to their source and destination addresses when appropriate.\nWe
    will call this server an anonymizing forwarder.  The anonymizing\nforwarding server
    intends to contribute to the goal of supporting\nanonymity at the IP layer [NymIP].\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
