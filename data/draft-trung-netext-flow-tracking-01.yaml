abstract:
  content: "<p>A mobile node (MN) can connect to the network by using multipleinterfaces
    simultaneously or sequentially. The quality of eachconnection can be changed due
    to many reasons such as the movement ofthe MN and the interference from the network.
    To guarantee thequality of service, some flows can be moved from a bad connection
    toanother better one. In this draft we discuss about how to extend theProxy Mobile
    IPv6 (PMIPv6) to support such kind of flow mobility.</p>"
