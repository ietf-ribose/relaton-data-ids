abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in theestablishment
    of sessions in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).In that role, they define
    and impact policies on call routing,rendezvous, and other call features. However,
    there is no standardmeans by which network elements can have any influence on
    sessionpolicies, such as the codecs that are to be used. As such, ad-hoc andnon-conformant
    techniques have been deployed to allow for suchsession policy mechanisms. In this
    document, we discuss a completeand standards-based mechanism for session policies.</p>"
