abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document gives general rules for how to pronounce Mandarin\n
    \  Chinese names in conversation, and how to determine which name is\n   someone's
    surname.  It also covers some other related topics about\n   Chinese names.  The
    intent is to allow IETF participants who are not\n   familiar with Chinese to
    communicate better with Chinese\n   participants.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
