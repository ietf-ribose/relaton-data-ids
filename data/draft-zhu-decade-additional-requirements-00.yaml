abstract:
- content: "<p>The DECoupled Application Data Enroute(DECADE)working group is specifying
    standardized interfaces for accessing in-network storage from applications to
    store, retrieve and manage data. The main object is to provide a framework that
    is useful to the applications, including P2P applications and other data-oriented
    applications, possibly related applications that can benefit from accessing in-
    network storage. This memo focuses on some requirements such as request redirecting
    and so on which are on the central of mobility, wireless network environment and
    CDN application. We present these in this memo as additional requirements that
    should be considered for the DECADE architecture and protocol specifications.</p>"
