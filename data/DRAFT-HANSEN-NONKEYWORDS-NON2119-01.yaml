abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Specifications can contain normative keywords, as defined in
    RFC\n   2119, to signify requirements, permission or prohibitions.  They\n   include
    MUST, SHOULD and MAY, which are commonly spelled in all\n   CAPITALS (but need
    not be).  These words can also be used for non-\n   normative purposes.  However
    when used within an RFC this is\n   confusing, given their typical use as normative
    vocabulary, even when\n   they do not formally have normative import.\n\n   Several
    words and phrases are specified in this document for non-\n   normative purposes
    as alternatives to the normative vocabulary of RFC\n   2119.  Authors who follow
    these guidelines do NOT need to incorporate\n   any declaration at the beginning
    of their document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
