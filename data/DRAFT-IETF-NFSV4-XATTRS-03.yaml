abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an OPTIONAL feature extending the NFSv4\n
    \  protocol which allows extended attributes (hereinafter also referred\n   to
    as xattrs) to be interrogated and manipulated using NFSv4.  An\n   xattr is a
    file system feature that allows opaque metadata, not\n   interpreted by the file
    system, to be associated with files and\n   directories.  Such support is present
    in many modern local file\n   systems.  New file attributes are proposed to allow
    clients to query\n   the server for xattr support, and new operations to get and
    set\n   xattrs on file system objects are provided.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
