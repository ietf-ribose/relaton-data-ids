abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Packet Filter Configuration Protocol (PFCP) is a client-server\n
    \  protocol which provides a mechanism for trusted clients to\n   dynamically
    request updates to a packet filtering policy managed by a\n   server.  Typically,
    a server is either a packet filter or an entity\n   which controls one or more
    packet filters.  Since clients may specify\n   permitted flows as and when they
    are required, packet filters\n   configured via PFCP may operate an extremely
    restrictive default\n   policy.\n\t </p>\n      "
