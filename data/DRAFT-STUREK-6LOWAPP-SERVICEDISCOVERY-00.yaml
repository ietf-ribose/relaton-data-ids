  content: "\n\t <p>IEEE 802.15.4 networked solutions employing [RFC4944] for \napplications
    like Smart Grid Home Area Networking require unattended \nservice discovery which
    can be supported with small, single packet \n(or few packet) exchanges.  At the
    same time, it is desirable to mix \nwired devices into the same network so interoperation
    of service \ndiscovery between devices with differing operational characteristics
    \nis desired.\n\t </p>\n      "
