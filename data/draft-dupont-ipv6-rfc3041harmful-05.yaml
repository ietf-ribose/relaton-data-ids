abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The purpose of the privacy extensions for stateless addressautoconfiguration
    [1] is to change the interface identifier (andthe global-scope addresses generated
    from it) over time in orderto make it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other
    informationcollectors to identify when different addresses used in differenttransactions
    actually correspond to the same node.Current Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
    [2] attacks employforged source addresses which can also be in the same prefixesthan
    the real addresses of the compromised nodes used for attacks.Indeed, network ingress
    filtering defeats DDoS using 'random'forged source addresses.</p>"
