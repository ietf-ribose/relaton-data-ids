abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Netext WG has been recently rechartered to determine what
    Proxy\nMobile IPv6 extensions are required for flow mobility support of a MN\nimplementing
    the single IP interface hiding mechanism.  This document\nbriefly introduces the
    single IP interface hiding mechanism and it\nderives the associated protocol operations
    to enable seamless flow\nmobility across multiple access networks.  These extensions
    are\nintended to allow such mobile nodes to send and receive IP packets on\nmultiple
    physical media in a simultaneous and possibly discriminated\nmanner when attached
    to a PMIPv6 domain.  A typical usage of these\nextensions is to perform downlink
    flow discrimination through\nmultiple interfaces based on filtering rules (i.e.
    dedicate one MN\nphysical media to VOIP traffic and another MN media to HTTP traffic).\n\nThe
    proposed extensions to PMIPv6 attempt to increment in a backward\ncompatible manner
    the current PMIPv6 specification.  In addition\nthese extensions use, when possible,
    existing specifications related\nto multihoming support at IETF and conform to
    the problem statement\nof Netext Working Group.\n\t </p>\n      "
