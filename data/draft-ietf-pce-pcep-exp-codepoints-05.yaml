abstract:
- content: "<p>IANA assigns values to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) parameters (messages, objects, TLVs). IANA established a top-level registry
    to contain all PCEP codepoints and sub-registries. This top-level registry contains
    sub-registries for PCEP message, object, and TLV types. The allocation policy
    for each of these sub-registries is IETF Review. This document updates RFC 5440
    by changing the allocation policies for these three registries to mark some of
    the codepoints as assigned for Experimental Use.</p>"
