abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines extensions to the SIP REFER method so
    that this\n   method can be used to refer to multiple resources. These extensions\n
    \  include the use of pointers to URI-lists in the Refer-To header\n   field,
    the use of bodies to describe the requests to be sent by the\n   server, and the
    use of a new event package to report the state of\n   several transactions.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
