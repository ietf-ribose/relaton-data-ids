abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a scheme of 'Domain Name Auto-Registration\nfor
    Plugged-in IPv6 Nodes' mechanism that makes it possible to\nregister both regular
    and inverse domain name information of plugged-\nin IPv6 nodes to DNS servers
    automatically.\nSince IPv6 addresses are too long to remember and EUI64-based\naddresses
    are too complicated to remember, there are strong\nrequirements to use logical
    names that are easy to remember instead\nof IPv6 addresses to specify IPv6 nodes
    and to register domain name\ninformation of plugged-in IPv6 nodes automatically.\nIn
    order to meet the requirements, a mechanism is proposed as one of\nthe IPv6 auto-configuration
    (plug and play) functions. After the\nAddress Autoconfiguration [ADDR-AUTO] has
    been executed, it works as\na succeeding plug and play mechanism.\nThis document
    clarifies problems that we meet when we apply the\nDynamic Updates in the DNS
    [DYN-DNS] to automatic domain name\ninformation registration mechanisms. This
    document proposes the\nDomain Name Auto-Registration mechanism as a solution to
    these\nproblems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
