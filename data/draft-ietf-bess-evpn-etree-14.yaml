abstract:
- content: <p>The MEF Forum (MEF) has defined a rooted-multipoint Ethernet service
    known as Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree). A solution framework for supporting this service
    in MPLS networks is described in RFC 7387, "A Framework for Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree)
    Service over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Network". This document discusses
    how those functional requirements can be met with a solution based on RFC 7432,
    "BGP MPLS Based Ethernet VPN (EVPN)", with some extensions and a description of
    how such a solution can offer a more efficient implementation of these functions
    than that of RFC 7796, "Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) Support in Virtual Private LAN
    Service (VPLS)". This document makes use of the most significant bit of the Tunnel
    Type field (in the P-Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel attribute) governed
    by the IANA registry created by RFC 7385; hence, it updates RFC 7385 accordingly.</p>
