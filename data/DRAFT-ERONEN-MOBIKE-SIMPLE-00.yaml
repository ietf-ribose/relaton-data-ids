abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes how existing NAT Traversal functionality\n
    \  could be leveraged to better support mobility and multihoming for\n   IKEv2.
    The purpose is not to specify a finished solution, but rather\n   to provide input
    for discussions in the MOBIKE WG.  In particular,\n   this draft raises questions
    to what extent the complexity present in\n   the two other MOBIKE protocol proposals
    is actually necessary. These\n   questions are not answered in this document,
    but are to be discussed\n   in the MOBIKE WG.\n\t </p>\n      "
