abstract:
- content: "<p>Various applications need to exchange structured information, such
    as business-card contact information, bibliographic citations, and structured
    forms and replies. ASN.1 [ISO87] is a commonly accepted framework for producing
    binary encoding of information. However, Internet data exchanges often take place
    in a textual environment, such as electronic mail. In these cases, it would be
    helpful to have conventions for encoding structured information so that it is
    entirely legible as text, but sufficiently structured to allow machine processing.
    This document specifies Structured Text Interchange Format (STIF), a syntax for
    encoding attribute/value pairs. The pairs can be collected into multi-part sequences
    and nested sub-lists. The syntax provides for user-defined extensions and for
    references to data from within sequences and sub-lists. While STIF can be generally
    compared with ASN.1/BER, it attempts much simpler encoding. In particular, it
    is strictly text-based and it does not provide for specification of a value's
    data type.</p>"
