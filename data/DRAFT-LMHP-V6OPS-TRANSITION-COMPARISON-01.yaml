abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Several IPv6 transition technologies can be used to provide
    IPv4-as-\n   a-service (IPv4aaS) to the customers, while the ISPs have only IPv6\n
    \  in their access and or core network. All these technologies have\n   their
    advantages and disadvantages. Depending on several various\n   conditions and
    preferences, different technologies may prove to be\n   the most appropriate solution.
    This document examines the five most\n   prominent IPv4aaS technologies considering
    several different aspects\n   in order to provide network operators with an easy
    to use guideline\n   for selecting the technology that suit their needs the best.\n\n\t
