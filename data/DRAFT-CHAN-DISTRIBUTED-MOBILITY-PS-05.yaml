abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The traditional hierarchical structure of cellular networks
    has led\n   to deployment models which are heavily centralized.  Mobility\n   management
    with centralized mobility anchoring in existing\n   hierarchical mobile networks
    is quite prone to suboptimal routing and\n   issues related to scalability.  Centralized
    functions present a\n   single point of failure, and inevitably introduce longer
    delays and\n   higher signaling loads for network operations related to mobility\n
    \  management.  To make matters worse, there are numerous variants of\n   Mobile
    IP in addition to other protocols standardized outside the\n   IETF, making it
    much more difficult to create economical and\n   interoperable solutions.  In
    this document we examine the problems of\n   centralized mobility management and
    identify requirements for\n   distributed and dynamic mobility management.\n\n\t
