abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes protocol independent methods called Explicit
    Flow Measurement Techniques that employ few marking bits, inside the header of
    each packet, for loss and delay measurement. The endpoints, marking the traffic,
    signal these metrics to intermediate observers allowing them to measure connection
    performance, and to locate the network segment where impairments happen. Different
    alternatives are considered within this document. These signaling methods apply
    to all protocols but they are especially valuable when applied to protocols that
    encrypt transport header and do not allow traditional methods for delay and loss
    detection.</p>"
