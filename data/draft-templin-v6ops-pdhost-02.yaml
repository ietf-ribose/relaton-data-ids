abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which then
    use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks. The requesting
    router then acts as a router between the downstream- attached hosts and the upstream
    provider network, and can also act as a host under the weak end system model.
    This document considers the case when the "requesting router" is actually a simple
    host, and receives a delegated prefix that it can use for multi-addressing purposes.
    The host does not connect any downstream-attached networks, and uses the prefix
    solely for its own multi-addressing purposes.</p>
