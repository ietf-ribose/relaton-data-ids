abstract:
  content: "<p>ROUTING ARCHITECT'S WARNING: flagrant IPv4 site multihoming practicescause
    a significant increase the routing table size, change rates andinstability, the
    tragedy of the commons by encouraging selfishrouting practices, the exhaustion
    of the 16-bit AS number space, andmay collapse the Internet interdomain routing
    architecture.As there has been a desire to avoid similar problems as seen withIPv4,
    the use of similar techniques to achieve site multihoming hasbeen prevented operationally
    in IPv6. However, the long effort toproceed with other IPv6 multihoming mechanisms
    has produced lots ofheat but little light. This memo tries to list available techniques,split
    the organizations to different types to separately examinetheir multihoming needs,
    to look at the immediate and short-termsolutions for these organization types,
    and to list a few immediateaction items on how to proceed with IPv6 site multihoming.</p>"
