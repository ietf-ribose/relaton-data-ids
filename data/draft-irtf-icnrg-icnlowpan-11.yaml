abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a convergence layer for Content-Centric Networking
    (CCNx) and Named Data Networking (NDN) over IEEE 802.15.4 Low-Power Wireless Personal
    Area Networks (LoWPANs). A new frame format is specified to adapt CCNx and NDN
    packets to the small MTU size of IEEE 802.15.4. For that, syntactic and semantic
    changes to the TLV-based header formats are described. To support compatibility
    with other LoWPAN technologies that may coexist on a wireless medium, the dispatching
    scheme provided by IPv6 over LoWPAN (6LoWPAN) is extended to include new dispatch
    types for CCNx and NDN. Additionally, the fragmentation component of the 6LoWPAN
    dispatching framework is applied to Information-Centric Network (ICN) chunks.
    In its second part, the document defines stateless and stateful compression schemes
    to improve efficiency on constrained links. Stateless compression reduces TLV
    expressions to static header fields for common use cases. Stateful compression
    schemes elide states local to the LoWPAN and replace names in Data packets by
    short local identifiers. This document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric
    Networking Research Group (ICNRG).</p>"
