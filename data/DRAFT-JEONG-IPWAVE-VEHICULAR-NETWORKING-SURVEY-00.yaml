abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document surveys the IP-based vehicular networks, which
    are\n   considered a key component of Intelligent Transportation Systems\n   (ITS).
    \ The main topics of vehicular networking are vehicle-to-\n   vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I), and infrastructure-\n   to-vehicle (I2V) networking.  This document deals
    with some critical\n   aspects in vehicular networking, such as IP address\n   autoconfiguration,
    vehicular network architecture, routing, mobility\n   management, and security.
    \ This document summarizes and analyzes the\n   previous research activities that
    use IPv4 or IPv6 for vehicular\n   networking.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
