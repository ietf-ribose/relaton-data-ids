abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes how to efficiently implement certain \nmechanisms
    of unidirectional operation in ROHC-TCP (robust header \ncompression scheme for
    TCP/IP), RFC XXX, which can significantly   \nimprove the compression efficiency
    compared to using simple control \nscheme.  \nAll the operational modes and state
    machines mentioned in this \ndocument are the same as the ones described in [ROHC-TCP].\n\t
