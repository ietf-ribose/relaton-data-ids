abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the conventions for using the Walnut
    Digital\n   Signature Algorithm (WalnutDSA) for digital signatures with the CBOR\n
    \  Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax.  WalnutDSA is a\n   lightweight,
    quantum-resistant signature scheme based on Group\n   Theoretic Cryptography (see
    [WALNUTDSA] and [WALNUTSPEC]) with\n   implementation and computational efficiency
    of signature verification\n   in constrained environments, even on 8- and 16-bit
    platforms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
