abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The set of DNS requests that an individual makes can provide
    a\n   monitor with a large amount of information about that individual.\n   DNS
    Private Exchange (DPRIVE) aims to deprive this actor of this\n   information.
    \ This document describes methods for measuring the\n   performance of DNS privacy
    mechanisms, particularly it provides\n   methods for measuring effectiveness in
    the face of pervasive\n   monitoring as defined in RFC7258.  The document includes
    example\n   evaluations for common use cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
