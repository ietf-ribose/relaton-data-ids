  content: "<p>This draft presents a policy-based DifferentiatedServices [DSARCH]
    architecture that has been realizedon the AIX operating system. We briefly motivate
    thebenefits of supporting DiffServ functions on servers usingpolicy-based networking,
    and outline the requirements forDiffServ-enabled servers. We then describe the
    policy-basedDiffServ infrastructure we have developed for AIX.Experimental results
    using Web server workloads demonstratethe efficacy of the DiffServ mechanisms
    provided. We alsooutline ongoing work in deploying diffserv-capable AIXservers
    on Internet2.</p>"
