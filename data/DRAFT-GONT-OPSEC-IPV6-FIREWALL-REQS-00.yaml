abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   While there are a large number of documents discussing IP and
    IPv6\n   packet filtering, requirements for IPv6 firewalls have never been\n   specified
    in the RFC series.  When it comes to IPv6, the more limited\n   experience with
    the protocols, and reduced variety of products has\n   made it rather difficult
    to specify what are reasonable features to\n   be expected from an IPv6 firewall.
    \ This has typically been a problem\n   for network operators, who typically have
    to produce a \"Request for\n   Proposal\" (from scratch) that describes such features.
    \ This document\n   specifies a set of requirements for IPv6 firewalls, marked
    as\n   \"mandatory\", \"recommended\", or \"optional\".\n\n\t </p>\n      "
