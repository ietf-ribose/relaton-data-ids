abstract:
- content: "<p>DMM is a mobility protocol which has mobility functions to solve the
    existing problems in the current centralized ones. However, when a mobile node
    moves to another anchor, the previous flow is forwarded by the previous router.
    For this reason, the routing optimization could be an issue. This draft proposes
    a routing optimization method in distributed anchor architecture. In this draft,
    we applied the SDN concept to DMM architecture for routing optimization.</p>"
