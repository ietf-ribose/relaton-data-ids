abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a header compression scheme and fragmentation\n
    \  functionality for IPv6/UDP protocols.  These techniques are\n   especially
    tailored for LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) networks\n   and could be extended
    to other protocol stacks.\n\n   The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) offers
    a great level of\n   flexibility when processing the header fields.  Static context
    means\n   that information stored in the context which, describes field values,\n
    \  does not change during the packet transmission, avoiding complex\n   resynchronization
    mechanisms, incompatible with LPWAN\n   characteristics.  In most of the cases,
    IPv6/UDP headers are reduced\n   to a small identifier.\n\n   This document describes
    the generic compression/decompression process\n   and applies it to IPv6/UDP headers.
    \ Similar mechanisms for other\n   protocols such as CoAP will be described in
    a separate document.\n   Moreover, this document specifies fragmentation and reassembly\n
    \  mechanims for SCHC compressed packets exceeding the L2 pdu size and\n   for
    the case where the SCHC compression is not possible then the\n   IPv6/UDP packet
    is sent.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
