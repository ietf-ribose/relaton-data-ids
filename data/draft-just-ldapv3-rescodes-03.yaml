abstract:
  content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to describe, in some detail, themeaning
    and use of the result codes used with the LDAPv3 protocol.Of particular importance
    are the error codes, which represent themajority of the result codes. This document
    provides definitions foreach result code, and outlines the expected behaviour
    of the variousoperations with respect to how result codes and in particular, errorconditions
    should be handled and which specific error code should bereturned.The LDAPv3 RFC
    [RFC2251] states that 'An LDAP server MUST act inaccordance with the X.500(1993)
    series of ITU recommendations whenproviding the service. However, it is not required
    that an LDAPserver make use of any X.500 protocols in providing this service,e.g.
    LDAP can be mapped onto any other directory system so long asthe X.500 data and
    service model as used in LDAP is not violated inthe LDAP interface.' The goal
    of this document is to transfer theapplicable information from X.511 to this document,
    and expand uponit for LDAP.</p>"
