abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With PIM-Bidir, the RPA does not have to be associated with
    a router.\n   Rather, it only needs to be a routable address on a RPL (typically
    a\n   multi-access network).  Such a scenario is commonly referred as\n   Phantom
    RPA.  This achieves RP resiliency to some extent, because the\n   \"RP\" will
    not fail.  However, if the RPL itself partitions, traffic\n   converged to one
    partition will not be able to reach other parts of\n   the network where joins
    converge to the other partitions of the RPL.\n\n   This document proposes simple
    procedures, which does not require\n   signaling extensions, to achieve RPL resiliency.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
