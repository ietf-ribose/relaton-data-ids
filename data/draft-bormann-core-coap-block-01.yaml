abstract:
  content: "<p>CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes andnetworks.
    CoAP is based on datagram transport, which limits themaximum size of resource
    representations that can be transferredwithout too much fragmentation. A previous
    version of this draftdefined the Block option. The Block option provides a minimal
    way totransfer larger representations in a block-wise fashion. It iscurrently
    documented in the WG draft draft-ietf-core-block-00.txtThis short I-D attempts
    to pick up some recent discussion on the CoREmailing list, and defines a more
    general, but also slightly morecomplex approach. It is intended as an example
    for a complete designbased on this discussion, to enable a rational assessment
    of therelative complexities.</p>"
