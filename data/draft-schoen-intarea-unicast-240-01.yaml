abstract:
- content: <p>This document redesignates 240/4, the region of the IPv4 address space
    historically known as "Experimental," "Future Use," or "Class E" address space,
    so that this space is no longer reserved. It asks implementers to make addresses
    in this range fully usable for unicast use on the Internet.</p>
