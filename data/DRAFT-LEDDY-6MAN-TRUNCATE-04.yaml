abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines IPv6 packet truncation procedures.  When
    an\n   IPv6 source node originates a packet, it can mark the packet as being\n
    \  eligible for truncation and forward it towards its destination.  If\n   an
    intermediate node cannot forward the packet because of an MTU\n   issue, it truncates
    the packet, marks it as being truncated, and,\n   again, forwards it towards its
    destination.  When the destination\n   node receives the packet, it detects that
    it has been truncated and\n   sends an ICMP message to the source node.  The ICMP
    message contains\n   MTU information that the source node uses to update its Path
    MTU\n   estimate.\n\n   The above-mentioned procedures enhance Path MTU Discovery
    (PMTUD) by\n   eliminating its reliance on the network's ability to deliver ICMP\n
    \  messages from an intermediate node to the source node.  However, the\n   above-mentioned
    procedures require the network to deliver ICMP\n   messages from the destination
    node to the source node.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
