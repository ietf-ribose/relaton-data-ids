abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We illustrate the architecture and mechanism of container resolution\n
    \  system, and to the protocol of resolving containers in ICN. The\n   fundamental
    characters are:1)Use Interest and Data packet as the\n   communication primitives,
    2)Every routing node has FIB, CS, PIT\n   tables to do packet routing and caching.
    Current NDN/CCN architecture\n   does not require a resolution system. The routing
    is totally based on\n   prefixes of content names, which causes scalability and
    mobility\n   issues described in [Cisco-Name]. This draft addresses the\n   aforementioned
    issues.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
