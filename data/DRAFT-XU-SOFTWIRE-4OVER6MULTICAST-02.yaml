abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The client networks could be of different address family with
    the\ncore network during IPv6 transition period.  The client networks may\nneed
    to run IP multicast applications across the transit core while\nit's not well
    supported currently.  This memo provides a AFBR-based\nsoftwire mesh multicast
    framework for IPv6 transition.\n\t </p>\n      "
