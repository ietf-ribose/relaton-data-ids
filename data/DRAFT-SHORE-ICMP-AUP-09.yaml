abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document we provide a basic description of ICMP's role
    in the\n   IP stack and some guidelines for future use.\n\n   This document is
    motivated by concerns about lack of clarity\n   concerning when to add new Internet
    Control Message Protocol (ICMP)\n   types and/or codes.  These concerns have highlighted
    a need to\n   describe policies for when adding new features to ICMP is desirable\n
    \  and when it is not.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
