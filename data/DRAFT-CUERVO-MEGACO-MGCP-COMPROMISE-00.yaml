abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The connection model in MGCP grew from a half-connection model,
    to, more\nrecently, a model that allows a second edgepoint to be specified [3].
    In\nthis document, we have taken the connection model a step further, making\nit
    symmetrical, identifying the difference between external connections\nand an MG-
    connection, allowing signalling related commands to be asso-\nciated with either
    edgepoint, or with both edgepoints in an MG. While\nthe half-connection model
    may work best for the simple case of MGs with\nan external IP connection on one
    side, the proposed more general connec-\ntion model adapts easily when the MG
    is for packet to packet connec-\ntions, when the MG is TDM on one side and IP
    on the other, as well as\nwhen the external connections are ATM on either side
    of an MG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
