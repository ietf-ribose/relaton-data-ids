abstract:
  content: <p>One of the potential problems with the "map-and-encapsulate"approaches
    to routing architecture is that there is a significantchance of packets being
    dropped while a mapping is being retrieved.Some approaches pre-load ingress tunnel
    routers with at least part ofthe mapping database. Some approaches try to solve
    this by providingintermediate "default" routers which have a great deal more knowledgethan
    a typical ingress tunnel router. This document proposes ascheme which does not
    drop packets yet does not require a great dealof knowledge in any router. However,
    there are still some issuesthat need to be worked out.</p>
