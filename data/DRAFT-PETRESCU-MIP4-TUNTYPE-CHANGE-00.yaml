abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The protocol Mobile IPv4 may use a number of encapsulation methods\nbetween
    an MN and its HA.  The UDP method is used to perform NAT\nTraversal (if a NAT
    sits between MN and HA) whereas IP-in-IP method\nmay be used if there is no NAT
    (CoA is a publicly routable address).\nAlthough these methods are individually
    specified, a mechanism for\nchanging between one to another is not, which may
    lead to incoherent\nimplementations.\n\nThis draft briefly presents the scenario
    of a MN performing a\nhandover between private space (NAT) and public space (non-NAT),
    the\nimplementation problem (type of tunnel can not be changed\ndynamically),
    and some potential solutions as textual modifications,\nbetter implementations,
    or protocol extensions.\n\t </p>\n      "
