abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The adoption of AI in network management solutions is becoming
    a\n   reality.  It is mainly supported by the need to resolve complex\n   problems
    arisen from the acceptance of SDN/NFV technologies as well\n   as network slicing.
    \ This allows current computer and network system\n   infrastructures to constantly
    grow in complexity, in parallel to the\n   demands of users.  However, exploiting
    the possibilities of AI is not\n   an easy task.  There has been a lot of effort
    to make Machine\n   Learning (ML) solutions reliable and acceptable but, at the
    same\n   time, other mechanisms have been forgotten.  It is the particular\n   case
    of reasoning.  Although it can provide enormous benefits to\n   management solutions
    by, for example, inferring new knowledge and\n   applying different kind of rules
    (e.g. logical) to choose from\n   several actions, it has received little attention.
    \ While ML\n   solutions work with data, so their only requirement from the network\n
    \  infrastructure is data retrieval, reasoning solutions work in\n   collaboration
    to the network they are managing.  This makes the\n   challenges arisen from intelligent
    reasoning to be a key for the\n   evolution of network management towards the
    full adoption of AI.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
