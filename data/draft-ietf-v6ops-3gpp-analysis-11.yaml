abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the transition to IPv6 in Third Generation Partnership
    Project (3GPP) packet networks. These networks are based on General Packet Radio
    Service (GPRS) technology, and the radio network architecture is based on Global
    System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or Universal Mobile Telecommunications
    System (UMTS)/Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technology. The focus
    is on analyzing different transition scenarios and applicable transition mechanisms
    and finding solutions for those transition scenarios. In these scenarios, the
    User Equipment (UE) connects to other nodes, e.g., in the Internet, and IPv6/IPv4
    transition mechanisms are needed. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
