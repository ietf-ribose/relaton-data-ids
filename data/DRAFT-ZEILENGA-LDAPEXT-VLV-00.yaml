abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access\nProtocol)
    Virtual List View (VLV) operation.  The operation allows the\nclient to obtain
    portion (the view) of an ordered set (the list) of\nentries visible through a
    virtual window.  The client can reissue the\noperation with different criteria
    to obtain a different view of the\nlist.  Clients may use this operation to page,
    scroll, or browse\ndirectory content.\nThe VLV operation is defined as a set of
    LDAP controls which extend\nthe Search operation.  The VLV controls may be used
    in conjunction\nwith a number of other search controls, such as the Server Side\nSorting
    of Search Results (RFC 2891) control.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
