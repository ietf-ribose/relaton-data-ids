abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of this Internet Draft is  to  start  discussion
    \ on  the\n   issues  involved  in  PSTN  Internet  Notification  (PIN), as part
    of\n   interconnecting IP and Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)  with\n
    \  the intent of converging existing and creating new hybrid PSTN and IP\n   services.
    \  PSTN  Events  Notification,  based  on  open well-defined\n   protocols, will
    promote interoperability of  both  the  networks  and\n   systems built by different
    vendors.  This Internet Draft is submitted\n   with the goal of becoming an informational
    RFC.\n \n   The rest of this document is as follows:\n \n   Section 2 briefly
    describes the PIN services.\n \n   Section  3 describes the scope of the proposed
    project by introducing\n   its  overall  architecture  and  identifying  the  interfaces
    \ to  be\n   standardized.\n \n   Sections  4,  5,  and 6 respectively address
    security considerations,\n   supply references, and provide the authors address,
    \ as  required  by\n   [1].\n \n   Section  7  acknowledges  individuals  providing
    \ assistance  in  the\n   creation of this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
