abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memorandum describes the Mobile Infrastructure Positioning\n
    \  Protocol, which specifies a protocol for distributing positioning\n   information
    from network elements which are in motion. The recipients\n   of positioning information
    as described herein are assumed to be\n   other nodes on the same vehicle and/or
    external recipients. The\n   emphasis is on an efficient and reliable way to provide
    a position\n   reference.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
