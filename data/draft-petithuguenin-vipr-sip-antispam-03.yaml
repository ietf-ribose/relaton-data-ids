abstract:
- content: "<p>Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a new technique
    for inter-domain federation of SIP calls. ViPR makes use of the PSTN as an introduction
    mechanism to verify the correctness of mappings from phone numbers to domains.
    The PSTN introduction mechanism can also be used as a technique for blocking spam
    - a SIP caller is only authorized when its calling domain has previously called
    that same number over the PSTN. This document describes an extension to SIP which
    enables authorization of SIP calls based on a prior PSTN introduction.</p>"
