abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes challenges associated with securing smart
    object\n   devices in constrained implementations and environments.  The memo\n
    \  describes a possible deployment model suitable for these\n   environments,
    discusses the availability of cryptographic libraries\n   for small devices, presents
    some preliminary experiences in\n   implementing small devices using those libraries,
    and discusses\n   trade-offs involving different types of approaches.\n\n\t </p>\n
