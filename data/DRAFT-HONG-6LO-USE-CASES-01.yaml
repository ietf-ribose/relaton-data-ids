abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the characteristics of link layer\n
    \  technologies that are used at constrained node networks and typical\n   use
    cases of IPv6 over networks of resource-constrained nodes.  In\n   addition to
    IEEE 802.15.4, various link layer technologies such as\n   BLE, ITU-T G.9959 (Z-Wave),
    DECT-ULE, MS/TP, NFC, and LTE MTC are\n   widely used at constrained node networks
    for typical services.  Based\n   on these link layer technologies, IPv6 over networks
    of resource-\n   constrained nodes has various and practical use cases.  To\n
    \  efficiently implement typical services, the applicability and\n   consideration
    of several design spaces are described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
