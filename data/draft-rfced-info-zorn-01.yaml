abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a set of vendor-specific RADIUS attributesdesigned
    to support the use of Microsoft's proprietary dialect of PPPCHAP (MS-CHAP) in
    dial-up networks. MS-CHAP is derived from and (wherepossible) consistent with
    PPP CHAP [1]; the differences between PPP CHAPand MS-CHAP are significant enough
    to warrant the definition of newRADIUS attributes, however.</p>"
