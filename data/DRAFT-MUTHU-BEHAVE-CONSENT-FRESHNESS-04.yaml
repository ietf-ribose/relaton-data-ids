abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Verification of peer consent before sending traffic is necessary
    in\n   WebRTC deployments to ensure that a malicious JavaScript cannot use\n   the
    browser as a platform for launching attacks.  A related problem\n   is session
    liveness.  WebRTC application may want to detect\n   connection failure and take
    appropriate action.\n\n   This document describes how a WebRTC browser can verify
    peer consent\n   to continue sending traffic and detect connection failure.\n\n\t
