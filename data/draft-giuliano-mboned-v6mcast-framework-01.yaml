abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes an architectural framework for deployinginterdomain
    multicast for IPv6 with simplicity, scalability,efficiency and security as the
    primary goals, applying the lessonslearned from deploying IPv4 multicast. In order
    to achieve thisobjective, the deprecation of network-based source discovery, andtherefore
    Any Source Multicast, is proposed. Source-SpecificMulticast is proposed as the
    service model supported for deployinginterdomain IPv6 multicast. The architectural
    components responsiblefor providing source discovery are also discussed.</p>"
