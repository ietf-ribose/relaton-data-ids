abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Eifel response algorithm uses the Eifel detection algorithm
    to\ndetect a posteriori whether the TCP sender has entered loss recovery\nunnecessarily.
    In response to a spurious timeout it avoids the\ngo-back-N retransmits that would
    otherwise be sent, and reinitializes\nthe RTT estimators to avoid further spurious
    timeouts. Likewise, it\nadapts the duplicate acknowledgement threshold in response
    to a\nspurious fast retransmit. In both cases, the Eifel response algorithm\nrestores
    the congestion control state in way that avoids packet\nbursts.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
