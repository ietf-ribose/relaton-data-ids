abstract:
- content: "<p>Nowadays, the underlying network infrastructure grows in scale and
    complexity, which make it challenging for network operators to manage and configure
    the network. Deploying policy or configuration based on an abstract view of the
    underlying network is much better than manipulating each individual network element,
    however, in this case, the policy and configuration cannot be recognized by the
    network devices. This document describes guidelines for mapping configuration
    and policy into device-level configuration. The SUPA framework overview and primary
    procedures of mapping are proposed. Moreover, an exemplary mapping scenario is
    provided to illustrate the mechanism involved.</p>"
