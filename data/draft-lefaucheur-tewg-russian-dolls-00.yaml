abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides input for the selection of a default Bandwidth
    Constraints Model for Diff-Serv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS- TE). It discusses
    a number of considerations on Bandwidth Constraints Models and how the Maximum
    Allocation Model and the Russian Dolls Model address these considerations. While
    this document may not exhaustively cover all possible considerations for selection
    of a Bandwidth Constraints model, we feel it covers the most important considerations
    for practical DS-TE deployment. We conclude that the Russian Dolls Bandwidth Constraint
    Model is a good default Bandwidth Constraint Model for DS-TE.</p>"
