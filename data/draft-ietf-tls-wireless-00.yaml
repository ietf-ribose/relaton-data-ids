abstract:
  content: "<p>This document suggests extensions to TLS designed to make TLS more
    amenable to use within wireless environments. The extensions may beused by TLS
    clients and servers. The extensions are backwardscompatible - communication is
    possible between TLS 1.0 clientsthat support the extensions and TLS 1.0 servers
    that do notsupport the extensions, and vice versa.</p>"
