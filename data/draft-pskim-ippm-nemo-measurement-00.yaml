abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, the new measurement scheme of IP performance metrics
    is proposed for the mobile network in heterogeneous wireless network environment.
    In the proposed scheme, all mobile nodes (MNs) inside the mobile network can get
    IP performance metrics irrespective of the presence or absence of measurement
    functionality. That is, the proposed scheme does not require the MN to be involved
    in measuring IP performance metrics. The multihomed mobile router (MR) with heterogeneous
    wireless interfaces measures IP performance metrics on behalf of the MNs inside
    the mobile network. Then, when MNs want to understand the condition of multiple
    communication paths, MNs can get measured IP performance metrics from the MR using
    L3 messages. The proposed scheme can reduce burden and power consumption of MNs
    with limited resource and battery power since MNs don't measure directly IP performance
    metrics. In addition, the proposed scheme can reduce considerably traffic overhead
    over wireless links on measurement paths since signaling messages and injected
    testing traffic are reduced.</p>"
