abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a standard way to store the configuration and
    the results of traceroute measurements. This document first describes the terminology
    used in this document and the traceroute tool itself; afterwards, the common information
    model is defined, dividing the information elements into two semantically separated
    groups (configuration elements and results elements). Moreover, an additional
    element is defined to relate configuration elements and results elements by means
    of a common unique identifier. On the basis of the information model, a data model
    based on XML is defined to store the results of traceroute measurements. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
