abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents detailed information with respect to the four
    sub-models of the Layer One Virtual Private Network (L1VPN) enhanced mode. Each
    sub-model is evaluated from different points of view, such as Topology Confidentiality,
    scalability, and reliability. The requirements on GMPLS to support each sub-model
    of the L1VPN enhanced mode are also discussed in this document.</p>"
