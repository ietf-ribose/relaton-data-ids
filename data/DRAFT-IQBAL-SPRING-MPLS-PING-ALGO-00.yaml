abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC8287 defines the extensions to MPLS LSP Ping and Traceroute
    for\n   Segment Routing IGP-Prefix and IGP-Adjacency Segment Identifier\n   (SIDs)
    with an MPLS data plane.  [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] proposes a\n   mechanism to
    allow IGPs to compute constraint based path over network\n   and use Segment Routing
    Prefix-SIDs to steer packets along the\n   constraint-based paths.  All Prefix-SIDs
    associated with the Flexible\n   Algorithm are assigned to the same IPv4/IPv6
    Prefix.  Any Segment\n   Routing network that uses Flexible Algorithm based path
    computation\n   needs additional details to be carried in the FEC Stack sub-TLV
    for\n   FEC validaiton.\n\n   This document updates [RFC8287] by modifying IPv4
    and IPv6 IGP-Prefix\n   Segment ID FEC sub-TLVs to also include algorithm identification.\n\n\t
