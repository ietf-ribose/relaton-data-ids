abstract:
  content: "<p>IPFIX Flow Aggregation describes a methodology for reducing theamount
    of measurement data exchanged between monitoring devices(IPFIX Exporters) and
    analyzers (IPFIX Collectors). Aggregationtechniques represent a necessary enhancement
    in order to cope withincreasing amounts of monitoring data that accrue with the
    ever-growing network capacities. Using Flow Selection Criteria andCompound Flow
    creation techniques, measurement information ofmultiple Flows that are sharing
    some common criteria is merged to beexported in one Compound Flow. Subsets of
    Flows eligible foraggregation, as well as the desired degree of similarity, can
    becustomized using a set of Aggregation Rules.</p>"
