abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6374 describes methods of making loss and delay measurements on
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) primarily as used in MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
    networks. This document describes a method of extending RFC 6374 performance measurements
    from flows carried over MPLS-TP to flows carried over generic MPLS LSPs. In particular,
    it extends the technique to allow loss and delay measurements to be made on multi-point
    to point LSPs and introduces some additional techniques to allow more sophisticated
    measurements to be made in both MPLS-TP and generic MPLS networks.</p>"
