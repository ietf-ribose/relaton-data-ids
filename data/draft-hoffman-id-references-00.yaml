abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 2026 places restrictions on how Internet-Drafts can be referred
    to in RFCs. Over time, the way that the IETF community uses sometimes make RFCs
    inaccurate (because many drafts that are referred to are not actually "works in
    progress", and also make references to Internet-Drafts nearly useless to RFC readers.
    This document updates the one part of RFC 2026, and the one part of RFC 7322,
    that covers referencing Internet-Drafts.</p>
