abstract:
  content: "<p>IKEv2 specifies that Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication
    must be used together with responder authentication based on public key signatures.
    This is necessary with old EAP methods that provide only unilateral authentication
    using, e.g., one- time passwords or token cards. This document specifies how EAP
    methods that provide mutual authentication and key agreement can be used to provide
    extensible responder authentication for IKEv2 based on methods other than public
    key signatures. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
