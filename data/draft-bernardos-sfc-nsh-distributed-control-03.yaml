abstract:
  content: <p>Service function chaining (SFC) allows the instantiation of an ordered
    set of service functions and subsequent "steering" of traffic through them. In
    order to set up and maintain SFC instances, a control plane is required, which
    typically is centralized. In certain environments, such as fog computing ones,
    such centralized control might not be feasible, calling for distributed SFC control
    solutions. This document specifies several NSH extensions to provide in-band SFC
    control signaling.</p>
