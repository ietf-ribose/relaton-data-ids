abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an extensible method to return additional\n
    \  information about the cause of DNS errors.  The primary use case is\n   to
    extend SERVFAIL to provide additional information about the cause\n   of DNS and
    DNSSEC failures.\n\n   [ Open question: The document currently defines a registry
    for\n   errors.  It has also been suggested that the option also carry human\n
    \  readable (text) messages, to allow the server admin to provide\n   additional
    debugging information (e.g: \"example.com pointed their NS\n   at us.  No idea
    why...\", \"We don't provide recursive DNS to\n   192.0.2.0.  Please stop asking...\",
    \"Have you tried Acme Anvil and\n   DNS?  We do DNS right...\" (!).  Please let
    us know if you think text\n   is needed, or if a 16bit FCFS registry is expressive
    enough. ]\n\n   [ Open question: This document discusses extended *errors*, but
    it\n   has been suggested that this could be used to also annotate *non-\n   error*
    messages.  The authors do not think that this is a good idea,\n   but could be
    persuaded otherwise. ]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
