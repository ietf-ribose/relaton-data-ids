abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In some IPv6 environments, the need has arisen for hosts to
    be able\n   to utilize a unique IPv6 prefix, even though the link or media may
    be\n   shared.  Typically hosts (subscribers) on a shared network, either\n   wired
    or wireless, such as Ethernet, WiFi, etc., will acquire unique\n   IPv6 addresses
    from a common IPv6 prefix that is allocated or\n   assigned for use on a specific
    link.\n\n   In most deployments today, IPv6 address assignment from a single IPv6\n
    \  prefix on a shared network is done by either using IPv6 stateless\n   address
    auto-configuration (SLAAC) and/or stateful DHCPv6.  While\n   this is still viable
    and operates as designed, there are some large\n   scale environments where this
    concept introduces significant\n   performance challenges and implications, specifically
    related to IPv6\n   router and neighbor discovery.\n\n   This document outlines
    an approach utilising existing IPv6 protocols\n   to allow hosts to be assigned
    a unique IPv6 prefix (instead of a\n   unique IPv6 address from a shared IPv6
    prefix).  Benefits of unique\n   IPv6 prefix over a unique IPv6 address from the
    service provider\n   include improved subscriber isolation and enhanced subscriber\n
    \  management.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
