abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Nowadays users consumption style for video and multimedia\n
    \  applications is strongly changing.  Users are heavily counting on\n   wireless
    and mobile devices for video streaming and interactive video\n   and multimedia
    applications.  This can be implemented for instance by\n   having more intelligence
    in the service and the network\n   infrastructure to better suit a differentiated
    users consumption\n   style.  This can be achieved through having: (i) a knowledge
    in the\n   network and service platform about the available device and network\n
    \  conditions for the end-user and (ii) a knowledge in the network about\n   the
    content requirements in terms of devices capabilities and network\n   resources
    for content stored either in the network or in the\n   application server.  To
    obtain such knowledge with no need for\n   changing the current infrastructure
    and in a generalized way to all\n   applications, feedback/notification mechanisms
    between the end-user\n   application, the network and the service platform is
    needed to\n   provide information helping the content delivery and adaptation\n
    \  decisions.  This document is investigating such application-agnostic\n   track.\n\n
    \  This document extends the Port Control Protocol (PCP) RFC 6887\n   [RFC6887]
    to allow: (i) the users application to notify the network\n   and application
    server about its available resources in terms of\n   devices capabilities and
    network conditions as well as information\n   about the user (e.g., location,
    mobility status) and (ii) the\n   application server to notify the network about
    the requirements of\n   the content it stores in terms of devices and network
    resources.  A\n   new PCP option, denoted the FEEDBACK, is specified to allow
    such\n   feedback notification signaling.  This option is used with both PEER\n
    \  and MAP Opcodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
