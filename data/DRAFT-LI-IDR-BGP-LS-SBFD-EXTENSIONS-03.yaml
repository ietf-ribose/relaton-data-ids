abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD) defines
    a\n   simplified mechanism to use Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)\n   with
    large portions of negotiation aspects eliminated, thus providing\n   benefits
    such as quick provisioning as well as improved control and\n   flexibility to
    network nodes initiating the path monitoring.  The\n   link-state routing protocols
    (IS-IS and OSPF) have been extended to\n   advertise the Seamless BFD (S-BFD)
    Discriminators.\n\n   This draft defines extensions to the BGP Link-state address-family
    to\n   carry the S-BFD Discriminators information via BGP.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
