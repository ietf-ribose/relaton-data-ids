abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a series of extensions for OSPF[1] and
    MOSPF[2]\nthat can be used to provide Quality of Service (QoS) routing in\nconjunction
    with a resource reservation protocol such as RSVP[4] or\nother mechanisms that
    can notify routing of the QoS needs of a data\nflow. Advertisements indicating
    the resources available and the\nresources used are advertised to the OSPF routing
    domain and paths are\ncomputed based on topology information, link resource information,
    and\nthe resource requirements of a particular data flow.\n\t </p>\n      "
