abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is concerned with the specification and properties
    of \nHash Functions for packet selection in PSAMP. Having a detailed and \nexhaustive
    description of the Hash Function, in terms of input \nparameters, output value,
    selection range and internal operations \nis fundamental for coherent configuration
    of the same hash based \nselection at different points in the network. This coherency
    is \nfundamental for all network measurement applications needing \nconsistent
    packet selection.\n\t </p>\n      "
