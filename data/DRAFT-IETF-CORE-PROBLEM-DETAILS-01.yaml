abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a \"problem detail\" as a way to carry
    machine-\n   readable details of errors in a CoAP response to avoid the need to\n
    \  define new error response formats for CoAP APIs.  The proposed format\n   is
    inspired by the Problem Details for HTTP APIs defined in RFC 7807.\n\nDiscussion
    Venues\n\n   This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Source
    for this draft and an issue tracker can be found at\n   https://github.com/core-wg/core-problem-details
    (https://github.com/\n   core-wg/core-problem-details).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
