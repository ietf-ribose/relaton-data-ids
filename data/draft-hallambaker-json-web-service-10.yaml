abstract:
- content: "<p>The JSON Web Binding (JWB) describes a standardized approach to implementing
    Web Services. Services are advertised using the DNS SRV and HTTP Well Known Service
    conventions. Messages may be authenticated or authenticated and encrypted at the
    message layer in addition to any transport and/or network layer security. Service
    messages are encoded in JSON using Internet time format for Date-Time fields and
    Base64urlencoding for binary objects. This document specifies Version 1.0 of JWB
    which uses HTTP/1.1 for transport. Use of the multiple stream capabilities of
    HTTP/2 or QUIC is outside the scope of this document. This document is also available
    online at http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-json-web-service.html
