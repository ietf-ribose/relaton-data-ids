abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This informational document discusses the use of manually configuredIPsec
    security associations to protect IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)messages. IPsec security
    associations are generally identified bythe triple (security parameters index,
    destination address,protocol). In the case of Neighbor Discovery, configuring
    theseassociations requires some effort, however. There are multiple knowndestination
    addresses plus a number of addresses that depend on thephysical link addresses.
    This document describes the securityimplications of protecting or not protecting
    the Neighbor Discoverymessages and lists the security associations that must be
    configuredmanually. The presented method is applicable only in small networks,but
    some approaches for reducing the configuration effort arediscussed.</p>"
