abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] has been proposed as an
    access\nvehicle for public ATM networks. Support for multicast in this\nenvironment
    via either RAS replication, or a adding MARS client side by\nside with PPP is
    problematic on several fronts.\n \nThis document describes how an ATM attached
    system can act as a MARS\nproxy on behalf of a PPP client. This solution circumvents
    many of the\nassociated problems with respect to VC frugality, scalability, and\nauthentication.\n\t
