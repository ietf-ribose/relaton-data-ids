abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a mutual authentication method for
    the Hyper-\n   text Transport Protocol (HTTP).  This method provides a true mutual\n
    \  authentication between an HTTP client and an HTTP server using\n   password-based
    authentication.  Unlike the Basic and Digest\n   authentication methods, the Mutual
    authentication method specified in\n   this document assures the user that the
    server truly knows the user's\n   encrypted password.  This prevents common phishing
    attacks: a\n   phishing attacker controlling a fake website cannot convince a
    user\n   that he authenticated to the genuine website.  Furthermore, even when\n
    \  a user authenticates to an illegitimate server, the server cannot\n   gain
    any information about the user's password.  The Mutual\n   authentication method
    is designed as an extension to the HTTP\n   protocol, and is intended to replace
    the existing authentication\n   methods used in HTTP (the Basic method, Digest
    method, and\n   authentication using HTML forms).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
