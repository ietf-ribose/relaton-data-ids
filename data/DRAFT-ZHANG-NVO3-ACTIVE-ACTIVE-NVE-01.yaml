abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multi-homing of NVEs is a desirable feature to NVO3 since it
    provides\n   Tenant Systems with reliable connection, load-balance, etc. The major\n
    \  issue of the multi-homing of NVEs is that it introduces one-to-many\n   mapping
    from Tenant System (inner) addresses to NVE (outer)\n   addresses.\n\n   This
    document identifies the requirements for multi-homing of NVEs\n   and specifies
    corresponding solutions to meet these requirements. The\n   key is to let remote
    NVEs be aware of the group of NVEs that are\n   offering multi-homing to Tenant
    Systems, therefore the remote NVE can\n   cope with the one-to-many mapping correctly.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
