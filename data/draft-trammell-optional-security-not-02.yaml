abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explores the common properties of optional security protocols
    and extensions, and notes that due to the base-rate fallacy and general issues
    with coordinated deployment of protocols under uncertain incentives, optional
    security protocols have proven difficult to deploy in practice. This document
    defines the problem, examines efforts to add optional security for routing, naming,
    and end-to-end transport, and extracts guidelines for future efforts to deploy
    optional security protocols based on successes and failures to date.</p>"
