abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The recently published [IEEE802154e] standard formalizes the
    concept\n   of link-layer resources in LLNs.  Nodes are synchronized and follow
    a\n   schedule.  A cell in that schedule corresponds to an atomic link-\n   layer
    resource, and can be allocated to any pair of neighbors in the\n   network.  This
    allows the schedule to be built to tightly match each\n   node's bandwidth, latency
    and energy constraints.  The [IEEE802154e]\n   standard does not, however, present
    a mechanism to do so, as building\n   and managing the schedule is out of scope
    of the standard.  This\n   document describes the 6TiSCH Operation Sublayer (6top)
    and the\n   commands it provides to upper network layers such as RPL or GMPLS.\n
    \  The set of functionalities includes feedback metrics from cell states\n   so
    network layers can take routing decisions, TSCH configuration and\n   control
    procedures, and the support for decentralized and centralized\n   scheduling.
    \ In addition, 6top can be configured to enable packet\n   switching at layer
    2.5, analogous to GMPLS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
