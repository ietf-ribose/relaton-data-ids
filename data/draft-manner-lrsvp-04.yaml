abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Guaranteed QoS for multimedia applications is based on reservedresources
    in each node on the end-to-end path. Even if thecorrespondent node does not support
    QoS, it would be useful to beable to reserve at least local resources at the access
    network,especially wireless link resources. Additionally, for mobile nodesthe
    continuity of QoS is disturbed due to end-to-end signalling orslow re-reservations
    of resources after each handover. This draftproposes a simple enhancement to RSVP,
    so that initial resourcereservations and re-reservations due to host mobility
    can be donelocally in an access network.</p>"
