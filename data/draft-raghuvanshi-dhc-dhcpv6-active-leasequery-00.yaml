abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) has been
    extended with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to request information
    about DHCPv6 bindings. That mechanism is limited to queries for DHCPv6 binding
    data updates until the time DHCPv6 server receive the Leasequery request. Continuous
    update of an external client with Leasequery data is sometimes desired. This document
    expands on the DHCPv6 Leasequery protocol, and allows for active transfer of real-time
    DHCPv6 binding information data via TCP. This document also extends DHCPv6 Bulk
    Leasequery by adding new options.</p>"
