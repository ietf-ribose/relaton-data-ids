abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A server that hosts applications that can be run with or without
    TLS\n   may want to communicate with clients whether the server is hosting an\n
    \  application only using TLS or also hosting the application without\n   TLS.
    \ Many clients have a policy to try to set up a TLS session but\n   fall back
    to insecure if the TLS session cannot be set up.  If the\n   server can securely
    communicate whether or not it can fall back to\n   insecure tells such a client
    whether or not they should even try to\n   set up an insecure session with the
    server.  This document describes\n   the use cases for this type of communication
    and a secure method for\n   communicating that information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
