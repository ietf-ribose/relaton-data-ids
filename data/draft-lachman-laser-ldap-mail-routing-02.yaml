abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an LDAP [1] object class called 'inetLocalMailRecipient'
    and associated attributes that provide a way to designate an LDAP entry as one
    that represents a local (intra- organizational) email recipient, to specify the
    recipient's email address(es), and to provide routing information pertinent to
    the recipient. This is intended to support SMTP [2] message transfer agents in
    routing RFC 822-based email [3] within a private enterprise only, and is not to
    be used in the process of routing email across the public Internet.</p>"
