abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a mechanism to
    load-balance traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL). An ingress Label Switching
    Router (LSR) cannot insert ELs for packets going into a given Label Switched Path
    (LSP) unless an egress LSR has indicated via signaling that it has the capability
    to process ELs, referred to as the Entropy Label Capability (ELC), on that LSP.
    In addition, it would be useful for ingress LSRs to know each LSR's capability
    for reading the maximum label stack depth and performing EL-based load-balancing,
    referred to as Entropy Readable Label Depth (ERLD). This document defines a mechanism
    to signal these two capabilities using OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, and Border Gateway Protocol
    - Link State (BGP-LS).</p>"
