abstract:
- content: "<p>The TLS protocol is widely deployed and used over the Internet. Client
    and server nodes compute a set of keys called the keys-block, according to a pseudo
    random function (PRF). This draft proposes a keying infrastructure based on the
    TLS protocol. It suggests defining an additional Key Distribution Function (KDF)
    in order to deliver a set of cryptographic keys. In a peer to peer mode keys are
    directly produced as inputs of the KDF functions. For centralized architectures
    they are delivered through containers, secured with keys derived from the KDF
    function.</p>"
