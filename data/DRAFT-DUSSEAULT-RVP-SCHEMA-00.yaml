abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>          The RVP protocol [2] can be used to query properties
    of objects,\n          subscribe to certain kinds of events, and send instant
    messages\n          to objects.  These objects are often users, but there are
    other\n          classes of objects as well.\n \n          A schema needs to be
    defined which applies to all kinds of RVP\n          objects, as well as more
    detailed schemas for the most commonly\n          used objects, users and groups.\n
    \n          The required properties for all RVP objects include common name\n
    \         (Cn), schema type and access control list.  The required\n          properties
    for a user object, which represents a single human\n          user of the system,
    include status, status message, email address\n          and directory server
    address.  The required properties for a\n          group object, which represents
    a list of objects which may be\n          messaged all at once by messaging this
    group, include member-\n          count and owner.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
