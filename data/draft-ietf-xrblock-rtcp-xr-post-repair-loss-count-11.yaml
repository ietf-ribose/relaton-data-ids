abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report
    (XR) block that allows reporting of a post-repair loss count metric for a range
    of RTP applications. In addition, another metric, repaired loss count, is also
    introduced in this report block for calculating the pre-repair loss count when
    needed, so that the RTP sender or a third-party entity is able to evaluate the
    effectiveness of the repair methods used by the system.</p>"
