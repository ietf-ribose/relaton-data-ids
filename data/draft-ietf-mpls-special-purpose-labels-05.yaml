abstract:
- content: <p>Some MPLS labels have been allocated for specific purposes. A block
    of labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end, and are commonly called "reserved
    labels". They will be called "special purpose labels" in this document. As there
    are only 16 of these special purpose labels, caution is needed in the allocation
    of new special purpose labels, yet at the same time allow forward progress when
    one is called for. This memo defines new procedures to follow in the allocation
    and retirement of special purpose labels, as well as a method to extend the special
    purpose label space. Finally, this memo renames the IANA registry for these labels
    to "Special Purpose MPLS Label Values", and creates a new one called the "Extended
    Special Purpose MPLS Label Values" registry. This document updates a number of
    previous RFCs that used the term "reserved label".</p>
