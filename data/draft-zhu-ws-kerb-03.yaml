abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extensions to the Kerberos protocol and the GSS-API
    Kerberos mechanism that enable a GSS-API Kerberos client to exchange messages
    with the KDC using the GSS-API acceptor as the proxy, by encapsulating the Kerberos
    messages inside GSS-API tokens. With these extensions a client can obtain Kerberos
    tickets for services where the KDC is not accessible to the client, but is accessible
    to the application server.</p>"
