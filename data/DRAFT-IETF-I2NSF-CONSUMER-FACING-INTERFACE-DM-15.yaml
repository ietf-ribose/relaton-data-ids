abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an information model and a YANG data
    model\n   for the Consumer-Facing Interface between an Interface to Network\n
    \  Security Functions (I2NSF) User and Security Controller in an I2NSF\n   system
    in a Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) environment.  The\n   information
    model defines various types of managed objects and the\n   relationship among
    them needed to build the interface.  The\n   information model is based on the
    \"Event-Condition-Action\" (ECA)\n   policy model defined by a capability information
    model for I2NSF, and\n   the data model is defined for enabling different users
    of a given\n   I2NSF system to define, manage, and monitor security policies for\n
    \  specific flows within an administrative domain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
