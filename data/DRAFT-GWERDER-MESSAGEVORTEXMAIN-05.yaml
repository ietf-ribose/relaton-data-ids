abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MessageVortex (referred to as Vortex) protocol achieves
    different\n   degrees of anonymity, including sender, receiver, and third-party\n
    \  anonymity, by specifying messages embedded within existing transfer\n   protocols,
    such as SMTP or XMPP, sent via peer nodes to one or more\n   recipients.\n\n   The
    protocol outperforms others by decoupling the transport from the\n   final transmitter
    and receiver.  No trust is placed into any\n   infrastructure except for that
    of the sending and receiving parties\n   of the message.  The creator of the routing
    block (Routing block\n   builder;RBB) has full control over the message flow.
    \ Routing nodes\n   gain no non-obvious knowledge about the messages even when\n
    \  collaborating.  While third-party anonymity is always achieved, the\n   protocol
    also allows for either sender or receiver anonymity.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
