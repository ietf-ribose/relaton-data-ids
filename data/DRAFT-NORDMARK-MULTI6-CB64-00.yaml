abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document outlines a potential solution to IPv6 multihoming
    in\norder to stimulate discussion.  This proposal is a middle ground\nbetween
    the NOID and CB128 proposals.\nThis proposed solution relies on verification the
    crypto-based\nidentifier properties (using public-key crypto during uncommon\noperations),
    while allowing locator rewriting by (border) routers,\nwith no per-packet overhead.
    \ The solution does have something which\ncould be viewed as a 'stack name' type
    of identifier, but this isn't\nexposed to upper layer protocols.  Instead it ensures
    that all upper\nlayer protocols can operate unmodified in a multihomed setting
    while\nstill seeing a stable IPv6 address, even though the address\ninternally
    consists of 64-bits worth of subnet locator plus 64-bits\nof crypto-based identifier.\n\nThis
    solution (and this draft) is remarkably similar to draft-\nnordmark-multi6-noid-00.txt;
    only issues related to prevention of\nredirection attacks differ.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
