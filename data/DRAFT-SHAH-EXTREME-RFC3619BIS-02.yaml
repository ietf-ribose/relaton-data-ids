abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes version 1.3 of the Ethernet Automatic\n
    \  Protection Switching (EAPS) (TM) technology invented by Extreme\n   Networks
    to increase the availability and robustness of Ethernet\n   rings.  An Ethernet
    ring built using EAPS can have resilience\n   comparable to that provided by SONET
    rings, at lower cost and without\n   some of the constraints (e.g. ring size)
    of SONET.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
