abstract:
  content: "<p>For C-ACC, platooning and other typical use cases in ITS, direct IP
    communication between neighbor vehicles poses the following two issues: 1) how
    to discover the neighbor vehicle and the demanded service; and 2) how to discover
    the link-layer address of the neighbor vehicle and selected server. This draft
    presents a solution to these problems based on DNS-SD/mDNS [RFC6762][RFC6763].</p>"
