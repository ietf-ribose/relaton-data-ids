abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables receiving
    asynchronous notification of events related to SIP systems. This framework defines
    the procedures for creating, refreshing and terminating subscriptions, as well
    as fetching and periodic polling of resource state. These procedures have a serious
    deficiency in that they do not allow state to persist over a subscription refresh,
    or between two consecutive polls. Another related but different problem relates
    to the relative intolerance of the framework to interferences in networking connectivity
    of subscribers in long- lasting subscriptions. This document explains the problems
    in more detail and discusses possible solutions.</p>"
