abstract:
- content: "<p>A micro-loop is a packet-forwarding loop that may occur transiently
    among two or more routers in a hop-by-hop packet-forwarding paradigm. This document
    analyzes the impact of using different link state IGP implementations in a single
    network with respect to micro-loops. The analysis is focused on the Shortest Path
    First (SPF) delay algorithm but also mentions the impact of SPF trigger strategies.</p>"
