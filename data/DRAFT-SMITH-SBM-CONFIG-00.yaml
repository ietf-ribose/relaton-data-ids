abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo includes a list of manageable parameters for RSVP and
    SBM\nimplementations.  These are in addition to those already described in\nRFC
    2206 and RFC 2213. Specifically, it describes parameters for control\nof the base
    signaling protocols themselves, as well as a basic set of\nparameters for control
    of policy decisions by a Local Policy Module.\nThese are not intended to be exhaustive
    lists but they have been\nidentified as useful for practical implementations.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
