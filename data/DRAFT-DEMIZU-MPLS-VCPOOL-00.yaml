abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Several label switching schemes have been proposed to fuse
    and\n   integrate Layer 2 and Layer 3.  They can be applied to various\n   datalinks
    including intermittent links such as ATM SVC.\n \n   Intermittent links require
    signaling to establish VCs before\n   employing them and to release VCs after
    utilizing them.  Because\n   signaling often introduces delays and costs, some
    kind of\n   optimization is necessary.\n \n   This document proposes to introduce
    a VC pool to reduce the delays\n   and the costs of signaling.\n\t </p>\n      "
