abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) facilitates Traffic Engineering\n
    \  (TE) based path calculation in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or\n   multi-layer
    networks. PCE can be stateless or stateful. With the LSP\n   state information
    acquired from the network, a stateful PCE exhibits\n   superiority in facilitating
    a wide variety of applications,\n   especially in GMPLS networks, such as impairment-aware
    routing and\n   wavelength assignment in wavelength-switched optical networks
    (WSON),\n   time-based scheduling applications. This memo provides extensions\n
    \  required for PCE communication protocol (i.e. PCEP) so as to enable\n   the
    usage of a stateful PCE capability in GMPLS networks. To be more\n   specific,
    the PCEP extensions specified in this memo include not\n   only new objects but
    also modification of existing objects in PCEP\n   messages, with regard to stateful
    PCE usage in GMPLS networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
