abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Spurious timeouts are not rare events in wireless wide-area network,e.g.
    GPRS or EDGE. It has been reported that spurious timeoutsgreatly decrease TCP's
    performance in many aspects. It is not onlybecause of the unnecessary retransmission
    of the last window of data,but also the congestion control is falsely triggered.
    Existingproposals of detecting spurious timeouts either require additionalinformation
    on each data packet, e.g., the timestamps option, orheuristically deduce spurious
    timeouts. These approaches needheuristic feedbacks from the receiver, and hence
    are vulnerable tomisbehaving receivers. In this document, a novel algorithm thatreliably
    detects spurious TCP retransmission timeouts, called STODER,is presented. STODER
    is a TCP sender algorithm and does not requireany information attached on data
    packets. STODER exploits TCPrepacketization to detect false retransmission and
    is well protectedagainst malicious receivers. Therefore, a more aggressive responsealgorithm
    can be safely applied along with the STODER algorithm.</p>"
