abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends Directory-Based Information Services
    (DBIS)\n   described in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support passwd and\n
    \  group databases.\n\n   The passwd and group database schemas SHALL be backwards
    compatible\n   with the Network Information Service [NIS] but stored within [X.500]\n
    \  entries so that they may be resolved with the Lightweight Directory\n   Access
    Protocol [RFC4510].\n\n   A passwd database represents user login accounts on
    UNIX and UNIX-\n   like systems and a group database represents user groups.\n\n
    \  This document describes configuration maps [draft-bannister-dbis-\n   mapping-00]
    for passwd and group databases, and database entries\n   referenced by those maps.\n\n
    \  Overlays may optionally be used to help reduce the complexity of\n   merging
    multiple DBIS domains in large environments by permitting\n   groups of hosts
    to have variations in their UIDs, GIDs, home\n   directories and login shells.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
