abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Various proposals have been submitted to the ROHC working group
    for\nenabling the use of ROHC [RFC3095] header compression over Ethernet,\n802.11
    and other 802-based links.\nPrevious proposals generally suffered from a lack
    of systems\nperspective on 802 networks.  The present document attempts to supply\nsome
    systems perspective and provides a rough outline for a solution.\n\nThis is a
    submission to the IETF ROHC WG.  Please direct discussion\nto its mailing list,
    rohc@ietf.org\n\n$Revision: 1.9 $\n\t </p>\n      "
