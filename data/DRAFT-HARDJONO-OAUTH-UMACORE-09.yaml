abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0.  UMA defines
    how\n   resource owners can control protected-resource access by clients\n   operated
    by arbitrary requesting parties, where the resources reside\n   on any number
    of resource servers, and where a centralized\n   authorization server governs
    access based on resource owner\n   policy.Met at advisory in Feb 2014.\n\n\t </p>\n
