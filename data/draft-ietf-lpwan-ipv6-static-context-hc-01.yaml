abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a header compression scheme and fragmentation
    functionality for IPv6/UDP protocols. These techniques are especially tailored
    for LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) networks and could be extended to other
    protocol stacks. The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) offers a great level
    of flexibility when processing the header fields. Static context means that information
    stored in the context which, describes field values, does not change during the
    packet transmission, avoiding complex resynchronization mechanisms, incompatible
    with LPWAN characteristics. In most of the cases, IPv6/UDP headers are reduced
    to a small identifier. This document describes the generic compression/decompression
    process and applies it to IPv6/UDP headers. Similar mechanisms for other protocols
    such as CoAP will be described in a separate document. Moreover, this document
    specifies fragmentation and reassembly mechanims for SCHC compressed packets exceeding
    the L2 pdu size and for the case where the SCHC compression is not possible then
    the IPv6/UDP packet is sent.</p>"
