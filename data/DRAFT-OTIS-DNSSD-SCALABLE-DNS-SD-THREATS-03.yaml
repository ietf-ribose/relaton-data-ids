abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   mDNS combined with Service Discovery (DNS-SD) extends network\n
    \  resource distribution beyond the reach of multicast normally limited\n   by
    the MAC Bridge.  Since related resources are often not\n   authenticated, either
    local resources are inherently trustworthy or\n   are subsequently verified by
    associated services.  Resource\n   distribution becomes complex when a hybrid
    scheme combines adjacent\n   network resources into a common unicast DNS-SD structure.
    \ This\n   document explores related security considerations.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
