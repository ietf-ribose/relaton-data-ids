abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Wireless IP-based systems will be increasingly used for building\n
    \  control systems in the future where wireless devices interconnect\n   with
    each other, forming low-power and lossy networks (LLNs).  The\n   CoAP/6LoWPAN
    standards are emerging as the de-facto protocols in this\n   area for resource-constrained
    devices.  Both multicast and security\n   are key needs in these networks.  This
    draft presents a method for\n   securing multicast communication in LLNs based
    on the DTLS security\n   protocol which is already present in CoAP devices.  This
    is achieved\n   by using unicast DTLS-protected communication channel to distribute\n
    \  keying material and security parameters to group members.  Group keys\n   consisting
    of a Traffic Encryption Key (TEK) and a Traffic\n   Authentication Key (TAK) are
    generated by group members based on the\n   keying material received.  A group
    member uses its DTLS record layer\n   implementation to encrypt a multicast message
    and provide message\n   authentication using the group keys before sending the
    message via IP\n   multicast to the group.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
