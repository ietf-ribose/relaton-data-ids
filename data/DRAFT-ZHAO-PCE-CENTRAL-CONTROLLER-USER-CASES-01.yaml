abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks deployment scenarios, service providers
    would\n   like to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in both MPLS and\n
    \  GMPLS network while removing the complexity of existing signaling\n   protocols
    such as LDP and RSVP-TE.  In this document, we propose to\n   use the PCE as a
    central controller so that LSP can be calculated/\n   signaled/initiated/downloaded/managed
    through a centralized PCE\n   server to each network devices along the LSP path
    while leveraging\n   the existing PCE technologies as much as possible.\n\n   This
    draft describes the use cases for using the PCE as the central\n   controller
    where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated/downloaded/\n   maintained through extending
    the current PCE architectures and\n   extending the PCEP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
