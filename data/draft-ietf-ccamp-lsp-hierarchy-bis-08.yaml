abstract:
- content: "<p>Label Switched Paths (LSPs) set up in Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) or Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks can be used to form links to carry
    traffic in those networks or in other (client) networks. Protocol mechanisms already
    exist to facilitate the establishment of such LSPs and to bundle traffic engineering
    (TE) links to reduce the load on routing protocols. This document defines extensions
    to those mechanisms to support identifying the use to which such LSPs are to be
    put and to enable the TE link endpoints to be assigned addresses or unnumbered
    identifiers during the signaling process. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
