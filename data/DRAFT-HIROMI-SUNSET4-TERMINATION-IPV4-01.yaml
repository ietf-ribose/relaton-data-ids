abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    After sun-setting of IPv4, many devices will be connected
    to IPv6\n   single stack network. In this document we describe a workaround for\n
    \  IPv6 enabled network configuration. At this moment, the condition of\n   IPv6
    adoption on the consumer devices such as PC, tablet, mobile\n   terminal and entertainment
    device are various. For example, some\n   devices are fully support IPv6 client
    but some are not. It is very\n   hard to provide IPv6 network service with these
    various conditioned\n   devices. To solve this problem, we tried to verify some\n
    \  configurations to connect these devices into IPv6 enabled consumer\n   network
    for termination of IPv4 network services.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
