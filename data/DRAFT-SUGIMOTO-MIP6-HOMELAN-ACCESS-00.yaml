abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document, we propose to relax forwarding rule of the
    Mobile\n   IPv6 home agent.  In addition to utilizing link-local scope home\n
    \  address, mobile node may request home agent to bypass specific link-\n   local
    scope multicast traffic which may be of its interest.  The\n   extensions allow
    mobile node to seamlessly access the home network\n   through link-local communication.
    \ Modifications to mobility signals\n   for home registration are made in order
    to realize the extensions.\n   This document also provides a set of requirements
    and guidelines for\n   target usage scenario and implications to Mobile IPv6 system
    design.\n\t </p>\n      "
