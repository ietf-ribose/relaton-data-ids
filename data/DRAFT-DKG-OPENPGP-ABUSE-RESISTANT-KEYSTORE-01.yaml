abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OpenPGP transferable public keys are composite certificates,
    made up\n   of primary keys, direct key signatures, user IDs, identity\n   certifications
    (\"signature packets\"), subkeys, and so on.  They are\n   often assembled by
    merging multiple certificates that all share the\n   same primary key, and are
    distributed in public keystores.\n\n   Unfortunately, since any third-party can
    add certifications with any\n   content to any OpenPGP certificate, the assembled/merged
    form of a\n   certificate can become unwieldy or undistributable.\n\n   This draft
    documents techniques that an archive of OpenPGP\n   certificates can use to mitigate
    the impact of these various forms of\n   flooding attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
