abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are quite a few potential problems regarding firewalling
    or\npacket filtering in IPv6 environment.  These include slight ambiguity\nin
    the IPv6 specification, problems parsing packets beyond unknown\nExtension Headers
    and Destination Options, and introduction of end-\nto-end encrypted traffic and
    peer-to-peer applications.  There may\nalso be need to extend packet matching
    to include some Extension\nHeader or Destination Option fields.  This draft discusses
    these\nissues to raise awareness and proposes some tentative solutions or\nworkarounds.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
