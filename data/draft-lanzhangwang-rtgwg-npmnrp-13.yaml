abstract:
- content: <p>The Node Potential Oriented Multi-Nexthop Routing Protocol (NP-MNRP)
    bases on the idea of "hop-by-hop routing forwarding, multi-backup next hop" and
    combines with the phenomena that water flows from higher place to lower. NP-MNRP
    defines a metric named as node potential, which is based on hop count and the
    actual link bandwidth, and calculates multiple next-hops through the potential
    difference between the nodes.</p>
