abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a YANG data model to map customer service\n
    \  models (e.g., the L3VPN Service Model (L3SM)) to Traffic Engineering\n   (TE)
    models (e.g., the TE Tunnel or the Virtual Network (VN) model).\n   These models
    are referred to as TE Service Mapping Model and are\n   applicable generically
    to the operator's need for seamless control\n   and management of their VPN services
    with underlying TE support.\n\n   The models are principally used for monitoring
    and diagnostics of the\n   management systems to show how the service requests
    are mapped onto\n   underlying network resource and TE models.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
