abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how DSR [1] can be extended for the
    support\n   of MANET multipath routing. In DSR, the route record informatio is\n
    \  available at the destination, so the destination can select multiple\n   routes
    with good characteristics and notify the source of them.\n   Therefore, in this
    draft, we describe how we can extend the Route\n   Request option to specify the
    number of routes selected at the\n   destination.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
