abstract:
- content: "<p>The known security vulnerabilities in Neighbor Discovery have not been
    properly dealt with. This note suggests some techniques based on cryptographically
    generated addresses and probes that may be applied even in the absence of a pre-established
    security relationship between the parties involved.</p>"
