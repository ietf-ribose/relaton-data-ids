abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF has standardized RBridges, devices that implement the
    TRILL\nprotocol, a solution for transparent shortest-path frame routing in\nmulti-hop
    networks with arbitrary topologies, using a link-state\nrouting protocol technology
    and encapsulation with a hop-count.  As\nRBridges are deployed in real-world situations,
    operators will need\ntools for debugging problems that arise.  This document specifies
    a\nset of RBridge features for operations, administration, and\nmaintenance purposes
    in RBridge campuses.  The features specified in\nthis document include tools for
    traceroute, ping, and error\nreporting.\n\t </p>\n      "
