abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the Internet has grown, many services with high availability\n
    \  requirements have emerged.  The requirements of these services have\n   increased
    the demands on the reliability of the infrastructure on\n   which those services
    rely.\n\n\n   Many techniques have been employed to increase the availability
    of\n   services deployed on the Internet.  This document presents\n   operational
    experience of wide-scale service distribution using\n   anycast, and proposes
    a series of recommendations for others using\n   this approach.\n\t </p>\n      "
