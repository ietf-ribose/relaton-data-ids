abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Designation of services and devices of a home network is not
    user\n   friendly, and mechanisms should enable a user to designate services\n
    \  and devices inside a home network using names.\n\n   In order to enable internal
    communications while the home network\n   experiments Internet connectivity shortage,
    the naming service should\n   be hosted on a device inside the home network.  On
    the other hand,\n   home networks devices have not been designed to handle heavy
    loads.\n   As a result, hosting the naming service on such home network device,\n
    \  visible on the Internet exposes this device to resource exhaustion\n   and
    other attacks, which could make the home network unreachable, and\n   most probably
    would also affect the internal communications of the\n   home network.\n\n   As
    result, home networks may prefer not serving the naming service\n   for the Internet,
    but instead prefer outsourcing it to a third party.\n   This document describes
    a mechanisms that enables the Home Network\n   Authority (HNA) to outsource the
    naming service to the Outsourcing\n   Infrastructure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
