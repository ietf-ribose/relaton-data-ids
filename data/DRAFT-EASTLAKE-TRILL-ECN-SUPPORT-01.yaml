abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Explicit congestion notification (ECN) allows a forwarding
    element to\n   notify downstream devices, including the destination, of the onset
    of\n   congestion without having to drop packets. This document extends this\n
    \  capability to TRILL switches, including integration with IP ECN.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
