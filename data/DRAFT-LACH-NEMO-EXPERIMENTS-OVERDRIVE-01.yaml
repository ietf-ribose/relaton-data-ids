abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document gives a short high-level overview of several\npractical
    experiments performed with mobile networks using Mobile\nIPv6-based NEMO extensions
    in the context of the IST OverDRiVE\nproject.  Laboratory experiments include
    simple and nested mobile\nnetworks in a pure IPv6 environment while 'field' experiments\ndemonstrated
    continuous IPv6 vehicular connectivity over two\npublicly deployed IPv4 networks:
    2.5G (GPRS) and Wireless LAN\n802.11b deployed around and inside a metropolitan
    area.\n\t </p>\n      "
