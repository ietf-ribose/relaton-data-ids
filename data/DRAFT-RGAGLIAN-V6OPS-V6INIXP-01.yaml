abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a guide for IPv6 deployment in Internet\n
    \  Exchange Points (IXP).  It includes information about the switching \n   fabric
    configuration, the addressing plan options and general\n   organizational tasks
    to be performed.  IXP are mainly a layer 2\n   device (the switching fabric) and
    in many case the best\n   recommendations state that IPv6 traffic and management
    should not be\n   handled differently than in IPv4.\n\t </p>\n      "
