abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the responsibilities and authorities for defining,
    collecting and distributing RFC 1327 address mapping rules. It clearly defines
    the items: mapping function, addressing authority, administrative equivalence
    as well as a mechanism for registering mapping authorities and administrative
    equivalence. This mechanism is based on an extension of RFC 1327 mapping rules
    (during the collection distribution process). No changes to already installed
    gateway software are required.</p>"
