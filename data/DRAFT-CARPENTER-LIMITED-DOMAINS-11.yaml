abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a noticeable trend towards network requirements, behaviours\n
    \  and semantics that are specific to a particular set of requirements\n   applied
    within a limited region of the Internet.  Policies, default\n   parameters, the
    options supported, the style of network management\n   and security requirements
    may vary between such limited regions.\n   This document reviews examples of such
    limited domains (also known as\n   controlled environments), notes emerging solutions,
    and includes a\n   related taxonomy.  It then briefly discusses the standardization
    of\n   protocols for limited domains.  Finally, it shows the needs for a\n   precise
    definition of \"limited domain membership\" and for mechanisms\n   to allow nodes
    to join a domain securely and to find other members,\n   including boundary nodes.\n\n
    \  This document is the product of the research of the authors.  It has\n   been
    produced through discussions and consultation within the IETF,\n   but is not
    the product of IETF conensus.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
