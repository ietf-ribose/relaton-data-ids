abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A spurious timeout in TCP forces the sender to unnecessarily\n
    \  retransmit one complete congestion window of data into the network.\n   In
    addition, the congestion state of the network could change\n   substantially after
    a spurious timeout.  In this draft we propose a\n   conservative congestion response
    algorithm afert spurious timeout\n   that takes network state into account.\n\n\t
