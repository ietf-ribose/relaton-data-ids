abstract:
  content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol allows the use of UDP for transportof
    SIP messages. The use of UDP inherently risks network congestionproblems, as UDP
    itself does not define congestion prevention,avoidance, detection, or correction
    mechanisms. This problem isaggravated by large SIP messages which fragment at
    the UDP level.Transport protocols in SIP are also negotiated on a per-hop basis,
    atthe SIP level, so SIP proxies may convert from TCP to UDP and soforth. This
    document defines by which a SIP User Agent may requirethat its requests are not
    sent over UDP or other transports havingcongestion-related characteristics similar
    to those of UDP.</p>"
