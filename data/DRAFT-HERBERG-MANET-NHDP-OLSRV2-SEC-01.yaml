abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies integrity and replay protection for
    required\n   implementation in the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)\n
    \  and the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).\n   This
    document specifies how an included integrity check value (ICV)\n   and a timestamp
    TLV, defined in RFC6622bis, are used by NHDP and\n   OLSRv2 for countering a number
    of security threats.  The ICV TLV uses\n   a SHA-256 based HMAC and a single shared
    secret key.  The timestamp\n   TLV is based on POSIX time, assuming router synchronization.
    \ The\n   mechanism in this specification can also be used for other MANET\n   protocols
    using RFC5444.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
