abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   XML signature standard (described in RFC3275 [RFC3275])defined
    by\n   IETF/W3C references or identifies signed elements by their unique\n   identities
    specified by \"id\" attribute values in the given XML\n   document.  Hence, signed
    XML elements can be shifted from one\n   location to another location in a XML
    document, and still, it does\n   not have any effect on its ability to verify
    its signature.  This\n   flexibility paves the way for an attacker to tweak original
    XML\n   message without getting noticed by the receiver.  This document\n   proposes
    to use absolute XPath as an \"Positional Token\" and modifies\n   XML Signature
    algorithm to overcome the XML Signature wrapping\n   attacks on XML signatures.\n\n\t
