abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Efficient detection of network attachment in IPv6 needs the
    following\n   two components: a method for the host to query routers on the link
    to\n   identify the link (Link Identification) and a method for the routers\n
    \  on the link to consistently respond to such a query with minimal\n   delay
    (Fast RA).  Solving the link identification based strictly on\n   RFC 2461 is
    difficult because of the flexibilities offered to routers\n   in terms of prefixes
    advertised in a router advertisement (RA)\n   message.  Similarly, the random
    delay in responding to router\n   solicitation messages imposed by RFC 2461 makes
    to it difficult to\n   achieve fast RA.  In this memo, an integrated solution
    is presented.\n   Monitoring of prefixes by both hosts and routers is used to
    achieve\n   link identification while router advertisements are sent rapidly in
    a\n   deterministic order by combining router solicitation source addresses\n
    \  with hash-based router tokens.\n\t </p>\n      "
