abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IETF Source Address Validation Improvements (SAVI) working
    group is\n   chartered for source address validation within the first hop from
    the\n   end hosts, i.e., preventing a node from spoofing the IP source\n   address
    of another node in the same IP link.  However, since SAVI\n   requires the edge
    routers or switches to be upgraded, the deployment\n   of SAVI will need a long
    time.  During this transition period, some\n   source address validation techniques
    beyond the first hop (SAVI-BF)\n   may be needed to complement SAVI and protect
    the networks from\n   spoofing based attacks.  In this document, we first propose
    three\n   desired features of the SAVI-BF techniques.  Then we analyze the\n   problems
    of the current SAVI-BF technique, ingress filtering.\n   Finally, we discuss the
    directions that we can explore to improve\n   SAVI-BF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
