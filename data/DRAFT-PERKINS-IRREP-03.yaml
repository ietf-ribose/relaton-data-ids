abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODVv2) routing protocol
    is\n   intended for use by mobile routers in wireless, multihop networks.\n   AODVv2
    determines unicast routes among AODVv2 routers within the\n   network in an on-demand
    fashion, offering on-demand convergence in\n   dynamic topologies.  This document
    specifies an extension to AODVv2\n   (possibly useful with other reactive routing
    protocols) enabling\n   intermediate nodes to shorten route discovery times.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
