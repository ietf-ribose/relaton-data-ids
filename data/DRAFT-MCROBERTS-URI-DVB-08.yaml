abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes for broadcasting
    programme\n   resources transmitted over MPEG-2 Transport Streams [MPEG-Systems]\n
    \  have been devised in their process of creating standards by the\n   Digital
    Video Broadcasting Project (DVB), the Association of Radio\n   Industries and
    Businesses in Japan (ARIB) and the OpenCable\n   Application Platform (OCAP) to
    acquire current and future scheduled\n   publications of broadcast media content
    from multimedia applications\n   such as HTTP, MHP [DVB-MHP], OCAP [OCAP1.0] or
    other XML based\n   metadata.\n\n   These URI are used to locate the actual digital
    TV, Radio or other\n   multimedia broadcast programme services (i.e., channels
    or events)\n   and also the audio-visual components related to that programme,
    for\n   example an HTTP-based programme guide on the Web or other XML-based\n
    \  electronic programme guides in digital broadcast receivers.\n\n   This document
    defines the \"dvb\" URI scheme for the benefit of the\n   Internet community,
    given its definition as part of the Digital Video\n   Broadcasting (DVB) suite
    of ETSI standards.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
