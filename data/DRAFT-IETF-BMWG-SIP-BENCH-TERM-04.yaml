abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a terminology for benchmarking SIP performance\n
    \  in networking devices.  Terms are included for test components, test\n   setup
    parameters, and performance benchmark metrics for black-box\n   benchmarking of
    SIP networking devices.  The performance benchmark\n   metrics are obtained for
    the SIP control plane and media plane.  The\n   terms are intended for use in
    a companion methodology document for\n   complete performance characterization
    of a device in a variety of\n   conditions making it possible to compare performance
    of different\n   devices.  It is critical to provide test setup parameters and
    a\n   methodology document for SIP performance benchmarking because SIP\n   allows
    a wide range of configuration and operational conditions that\n   can influence
    performance benchmark measurements.  It is necessary to\n   have terminology and
    methodology standards to ensure that reported\n   benchmarks have consistent definition
    and were obtained following the\n   same procedures.  Benchmarks can be applied
    to compare performance of\n   a variety of SIP networking devices.\n\n\t </p>\n
