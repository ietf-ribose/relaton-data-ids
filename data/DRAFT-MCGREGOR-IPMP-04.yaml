abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The practice and need for active network measurement is well\nestablished,
    however current tools are not well suited to this\ntask, mostly because the protocols
    which they employ have not\nbeen designed for measurement of the modern Internet.\nThe
    IP Measurement Protocol (IPMP) is based on packet-probes, and\nis designed to
    allow routers to participate in measurements by the\ninsertion of path information
    as the probe passes between a pair of\nhosts.  IPMP is tightly constrained and
    easy to implement.\n\t </p>\n      "
