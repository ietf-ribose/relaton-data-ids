abstract:
- content: "<p>This document seeks to document all usage of IPv4 addresses in currently
    deployed IETF documented standards. In order to successfully transition from an
    all IPv4 Internet to an all IPv6 Internet, many interim steps will be taken. One
    of these steps is the evolution of current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.
    It is hoped that these protocols (and their implementations) will be redesigned
    to be network address independent, but failing that will at least dually support
    IPv4 and IPv6. To this end, all Standards (Full, Draft, and Proposed) as well
    as Experimental RFCs will be surveyed and any dependencies will be documented.</p>"
