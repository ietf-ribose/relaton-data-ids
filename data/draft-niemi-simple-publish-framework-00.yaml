abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Session InitiationProtocol
    (SIP). The purpose of this extension is to provide anextensible framework for
    publication of SIP specific data. Thisextension derives from the recent Internet
    Draft defining the PUBLISHmethod, but instead of using the SIP events framework,
    it introducesa specific publication framework for the publish mechanism. The mainmotivations
    for decoupling publications from events are that theevent framework is not overloaded,
    and the applicability of thePUBLISH method to problem sets similar to those surfacing
    in thepublication of event state is improved. The SIP publicationframework is
    neither intended for general data manipulation, nor isit intended to foster any
    discussion on the issue of using SIP foreverything.</p>"
