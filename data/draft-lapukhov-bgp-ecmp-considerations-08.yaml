abstract:
- content: <p>BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) [RFC4271] employs tie-breaking logic to
    select a single best path among multiple paths available, known as BGP best path
    selection. At the same time, it has become a common practice to allow for "equal-cost
    multipath" (ECMP) selection and programming of multiple next-hops in routing tables.
    This document summarizes some common considerations for the ECMP logic when BGP
    is used as the routing protocol, with the intent of providing common reference
    for otherwise unstandardized set of features.</p>
