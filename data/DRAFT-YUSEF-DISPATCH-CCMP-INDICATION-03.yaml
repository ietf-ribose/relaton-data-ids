abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol document
    defines a\n   way for a client to discover a conference control server that\n
    \  supports CCMP. However, it does not define a way for a client\n   involved
    in a conference to determine if the conference focus\n   supports CCMP. This information
    would allow a CCMP-enabled client\n   that joins a conference using SIP to also
    register for the XCON\n   conference event package RFC4575 [RFC 4575] and take
    advantage of\n   CCMP operations on the conference.\n\n   This document describes
    a few options to address the above limitation\n   with the pros and cons for each
    approach, and recommends two to be\n   used depending on the need of the UA. The
    first approach uses the\n   Call-Info header and as a result this document updates
    RFC3261. The\n   second approach defines a new value for the 'purpose' parameter
    in\n   the 'service-uris' element in the SIP conferencing event package, and\n
    \  as a result this document update RFC4575 [RFC 4575].\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
