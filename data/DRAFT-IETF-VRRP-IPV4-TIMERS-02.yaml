abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The router survivability capability provided by the Virtual\n
    \  Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv4 (VRRPv4) satisfies the\n   requirements
    for many LAN environments. There are, however,\n   LAN environments that have
    sub-second failover requirements and\n   thus a need for finer granularity of
    the VRRP timers. This draft\n   proposes extensions to VRRPv4 [RFC 3768] for specifying
    sub-second\n   Advertisement Intervals. A new message type is introduced which\n
    \  permits the timer granularity for the Advertisement Interval to\n   be specified.
    In addition, a new field is introduced permitting\n   the specification of the
    number of missed ADVERTISEMENTs before\n   a Virtual Router Master is declared
    down.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
