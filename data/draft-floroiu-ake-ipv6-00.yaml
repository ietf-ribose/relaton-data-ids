abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes an authenticated key exchange scheme enabling
    twonodes to establish a security association in a way robust to man in themiddle
    attacks. The scheme is based on owner-bound IP addresses and DNSlookups.The proposed
    scheme relies on the fact that an attacker cannot timelyproduce a piece of information
    to match the output of a one wayfunction.</p>"
