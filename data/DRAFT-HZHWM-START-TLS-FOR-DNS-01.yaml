abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a technique for upgrading a DNS TCP\n
    \  connection to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) over standard ports.\n   Encryption
    provided by DNS-over-TLS eliminates opportunities for\n   eavesdropping of DNS
    queries in the network.  The proposed mechanism\n   is backwards compatible with
    clients and servers that are not aware\n   of DNS-over-TLS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
