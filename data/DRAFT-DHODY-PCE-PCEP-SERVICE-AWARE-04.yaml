abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks like financial information network (stock/\n
    \  commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications,\n   Latency
    (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet loss is\n   becoming a key requirement
    for path computation along with other\n   constraints and metrics.  Latency, Latency-Variation
    and Packet Loss\n   is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between\n
    \  customers and service providers.\n\n   [MPLS-DELAY-FWK] describes MPLS architecture
    to allow Latency\n   (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet loss as properties.\n
    \  [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS] describes mechanisms with\n   which
    network performance information is distributed via OSPF and\n   ISIS respectively.
    \ This document describes the extension to PCEP to\n   carry Latency, Latency-Variation
    and Loss as constraints for end to\n   end path computation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
