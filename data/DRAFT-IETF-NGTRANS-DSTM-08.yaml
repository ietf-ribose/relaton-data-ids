abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>During the initial deployment of IPv6, hosts in native IPv6 networks\nwill
    need to maintain connectivity with hosts and/or applications who\ncan only be
    reached through IPv4. The Dual Stack Transition Mechanism\n(DSTM) provides a method
    to assure this connectivity based on the use\nof IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnels and the
    temporal allocation of a global\nIPv4 address to hosts requiring such communication.
    This document\ndefines the processes and architecture required for this transition\nmechanism.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
