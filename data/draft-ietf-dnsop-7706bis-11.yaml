abstract:
- content: "<p>Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip times
    to the closest DNS root server; those resolvers may have difficulty getting responses
    from the root servers, such as during a network attack. Some DNS recursive resolver
    operators want to prevent snooping by third parties of requests sent to DNS root
    servers. Such resolvers can greatly decrease the round-trip time and prevent observation
    of requests by serving a copy of the full root zone on the same server, such as
    on a loopback address or in the resolver software. This document shows how to
    start and maintain such a copy of the root zone that does not cause problems for
    other users of the DNS, at the cost of adding some operational fragility for the
    operator. This document obsoletes RFC 7706. [ This document is being collaborated
    on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-kh-dnsop-7706bis. The most recent
    version of the document, open issues, and so on should all be available there.
    The authors gratefully accept pull requests. ]</p>"
