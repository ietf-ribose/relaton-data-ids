abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines the format of network news articles.Network news
    articles resemble mail messages but are broadcast topotentially large audiences,
    using a flooding algorithm thatpropagates one copy to each interested host (or
    group thereof),typically stores only one copy per host, and does not require anycentral
    administration or systematic registration of interestedusers. Network news originated
    as the medium of communication forUsenet, circa 1980. Since then Usenet has grown
    explosively, and manyInternet sites participate in it. In addition, the news technology
    isnow in widespread use for other purposes, on the Internet andelsewhere.This
    document defines the format of network news articles in thecontext of the Internet
    Message Format, and adds MultipurposeInternet Mail Extensions (MIME) support for
    multimedia andinternationalized message bodies.</p>"
