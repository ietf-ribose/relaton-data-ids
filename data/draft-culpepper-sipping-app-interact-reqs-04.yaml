abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the high level requirements for a framework and/or
    one or more mechanisms that support user interaction, via SIP-based user agents,
    with applications residing on remote network servers. The requirements in this
    document address the overall features of such a system, without regard to its
    architecture. SIP currently supports media-based application interactions using
    methods such as speech, video and end-to-end telephony-related tones; however,
    it is desired that more general application interaction models are defined, especially
    those that are not restricted to the media plane. In addition, it is desired that
    an application be able to present the user with application-specific user interfaces
    and information. The user agent should also be able to generate activity indications
    back to an application to communicate actions on physical or logical user interfaces.
    The document also defines a number of topic-related terms to assist in disambiguating
    discussions of the issues.</p>"
