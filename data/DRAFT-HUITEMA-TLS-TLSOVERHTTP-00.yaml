abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We observe that attacks against HTTPS are getting more and
    more\n   popular.  The attacks typically exploit weaknesses in PKI certificate\n
    \  verification software.  These weaknesses allow a third party to\n   insert
    itself as a Man-In-The-Middle in a TLS connection, accessing\n   the content of
    messages that were previously encrypted and in some\n   case changing these messages.\n\n
    \  TLS over HTTP allows clients and servers to carry a TLS conversation\n   on
    top of HTTP, and thus bypass the man-in-the-middle attackers.\n   Different deployment
    models are possible, e.g., HTTP over TLS over\n   HTTP, application-layer-protocol
    over TLS over HTTP, or HTTP over TLS\n   over HTTP over TLS.\n\n   The proposed
    solution allows for reuse of the existing TLS\n   implementation, thus minimizing
    the development costs and risks.  It\n   includes an optional obfuscation layer,
    to maximize the likelihood of\n   working unnoticed by firewalls and other MITM
    boxes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
