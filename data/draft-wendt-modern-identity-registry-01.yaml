abstract:
- content: "<p>This document will describe an approach for how a distributed identity
    registry model might look. It will consider both public registry components of
    the data model necessary for routing calls from one globally routable identity
    to another. It will also consider part of the private registry components a provider
    may need to manage associations with users or customers. Other topics include
    provider associations, application or service association, and the ability to
    support multiple identities associated with a user/ subscriber (e.g. telephone
    number and e-mail identity).</p>"
