abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is used to interconnect\n
    \  systems across a wide-area or metropolitan-area network, making it\n   appear
    that they are on a private LAN.  The systems which are\n   interconnected may
    themselves be LAN switches.  If, however, they\n   are IP hosts or IP routers,
    certain simplifications to the operation\n   of the VPLS are possible.  We call
    this simplified type of VPLS an\n   \"IP-only LAN Service\" (IPLS).  In an IPLS,
    as in a VPLS, LAN\n   interfaces are run in promiscuous mode, and frames are forwarded\n
    \  based on their destination MAC addresses.  However, the maintenance\n   of
    the MAC forwarding tables is done via signaling, rather than via\n   the MAC address
    learning procedures specified in [IEEE 802.1D].\n   This draft specifies the protocol
    extensions and procedures for\n   support of the IPLS service.\n\n   The original
    intent was to provide an alternate solution to VPLS\n   for those PE routers that
    were not capable of learning MAC address\n   through data plane. This became a
    non-issue with newer hardware.\n   The concepts put forth by this draft are still
    valuable and are\n   adopted in one form or other by newer work such as Ethernet
    VPN\n   in L2VPN Working Group and possible data center applications. At\n   this
    point, no further action is planned to update this document\n   and is published
    simply as a historic record of the ideas.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
