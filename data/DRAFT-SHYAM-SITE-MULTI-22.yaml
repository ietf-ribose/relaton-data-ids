abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a solution for Site Multihoming of stub\n
    \  networks in a real IP environment. Each user interface in a customer\n   network
    may have as many global unicast addresses as many service\n   providers it will
    be connected with. Users can establish multiple\n   connections through different
    service providers simultaneously.\n   Customer networks can maintain private address
    space to communicate\n   within its users. Customer networks can provide IP mobility
    services\n   as well.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
