abstract:
- content: "<p>The delivery of network services often require service functions and
    their specific order, called a service function chain (SFC). A SFC request is
    usually composed by distributed resources which are expected to available across
    multiple domains with different technology and/or administration. This document
    describes different standardization activities and research projects addressing
    the challenges posed by SFC across multiple domains (specifically, multiple administrative
    domains). In addition, this document presents an initial approach to realize inter-domain
    service chains leveraging the Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol.
    Finally, another important concern of this document is to initiate a discussion
    (ALTO, SFC as well as other WGs) regarding if, how, and under what conditions
    ALTO can be useful to improve the multi-domain SFC process.</p>"
