abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of TLS-SE-IO is to provide virtual IO pins for secure elements
    running TLS servers, in order to interact with sensors and actuators. TLS-SE device
    processes TLS packets in secure element. It may work like a black box (server
    mode) that exchanges fully encrypted packets. It may also export encrypted packet
    in clear form, in order to provide virtual output pin. Output messages may include
    cookies and/or cryptographic materials. Virtual input pin forwards input messages,
    triggered by previous output messages, and sent to TLS-SE device for further processing.</p>"
