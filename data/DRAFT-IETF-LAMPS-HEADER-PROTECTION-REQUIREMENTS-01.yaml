abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Privacy and security issues with email header protection in
    S/MIME\n   have been identified for some time.  However, the desire to fix these\n
    \  issues has only recently been expressed in the IETF LAMPS Working\n   Group.
    \ The existing S/MIME specification is likely to be updated\n   regarding header
    protection.\n\n   This document describes the problem statement, generic use cases,
    and\n   requirements of header protection.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
