abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A secure substrate known as the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP)
    is\n   required by the Generic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) used by\n
    \  Autonomic Service Agents.  This document describes QUADS, a QUick And\n   Dirty
    Secure ACP using symmetric cryptography and preconfigured keys\n   or passwords.
    \ It also describes a simplistic QUADS Key\n   Infrastructure based on asymmetric
    cryptography used over insecure\n   instances of GRASP to create a QUADS ACP.\n\n\t
