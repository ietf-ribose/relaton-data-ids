abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document addresses challenges while applying methodologies\n
    \  described in [RFC2544] to benchmarking NFV (Network Function\n   Virtualization)
    over an extended period of time, sometimes referred\n   to as \"soak testing\".
    \ More specifically to benchmarking software\n   based implementations of NFV
    data planes.  Packet throughput search\n   approach proposed by this document
    assumes that system under test is\n   probabilistic in nature, and not deterministic.\n\n\t
