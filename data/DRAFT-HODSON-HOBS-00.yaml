abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Where LDAP servers are based on X.500 DSAs for the holding of\n
    \     distributed Directory information, the maintenance of the\n      necessary
    security and networking relationships between DSAs is\n      an important factor
    to consider.\n \n      The '93 X.500 Directory standards define HOB (Hierarchical\n
    \     Operational Binding) procedures for the creation of a new naming\n      context
    in another DSA, and also for the maintenance of the\n      relationship between
    two DSAs where one holds a superior naming\n      context and the other holds
    a subordinate naming context.  The\n      standards also define the use of the
    Directory Operational\n      Binding Management Protocol (DOP) to mediate these
    procedures.\n \n      The use of HOBs provides a major simplification for managers
    of\n      X.500 systems, since it provides a way to update policies\n      automatically
    from one DSA to another.  But practical design for\n      HOBs requires decisions
    in a number of respects not fully\n      treated by the standards.  This document
    simplifies the\n      implementor's task by defining viable and practical subsets
    of\n      the standards and by clarifying some of the issues left\n      undefined
    by the standards.\n \n      HOBs always represent an intimate relationship between
    DSAs\n      which must be protected from masquerade. A method of providing\n      this
    protection is given in the '93 Directory standards by\n      requiring mutual
    authentication at the bind between DSAs. HOBS\n      will normally only be established
    between DSAs owned by a single\n      administrative authority, so security needs
    to be considered in\n      this somewhat easier context than complete openness.\n
    \n      Although simple unprotected authentication (name and password)\n      can
    be a valid option in an already-secure environment, simple\n      protected authentication
    using an encrypted password is\n      potentially a much more secure technique,
    as is strong\n      authentica\n\t </p>\n      "
