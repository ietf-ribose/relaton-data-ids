abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) can have several modes
    of\n   operation over ATM. The MPLS Framework document [1] indicates that\n   MPLS
    MUST allow 'ships in the night' (SIN) operation with existing L2\n   switching
    protocols (e.g., ATM Forum Signaling).\n \n   This document identifies the technical
    requirements that have to be\n   resolved in order to allow for a successful SIN
    operation between\n   MPLS and ATM Forum protocol stack. Solutions to the various\n
    \  challenges are proposed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
