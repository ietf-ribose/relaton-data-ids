abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Stateful PCE maintains information about LSP characteristics
    and\n   resource usage within the network in order to provide traffic\n   engineering
    calculations for its associated PCCs.  This document\n   describes general considerations
    for stateful PCEP and examines its\n   applicability and benefits through a number
    of use cases.  PCEP\n   extensions required for stateful PCE usage are covered
    in separate\n   documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
