abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a new mechanism for conversational
    multimedia\n   flows.  The proposed mechanism uses Forward Error Correction (FEC)\n
    \  encoded RTP packets (redundant packets) along side the media packets\n   to
    probe for available network capacity.  A straightforward\n   interpretation is,
    the sending endpoint increases the transmission\n   rate by keeping the media
    rate constant but increases the amount of\n   FEC.  If no losses and discards
    occur, the endpoint can then increase\n   the media rate.  If losses occur, the
    redundant FEC packets help in\n   recovering the lost packets.  Consequently,
    the endpoint can vary the\n   FEC bit rate to conservatively (by a small amount)
    or aggressively\n   (by a large amount) probe for available network capacity.\n\n\t
