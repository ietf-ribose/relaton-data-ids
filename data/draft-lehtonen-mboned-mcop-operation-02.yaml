abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft defines Multicast Control Protocol (MCOP) operation forfirst
    hop routers. In this context, MCOP may be used as a tool formulticast network
    management. MCOP provides multicast network remotemanagement with centralized
    information database located at MulticastControl Server (MCS). It allows gradual,
    group and network specificmulticast network deployment. The control is done by
    MCOP enabledfirst hop routers, Multicast Control Clients (MCC), based on theinformation
    received from the MCS. MCC can filter IGMP/MLD reportsand multicast packets before
    they reach the IGMP/MLD processing layeror multicast routing stack of the router.
    MCOP is independent ofmulticast routing protocols.</p>"
