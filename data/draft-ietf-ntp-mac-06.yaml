abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Time Protocol (NTP), as described in RFC 5905, states that
    NTP packets should be authenticated by appending NTP data to a 128-bit key and
    hashing the result with MD5 to obtain a 128-bit tag. This document deprecates
    MD5-based authentication, which is considered too weak, and recommends the use
    of AES-CMAC as described in RFC 4493 as a replacement.</p>"
