abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies protocol interfaces profiled by the US NSA
    (United States National Security Agency) for NSS (National Security System) servers
    that provide public key certificates, CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists), and
    symmetric keys to NSS clients. Servers that support these interfaces are referred
    to as SODP (Secure Object Delivery Protocol) servers. The intended audience for
    this profile comprises developers of client devices that will obtain key management
    services from NSA-operated SODP servers. Interfaces supported by SODP servers
    include: EST (Enrollment over Secure Transport) and its extensions as well as
    CMC (Certificate Management over CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax)). This profile
    applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of
    US National Security Systems (SP 800- 59). It is also appropriate for other US
    Government systems that process high-value information. It is made publicly available
    for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.</p>"
