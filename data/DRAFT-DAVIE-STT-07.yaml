abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Virtualization places unique requirements on tunneling\n
    \  protocols.  This draft describes STT (Stateless Transport Tunneling),\n   a
    tunnel encapsulation that enables overlay networks to be built in\n   virtualized
    networks.  STT is particularly useful when some tunnel\n   endpoints are in end-systems,
    as it utilizes the capabilities of the\n   network interface card to improve performance.
    \ This draft documents\n   the protocol and the rationale for its design, and
    highlights issues\n   that may arise in deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
