abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Although the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) needs no special\nmechanism
    to enable network services and applications, in complex\narchitectures, feature
    composition and service invocation become\nunmanageable without a mechanism for
    specifying the services that are\nassociated with routes. This draft introduces
    distributed application\narchitectures that span multiple administrative domains
    and proposes\nthe use of ServiceCodes in SIP to allow service providers to compose\nchains
    of features across application servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
