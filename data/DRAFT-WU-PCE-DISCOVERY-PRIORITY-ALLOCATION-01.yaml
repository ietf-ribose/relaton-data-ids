abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RFC5088][RFC5089] define a method to advertise path computation\n
    \  capabilities using IGP flooding.  OSPF and ISIS are extended to\n   support
    such capabilities advertisement.  However\n   [RFC5088][RFC5089]don't provide
    a method to advertise PCEP over TLS\n   support capability.\n\n   This document
    proposes new capability flag bit for PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-\n   TLV that can be announced
    as attribute in the IGP advertisement\n   (defined in [RFC5088 ][RFC5089]) to
    distribute transport support\n   information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
