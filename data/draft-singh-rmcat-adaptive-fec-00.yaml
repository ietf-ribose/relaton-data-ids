abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new mechanism for conversational multimedia
    flows. The proposed mechanism uses Forward Error Correction (FEC) encoded RTP
    packets (redundant packets) along side the media packets to probe for available
    network capacity. A straightforward interpretation is, the sending endpoint increases
    the transmission rate by keeping the media rate constant but increases the amount
    of FEC. If no losses and discards occur, the endpoint can then increase the media
    rate. If losses occur, the redundant FEC packets help in recovering the lost packets.
    Consequently, the endpoint can vary the FEC bit rate to conservatively (by a small
    amount) or aggressively (by a large amount) probe for available network capacity.</p>"
