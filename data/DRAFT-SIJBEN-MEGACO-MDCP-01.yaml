abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a protocol for use between media devices
    and\n   their controllers.  The scope of such media devices includes voice,\n
    \  video and data applications.  This work started with the\n   decomposition
    of gateways into functional elements, viz. media\n   gateway controller, media
    gateway and signaling gateway.  A protocol\n   is needed to allow media gateway
    controllers and media gateways to\n   communicate.  Since then the scope has been
    broadened to the control\n   of media devices that do not have a gateway function,
    such as IVR\n   systems, multipoint processors, etc.\n   A model is introduced
    to describe the functionality of media devices\n   and the various operations
    on that model are described.\n\t </p>\n      "
