abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component
    capable\n   of selecting the paths through a traffic engineered network.  These\n
    \  paths may be supplied in response to requests for computation, or may\n   be
    unsolicited instructions issued by the PCE to network elements.\n   Both approaches
    use the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) to convey\n   the details of the computed
    path.\n\n   Traffic flows may be categorized and described using \"Flow\n   Specifications\".
    \ RFC 5575 defines the Flow Specification and\n   describes how it may be distributed
    in BGP to allow specific traffic\n   flows to be associated with routes.\n\n   This
    document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support\n   dissemination of
    Flow Specifications.  This allows a PCE to indicate\n   what traffic should be
    placed on each path that it is aware of.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
