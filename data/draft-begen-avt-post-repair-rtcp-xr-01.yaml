abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines a new report block type within the framework
    ofRTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XR). One of theinitial XR report
    block types is the Loss Run Length Encoding (RLE)Report Block. This report conveys
    the information regarding theindividual Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet
    receipt and lossevents experienced during the RTCP interval preceding thetransmission
    of the report. The new report, which is referred to asthe Post-repair Loss RLE
    Report, carries the information regardingthe remaining lost packets after all
    error-repair techniques areapplied. By comparing the RTP packet receipts/losses
    before andafter the error repair is completed, one can determine theeffectiveness
    of the error-repair techniques in an aggregatedfashion. This document also defines
    the signaling of the Post-repairLoss RLE Report in the Session Description Protocol
