abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft gives a summary of findings about routing optimization
    ofnot-via addresses [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-notvia-addresses] and LFAs[RFC5286]
    in IP networks. The optimization is done only by tuning IPlink costs. Optimization
    goals for both IP FRR techniques is themaximum link utilization in the failure-free
    scenario and for a setof failure scenarios such as all single link (and node)
    failures aswell as the failure coverage by LFAs. For LFAs, the failure coverageis
    another optimization goal.</p>"
