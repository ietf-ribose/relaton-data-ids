abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) transport paths can be statically
    provisioned via a Network Management System (NMS) or dynamically provisioned via
    a control plane. The transport paths provided by MPLS-TP are used as a server
    layer for pseudowires carrying client signals other than IP or MPLS. It may be
    necessary to support MPLS-TP pseudowires, to extend across multiple domains. This
    document outlines the requirements and solution for coordinating MPLS-TP transport
    paths and a multi-segment PWs that will traverse multiple domains, where some
    domains are statically provisioned, and other domains that are dynamically provisioned.
    This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) /
    International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector
    (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire
    Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</p>"
