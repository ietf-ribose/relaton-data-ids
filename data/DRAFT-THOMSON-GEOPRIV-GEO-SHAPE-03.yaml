abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a set of shapes for the representation
    of\n   uncertainty for PIDF-LO geodetic location information.  This includes\n
    \  a GML profile and a schema that defines additional geometries.\n   Further
    recommendations are made to restrict the use of geographic\n   Coordinate Reference
    Systems (CRS) and units of measure restrictions\n   that improve interoperability.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
