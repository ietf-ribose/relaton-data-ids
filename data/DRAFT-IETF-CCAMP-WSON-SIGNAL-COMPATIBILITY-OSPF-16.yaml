abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching\n
    \  (GMPLS) Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing enhancements to\n   support
    signal compatibility constraints associated with Wavelength-\n   Switched Optical
    network (WSON) elements. These routing enhancements\n   are applicable in common
    optical or hybrid electro-optical networks\n   where not all of the optical signals
    in the network are compatible\n   with all network elements participating in the
    network.\n\n   This compatibility constraint model is applicable to common optical\n
    \  or hybrid electro optical systems such as Optical-Electronic-Optical\n   (OEO)
    switches, regenerators, and wavelength converters since such\n   systems can be
    limited to processing only certain types of WSON\n   signals.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
