abstract:
  content: "<p>TCP and other transport-layer protocols are vulnerable to spoofingattacks
    from off-path hosts. These attacks can be prevented throughthe use of cryptographic
    authentication. However, it is difficult touse cryptographic authentication in
    all circumstances. A variety ofobfuscation techniques -- such as initial sequence
    numberrandomization and source port randomization -- increase the effortrequired
    of an attacker to successfully guess the packet headerfields which uniquely identify
    a transport connection. This memoproposes the use of the IPv6 Flow Label field
    as a random, per-connection nonce value, to add entropy to the set of packet headerfields
    used to identify a transport connection. This mechanism iseasily implementable,
    allows for incremental deployment, and is fullycompliant with the rules for Flow
    Label use defined in RFC 3697.</p>"
