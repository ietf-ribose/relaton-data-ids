abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   From time to time, networking protocols need to be able to
    name\n   things used within the protocol, and resolve the names created or\n   referenced.
    \ It's common for protocol designers in this predicament\n   to attempt to use
    domain names as the starting point for their\n   systems of names, and the DNS
    as the starting point for name\n   resolution.\n\n   This is completely understandable--
    domain names, and DNS resolution,\n   are well-established in both the expectations
    of network users and\n   developers, and well-supported by fielded software.  It
    also has\n   significant limitations.\n\n   This document deals principally with
    the questions a protocol\n   designer or software developer should ask themselves
    about what\n   behavior they want from the names they use in the context of a
    new\n   protocol or scope for names.  Depending to the answers to these\n   questions,
    the answer may be that domain names will not meet the\n   constraints at hand.
    \ Future versions of this draft will provide some\n   comments on alternatives.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
