abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines the Security Event Token (SET) data\n
    \  structure.  A SET describes statements of fact from the perspective\n   of
    an issuer about a subject.  These statements of fact represent an\n   event that
    occurred directly to or about a security subject, for\n   example, a statement
    about the issuance or revocation of a token on\n   behalf of a subject.  This
    specification is intended to enable\n   representing security- and identity-related
    events.  A SET is a JSON\n   Web Token (JWT), which can be optionally signed and/or
    encrypted.\n   SETs can be distributed via protocols such as HTTP.\n\n\t </p>\n
