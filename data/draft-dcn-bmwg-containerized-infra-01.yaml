abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes benchmarking considerations for the containerized
    infrastructure. In the containerized infrastructure, Virtualized Network Functions(VNFs)
    are deployed on operating-system- level virtualization platform by abstracting
    the user namespace as opposed to virtualization using a hypervisor. Leveraging
    this, the system configurations and networking scenarios for benchmarking will
    be partially changed by the way in which the resource allocation and network technologies
    speicifed for containerized VNFs. In this draft we compare the state of the art
    in a container networking architecture with networking on VM-based virtualized
    systems, and provide several test scenarios in the containerized infrastructure.</p>"
