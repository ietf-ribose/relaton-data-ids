abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document outlines a set of recommendations and guidelines
    for\n   how networking software should be designed to enable the development,\n
    \  testing, and deployment of new protocols and protocol features.  The\n   focus
    is primarily on the API contract that a client-side networking\n   library should
    present to applications using networking features, and\n   how that library can
    be architected to maximize flexibility and\n   longevity.\n\n   Specific areas
    of protocol development that should be enabled\n   include:\n\n   o  Making security
    and privacy easy to use\n\n   o  Reducing latency with 0-RTT protocols\n\n   o
    \ Allowing wider use of multi-stream protocols\n\n   o  Providing a simple interface
    for multi-path protocols\n\n\t </p>\n      "
