abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE)
    Link Format Interface Descriptions [RFC6690] applicable for use in constrained
    environments. These include the: Actuator, Parameter, Read-only parameter, Sensor,
    Batch, Linked Batch and Link List interfaces. The Batch, Linked Batch and Link
    List interfaces make use of resource collections. This document further describes
    how collections relate to interfaces. Many applications require a set of interface
    descriptions in order provide the required functionality. This document defines
    an Interface Description attribute value to describe resources conforming to a
    particular interface. Editor's notes: o The git repository for the draft is found
    at https://github.com/</p>"
