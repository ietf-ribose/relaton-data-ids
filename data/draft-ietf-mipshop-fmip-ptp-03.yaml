abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers specification currently does not explicitly
    define prefix management over point-to-point links when a mobile node uses a prefix
    to formulate a new care-of-address. In this document a mechanism is developed
    for a previous access router to request unique prefixes from a new access router,
    and in turn, the previous access router advertises the prefixes to the mobile
    node for a new care-of-address configuration. Extensions to Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers
    specification are also specified in this document.</p>"
