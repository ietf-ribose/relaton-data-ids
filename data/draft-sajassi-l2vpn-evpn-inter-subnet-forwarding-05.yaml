abstract:
- content: "<p>EVPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
    for intra-subnet connectivity among hosts/VMs over an MPLS/IP network. However,
    there are scenarios in which inter-subnet forwarding among hosts/VMs across different
    IP subnets is required, while maintaining the multi-homing capabilities of EVPN.
    This document describes an Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) solution based
    on EVPN to address such requirements.</p>"
