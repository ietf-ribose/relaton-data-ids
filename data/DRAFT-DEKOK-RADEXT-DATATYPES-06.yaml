abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RADIUS specifications have used data types for two decades
    without\n   defining them as managed entities.  During this time, RADIUS\n   implementations
    have named the data types, and have used them in\n   attribute definitions.  This
    document updates the specifications to\n   better follow established practice.
    \ We do this by naming the data\n   types defined in RFC 6158, which have been
    used since at least RFC\n   2865.  We provide an IANA registry for the data types,
    and update the\n   RADIUS Attribute Type registry to include a \"Data Type\" field
    for\n   each attribute.  Finally, we recommend that authors of RADIUS\n   specifications
    use these types in preference to existing practice.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
