abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document outlines some of the fundamental requirements and
    issues \nrelated to the control and maintenance of quality of service (QoS) in
    an \nOpen Base Station Transport (OBAST) architecture.  It begins with a \nreview
    of a baseline OBAST architecture, highlighting those elements \nthat are particularly
    relevant to QoS provisioning, then discusses the \nrequirements for QoS within
    this framework.  In particular, the \nrequirements for control and maintenance
    of QoS during mobility \nhandoffs, and for support of adaptive applications, is
    addressed.\n\t </p>\n      "
