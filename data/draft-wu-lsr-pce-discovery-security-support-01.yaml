abstract:
- content: "<p>When a Path Computation Element (PCE) is a Label Switching Router (LSR)
    participating in the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a server participating
    in IGP, its presence and path computation capabilities can be advertised using
    IGP flooding. The IGP extensions for PCE discovery (RFC 5088 and RFC 5089) define
    a method to advertise path computation capabilities using IGP flooding for OSPF
    and IS-IS respectively. However these specifications lack a method to advertise
    PCEP security (e.g., Transport Layer Security(TLS), TCP Authentication Option
    (TCP-AO)) support capability. This document proposes new capability flag bits
    for PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV that can be announced as attribute in the IGP advertisement
    to distribute PCEP security support information. In addition, this document updates
    RFC 5088 and RFC 5089 to allow advertisement of Key ID or Key Chain Name Sub-TLV
    to support TCP AO security capability.</p>"
