abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes some practical usages of address selection
    policy distribution mechanism defined in another document. Address selection policies
    are originated by ISPs or by network administrators and are delivered to each
    end host. These policies are stored at end hosts in the form of default address
    selection policy table. This mechanism enables central control of address selection
    policy at end hosts, so it is essential or helpful in many cases, such as IPv4
    and IPv6 dual-stack environment and ULA and Global address parallel-use environment.</p>"
