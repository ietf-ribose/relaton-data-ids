abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) can in general be defined
    as a new\n   approach for network programmability.  Network programmability refers\n
    \  to the capacity to initialize, control, change, and manage network\n   behavior
    dynamically via open interfaces as opposed to relying on\n   closed-box solutions
    and propietary-defined interfaces.  SDN\n   emphasizes the role of software in
    running networks through the\n   introduction of an abstraction for the data forwarding
    plane and, by\n   doing so, separates it from the control plane.  This separation\n
    \  allows faster innovation cycles at both planes as experience has\n   already
    shown.  However, there is increasing confusion as to what\n   exactly SDN is,
    what is the layer structure in an SDN architecture\n   and how do layers interface
    with each other.  This document aims to\n   answer these questions and provide
    a concise reference document for\n   SDNRG, in particular, and the SDN community,
    in general, based on\n   relevant peer-reviewed literature and documents in the
    RFC series.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
