abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some networks deploy firewalls configured to block UDP traffic.
    \ When\n   SIP user agents or WebRTC endpoints are deployed behind such\n   firewalls,
    media cannot be sent over UDP across the firewall, but\n   must be sent using
    TCP (which causes a different user experience) or\n   through a session border
    controller.\n\n   This draft describes an alternate model wherein extensions to
    ICE\n   connectivity checks can be examined by the firewall to permit\n   outgoing
    UDP flows across the firewall.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
