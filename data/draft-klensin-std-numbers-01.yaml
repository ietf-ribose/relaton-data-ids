abstract:
  content: "\t <t>STD numbers are assigned to IETF Standards Track specifications
    inorder to provide a stable reference even when RFCs are revised andthe underlying
    documents change. However, the numbers are onlyassigned when the specifications
    reach Full Standard maturity level,significantly reducing their utility in the
    contemporary world inwhich few specifications advance beyond the first standardizationmaturity
    level. For that reason, one recent proposal suggestedeliminating the numbers entirely.
    This document argues that stablereferences for Standards Track specifications
    are actually useful andthat the solution is not to abolish the numbers but to
    change thepoint at which they are assigned.</p>"
