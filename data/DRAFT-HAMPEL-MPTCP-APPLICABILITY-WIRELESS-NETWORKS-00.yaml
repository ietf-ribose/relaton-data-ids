abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document analyses the applicability of Multipath TCP to
    wireless\n   access networks with overlapping coverage area, and it discusses\n
    \  potential protocol extensions that aim to improve operation in such\n   environments.
    \ The analysis attempts to identify use cases, benefits\n   as well as technical
    and functional obstacles encountered in the\n   current version of the protocol.
    \ Based on this analysis,\n   recommendations are made on feature-, signaling-
    and policy\n   extensions that promise to enhance Multipath-TCP's value, versatility\n
    \  and market acceptance in wireless access networks.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
