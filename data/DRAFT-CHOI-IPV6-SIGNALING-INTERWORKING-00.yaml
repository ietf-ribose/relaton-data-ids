abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this draft, we describe the features and requirements of QoS
    \nsignaling in IPv6 network to explain the needs of end-to-end QoS \nsignaling.
    We discuss the signaling interworking between IPv6 network \nand other network.
    The delivering methods of signaling messages in \nIPv6 network are also presented
    in Appendix. \n   \n\t </p>\n      "
