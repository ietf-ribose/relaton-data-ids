abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the structure of the control messages
    that\n   were historically used with the Network Time Protocol before the\n   advent
    of more modern control and management approaches.  These\n   control messages
    have been used to monitor and control the Network\n   Time Protocol application
    running on any IP network attached\n   computer.  The information in this document
    was originally described\n   in Appendix B of RFC 1305.  The goal of this document
    is to provide\n   an updated description of the control messages described in
    RFC 1305\n   in order to conform with the updated Network Time Protocol\n   specification
    documented in RFC 5905.\n\n   The publication of this document is not meant to
    encourage the\n   development and deployment of these control messages.  This
    document\n   is only providing a current reference for these control messages\n
    \  given the current status of RFC 1305.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
