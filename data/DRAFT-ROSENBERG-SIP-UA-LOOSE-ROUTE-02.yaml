abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A key part of the behavior of the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP)\nis that SIP proxies rewrite the Request-URI as a request moves\nthroughout
    the network.  Over the years, experience has shown this to\nbe problematic.  It
    makes it difficult to use Request URI for service\ninvocation, complicates emergency
    services, makes it more complex to\nsupport aliases, and so on.  Architecturally,
    it confounds the\nconcepts of address and route.  This document proposes to change
    this\nthrough a new mechanism called UA loose routing.\n\t </p>\n      "
