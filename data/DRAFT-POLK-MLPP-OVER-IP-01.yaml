abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The intent of this document is to introduce an Architecture for
    Multi-\nLevel Precedence and Preemption (MLPP) into the IP realm. MLPP was \noriginally
    written to create 'a prioritized call handling service' [1] \nin  combination
    with ISDN supplementary services. MLPP has two very \nsimple concepts for voice
    (Real-Time) communications: \nA) setting or marking every session at inception
    with a \nPrecedence level relative to others within a known network \ndomain;
    and \nB) the end-stations or internetworking devices preempting \nlower relative
    priority sessions in order for higher \nrelative level sessions to pass or occur
    during times of \ncongestion at any point in that known, managed domain, \nincluding
    to the end-station (phone).\n\t </p>\n      "
