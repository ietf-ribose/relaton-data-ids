abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   LTE, 4G mobile networks use IP transport which is not optimized
    for\n   data transport. IP unicast routing from server to clients is used for\n
    \  delivery of multimedia content to User Equipment (UE), where each\n   user
    gets separate stream. From bandwidth and routing perspective\n   this approach
    is inefficient. Multicast and broadcast technologies\n   have emerged recently
    for mobile networks, but their deployments are\n   very limited or at an experimental
    stage due to complex architecture\n   and radio spectrum issues. ICN is a rapidly
    emerging technology with\n   built in features for efficient multimedia data delivery,
    however\n   majority of the work is focused on fixed networks. The main focus
    of\n   this draft is on native deployment of ICN in cellular mobile networks\n
    \  by using ICN into 3GPP protocol stack. ICN has an inherent capability\n   for
    multicast, anchorless mobility, security and it is optimized for\n   data delivery
    using local caching at the edge. The native ICN or dual\n   stack (along with
    IP) deployment will bring all inherent benefits and\n   help in optimizing mobile
    networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
