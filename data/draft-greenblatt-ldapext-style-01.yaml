abstract:
- content: "<p>Version 3 of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) as defined
    in [1] provides a base set of services. Additionally, LDAP provides several mechanisms
    by which the base set of services may be enhanced to provide additional services.
    This document describes the different ways that LDAP may be enhanced, and how
    developers can decide which enhancement mechanism is best suited for their environment.
    It also discusses the positives and negatives for each LDAP enhancement mechanism</p>"
