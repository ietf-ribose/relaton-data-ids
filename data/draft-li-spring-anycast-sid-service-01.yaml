abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing enables an operator or an application to specify a packet
    processing program. When Segment Routing is applied to IPv6 data plane, the list
    of IPv6 SIDs in SRH can specify a series of execution endpoints that hold service
    functions that process the packet. However, steering traffic dynamically to the
    different execution endpoints requires a specific "re-encapsulating". This procedure
    may be complex and take time. This document proposes A-SID (Anycast-SID) based
    on SRv6 to achieve flexible and robust service provision. It uses anycast SID
    to identify service functions and locates the service functions based on anycast
    routing. The proposed solution can stay compatibility with the existing SRv6.</p>
