abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the term "Public Suffix domain" as meaning a domain
    under which multiple parties that are unaffiliated with the owner of the Public
    Suffix domain may register subdomains. Examples of Public Suffix domains include
    "org", "co.uk", "k12.wa.us" and "uk.com". It also defines a file format that can
    be used to distribute information about such Public Suffix domains to relying
    parties. As an example, this information is then used to limit which domains an
    Internet service can set HTTP cookies for, strengthening the rules already defined
    by the cookie specification. This specification updates RFC 6265 [RFC6265] by
    defining the term "Public Suffix domain".</p>
