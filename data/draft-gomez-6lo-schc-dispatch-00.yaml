abstract:
- content: "<p>A new framework called Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) has
    been designed to support IPv6 over Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies
    [RFC8724]. One of the SCHC components is a header compression mechanism. If used
    properly, SCHC header compression allows a greater compression ratio than that
    achievable with traditional 6LoWPAN header compression [RFC6282]. For this reason,
    it may make sense to use SCHC header compression in some 6LoWPAN environments.
    In its current form, this document proposes a number of 6LoWPAN Dispatch type
    approaches to signal when a packet header has been compressed by using SCHC header
    compression.</p>"
