abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes technical mechanisms employed in network censorship
    that regimes around the world use for blocking or impairing Internet traffic.
    It aims to make designers, implementers, and users of Internet protocols aware
    of the properties exploited and mechanisms used for censoring end-user access
    to information. This document makes no suggestions on individual protocol considerations,
    and is purely informational, intended as a reference.</p>"
