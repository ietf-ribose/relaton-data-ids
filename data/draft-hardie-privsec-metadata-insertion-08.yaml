abstract:
- content: "<p>The IAB published RFC 7624 in response to several revelations of pervasive
    attacks on Internet communications. This document considers the implications of
    protocol designs that associate metadata with encrypted flows. In particular,
    it asserts that designs that share metadata only by explicit actions at the host
    are preferable to designs in which middleboxes insert metadata.</p>"
