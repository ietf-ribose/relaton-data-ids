abstract:
- content: "<p>The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
    is designed to make managing user identity in cloud based applications and services
    easier. The specification suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas
    and deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration,
    while applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. It's
    intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing
    a common user schema and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide
    patterns for exchanging this schema using standard protocols. In essence, make
    it fast, cheap, and easy to move users in to, out of, and around the cloud.</p>"
