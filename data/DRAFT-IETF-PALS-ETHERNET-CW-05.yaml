abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The pseudowire (PW) encapsulation of Ethernet, as defined in
    RFC\n   4448, specifies that the use of the control word (CW) is optional.\n   In
    the absence of the CW an Ethernet pseudowire packet can be\n   misidentified as
    an IP packet by a label switching router (LSR).\n   This in turn may lead to the
    selection of the wrong equal-cost-multi-\n   path (ECMP) path for the packet,
    leading in turn to the misordering\n   of packets.  This problem has become more
    serious due to the\n   deployment of equipment with Ethernet MAC addresses that
    start with\n   0x4 or 0x6.  The use of the Ethernet PW CW addresses this problem.\n
    \  This document recommends the use of the Ethernet pseudowire control\n   word
    in all but exceptional circumstances.\n\n   This document updates RFC 4448.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
