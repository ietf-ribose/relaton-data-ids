abstract:
  content: "<p>Add-Paths is a BGP enhancement that allows a BGP router to advertisemultiple
    distinct paths for the same prefix/NLRI. This provides anumber of potential benefits,
    including reduced routing churn, fasterconvergence and better loadsharing.This
    document provides recommendations to implementers of Add-Pathsso that network
    operators have the tools needed to address theirspecific applications and to manage
    the scalability impact of Add-Paths. A router implementing Add-Paths may learn
    many paths for aprefix and must decide which of these to advertise to peers. Thisdocument
    analyses different algorithms for making this selection andprovides recommendations
    based on the target application.</p>"
