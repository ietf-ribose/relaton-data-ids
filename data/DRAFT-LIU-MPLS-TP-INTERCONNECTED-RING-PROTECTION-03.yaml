abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The requirements for MPLS Transport Profile include a requirement\n
    \  (R93) that requires that MPLS-TP must support recovery mechanisms for\n   a
    network constructed from interconnected rings that protect user\n   data that
    traverses more than one ring.  In particular, this includes\n   protecting against
    cases of failure at the ring interconnect nodes\n   and links.  This document
    presents different configurations of\n   interconnected rings and special mechanisms
    to address the recovery\n   of ring-interconnect nodes and links. .\n\n   This
    document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task\n   Force(IETF) / International
    Telecommunications Union\n   Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T)
    effort to include\n   an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3
    architectures\n   to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet
    transport\n   network as defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
