abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In any BGP based MPLS network such as MPLS VPN [RFC4364], an
    ingress \n   PE router would continue to attract traffic from the CE router by
    \n   advertising the prefix reachability, even though the Label Switched \n   Path
    (LSP) from the ingress PE router to the egress PE router may be \n   broken. This
    causes the VPN traffic to be dropped inside the MPLS VPN \n   network.  \n\n   This
    document proposes a framework to make BGP consider the MPLS path \n   availability
    to the \"NEXT_HOP\" (i.e. egress PE router) during the BGP \n   bestpath candidate
    selection process. This document also defines a \n   local database for storing
    the MPLS path health information for one \n   or more IP prefixes and its interaction
    with BGP. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
