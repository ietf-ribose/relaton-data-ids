abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Trust routers form an integral part of the ABFAB infrastructure
    fordetermining routes between IdPs and RPs and determining CoI membership.Since
    it is inherent in their name that they are to be trusted, thisInternet Draft specifies
    a trust model for their operation, so that IdPsand RPs can rely on them to perform
    the tasks that they are trusted toperform. These tasks are:-\tform a trusted route
    between an IdP and RP-\tensure that a community of interest (CoI)only has the
    members that itshould have</p>"
