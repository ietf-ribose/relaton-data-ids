abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       The Presence Protocol is designed to maintain presence\n
    \      information about a potentially large number of online users\n       connected
    through various Points of Presence (PoPs), and\n       belonging to several Federations
    (which are collections of\n       uniformly administered entities).  The Presence
    Protocol\n       meets several of the requirements for a Presence Information\n
    \      Protocol [PIP-Req] in a simple, direct fashion. (Issues\n       around
    security of messages are deliberately excluded from\n       this draft.)\n \n
    \      The Presence Protocol is related to the [PIP-Demo] protocol.\n       It
    differs from it in introducing a notion of Points of\n       Presence, mediating
    between the Presence Server and user\n       agents (clients) and specifys a mechanism
    for a user to\n       control the dissemination of their own presence information.\n
    \      It is substantially simpler, doing away with leases (in\n       favor of
    pings), eliminating redirections, and eliminating\n       the dependence on an
    HTTP-style transport protocol. Further,\n       it leaves for a separate protocol,
    the Messaging Protocol,\n       the task of defining how Instant Messages should
    be\n       communicated between points of presence.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
