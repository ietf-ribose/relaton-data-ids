abstract:
  content: "\t <t>When users are at known undergroudn locations, such as tube stationsthey
    often do not have a GPS signal, as the radio waves from thesatellites required
    cannot penetrate the earth, this draft suggestsproviding GPS locations over WiFI
    using remote IP detection for aserver to respond with the correct name of clients
    location andthe clients GPS location.Extending this to those without WifI access
    the standard goes onestage further, by offering a hidden wifi network with a standard
    name,such as .location. The principle being that mobile devices canlook for this
    network in cases where GPS data cannot be collected. Itis hoped that this will
    allow those using mapping services to knowwhere they are when travelling on underground
    trains etc.</p>"
