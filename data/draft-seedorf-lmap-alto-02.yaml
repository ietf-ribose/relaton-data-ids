abstract:
- content: "<p>In the context of Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance
    (LMAP), measurement results are currently made available to the public either
    at the finest granularity level (e.g. as a list of results of all individual tests),
    or in a very high level human- readable format (e.g. as PDF reports). This document
    argues that there is a need for an intermediate way to provide access to large-
    scale network measurement results, flexible enough to enable querying of specific
    and possibly aggregated data. The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
    Protocol, defined with the goal to provide applications with network information,
    seems a good candidate to fulfill such a role. Finally, we describe our methodology
    for analyzing the United States Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) Measuring
    Broadband America (MBA) dataset to derive required topology and cost maps suitable
    for consumption by an ALTO server.</p>"
