abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data centers have become critical components of the infrastructure\n
    \  used by network operators to provide services to their customers.\n   Data
    centers are attached to the Internet or a backbone network by\n   gateway routers
    and one data center typically has more than one\n   gateway for commercial, load
    balancing, and resiliency reasons.\n\n   Segment routing is a popular protocol
    mechanism for operating within\n   a data center, but also for steering traffic
    that flows between two\n   data center sites.  In order that one data center site
    may load\n   balance the traffic it sends to another data center site it needs
    to\n   know the complete set of gateway routers at the remote data center,\n   the
    points of connection from those gateways to the backbone network,\n   and the
    connectivity across the backbone network.\n\n   This document defines a mechanism
    using the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation\n   attribute to allow each gateway router
    to advertise the routes to the\n   prefixes in the data center site to which it
    provides access, and\n   also to advertise on behalf of each other gateway to
    the same data\n   center site.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
