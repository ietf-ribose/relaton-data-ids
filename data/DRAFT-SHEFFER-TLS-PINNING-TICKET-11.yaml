abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Misissued public-key certificates can prevent TLS clients from\n
    \  appropriately authenticating the TLS server.  Several alternatives\n   have
    been proposed to detect this situation and prevent a client from\n   establishing
    a TLS session with a TLS end point authenticated with an\n   illegitimate public-key
    certificate.  These mechanisms are either not\n   widely deployed or limited to
    public web browsing.\n\n   This document proposes experimental extensions to TLS
    with opaque\n   pinning tickets as a way to pin the server's identity.  During
    an\n   initial TLS session, the server provides an original encrypted\n   pinning
    ticket.  In subsequent TLS session establishment, upon\n   receipt of the pinning
    ticket, the server proves its ability to\n   decrypt the pinning ticket and thus
    the ownership of the pinning\n   protection key.  The client can now safely conclude
    that the TLS\n   session is established with the same TLS server as the original
    TLS\n   session.  One of the important properties of this proposal is that no\n
    \  manual management actions are required.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
