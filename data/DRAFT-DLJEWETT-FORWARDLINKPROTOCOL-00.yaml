  content: "\n\t <p>   *Short* Description:\n   This Protocol automates creation and
    storage of Internet Links and\n   BackLinks, together with enhanced MetaData,
    by individual,\n   independent WebSites.   The MetaData is displayed to Readers
    in\n   SortableTables.  The information in the SortableTables will be used\n   by
    Readers to decide whether to follow Links and BackLinks that they\n   encounter
    in using the Web, and will speed development of Knowledge\n   based upon Web-
    Information.  The Categories in the Tables are guided\n   by the interests of
    the Readers, and differ between WebSites hosting\n   different topics.\n\n   The
    Protocol is designed to be implemented on individual WebSites; it\n   does not
    require a centralized server nor top-down supervision.\n\n   *Longer* Description:\n
    \  The FL-P (ForwardLink-Protocol) provides new communication\n   conventions
    by which two WebSites exchange information and MetaData\n   to provide easy and
    useful means for Article-Readers to decide\n   whether to follow a Link from one
    Article to the another.  A\n   *RetroLink* takes the Reader to a citED Older-Text,
    from a citING\n   Newer-Text.  A *ForwardLink* takes the Reader to the citING
    Newer-\n   Text, from a citED Older-Text.\n\n      (NOTE: The words \"Older\"
    and \"Newer\" apply to the *Text*, *not* to\n      the *Article* or *WebSite*.
    \ The adjectives \"Forward\" and \"Retro\"\n      refer to the point-of-view of
    the Reader *when reading* the text\n      that contains the Link.  The necessity
    for this new terminology is\n      explained in the body of the proposal.)\n\n
    \  Text-specific and Article-specific MetaData are presented to the\n   Reader
    in SortableTables whose organization is determined by the\n   Reader.  The Reader's
    choices in data-categories and sorting are\n   saved in Cookies on the Reader's
    Computer.  These features aid the\n   Reader in organizing the information of
    the SortableTables so as to\n   decide whether to follow a displayed Link or not.
    \ These features\n   increase the Reader's efficiency in searching for information
    on the\n   Web.\n\n   ForwardLinks will significantly increase the utility of
    the Web for\n   scholars, thus enhancing Knowledge creation based upon Web-\n
    \  Information.  Additionally, ForwardLinks will *increase the value* of\n   open-access,
    online archives (of both Publishers and Libraries).\n   Such archives, will, over
    time, collect increasing numbers of\n   valuable ForwardLinks that point to newer
    developments in a field,\n   which is critical information for further progress.\n\n
    \  ForwardLinks are based upon \"human judgments of importance\".  For\n   example,
    ForwardLinks may well occur between two Articles that do\n   *not* share *any*
    duplicate words or phrases.  Such Linkages *cannot\n   be discovered* with *present
    WebSearch techniques*.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
