abstract:
- content: "<p>SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism framework
    that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols and attributes. This
    framework has been extended with a media capabilities negotiation mechanism that
    allows endpoints to negotiate additional media-related capabilities. This negotiation
    is embedded into the widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures. This memo extends
    the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow endpoints to negotiate three
    additional SDP capabilities. In particular, this memo provides a mechanism to
    negotiate bandwidth ('b=' line), connection data ('c=' line), and titles ('i='
    line for each session or media).</p>"
