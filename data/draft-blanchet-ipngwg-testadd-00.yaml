abstract:
  content: "<p>To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion, an IPv6 prefixis
    reserved for use in private testing or as examples in other RFCs,documentation,
    and the like. Since site local addresses have specialmeaning in IPv6, these cannot
    be used in many example situations andare confusing. Instead, an IPv6 prefix is
    reserved in the range ofthe test address space.</p>"
