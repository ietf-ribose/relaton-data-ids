abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a set of principles for designing protocols\n
    \  with rules for intermediaries.  The goal of these principles is to\n   limit
    the ways in which intermediaries can produce undesirable\n   effects and to protect
    the useful functions that intermediaries\n   legitimately provide.\n\n\t </p>\n
