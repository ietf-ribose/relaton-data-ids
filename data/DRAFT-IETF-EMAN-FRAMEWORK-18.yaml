abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       This document defines a framework for Energy Management
    for\n       devices and device components within or connected to\n       communication
    networks.  The framework presents a physical\n       reference model and information
    model. The information\n       model consists of an Energy Management Domain as
    a set of\n       Energy Objects. Each Energy Object can be attributed with\n       identity,
    classification, and context.  Energy Objects can\n       be monitored and controlled
    with respect to power, Power\n       State, energy, demand, Power Attributes,
    and battery.\n       Additionally the framework models relationships and\n       capabilities
    between Energy Objects.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
