abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the Internet and the telephone network have become increasingly\n
    \  interconnected and interdependent, attackers can impersonate or\n   obscure
    calling party numbers when orchestrating bulk commercial\n   calling schemes,
    hacking voicemail boxes or even circumventing multi-\n   factor authentication
    systems trusted by banks.  This document\n   analyzes threats in the resulting
    system, enumerating actors,\n   reviewing the capabilities available to and used
    by attackers, and\n   describing scenarios in which attacks are launched.\n\n\t
