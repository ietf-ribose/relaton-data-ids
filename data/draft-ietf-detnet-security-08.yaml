abstract:
- content: "<p>A deterministic network is one that can carry data flows for real-
    time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency. Deterministic
    networks have been successfully deployed in real-time operational technology (OT)
    applications for some years. However, such networks are typically isolated from
    external access, and thus the security threat from external attackers is low.
    IETF Deterministic Networking (DetNet) specifies a set of technologies that enable
    creation of deterministic networks on IP-based networks of potentially wide area
    (on the scale of a corporate network) potentially bringing the OT network into
    contact with Information Technology (IT) traffic and security threats that lie
    outside of a tightly controlled and bounded area (such as the internals of an
    aircraft). These DetNet technologies have not previously been deployed together
    on a wide area IP-based network, and thus can present security considerations
    that may be new to IP-based wide area network designers. This document, intended
    for use by DetNet network designers, provides insight into these security considerations.</p>"
