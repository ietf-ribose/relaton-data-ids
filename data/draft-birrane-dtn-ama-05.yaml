abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an asynchronous management architecture (AMA)
    suitable for providing application-level network management services in a challenged
    networking environment. Challenged networks are those that require fault protection,
    configuration, and performance reporting while unable to provide humans-in-the-loop
    with synchronous feedback or otherwise preserve transport-layer sessions. In such
    a context, networks must exhibit behavior that is both determinable and autonomous
    while maintaining compatibility with existing network management protocols and
    operational concepts.</p>"
