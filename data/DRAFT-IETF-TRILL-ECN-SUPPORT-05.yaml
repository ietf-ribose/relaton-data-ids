abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Explicit congestion notification (ECN) allows a forwarding
    element to\n   notify downstream devices, including the destination, of the onset
    of\n   congestion without having to drop packets. This can improve network\n   efficiency
    through better congestion control without packet drops.\n   This document extends
    ECN to TRILL switches, including integration\n   with IP ECN, and provides for
    ECN marking in the TRILL Header\n   Extension Flags Word (see RFC 7179).\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
