abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Many existing routers enable their data planes to keep forwardingdata
    packets during the restart of their control plains. Thisfunctionality is called
    \"graceful restart\" or \"non-stop forwarding\".A router supporting graceful restart
    is able to provide more reliablepacket forwarding service during system maintaining
    procedures andsoftware-error recoveries. This informational document analyzes
    theissues with enhancing VRRP to support graceful restart and introducesseveral
    candidate solutions.</p>"
