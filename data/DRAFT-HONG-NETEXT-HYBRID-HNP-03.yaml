abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) supports multihoming where a mobile
    node\ncan connect to a PMIPv6 domain through multiple interfaces for\nsimultaneous
    access or inter-technology handoff.  However, for an\ninter-technology handoff,
    PMIPv6 does not allow simultaneous access\nsince all the home network prefixes
    associated with one interface are\ndelivered to another interface of a mobile
    node.  In addition, if we\nassume that the flow is classified by home network
    prefix, then the\nPMIPv6 cannot support flow mobility since it requires moving
    just\nsome home network prefixes between interfaces.  In this document, we\npropose
    a hybrid home network prefix assignment (HHNPA) scheme where\nboth the static
    prefix model and the dynamic prefix model are used.\nBy using these two different
    home network prefix models, it can\nsupport flow mobility that some home network
    prefixes are moved to\nanother interface and some home network prefixes are remained
    at\nexisting interface.\n\t </p>\n      "
