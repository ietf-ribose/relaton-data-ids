abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) over
    HTTPS\n   transport binding and the corresponding 'ipps' URI scheme, that is\n
    \  used to designate the access to the network location of a secure IPP\n   print
    service or a network resource (for example, a print job)\n   managed by such a
    service.\n\n   This memo is an individual submission to the IETF by the Internet\n
    \  Printing Protocol Working Group of the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working\n   Group,
    as part of their PWG IPP Everywhere (PWG 5100.14) project for\n   secure mobile
    printing with vendor-neutral Client software.\n\n   This memo defines an alternate
    IPP transport binding to that defined\n   in the original IPP URL Scheme (RFC
    3510), but this memo does not\n   update or obsolete (RFC 3510).\n\n   This memo
    updates RFC 2910 and RFC 2911.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
