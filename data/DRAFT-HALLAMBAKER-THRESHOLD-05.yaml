abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Threshold cryptography operation modes are described with application\n
    \  to the Ed25519, Ed448, X25519 and X448 Elliptic Curves.  Threshold\n   key
    generation allows generation of keypairs to be divided between\n   two or more
    parties with verifiable security guaranties.  Threshold\n   decryption allows
    elliptic curve key agreement to be divided between\n   two or more parties such
    that all the parties must co-operate to\n   complete a private key agreement operation.
    \ The same primitives may\n   be applied to improve resistance to side channel
    attacks.  A\n   Threshold signature scheme is described in a separate document.\n\n
    \  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/cfrg/\n   (http://whatever)Discussion
    of this draft should take place on the\n   CFRG mailing list (cfrg@irtf.org),
    which is archived at .\n\n\t </p>\n      "
