abstract:
  content: "<p>This specification describes a new mobile network architecture which
    improves mobility management using Identifier Locator Addressing ILA) in IPv6
    for next generation mobile telecommunication networks such as 5G and Mobile Edge
    Clouds. Identifier-locator addressing differentiates between location and identity
    of a addressable network element, which can be a mobile device or a data center
    task. The approach presented in this draft enables mobility management on Layer
    3, and provides a simplified, GTP-tunnel-free and more efficient architecture
    with less core network utilization compared to traditional architecture.</p>"
