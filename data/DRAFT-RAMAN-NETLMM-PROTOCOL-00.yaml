abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document suggests a local mobility solution controlled by
    the \nnetwork within a local mobility domain. The proposed solution employs \na
    Proxy Mobile IPv6 client that generates a Proxy Binding Update \nmessage. Two
    variants of the solution are suggested depending on the \nrealization of the Proxy
    Mobile IP client function. The security \nassociation between the network elements
    for executing the local \nmobility is also discussed. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
