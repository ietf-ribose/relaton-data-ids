abstract:
  content: "<p>In order to provide interoperable implementations of certain SessionInitiation
    Protocol (SIP) based features, such as automated callhandling, it is necessary
    for devices to configure network serverswith feature data. An example is a call
    forwarding number for a callforwarding service. This document introduces the concept
    ofRepresentational State Transfer (REST) and gives an example of howREST can be
    used for such configuration.</p>"
