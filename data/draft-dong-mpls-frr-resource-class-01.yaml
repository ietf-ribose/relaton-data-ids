abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes simple and backward compatible extensions to
    Fast-Reroute (FRR) MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE). The purpose of these extensions
    include the following. These extensions provide a classification of SRLG to support
    LSP with differing protection requirements. These extensions allow highly reliable
    nodes or links, typically resources with redundancy at a lower layer, to be identified
    to allow LSP to optionally not consider these resources as potential points of
    failure.</p>"
