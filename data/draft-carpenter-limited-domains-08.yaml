abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a noticeable trend towards network requirements, behaviours
    and semantics that are specific to a limited region of the Internet and a particular
    set of requirements. Policies, default parameters, the options supported, the
    style of network management and security requirements may vary. This document
    reviews examples of such limited domains, also known as controlled environments,
    and emerging solutions, and includes a related taxonomy. It then briefly discusses
    the standardization of protocols for limited domains. Finally, it shows the needs
    for a precise definition of limited domain membership and for mechanisms to allow
    nodes to join a domain securely and to find other members, including boundary
    nodes.</p>"
