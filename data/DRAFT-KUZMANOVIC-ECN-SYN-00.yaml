abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft specifies a modification to RFC 3168 to allow TCP SYN/ACK\n
    \  packets to be ECN-Capable.  For TCP, RFC 3168 only specified setting\n   an
    ECN-Capable codepoint on data packets, and not on SYN and SYN/ACK\n   packets.
    \ However, because of the high cost to the TCP transfer of\n   having a SYN/ACK
    packet dropped, with the resulting retransmit\n   timeout, this document is specifying
    the use of ECN for the SYN/ACK\n   packet itself, when sent in response to a SYN
    packet with the two ECN\n   flags set in the TCP header, indicating a willingness
    to use ECN.\n   Setting TCP SYN/ACK packets as ECN-Capable can be of great benefit
    to\n   the TCP connection, avoiding the severe penalty of a retransmit\n   timeout
    for a connection that has not yet started placing a load on\n   the network.  The
    sender of the SYN/ACK packet must respond to an ECN\n   mark by reducing its initial
    congestion window from two, three, or\n   four segments to one segment, reducing
    the subsequent load from that\n   connection on the network.\n\t </p>\n      "
