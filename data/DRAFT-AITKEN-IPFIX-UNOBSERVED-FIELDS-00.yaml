abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        The IPFIX protocol is designed to export information about\n
    \       observations, and lacks a method for reporting that observations\n        are
    unavailable. This document discusses several methods for\n        reporting when
    fields are unavailable, reviews the advantages\n        and disadvantage of each,
    and recommends methods which should be\n        used.\n\n\n     \n\t </p>\n      "
