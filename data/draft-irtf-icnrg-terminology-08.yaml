abstract:
- content: "<p>Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a novel paradigm where network
    communications are accomplished by requesting named content instead of sending
    packets to destination addresses. Named Data Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric
    Networking (CCNx) are two prominent ICN architectures. This document provides
    an overview of the terminology and definitions that have been used in describing
    concepts in these two implementations of ICN. While there are other ICN architectures,
    they are not part of the NDN and CCNx concepts and as such are out of scope for
    this document. This document is a product of the Information-Centric Networking
    Research Group (ICNRG).</p>"
