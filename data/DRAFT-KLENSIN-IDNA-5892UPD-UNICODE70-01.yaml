abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current version of the IDNA specifications anticipated
    that each\n   new version of Unicode would be reviewed to verify that no changes\n
    \  had been introduced that required adjustments to the set of rules\n   and,
    in particular, whether new exceptions or backward compatibility\n   adjustments
    were needed.  That review was conducted for Unicode 7.0.0\n   and identified a
    potentially problematic new code point.  This\n   specification discusses that
    code point and associated issues and\n   updates RFC 5982 accordingly.  It also
    applies an editorial\n   clarification that was the subject of an earlier erratum.
    \ In\n   addition, the discussion of the specific issue updates RFC 5894.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
