abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Lower Effort
    (LE) per-hop behavior (PHB). The primary objective of this LE PHB is to protect
    best-effort (BE) traffic (packets forwarded with the default PHB) from LE traffic
    in congestion situations, i.e., when resources become scarce, best-effort traffic
    has precedence over LE traffic and may preempt it. There are numerous uses for
    this PHB, e.g., for background traffic of low precedence, such as bulk data transfers
    with low priority in time, non time-critical backups, larger software updates,
    web search engines while gathering information from web servers and so on.</p>"
