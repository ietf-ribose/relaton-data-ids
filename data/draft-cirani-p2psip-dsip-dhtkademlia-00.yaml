abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft describes a Kademlia-based protocol for Resource Lookup
    inP2PSIP. The proposed protocol is based on dSIP, a SIP-based protocolproposed
    by other authors as generic framework for a distributed SIPLocation Service. Although
    the dSIP authors have obsoleted the draftby a newer approach based on a binary
    protocol named RELOAD, we arestill considering this SIP-based approach, due to
    implementationsimplicity, possibility of reuse of already available SIP stackimplementations,
    easy integration into existing UAs, minimization ofthe number of required protocols
    for a P2P UA, and widespread supportfor (and relative maturity of) the SIP standard.</p>"
