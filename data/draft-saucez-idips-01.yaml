    Selection and to improve traffic engineering capabilities inmultihomed corporate
    networks. With the protocol, any network devicethat requires to select a path
    among a list of different paths asks aTraffic Engineering service called IDIPS
    (ISP-Driven Informed PathSelection) to obtain an ordered list of the possible
