abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies how to use the Internet Key Exchange
    (IKE)\n   protocols, such as IKEv1 and IKEv2, to setup \"unauthenticated\"\n   security
    associations (SAs) using public keys as IKE identities and\n   unauthenticated
    public keys and/or certificates as IKE credentials.\n   This unauthenticated SA
    negotiation protocol works by having IKE\n   peers assert public keys as identities
    using a new IKE ID payload\n   type for the purpose.  Unauthenticated IPsec is
    herein referred to by\n   its popular acronym, \"BTNS\" (Better Than Nothing Security).\n\n
    \  This document focuses on BITS (bump in the stack) mode IPsec, leaving\n   specification
    of unauthenticated native IPsec to a separate document.\n   We assume an RFC2401bis
    processing model, specifically a PAD (peer\n   authorization database) separate
    from the SPD (security policy\n   database).\n\t </p>\n      "
