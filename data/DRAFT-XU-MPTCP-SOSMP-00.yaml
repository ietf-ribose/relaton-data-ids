abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo presents a new stochastic optimal scheduler for the\n
    \  Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP). The new scheduler is\n   based
    on the Lyapunov optimatization technique, which can make online\n   control decision
    for data scheduling. Considering the payment of\n   users for different paths,
    this memo makes a trade off between the\n   throughput utility and the cost. The
    new scheduler can not only\n   satisfy the demand of service, but also minimize
    the cost as much as\n   possible.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
