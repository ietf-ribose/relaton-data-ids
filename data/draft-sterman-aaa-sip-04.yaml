abstract:
  content: "<p>Several protocols borrow the authentication mechanisms from the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol, HTTP. This document specifies an extension to RADIUS that allows
    a RADIUS client in an HTTP-style server, upon reception of a request, retrieve
    and compute Digest authentication information from a RADIUS server. Additionally,
    a scenario describing the authentication of a user emitting an HTTP-style request
    is provided.</p>"
