abstract:
- content: "<p>HIP proxies play an important role in the transition from the current
    Internet architecture to the HIP architecture. A core objective of a HIP proxy
    is to facilitate the communications between legacy (or Non-HIP) hosts and HIP
    hosts while not modifying their protocol stacks. In this document, the legacy
    hosts served by proxies are referred to as the Made-up Legacy (ML) hosts. Currently,
    various designing solutions of HIP proxies have been proposed. These solutions
    may be applicable in different working circumstances. In this document, we attempt
    to investigate these solutions in detail and compare their performances in different
    scenarios.</p>"
