abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Usually in FMIPv6, the MN will start the binding process with
    its \nhome agent and the correspondent nodes after it has attached to NAR. \nTill
    the binding is completed, the mobile node continues to receive \npackets via a
    reverse tunnel established between PAR and NAR. The \nduration of this tunnel
    will depend on the time it takes for the \nmobile node to complete its binding,
    till which time the tunnel will \n \n \n continue to consume buffer and processing
    resources related to \nmaintaining the tunnel and forwarding packets through this
    tunnel in \nboth PAR and NAR.  \n\nThis document specifies an extension to FMIPv6
    to enhance its \nperformance, in terms of resource management, by reducing the
    \nduration of the tunnel existence. This is achieved by enabling the \nNAR to
    act as a proxy for the MN for FMIPv6 handover. Additional \nmessage(s) and message
    options along with modifications to existing \nFMIPv6 messages and message options
    and definitions of new messages \nand message options to achieve the desired functionality
    is also \ndescribed in this document.\n\t </p>\n      "
