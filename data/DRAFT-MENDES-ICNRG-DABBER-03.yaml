abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes the Data reAchaBility BasEd Routing (DABBER)\n
    \  protocol, which has been developed to extend the reached of Named\n   Data
    Networking based routing approaches to opportunistic wireless\n   networks. By
    \"opportunistic wireless networks\" it is meant multi-hop\n   wireless networks
    where finding an end-to-end path between any pair\n   of nodes at any moment in
    time may be a challenge. The goal is to\n   assist in better defining opportunities
    for the transmission of\n   Interest packets towards the most suitable data source,
    based on\n   metrics that provide information about: i) the availability of\n
    \  different data sources; ii) the availability and centrality of\n   neighbor
    nodes; iii) the time lapse between forwarding Interest\n   packets and receiving
    the corresponding data packets. The document\n   presents an architectural overview
    of DABBER followed by\n   specification options related to the dissemination of
    name-prefix\n   information to support the computation of next hops, and the ranking\n
    \  of forwarding options based on the best set of neighbors to ensure a\n   short
    time-to-completion.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
