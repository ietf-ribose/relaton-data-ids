abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the foundation of the current new round of industrial revolution,\n
    \  the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) based on cyber-physical\n   systems
    (CPS) [smart-factory] has become the focus of research in\n   various countries.
    \ One of the key issues in the entire development\n   stage of IIoT is the standardization
    of the IIoT architecture.  With\n   the development of intelligent manufacturing
    technology, the number\n   of IIoT devices is expected to increase sharply, and
    large amounts of\n   data will be generated in the industrial manufacturing process.\n
    \  However, traditional industrial networks cannot meet the IIoT\n   requirements
    for high data rates, low latency, massive connections,\n   interconnection, and
    interoperability.  Current IIoT architectures\n   also have various limitations,
    including those in mobility, security,\n   scalability, and communication reliability.
    \ These limitations hinder\n   the development and implementation of IIoT.  As
    a network layer\n   protocol, IPv6 can solve the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion.\n
    \  Meanwhile, as a high-speed, low-latency, wireless communication\n   technology,
    5G has great potential in promoting IIoT.  To solve the\n   aforementioned problems,
    this draft proposes an IIoT architecture\n   based on IPv6 and 5G.  The architecture
    can provide high-speed, low-\n   latency communication services and possesses
    massive connectivity,\n   mobility, scalability, security, and other features
    for industrial\n   devices.  It can also provide generalized, refined, flexible
    network\n   services for devices outside factories.  Moreover, an information\n
    \  model is defined to standardize the representation of information in\n   IIoT.
    \ The security challenges in and recommendations for IIoT are\n   also discussed.\n\n\t
