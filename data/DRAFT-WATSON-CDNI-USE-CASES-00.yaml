    for\nCDN Interconnection within the IETF.  This documents provides a\ncomplimentary
    set of technical use cases for how CDNs may be\ninterconnected.  The goal of this
    document is to outline real world\nuse-cases for CDN Interconnect, for the IETF,
    with the intention of\nsupporting the case for formation of a Working Group which
    would work\non the definition of standardised, interoperable methods of\nInterconnecting
    CDNs.  The goal of this document is NOT to define the\ntechnical solutions to
    be used.\n\nThe intent of this document is to outline a set of technical use\ncases.
    \ While the technical use cases may be influenced by business-\nrelated and other
    non-technical factors, this document does not\nattempt to detail any non-technical
    aspects of CDN Interconnect.\n\t </p>\n      "
