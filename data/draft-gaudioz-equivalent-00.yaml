abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes EDS (Equivalent Differentiated Services), a
    new building-block for a simple, robust, free and scalable end-to-end service
    differentiation in IP networks. The EDS scheme aims at providing a spectrum of
    'different but equivalent' network services that offer a trade-off between delay
    and loss rate to the end-to-end flows. The EDS scheme can be deployed incrementally
    in the Internet.</p>"
