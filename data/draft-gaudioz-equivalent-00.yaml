abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes EDS (Equivalent Differentiated Services), anew
    building-block for a simple, robust, free and scalable end-to-endservice differentiation
    in IP networks. The EDS scheme aims atproviding a spectrum of 'different but equivalent'
    network servicesthat offer a trade-off between delay and loss rate to the end-to-endflows.
    The EDS scheme can be deployed incrementally in the Internet.</p>"
