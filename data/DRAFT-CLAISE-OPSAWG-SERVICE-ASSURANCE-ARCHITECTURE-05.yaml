abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an architecture for Service Assurance
    for\n   Intent-based Networking (SAIN).  This architecture aims at assuring\n
    \  that service instances are correctly running.  As services rely on\n   multiple
    sub-services by the underlying network devices, getting the\n   assurance of a
    healthy service is only possible with a holistic view\n   of network devices.
    \ This architecture not only helps to correlate\n   the service degradation with
    the network root cause but also the\n   impacted services when a network component
    fails or degrades.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
