abstract:
- content: "<p>During the transition to IPv6, there are scenarios where a backbone
    network internally running one IP address family (referred to as the internal
    IP or I-IP family) connects client networks running another IP address family
    (referred to as the external IP or E-IP family). In such cases, the I-IP backbone
    needs to offer both unicast and multicast transit services to the client E-IP
    networks. This document describes a mechanism for supporting multicast across
    backbone networks where the I-IP and E-IP protocol families differ. The document
    focuses on the IPv4-over-IPv6 scenario, due to lack of real-world use cases for
    the IPv6-over-IPv4 scenario.</p>"
