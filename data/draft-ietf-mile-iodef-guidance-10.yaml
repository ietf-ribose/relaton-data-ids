abstract:
- content: "<p>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format v2 [RFC7970] defines
    a data representation that provides a framework for sharing information commonly
    exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) about computer
    security incidents. Since the IODEF model includes a wealth of available options
    that can be used to describe a security incident or issue, it can be challenging
    for security practitioners to develop tools that can leverage IODEF for incident
    sharing. This document provides guidelines for IODEF implementers. It also addresses
    how common security indicators can be represented in IODEF and use-cases of how
    IODEF is being used. This document aims to make IODEF's adoption by vendors easier
    and encourage faster and wider adoption of the model by Computer Security Incident
    Response Teams (CSIRTs) around the world.</p>"
