abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Given responsibilities and importance it bears, DNS root system\n
    \  architecture remains largely unchanged. Over the years, the topics\n   together
    with some proposals of scaling the root have been discussed\n   in various communities,
    trying to offer solutions or insights to a\n   specific issue of DNS root operation.
    This document gathers and\n   describes issues relating to the root zone operation
    and management\n   and comb corresponding technical requirements for evolution\n
    \  directions of root zone operation and management in new groundwork.\n\n\t </p>\n
