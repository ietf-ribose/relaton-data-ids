abstract:
  content: "\t <t>During the Cisco [Cisco] European networkers Conference 2009 that
    ranfrom 26th to 29th January in Barcelona native IPv6 was added to thetraditional
    IPv4 infrastructure. During this conference the 3500attendees had dual stack access
    to both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.The goal of this IPv6 deployment project
    was to gather usagestatistics in a situation where the end-user just wants to
    accesshis/her enterprise VPN or simply get onto the Internet. Thecollected statistics
    are not only useful per se but this documentpresents easy ways to measure the
    quality of the IPv6 connectivityoffered on such events. In essence the users were
    not conductingIPv6 technology tests, but were just using Internet services. Thestatistics
    collected give some pieces of information on the size andimpact of IPv6 onto the
    normal userbase and will also derive theimportance of IPv6 onto the infrastructiure
    and end-user operatingsystems and firewall technologies. The experiment ran incollaboration
    with Google [Google] and Tata-Communications [Tata].</p>"
