abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) has access to not
    only the\n   information disseminated by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol\n
    \  (IGP), but also the set of active paths and their reserved resources\n   for
    its computation.  The additional Label Switched Path (LSP) state\n   information
    allows the PCE to compute constrained paths while\n   considering individual LSPs
    and their interactions.  This requires a\n   reliable state synchronization mechanism
    between the PCE and the\n   network, PCE and path computation clients (PCCs),
    and between\n   cooperating PCEs.  The basic mechanism for state synchronization
    is\n   part of the stateful PCE specification.  This draft presents\n   motivations
    for optimizations to the base state synchronization\n   procedure and specifies
    the required Path Computation Element\n   Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions.\n\n\n\t
