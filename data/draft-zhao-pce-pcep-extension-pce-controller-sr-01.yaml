abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks deployment scenarios, service providers would like
    to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in both MPLS and GMPLS while removing
    the complexity of existing signaling protocols such as LDP and RSVP-TE. PCE has
    been proposed to be used as a central controller (PCECC) so that LSP can be calculated/setup/
    initiated and label forwarding entries are downloaded through a centralized PCE
    server to each network devices along the path while leveraging the existing PCE
    technologies as much as possible. This document specifies the procedures and PCEP
    protocol extensions when the PCE functions as one of the central controller components
    in Segment Routing(SR).</p>"
