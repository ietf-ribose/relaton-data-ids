abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ability for a node to specify a forwarding path, other
    than the\n   normal shortest path, that a particular packet will traverse,\n   benefits
    a number of network functions. Source-based routing\n   mechanisms have previously
    been specified for network protocols, but\n   have not seen widespread adoption.
    In this context, the term\n   'source' means 'the point at which the explicit
    route is imposed'.\n\n   The objective of this document is to illustrate some
    use cases that\n   need to be taken into account by the Source Packet Routing
    in\n   Networking (SPRING) architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
