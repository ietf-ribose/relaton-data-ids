abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a scalable routing scheme for ICN regardless
    of\n   the underlying network protocols. When Lookup-By-Name routing (LBNR)\n
    \  is used the first thing to do is name to locator resolution. Once the\n   locator
    is acquired, discovery and delivery steps are carried out\n   based on the network
    protocol of the locator. However, if the\n   requestor and contents server are
    in heterogeneous networks discovery\n   and delivery step could not be carried
    out smoothly. To let this\n   happen seamlessly we propose scalable routing scheme
    based on\n   hierarchically-organized domain structure. This scheme is independent\n
    \  of underlying network protocols and is more scalable thanks to the\n   abstraction
    of location spaces. Internet is projected as spaces (i.e.\n   domains) which have
    hierarchical relationship among them, and each\n   node which belongs to a domain
    can be reached through \"locator\" which\n   is a concatenation of \"domain IDs\".\n\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
