abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond Web (ABFAB)\n
    \  architecture provides cross-domain authentication, authorization and\n   accounting
    functionality by utilizing well-established technologies,\n   such as Diameter,
    the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and\n   the Generic Security Services
    API (GSS-API).\n\n   This document defines a Diameter application for usage with
    the ABFAB\n   architecture to convey authentication information, and authorization\n
    \  decisions from the Diameter server (acting as the identity provider)\n   to
    the Diameter client (acting as a relying party) encoded in a\n   Security Assertion
    Markup Language (SAML) encoding.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
