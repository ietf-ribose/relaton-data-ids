abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an extension to minimize the delay
    induced by\n   the presence of MPTCP-unfriendly nodes in some of the paths selected\n
    \  by a MPTCP endpoint, and which may support the establishment of MPTCP\n   subflows.
    \ Concretely, this procedure allows a MPTCP endpoint to\n   assess whether the
    networks the endpoint connects to are compliant\n   with MPTCP signals or not.
    \ The procedure is not enabled for every\n   new MPTCP connection; it is activated
    upon bootstrap or when a\n   network attachment change occurs (e.g., attach to
    a new network,\n   discover a new external IP address, etc.).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
