abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Kerberos protocol does not allow ticket extensions. This make
    itharder to deploy features like PKCROSS.Since the Kerberos protocol did not specified
    extensibility for theTicket structure and the current implementations are aware
    of thecontents of tickets, the extension protocol cannot simply extend theTicket
    ASN.1 structure. Instead, the extension data needs to behidden inside the ticket.This
    protocol defines two methods to add extend the tickets. Thefirst method requires
    updated clients and is more in line with thefuture development of Kerberos. The
    second way does not requireupdate client. To take advantage of this protocol the
    server (KDC orapplication server) need to update a well. The two methods areequivalent
    and there is a 1-1 mapping between them.</p>"
