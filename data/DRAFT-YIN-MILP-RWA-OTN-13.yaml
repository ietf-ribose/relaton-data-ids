abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The RWA problem can be formulated as a Mixed-Integer linear
    program.\n   Load balancing is a key factor for the optical transport networks.\n
    \  However, the existed approaches using mixed-Integer linear program to\n   solve
    the RWA problem are not perfect enough without considering the\n   load balancing
    of the networks.\n\n   This documentary provides a model of Mixed-Integer Linear
    Programming\n   to solve the problem of load balancing needed by routing and\n
    \  wavelength assignment (RWA) process in optical transport networks.\n\n\t </p>\n
