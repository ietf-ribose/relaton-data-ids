abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal
    Control\n   (RTP/AVP) is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure\n
    \  Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for\n   Real-time
    Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/\n   AVPF), and the Extended
    Secure RTP Profile for RTCP-Based Feedback\n   (RTP/SAVPF).  This document updates
    the RTP/AVP profile (and by\n   extension, the profiles that build upon it) to
    reflect changes in\n   audio codec usage since the document was originally published.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
