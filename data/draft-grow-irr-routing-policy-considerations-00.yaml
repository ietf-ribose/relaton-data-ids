abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to catalog past issues influencing
    the efficacy of Internet Routing Registries (IRR) for inter-domain routing policy
    specification and application in the global routing system over the past two decades.
    Additionally, it provides a discussion regarding which of these issues are still
    problematic in practice, and which are simply artifacts that are no longer applicable
    but continue to stifle inter-provider policy-based filtering adoption and IRR
    utility to this day.</p>"
