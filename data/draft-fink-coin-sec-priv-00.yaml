abstract:
- content: "<p>With the growing interconnection of devices, cyber-security and data
    protection are of increasing importance. This is especially the case regarding
    cyber-physical systems due to their close entanglement with the physical world.
    Misbehavior and information leakage can lead to financial and physical damage
    and endanger human lives and well- being. Thus, hard security and privacy requirements
    are necessary to be met. Furthermore, thorough investigation of incidents is essential
    for ultimate protection. In-network computing allows the processing of traffic
    and data directly in the network and at line- rate. Thus, the in-network computing
    paradigm presents a promising solution for efficiently providing security and
    privacy mechanisms as well as event analysis. This document discusses select mechanisms
    to demonstrate how in-network computing concepts can be applied to encounter current
    shortcomings of cyber-security and data privacy.</p>"
