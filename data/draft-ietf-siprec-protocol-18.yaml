abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the use of the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP), the Session Description Protocol (SDP), and the Real-time Transport Protocol
    (RTP) for delivering real-time media and metadata from a Communication Session
    (CS) to a recording device. The Session Recording Protocol specifies the use of
    SIP, SDP, and RTP to establish a Recording Session (RS) between the Session Recording
    Client (SRC), which is on the path of the CS, and a Session Recording Server (SRS)
    at the recording device. This document considers only active recording, where
    the SRC purposefully streams media to an SRS and all participating user agents
    (UAs) are notified of the recording. Passive recording, where a recording device
    detects media directly from the network (e.g., using port-mirroring techniques),
    is outside the scope of this document. In addition, lawful intercept is outside
    the scope of this document.</p>"
