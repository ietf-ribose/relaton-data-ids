abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a passive performance measurement method
    for\n   SRv6 network programming.  In this method, performance measurement\n   information
    can be carried in data packets by two ways.  One way is\n   carrying measurement
    information by used SIDs.  Another way is\n   carrying measurement information
    via related SRH TLVs.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
