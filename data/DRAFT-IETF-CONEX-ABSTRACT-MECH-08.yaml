abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders
    inform\n   the network about the congestion encountered by packets earlier in\n
    \  the same flow.  Today, network elements at any layer may signal\n   congestion
    to the receiver by dropping packets or by ECN markings,\n   and the receiver passes
    this information back to the sender in\n   transport-layer feedback.  The mechanism
    described here enables the\n   sender to also relay this congestion information
    back into the\n   network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total amount
    of\n   congestion from all elements on the path is revealed to all IP\n   elements
    along the path, where it could, for example, be used to\n   provide input to traffic
    management.  This mechanism is called\n   congestion exposure or ConEx.  The companion
    document \"ConEx Concepts\n   and Use Cases\" provides the entry-point to the
    set of ConEx\n   documentation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
