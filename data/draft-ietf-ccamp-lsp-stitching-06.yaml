abstract:
- content: <p>In certain scenarios, there may be a need to combine several Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) such that a
    single end-to-end (e2e) LSP is realized and all traffic from one constituent LSP
    is switched onto the next LSP. We will refer to this as "LSP stitching", the key
    requirement being that a constituent LSP not be allocated to more than one e2e
    LSP. The constituent LSPs will be referred to as "LSP segments" (S-LSPs). This
    document describes extensions to the existing GMPLS signaling protocol (Resource
    Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)) to establish e2e LSPs created
    from S-LSPs, and describes how the LSPs can be managed using the GMPLS signaling
    and routing protocols. It may be possible to configure a GMPLS node to switch
    the traffic from an LSP for which it is the egress, to another LSP for which it
    is the ingress, without requiring any signaling or routing extensions whatsoever
    and such that the operation is completely transparent to other nodes. This will
    also result in LSP stitching in the data plane. However, this document does not
    cover this scenario of LSP stitching. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
