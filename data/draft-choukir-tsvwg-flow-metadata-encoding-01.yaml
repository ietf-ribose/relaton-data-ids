abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol independent encoding for flow characteristics
    (a.k.a. metadata). A flow is defined as a set of IP packets passing through a
    network in a given direction. All packets belonging to a particular flow have
    a set of common properties (e.g. IP, port, transport). Flow metadata exposes key
    characteristics of the flow such as the originating application, the type of media
    in use (e.g. audio, video) and others as defined in [I-D.eckert-intarea-flow-metadata-framework].
    The flow characteristics are expressed in terms of information elements. These
    information elements are signaled either out of band or in band but always along
    the same path of the flow associated with the application. [I-D.eckert-intarea-flow-metadata-framework]
    defines the overall framework for flow metadata and the definition of the flow
    characteristics, whereas this document captures the encoding of these characteristics.
    The mapping of flow metadata encoding to different signaling protocols is outside
    the scope of this document.</p>"
