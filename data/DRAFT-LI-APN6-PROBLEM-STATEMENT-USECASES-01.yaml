abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network operators are facing the challenge of providing better\n
    \  network services for users.  As the ever developing 5G and industrial\n   verticals
    evolve, more and more services that have diverse network\n   requirements such
    as ultra-low latency and high reliability are\n   emerging, and therefore differentiated
    service treatment is desired\n   by users.  However, network operators are typically
    unaware of which\n   applications are traversing their network infrastructure,
    which means\n   that only coarse-grained services can be provided to users.  As
    a\n   result, network operators are only evolving their infrastructure to\n   be
    large but dumb pipes without corresponding revenue increases that\n   might be
    enabled by differentiated service treatment.  As network\n   technologies evolve
    including deployments of IPv6 and SRv6, the\n   programmability provided by IPv6
    and SRv6 encapsulations can be\n   augmented by conveying application related
    information into the\n   network.  Adding application knowledge to the network
    layer allows\n   applications to specify finer granularity requirements to the
    network\n   operator.\n\n   This document analyzes the existing problems caused
    by lack of\n   application awareness, and outlines various use cases that could\n
    \  benefit from an Application-aware IPv6 Networking (APN6)\n   architecture.\n\n\n\t
