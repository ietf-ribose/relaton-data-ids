abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification defines an extension to the multicast\naddressing
    architecture of the IP Version 4 protocol.  The\nextension presented in this document
    allows for unicast-prefix-\nbased allocation of multicast addresses.  By delegating
    multicast\naddresses at the same time as unicast prefixes, network operators\nwill
    be able to identify their multicast addresses without needing\nto run an inter-domain
    allocation protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
