abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Definition and operation of variant domain names are differ
    from zone\n   administrators, and there is no generic rules, therefore, in general,\n
    \  it is hard to guess variant labels for end users and / or\n   applications.
    \ Meanwhile, zone administrators are understanding all\n   variant labels list
    because they generate variant labels and activate\n   them according to rules
    they defined.  Thus, if there is a mechanism\n   that end users and / or applications
    can obtain variant labels list\n   from zone administrators, then it would be
    useful.  The Variant\n   Labels Resource Record (VL RR) provides such variant
    labels list for\n   that purpose.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
