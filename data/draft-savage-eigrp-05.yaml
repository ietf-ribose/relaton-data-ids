abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the protocol design and architecture for Enhanced
    Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). EIGRP is a routing protocol based on
    Distance Vector technology. The specific algorithm used is called "DUAL", a Diffusing
    Update Algorithm as referenced in "Loop-Free Routing Using Diffusing Computations"
    (Garcia-Luna-Aceves 1993). The algorithm and procedures were researched, developed,
    and simulated by SRI International.</p>
