abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)
    routing\n   protocol is adopted by a highly symmetric network such as the Leaf-\n
    \  Spine or Fat-Tree network, the Leaf nodes (e.g., Top of Rack switches\n   in
    datacenters) are recommended to be prevented from receiving other\n   nodes' explicit
    routes in order to achieve scalability.  However,\n   such a setup would cause
    traffic black-holes or suboptimal routing if\n   link failure happens in the network.
    \ This document extends IS-IS to\n   solve this problem.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
