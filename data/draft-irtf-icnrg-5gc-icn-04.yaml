abstract:
- content: "<p>The proposed 3GPP's 5G core nextgen architecture (5GC) allows the introduction
    of new user and control plane function, considering the support for network slicing
    functions, that offers greater flexibility to handle heterogeneous devices and
    applications. In this draft, we provide a short description of the proposed 5GC
    architecture, including recent efforts to provide cellular Local Area Network
    (LAN) connectivity, followed by extensions to 5GC's control and user plane to
    support Packet Data Unit (PDU) sessions over Information-Centric Networks (ICN).
    In addition, ICN over 5GLAN is also described.</p>"
