abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the framework of a mechanism for use
    in\n   conjunction with link state routing protocols which prevents the\n   transient
    loops which would otherwise occur during topology changes.\n   It does this by
    correctly sequencing the forwarding information base\n   (FIB) updates on the
    routers.\n\n   This mechanism can be used in the case of non-urgent link or node\n
    \  shutdowns and restarts or link metric changes.  It can also be used\n   in
    conjunction with a fast re-route mechanism which converts a sudden\n   link or
    node failure into a non-urgent topology change.  This is\n   possible where a
    complete repair path is provided for all affected\n   destinations.\n\n   After
    a non-urgent topology change, each router computes a rank that\n   defines the
    time at which it can safely update its FIB.  A method for\n   accelerating this
    loop-free convergence process by the use of\n   completion messages is also described.\n\n
    \  The technology described in this document has been subject to\n   extensive
    simulation using real network topologies and costs, and\n   pathological convergence
    behaviour.  However mechanism described in\n   this document are purely illustrative
    of the general approach and do\n   not constitute a protocol specification.  The
    document represents a\n   snapshot of the work of the Routing Area Working Group
    at the time of\n   publication and is published as a document of record.  Further
    work\n   is needed before implementation or deployment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
