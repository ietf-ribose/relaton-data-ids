abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility protocol that enabesmobility
    management for an IP host as it moves across differentpoints of attachment within
    the mobility domain. An IP host whosemobility is being managed by the network
    is unaware of the accessnetworks capability to do mobility management on its behalf
    usingProxy Mobile IPv6. This draft proposes mechanisms by which the hostis informed
    of Proxy Mobile IPv6 support, as well as how to activelydiscover such capability
    in the network that host attaches to. Theability of the host to discover or be
    aware of Proxy Mobile IPv6support in the access network enables better decision
    making in termsof the network selection and attach procedure as well as the choiceof
    mobility management.</p>"
