abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has seen widespread deployment\n
    \  within individual domains, typically supporting voice and video\n   communications.
    \ Though it was designed from the outset to support\n   inter-domain federation
    over the public Internet, such federation has\n   not materialized.  The primary
    reasons for this are the complexities\n   of inter-domain phone number routing
    and concerns over security.\n   This document reviews this problem space, outlines
    requirements, and\n   then describes a new model and technique for inter-domain
    federation\n   with SIP involving the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN),\n
    \  called Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (VIPR).  VIPR\n   addresses
    the problems that have prevented inter-domain federation\n   over the Internet.
    \ It provides fully distributed inter-domain\n   routing for phone numbers, authorized
    mappings from phone numbers to\n   domains, a new technique for automated SIP
    anti-spam, and privacy of\n   number ownership, all while preserving the trapezoidal
    model of SIP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
