abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes the traceroute facility for Content-Centric
    Network (CCN), named "Contrace". Contrace investigates: 1) the routing path information
    per name prefix, device name, and function/ application, 2) the Round-Trip Time
    (RTT) between content forwarder and consumer, and 3) the states of in-network
    cache per name prefix. In addition, it discovers a gateway that supports different
    protocols such as CCN and NDN.</p>'
