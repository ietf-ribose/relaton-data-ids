abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the goals of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)
    is to\n   offer the NFV infrastructure as a service to other SP customers -\n
    \  this is called NFVIaaS. Virtual Network Function (VNF) deployment in\n   this
    paradigm will drive support for unique placement policies,\n   given VNF's stringent
    service level specifications (SLS) required by\n   customer SPs. Additionally,
    NFV DCs often have capacity, energy and\n   other constraints - thus, optimizing
    the overall resource usage\n   based on policy is an important part of the overall
    solution. The\n   purpose of this document is to depict an architectural framework
    for\n   policy based resource placement and scheduling in the context of\n   NFVIaaS.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
