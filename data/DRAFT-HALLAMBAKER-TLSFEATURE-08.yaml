abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of the TLS feature extension is to prevent downgrade\n
    \  attacks that are not otherwise prevented by the TLS protocol. In\n   particular,
    the TLS feature extension may be used to mandate support\n   for revocation checking
    features in the TLS protocol such as OCSP\n   stapling.  Informing clients that
    an OCSP status response will always\n   be stapled permits an immediate failure
    in the case that the response\n   is not stapled. This in turn prevents a denial
    of service attack that\n   might otherwise be possible.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
