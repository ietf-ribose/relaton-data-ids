  content: "\t <t>This document is an implementation report for the Resource Public
    Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Router protocol as defined in RFC 6810. The authors

    are experts with the implementations they reported on, and their responses are
    considered authoritative for the implementations for which their responses represent.
    The respondents were asked to only use the \"YES\" answer if the feature had at
    least been tested in the lab.</p>"
