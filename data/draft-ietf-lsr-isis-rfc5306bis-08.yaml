abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for a restarting router to signal
    to its neighbors that it is restarting, allowing them to reestablish their adjacencies
    without cycling through the down state, while still correctly initiating database
    synchronization. This document additionally describes a mechanism for a router
    to signal its neighbors that it is preparing to initiate a restart while maintaining
    forwarding plane state. This allows the neighbors to maintain their adjacencies
    until the router has restarted, but also allows the neighbors to bring the adjacencies
    down in the event of other topology changes. This document additionally describes
    a mechanism for a restarting router to determine when it has achieved Link State
    Protocol Data Unit (LSP) database synchronization with its neighbors and a mechanism
    to optimize LSP database synchronization, while minimizing transient routing disruption
    when a router starts. This document obsoletes RFC 5306.</p>"
