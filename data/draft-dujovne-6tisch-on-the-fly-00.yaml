abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the environment, problem statement, and goals
    of the On-The-Fly (OTF) scheduling for the IEEE802.15.4e TSCH MAC protocol in
    the context of LLNs. The purpose of OTF is to dynamically adapt the number of
    reserved cells between neighbor nodes to satisfy different type of constraints,
    based on the specific application. The cell reservation with OTF is distributed:
    neighbor nodes negotiate the cell(s) to be (re)allocated/deleted among them, without
    the intervention of a centralized entity. This document aims to define a module
    which uses the functionalities provided by the 6top sublayer to extract statistics
    and to reserve/delete cells in the schedule, leaving the reservation/deletion
    algorithm, and the number and type of statistics to be used in the algorithm itself,
    open. OTF allows to reserve/delete either a single cell between a couple of nodes,
    or a set of them (i.e., a bundle) in the TSCH schedule. Also, OTF allows to negotiate
    the aggregate bandwidth of a link without explicitly dealing with a reservation
    of a specific subset of cells.</p>"
