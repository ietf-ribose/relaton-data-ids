abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When delivering audio and video data through low capacity links,
    it \n   is important to optimally exploit the limited resources in order to \n
    \  provide the best possible user experience. QoS aspects in this \n   respect
    might relate to the pure audio and video quality, as well as \n   to delay and
    lip-sync. The actual weights of the different QoS \n   aspects depend on the service
    being offered, and are out of the scope \n   of this document. \n   In order to
    optimally exploit the limited resources, it is necessary \n   to get a reasonable
    precise measurement of them. This document \n   proposes metrics to address this
    problem. \n\n   This document, in this initial draft, focuses only on the semantic
    \n   aspects, leaving out the syntactical details. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
