abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Long-lived flows such as file transfers, video streams are
    common in\n   today's networks. In the context of service function chaining, this\n
    \  draft suggests use cases for dynamic bypass of certain service\n   functions
    for such flows. The benefit of this approach would be to\n   avoid expensive Layer
    7 service function processing for such flows\n   based on dynamic decisions and
    thus improve overall performance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
