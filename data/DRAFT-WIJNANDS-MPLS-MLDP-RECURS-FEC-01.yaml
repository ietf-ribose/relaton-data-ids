abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The control protocol used for constructing Point-to-Multipoint
    and\nMultipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths (\"MP LSPs\") contains a\nfield
    that identifies the address of a \"root node\".  Intermediate\nnodes are expected
    to be able to look up that address in their\nrouting tables.  However, if the
    route to the root node is a BGP\nroute, and the intermediate nodes are part of
    a BGP-free core, this\nis not possible.  This document specifies procedures which
    enable a\nMP LSP to be constructed through a BGP-free core.  In these\nprocedures,
    the root node address is temporarily replaced by an\naddress which is known to
    the intermediate nodes.\n\t </p>\n      "
