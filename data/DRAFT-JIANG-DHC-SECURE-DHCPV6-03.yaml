abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) enables
    \nDHCP servers to pass configuration parameters. It offers \nconfiguration flexibility.
    If not secured, DHCPv6 is vulnerable to \nvarious attacks, particularly fake attack.
    This document analyzes the \nsecurity issues of DHCPv6 and specifies security
    mechanisms, mainly \nusing CGAs.\n\t </p>\n      "
