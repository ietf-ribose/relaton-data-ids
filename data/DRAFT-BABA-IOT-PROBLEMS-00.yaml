abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is a summary of the results of meetings with
    actual\n   manufacturers of industrial products, companies that establish and\n
    \  run social infrastructures (hereafter referred to as \"Things\n   companies\"),
    and ICT enterprises about the challenges they face in\n   realizing IoT. These
    meetings revealed that the Things companies are\n   troubled by such as the vast
    gap between the product lifetimes of\n   their company products and the pace at
    which generation changes occur\n   in ICT technologies, the difference between
    the actual values and\n   catalog values of the wave traveling ranges, and the
    enormous number\n   of sensors that need to be installed. In order to deploy about
    IoT,\n   we believe that the solutions to these primitive issues must be\n   promoted
    in tandem with a service-oriented approach that places an\n   emphasis on the
    effects.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
