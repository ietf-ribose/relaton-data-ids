abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes two fully-specified simple FEC schemes forReed-Solomon
    codes that can be used to protect media streams alongthe lines defined by the
    FECFRAME framework. Reed-Solomon codesbelong to the class of Maximum Distance
    Separable (MDS) codes whichmeans they offer optimal protection against packet
    erasures. Theyare also systematic codes, which means that the source symbols arepart
    of the encoding symbols. The price to pay is a limit on themaximum source block
    size, on the maximum number of encoding symbols,and a computational complexity
    higher than that of LDPC codes forinstance.The first scheme is for Reed-Solomon
    codes over GF(2^^m), with 2 &lt;= m&lt;= 16 and arbitrary packet flows. The second
    scheme is similar tothe first scheme, with the exception that it is restricted
    to asingle sequenced flow.</p>"
