abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a remaining throughput metric for parent
    and\n   DODAG selection.  This metric represents the amount of remaining\n   traffic
    handling capacity that the node has.  This document also\n   proposes an Objective
    Function (OF) which uses the proposed metric\n   for parent and DODAG selection
    to balance the amount of traffic\n   between nodes and DODAGs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
