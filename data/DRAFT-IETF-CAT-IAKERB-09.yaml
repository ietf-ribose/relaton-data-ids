abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines extensions to the Kerberos protocol\nspecification
    (RFC 1510 [1]) and GSSAPI Kerberos protocol mechanism\n(RFC 1964 [2]) that enables
    a client to obtain Kerberos tickets for\nservices where the KDC is not accessible
    to the client, but is\naccessible to the application server. Some common scenarios
    where\nlack of accessibility would occur are when the client does not have\nan
    IP address prior to authenticating to an access point, the client\nis unable to
    locate a KDC, or a KDC is behind a firewall. The\ndocument specifies two protocols
    to allow a client to exchange KDC\nmessages (which are GSS encapsulated) with
    an IAKERB proxy instead of\na KDC.\n\t </p>\n      "
