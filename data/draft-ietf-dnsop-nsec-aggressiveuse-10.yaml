abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS relies upon caching to scale; however, the cache lookup generally
    requires an exact match. This document specifies the use of NSEC/NSEC3 resource
    records to allow DNSSEC-validating resolvers to generate negative answers within
    a range and positive answers from wildcards. This increases performance, decreases
    latency, decreases resource utilization on both authoritative and recursive servers,
    and increases privacy. Also, it may help increase resilience to certain DoS attacks
    in some circumstances. This document updates RFC 4035 by allowing validating resolvers
    to generate negative answers based upon NSEC/NSEC3 records and positive answers
    in the presence of wildcards.</p>"
