abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Streaming video on P2P overlays puts extremely high demands and\nstress
    on the underlying network, especially in case of TV and live\nstreaming.  The
    EU research project NAPA-WINE has devised an overall\narchitecture for live video
    streaming that supports the needs of the\nusers and content providers, while being
    respective of network-level\nneeds, as reducing inter-AS traffic using ALTO-like
    services.  In\nthis document, we describe generic elements of this software\narchitecture
    for P2P live streaming and derive the corresponding\nimplications for standardizing
    a Peer-to-Peer streaming protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
