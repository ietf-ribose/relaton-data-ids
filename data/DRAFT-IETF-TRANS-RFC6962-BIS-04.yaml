abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a protocol for publicly logging the
    existence\n   of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates as they are issued
    or\n   observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit certificate\n   authority
    (CA) activity and notice the issuance of suspect\n   certificates as well as to
    audit the certificate logs themselves.\n   The intent is that eventually clients
    would refuse to honor\n   certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively
    forcing CAs to\n   add all issued certificates to the logs.\n\n   Logs are network
    services that implement the protocol operations for\n   submissions and queries
    that are defined in this document.\n\t </p>\n      "
