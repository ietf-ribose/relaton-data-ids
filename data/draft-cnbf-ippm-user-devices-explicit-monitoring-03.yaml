abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a methodology to monitor network performance
    exploiting user devices. This can be achieved using the Explicit Flow Measurement
    Techniques, protocol independent methods that employ few marking bits, inside
    the header of each packet, for loss and delay measurement. User devices and servers,
    marking the traffic, signal these metrics to intermediate network observers allowing
    them to measure connection performance, and to locate the network segment where
    impairments happen. In addition or in alternative to network observers, a probe
    can be installed on the user device with remarkable benefits in terms of hardware
    deployment and measurement scalability.</p>"
