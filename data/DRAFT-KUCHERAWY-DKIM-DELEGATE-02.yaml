abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a handling agent
    to affix a\n   digital signature to an email message, associating a domain name
    with\n   that message using cryptographic signing techniques.  The digital\n   signature
    typically covers most of a message's original portions,\n   although the specific
    choices for content hashing are at the\n   discretion of the signer.  DKIM signatures
    survive simply email\n   relaying but typically are invalidated by processing
    through\n   Mediators, such as mailing lists.  For such cases, the signer needs
    a\n   way to indicate that a valid signature from some third party was\n   anticipated,
    and constitutes an acceptable handling of the message.\n   This enables a receiver
    to conclude that the content is legitimately\n   from that original signer, even
    though its original signature no\n   longer validates.\n\n   This document defines
    a mechanism for improving the ability to assess\n   DKIM validity for such messages.\n\n\t
