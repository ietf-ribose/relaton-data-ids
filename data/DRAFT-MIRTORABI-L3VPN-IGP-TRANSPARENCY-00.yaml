abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many Service Providers offer Virtual Private Network (VPN)
    services\n   to their customers, using a technique in which customer edge routers\n
    \  (CE routers) are routing peers of provider edge routers (PE routers).\n   Although
    specification has been defined allowing OSPF or other IGP to \n   be used as PE-CE
    routing protocol, BGP is often used as PE-CE routing\n   protocol. Section 2 describes
    some of the motivations to use BGP as\n   PE-CE routing protocol. The usage of
    BGP breaks customer route's \n   transparency when they move from an overlay VPN
    model to MPLS VPN model.\n   This document describes the extension to CE in order
    to keep the customer\n   routes' transparent when BGP is used as PE-CE routing
    protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
