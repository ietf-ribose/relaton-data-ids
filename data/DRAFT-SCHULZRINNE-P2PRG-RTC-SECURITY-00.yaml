abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks offer higher robustness against failure,\neasier
    configuration and are generally more economical than their\nclient-server counterparts.
    \ It has therefore become reasonable for\nresource consuming and typically centralized
    applications like Voice\nover IP (VoIP) and, in general, realtime communication
    to adapt and\nexploit the benefits of P2P. Such a migration needs to address a
    new\nset of P2P specific security problems.  This document describes some\nof
    the known issues found in common P2P networks, analyzing the\nrelevance of such
    issues and the applicability of existing solutions\nwhen using P2P architectures
    for realtime communication.\n\t </p>\n      "
