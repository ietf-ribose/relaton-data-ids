abstract:
  content: "<p>As implementation of MPTCP continues to grow, there will be interaction
    concerns regarding MPTCP sessions relative to the functionality of middleboxes,
    particularly those focused on network- based security. The purpose of this draft
    is to review this interaction of MPTCp sessions and middleboxes, the likely response
    of middlebox providers in dealing with any functional degradation due to MPTCP,
    and the potential requirements to support proxy functionality for MPTCP sessions.</p>"
