abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo presents the following rules, which to some extend can
    be \nregarded as the golden rules of IETF, even though there are exceptions \nwhen
    these rules should not be adhered to.\n\n- Be liberal in what you accept, and
    conservative in what you send\n- Do not munge forwarded data\n- Modify as late
    as possible\n- Cause no harm\n- Leave nothing undefined\n- Keep it simple, stupid\n-
    No voting, rough consensus\n- Plain ASCII text is enough\n\t </p>\n      "
