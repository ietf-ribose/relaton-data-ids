abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a technique
    for\n   inter-domain SIP federation.  ViPR hybridizes the PSTN, P2P networks,\n
    \  and SIP, and in doing so, addresses the phone number routing and VoIP\n   spam
    problems that have been a barrier to federation.  The ViPR\n   architecture uses
    a server, the ViPR server, which performs P2P and\n   validation services on behalf
    of call agents, which acts as clients\n   to the server.  Such an architecture
    requires a client/server\n   protocol between call agents and the ViPR server.
    \ That protocol,\n   defined here, is called the ViPR Access Protocol (VAP).\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
