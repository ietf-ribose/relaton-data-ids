abstract:
- content: <p>For efficient DNA, a host should quickly receive an RA upon a new link-layer
    connection. This draft presents a quick RA acquisition scheme with the support
    of a link-layer entity, PoA (Point of Attachment). Upon a new network attachment,
    the PoA may either trigger an AR (Access Router) to immediately send an unicast
    RA, "RA Triggering" or send such an RA for itself, "RA Proxying". We may put "RA
    Triggering" or "RA Proxying" functionality on a PoA to get the optimized result
    without IPv6 standard change.</p>
