abstract:
  content: "<p>Where multiple application servers are able to receive inboundconnections
    from clients, it is desirable provide some policy controlover client behaviour.
    This specification allows application serviceproviders to provide addresses of
    multiple servers in response to DNSqueries, while specifying failover and load
    balancing behaviours.Multiple servers are specified using existing protocol mechanisms
    forDNS Service records (SRV). An experimental record definition isdescribed, which
    can be implemented on existing systems.</p>"
