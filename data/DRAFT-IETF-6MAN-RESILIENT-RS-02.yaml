abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When an interface on a host is initialized, the host transmits
    Router\n   Solicitations in order to minimize the amount of time it needs to\n
    \  wait until the next unsolicited multicast Router Advertisement is\n   received.
    \ In certain scenarios, these router solicitations\n   transmitted by the host
    might be lost.  This document specifies a\n   mechanism for hosts to cope with
    the loss of the initial Router\n   Solicitations.  Furthermore, on some links,
    unsolicited multicast\n   Router Advertisements are never sent and the mechanism
    in this\n   document is intended to work even in such scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n
