abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the nature of signals seen by on-path elements
    examining transport protocols, contrasting implicit and explicit signals. For
    example, TCP's state machine uses a series of well-known messages that are exchanged
    in the clear. Because these are visible to network elements on the path between
    the two nodes setting up the transport connection, they are often used as signals
    by those network elements. In transports that do not exchange these messages in
    the clear, on-path network elements lack those signals. Often, the removal of
    those signals is intended by those moving the messages to confidential channels.
    Where the endpoints desire that network elements along the path receive these
    signals, this document recommends explicit signals be used.</p>"
