abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this specification OSPF shortest path first computation
    is done\n   based on power ratios (consumed-power to available-bandwidth OR\n
    \  available-bandwidth to available-bandwidth) assigned to links and\n   nodes
    such as Broadcast-Multi-Access networks that form part of the\n   topology in
    an area. When MPLS is deployed in the area (be it the\n   backbone or non-backbone
    area) LDP can be used to distribute a\n   disjoint set of labels for the power
    based topology. Flows some or\n   all of those that traverse the area can then
    be mapped either to the\n   regular shortest-path tree or the power based shortest-path
    tree.\n   This document specifies the proposal to construct and maintain such
    a\n   tree called the power based SPT.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
