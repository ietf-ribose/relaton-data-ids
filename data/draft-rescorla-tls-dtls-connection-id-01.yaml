abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the "Connection ID" concept for the Datagram
    Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol, version 1.2 and version 1.3. A Connection
    ID is an identifier carried in the record layer header that gives the recipient
    additional information for selecting the appropriate security association. In
    "classical" DTLS, selecting a security association of an incoming DTLS record
    is accomplished with the help of the 5-tuple. If the source IP address and/or
    source port changes during the lifetime of an ongoing DTLS session then the receiver
    will be unable to locate the correct security context.</p>
