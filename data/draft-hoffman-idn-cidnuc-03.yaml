abstract:
- content: "<p>This protocol describes a transformation method for representing non-
    ASCII characters in domain names in a fashion that is completely compatible with
    the current DNS. It meets the many requirements for internationalization of domain
    names. Note: this protocol is quite experimental and should not be deployed in
    the Internet until it reaches standards track in the IETF.</p>"
