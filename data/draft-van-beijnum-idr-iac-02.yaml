abstract:
- content: "<p>Although BGP implementations have extensive path selection algorithms,
    in practice operators have trouble performing satisfactory traffic engineering
    of incoming traffic based on BGP attributes that are taken into account in the
    path selection algorithm alone. For this reason, many ASes deaggregate their address
    range(s) into smaller blocks and announce these blocks differently to different
    neighboring ASes in order to arrive at the desired traffic flow. This practice
    contributes to the growth of the global routing table, which drives up capital
    expenditures for networks engaging in inter-domain routing. This memo introduces
    a new inter-domain metric that supports finer-grained traffic engineering than
    current BGP attributes.</p>"
