abstract:
  content: "<p>Although BGP implementations have extensive path selectionalgorithms,
    in practice operators have trouble performingsatisfactory traffic engineering
    of incoming traffic based on BGPattributes that are taken into account in the
    path selectionalgorithm alone. For this reason, many ASes deaggregate theiraddress
    range(s) into smaller blocks and announce these blocksdifferently to different
    neighboring ASes in order to arrive at thedesired traffic flow. This practice
    contributes to the growth of theglobal routing table, which drives up capital
    expenditures fornetworks engaging in inter-domain routing. This memo introduces
    anew inter-domain metric that supports finer-grained trafficengineering than current
    BGP attributes.</p>"
