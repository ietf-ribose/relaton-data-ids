abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes three usages of the Extensible Markup\nLanguage
    (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) that allow a\nclient to provide authorization
    decisions regarding watchers of their\npresence. The first of these usages, called
    permission-statements,\ncontains statements about what permissions are to be granted
    to\nwatchers of presence. The second of these usages, called\ncompound-permissions,
    allows a client to define new permissions as\ncombinations of other defined permissions.
    The third usage, called\nsupported-permissions, allows a client to determine what
    permissions\nare understood by the provider.\n\t </p>\n      "
