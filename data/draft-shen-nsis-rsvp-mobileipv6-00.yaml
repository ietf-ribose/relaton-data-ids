abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo first gives a brief review of a RSVP and Mobile IPv6interoperation
    framework proposed in [1] and compared its featureswith the Performance Requirements
    set forth by Requirements of a QoSSolution for Mobile IP [2]. The subsequent part
    of the memo presentsspecification details including message formats, processing
    rules andalgorithms that form the framework. The vast majority of thesespecifications
    has been verified by a prototype implementation. It isexpected that this work
    could serve as a useful input in dealing withNSIS protocol and mobility issue.</p>"
