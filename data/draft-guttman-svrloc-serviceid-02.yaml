abstract:
  content: "<p>The Service Location Protocol (SLP) allows clients to discoverservices
    with little or no prior configuration. SLP can be used toadvertise services of
    any kind through the use of URLs. However, SLPuses URLs for two purposes: as a
    LOCATOR (indicating the location ofthe service) and as an IDENTIFIER (used for
    subsequent operations ona service, such as registration, deregistration and looking
    upattributes.) Confounding these two functions in one object leads tocertain problems.
    The serviceid: scheme separates identificationfrom location, eliminating these
    problems.</p>"
