abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  As of the deprecation of NAT-PT as a mechanism to allow IPv6-only\n
    \ hosts to connect to IPv4-only hosts, there is no longer a viable\n  way to provide
    interoperation between IPv4-only and IPv6-only hosts\n  connected to the internet.\n\n
    \ This document outlines a way to use the HTTP CONNECT method (better\n  known
    as HTTPS proxying) to accomplish this interoperation for a\n  large (but not the
    full) set of IP applications. The intent is to\n  provide a base level usability
    for IPv6-only hosts to remove the\n  need to provide IPv4 connectivity in all
    cases.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
