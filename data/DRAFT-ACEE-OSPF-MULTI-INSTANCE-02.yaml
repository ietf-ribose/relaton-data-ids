abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>OSPFv3 includes a mechanism for supporting multiple instances
    on the\nsame link.  OSPFv2 could benefit from such a mechanism in order to\nsupport
    multiple routing domains on the same subnet.  The OSPFv2\ninstance ID is reserved
    for support of separate OSPFv2 protocol\ninstances.  This is different from OSPFv3
    where it could be used for\nother purposes such as putting the same link in multiple
    areas.\nOSPFv2 supports this capability using a separate subnet or the OSPF\nmulti-area
    adjacency capability.\n\t </p>\n      "
