abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The crypto-conditions specification defines a set of encoding
    formats\n   and data structures for *conditions* and *fulfillments*.  A condition\n
    \  uniquely identifies a logical \"boolean circuit\" constructed from one\n   or
    more logic gates, evaluated by either validating a cryptographic\n   signature
    or verifying the preimage of a hash digest.  A fulfillment\n   is a data structure
    encoding one or more cryptographic signatures and\n   hash digest preimages that
    define the structure of the circuit and\n   provide inputs to the logic gates
    allowing for the result of the\n   circuit to be evaluated.\n\n   A fulfillment
    is validated by evaluating that the circuit output is\n   TRUE but also that the
    provided fulfillment matches the circuit\n   fingerprint, the condition.\n\n   Since
    evaluation of some of the logic gates in the circuit (those\n   that are signatures)
    also take a message as input the evaluation of\n   the entire fulfillment takes
    an optional input message which is\n   passed to each logic gate as required.
    \ As such the algorithm to\n   validate a fulfillment against a condition and
    a message matches that\n   of other signature schemes and a crypto-condition can
    serve as a\n   sophisticated and flexible replacement for a simple signature where\n
    \  the condition is used as the public key and the fulfillment as the\n   signature.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
