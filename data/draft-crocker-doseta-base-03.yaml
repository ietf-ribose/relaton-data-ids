abstract:
- content: <p>DomainKeys Security Tagging (DOSETA) is a component mechanism that enables
    easy development of security-related services, such as for authentication or encryption.
    It uses self-certifying keys based on domain names. The domain name owner can
    be any actor involved in the handling of the data, such as the author's organization,
    a server operator or one of their agents. The DOSETA Library provides a collection
    of common capabilities, including canonicalization, parameter tagging and key
    retrieval. The DOSETA Signing Template creates common framework for a signature
    of data that are in a "header/content" form. Defining the meaning of a signature
    is the responsibility of the service that incorporates DOSETA. Data security is
    enforced through the use of cryptographic algorithms.</p>
