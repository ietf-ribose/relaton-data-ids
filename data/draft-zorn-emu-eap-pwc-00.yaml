    authentication methods. One such method is Generic TokenCard (EAP-GTC) which,

    in tunneled EAP methods.EAP-GTC does not provide the ability to change a password
    (forexample, an expired password), however. This document defines thePassWord
    Change EAP method (EAP-PWC) in order to fill that void infunctionality.</p>"
