abstract:
- content: "<p>PMIPv6 is designed to provide network based mobility, it requries no
    changes to the UE. There are proposals to extend PMIPv6 to support flow mobility.
    Flow mobility requries the UE and the network having communication protocol to
    carry the flow control messages. This document proposes to use the extended IKEv2
    protocol to carry the flow control messages between the UE and network.</p>"
