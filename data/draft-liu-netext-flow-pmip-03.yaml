abstract:
  content: "<p>PMIPv6 is designed to provide network based mobility, it requries nochanges
    to the UE. There are proposals to extend PMIPv6 to supportflow mobility. Flow
    mobility requries the UE and the network havingcommunication protocol to carry
    the flow control messages. Thisdocument proposes to use the extended IKEv2 protocol
    to carry theflow control messages between the UE and network.</p>"
