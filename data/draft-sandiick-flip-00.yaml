abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Networks and network applications must be robust and reliable. Formany
    applications and services, such as packetized voice, correcting afailure must
    be almost instantaneous. The first step in correcting afailure is, of course,
    detecting that it occurred. IP routingprotocols and signaling protocols as well
    as many application layerprotocols incorporate their own keepalive mechanisms
    to detectfailures. Typically, these protocols detect failures on the order ofseconds
    or tens of seconds. While there are some physical and linklayer technologies that
    inherently supply link outage detection, notall link layers do this. In order
    to provide for fast failuredetection over any type of lower layer, an IP layer
    fast keepaliveprotocol can be used. This draft describes such a protocol for quicklydetecting
    when a network layer interface of a peer has failed.</p>"
