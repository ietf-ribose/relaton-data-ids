abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a protocol extension to RPL that enables to
    install a limited amount of centrally-computed routes in a RPL graph, enabling
    loose source routing down a non-storing mode DODAG, or transversal routes inside
    the DODAG. As opposed to the classical route injection in RPL that are injected
    by the end devices, this draft enables the root of the DODAG to projects the routes
    that are needed on the nodes where they should be installed.</p>"
