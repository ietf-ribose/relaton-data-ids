abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the server-based threading extension to
    the\nIMAP4rev1 protocol.  This extension provides substantial performance\nimprovements
    for IMAP clients which offer threaded views.\nA server which supports this extension
    indicates this with more or\nmore capability names consisting of 'THREAD-' followed
    by a supported\nthreading algorithm name as described in this document.  This\nprovides
    for future upwards-compatible extensions.\n\t </p>\n      "
