abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Currently BGP-4 is capable of carrying multiple (Outbound Route\nFilters)
    ORFs entries for a given \"AFI/SAFI\".  Each ORF provides a\nfilter that a route
    whose NLRI matches AFI/SAFI, must pass through to\nbe transmitted in the BGP Update
    message.  Efficient processing of\nORF filters may require ordering of individual
    ORFs in certain\nsequence and grouping of ORFs that should be applied together.
    \ The\ngrouping functionality also provides the support for logical OR\noperation
    between the grouped ORFs.\n\nThis group ORF provides an ORF type that specifies
    that ordering and\ngrouping.  The route set that passes set of ORFs running in
    a \"Group\nORF\" will pass the same ORFs sent in normal ORFs.\n\t </p>\n      "
