abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new multicast forwarding\n
    \  architecture which doesn't require an explicit tree-building protocol\n   and
    doesn't require intermediate routers to maintain any multicast\n   state.  BIER
    is applicable in a multi-tenant data center network\n   envioronment for efficient
    delivery of Broadcast, Unknown-unicast and\n   Multicast (BUM) traffic while eliminating
    the need for maitaining a\n   huge amount of multicast state in an underlay.  This
    document\n   describes BGP extensions for advertising the BIER-specific\n   information.
    \ These extesnions are applicable in those multi-tenant\n   data centers where
    BGP instead of IGP is deployed as an underlay for\n   network reachability advertisement.
    \ These extensions may also be\n   applicable in other scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n
