abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines an XML format for a buddy list, whichrepresents
    a list of other users a particular user would like tosubscribe to. When a presence
    client starts up, it needs to initiatesubscriptions to the users on the buddy
    list. By keeping this list ina standard XML format, the list can be stored locally,
    or retrievedremotely using HTTP or any other transfer protocol. The greatadvantage
    of storing it remotely is that a user can move from machineto machine, fetch their
    buddy list from a home server, and thensubscribe to those users. This provides
    personal mobility forpresence services.</p>"
