abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In some applications it may be necessary to send multiple media\n
    \  encodings derived from the same media source in independent RTP media\n   streams.
    \ This is called Simulcast.  This document discusses the best\n   way of accomplishing
    this in RTP and how to signal it in SDP.  It is\n   concluded that a solution
    where the different simulcast versions are\n   based on separate SDP media descriptions
    provides best support for\n   simulcast.  A solution is defined by making two
    extensions to SDP.\n   The first extension consists of two new attributes in SDP
    that\n   express capability to send or receive simulcast streams,\n   respectively.
    \ The second extension describes how to group media\n   descriptions belonging
    to the same simulcast source by using the\n   grouping framework.\n\n\t </p>\n
