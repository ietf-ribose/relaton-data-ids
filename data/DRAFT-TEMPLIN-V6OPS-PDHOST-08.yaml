abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers
    which\n   then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks.\n
    \  This document considers the case when the \"requesting router\" is\n   actually
    an end system which receives a delegated prefix that it can\n   use for its own
    sub-delegation and/or multi-addressing purposes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
