abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an adaptive Non-Congestion Robustness
    (aNCR)\n   mechanism for TCP.  In the absence of explicit congestion\n   notification
    from the network, TCP uses only packet loss as an\n   indication of congestion.
    \ One of the signals TCP uses to determine\n   loss is the arrival of three duplicate
    acknowledgments.  However,\n   this heuristic is not always correct, notably in
    the case when paths\n   reorder packets.  This results in degraded performance.\n\n
    \  TCP-aNCR is designed to mitigate this performance degradation by\n   adaptively
    increasing the number of duplicate acknowledgments\n   required to trigger loss
    recovery, based on the current state of the\n   connection, in an effort to better
    disambiguate true segment loss\n   from segment reordering.  This document specifies
    the changes to TCP\n   and TCP-NCR (on which this specification build on) and
    discusses the\n   costs and benefits of these modifications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
