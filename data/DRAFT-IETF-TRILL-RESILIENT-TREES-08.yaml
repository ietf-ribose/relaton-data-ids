abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol\n
    \  provides multicast data forwarding based on IS-IS link state routing.\n   Distribution
    trees are computed based on the link state information\n   through Shortest Path
    First calculation. When a link on the\n   distribution tree fails, a campus-wide
    re-convergence of this\n   distribution tree will take place, which can be time
    consuming and\n   may cause considerable disruption to the ongoing multicast service.\n\n
    \  This document specifies how to build backup distribution trees to\n   protect
    links on the primary distribution tree. Since the backup\n   distribution tree
    is built up ahead of the link failure, when a link\n   on the primary distribution
    tree fails, the pre-installed backup\n   forwarding table will be utilized to
    deliver multicast packets\n   without waiting for the campus-wide re-convergence.
    This minimizes\n   the service disruption. This document updates RFC 6325.\n\n\t
