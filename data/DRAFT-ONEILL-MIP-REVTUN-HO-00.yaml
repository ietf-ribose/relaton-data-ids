abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Reverse tunneling in RFC3024 [RevTun] introduces new packet loss
    \  \nscenarios at the HA and also incurs similar packet routing issues as \nRFC3220
    [MIPv4] between Foreign Agents, during a handoff. Whether a Co-\nlocated Care-of-Address
    or a Foreign Agent Care-of-Address is used \nduring Mobile IP registration, any
    packets from the new Foreign that \nare received at the Home Agent before the
    visitor list has been updated \nwill be dropped. In addition, any in-flight packets
    from the old \nForeign agent will be dropped once the visitor list has been updated.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
