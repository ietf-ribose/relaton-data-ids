abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document examines the problems and challenges associated
    with\n   the process of setting up secure virtual network connections among\n
    \  authorized network nodes.  The network nodes can be located anywhere\n   in
    a private or public network, directly connected or behind one or\n   more levels
    of NAT.  Setting up a secure virtual network in this\n   environment entails the
    resolution of various issues such as\n   authentication, peer discovery, virtual
    network address management,\n   and connection parameters determination.\n\n\t
