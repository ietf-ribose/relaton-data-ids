abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A variety of mechanisms for implementing Virtual Private Network(VPN)
    utilizing public IP network infrastructure have been proposedin [1,2,3,4] and
    more may be emerging. This document attempts toidentify a set of criteria for
    evaluating such mechanisms. Thecriteria could be used by IETF for evaluating a
    VPN proposal beforeadvancing it to standard track or by VPN Service Providers
    orenterprise network administrators for choosing which mechanism to usein order
    to implement their desired VPN networks. The mechanisms thiscriteria addresses
    are exclusively for implementing IP based VPNs, asoppose to non-IP based ones,
    such as Frame Relay based VPNs, etc.</p>"
