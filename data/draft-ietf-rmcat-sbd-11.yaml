abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to detect whether end-to-end data
    flows share a common bottleneck. This mechanism relies on summary statistics that
    are calculated based on continuous measurements and used as input to a grouping
    algorithm that runs wherever the knowledge is needed.</p>"
