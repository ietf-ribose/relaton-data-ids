abstract:
- content: <p>Path MTU Discovery between end-host-devices/Virtual-Machines/servers/
    workloads connected over an EVPN-Overlay Network in an Datacenter/Campus/enterprise
    deployment, is a problem, yet to be resolved in the standards forums. It needs
    a converged solution to ensure optimal usage of network and computational resources
    of the underlay routers/switches forming the basis of the overlay network. This
    documents takes leads from the guidelines presented in [RFC4459]. The overlay
    connectivity can pan across various sites (geographically seperated or collocated)
    for realizing a Datacenter Interconnect or intersite VPNs between campus sites
    (buildings, branch offices etc). This literature intends to solve problem of icmp
    error propagation from an underlay routing/switching device to an end-host (hooked
    to EVPN overlay), thus facilitating "accurate MTU" learnings. This document also
    leverages the icmp multipart message extension, mentioned in [RFC4884] to carry
    the original packet in the icmp PDU.</p>
