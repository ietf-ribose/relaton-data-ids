abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a schema, object classes and attributes,
    for\n   Printers and Print Services, for use with directories that support\n   Lightweight
    Directory Access Protocol (RFC 4510).  This document is\n   based on the Printer
    attributes listed in Appendix E of Internet\n   Printing Protocol/1.1 (RFC 2911).
    \ Additional Printer attributes are\n   based on definitions in the Printer MIB
    v2 (RFC 3805), IEEE-ISTO PWG\n   Command Set for IEEE 1284 Device ID (PWG 5107.2),
    IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP\n   Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 (PWG 5100.13), and IEEE-ISTO
    PWG\n   IPP Everywhere (PWG 5100.14).\n\n   This document is an individual submission
    to the IETF by the Internet\n   Printing Protocol Working Group of the IEEE-ISTO
    Printer Working\n   Group, as part of their PWG IPP Everywhere (PWG 5100.14) project
    for\n   secure mobile printing with vendor-neutral Client software.\n\n   This
    document obsoletes RFC 3712.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
