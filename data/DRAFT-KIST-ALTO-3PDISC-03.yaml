abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is
    to\n   provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several\n   hosts
    from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired\n   resource.  ALTO is
    realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an\n   ALTO client can ask for guidance
    it needs to discover one or more\n   ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance.\n\n
    \  This document specifies a procedure for third-party ALTO server\n   discovery,
    which can be used if the ALTO client is not co-located\n   with the actual resource
    consumer, but instead embedded in a third\n   party such as a peer-to-peer tracker.\n\n
    \  Technically, the algorithm specified in this document takes one\n   IP address
    and a U-NAPTR Service Parameter (i.e., \"ALTO:http\" or\n   \"ALTO:https\") as
    parameters.  It performs several DNS lookups (for\n   PTR, SOA, and U-NAPTR resource
    records) and returns one or more\n   URI(s) of information resources related to
    that IP address.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
