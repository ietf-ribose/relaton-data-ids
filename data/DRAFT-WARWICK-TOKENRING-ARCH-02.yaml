abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document  contains  an  extract from the approved text
    of IEEE\n   standard 802.5R ''Dedicated Token Ring''.   The  extract  comprises\n
    \  the  MIB for the Dedicated Token Ring Concentrator, in SNMPv2 format.\n   The
    changes from the previous version of this draft are small but\n   important, and
    are in the area of CRF creation, where a RowStatus\n   mechanism replaces the
    previous way of creating CRFs.\n \n   802.5R  is a standard that encompasses the
    existing 802.5 token-\n   passing method of operation, and also defines a new
    duplex method of\n   operation for use only on dedicated point to point links,
    that does\n   not use tokens for data transmission.\n \n   The architecture of
    a DTR  Concentrator is defined in the 802.5R\n   standard.  It  is a MAC layer
    bridging device, which uses a new set\n   of forwarding rules that  ease interoperability
    between source\n   routing and transparent bridging in an  802.5  LAN.  The DTR\n
    \  Concentrator MIB is derived from the Source Routing and Transparent\n   Bridge
    MIBs  (RFCs 1525 and 1493).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
