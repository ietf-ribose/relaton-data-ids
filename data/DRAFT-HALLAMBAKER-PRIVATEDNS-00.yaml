abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes Private DNS, a transport security mechanism\n
    \  for the DNS protocol. The mechanism may be employed to secure\n   communication
    between a client and its resolver or between a resolver\n   and an authoritative
    server.\n\n   Service binding including key exchange is effected using the JSON\n
    \  Service Connect (JCX) Protocol. DNS protocol messages are wrapped in\n   a
    new framing protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
