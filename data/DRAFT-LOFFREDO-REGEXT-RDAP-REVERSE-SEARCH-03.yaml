abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include
    query\n   capabilities to find the list of domains related to a set of entities\n
    \  matching a given search pattern.  Even if such capabilities, commonly\n   referred
    to as reverse search, respond to some needs not yet readily\n   fulfilled by the
    current Whois protocol, they have raised concern\n   from two perspectives: server
    processing impact and data privacy.\n   Anyway, the impact of the reverse queries
    on RDAP servers processing\n   is the same of the standard searches and it can
    be reduced by\n   implementing policies to deal with big result sets, while data\n
    \  privacy risks can be mitigated by RDAP access control\n   functionalities.
    \ This document describes RDAP query extensions that\n   allows clients to request
    a reverse search based on the domains-\n   entities relationship.\n\n\t </p>\n
