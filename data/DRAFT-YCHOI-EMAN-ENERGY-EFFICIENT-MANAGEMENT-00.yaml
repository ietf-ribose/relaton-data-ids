abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Wireless network devices which have limited resources (e.g.,
    power\n   supply, memory, computing capabilities, and so on) should consider\n
    \  energy-efficient management.  However, the existing network\n   architectures
    for the network devices have some problems on energy\n   management about device
    failures and errors.  To improve the energy\n   management problem, this document
    proposes energy-efficient\n   management framework for the network devices.\n\n\t
