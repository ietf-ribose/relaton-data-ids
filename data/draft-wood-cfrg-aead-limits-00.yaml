abstract:
- content: "<p>An Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm provides
    confidentiality and integrity. Excessive use of the same key can give an attacker
    advantages in breaking these properties. This document provides simple guidance
    for users of common AEAD functions about how to limit the use of keys in order
    to bound the advantage given to an attacker.</p>"
