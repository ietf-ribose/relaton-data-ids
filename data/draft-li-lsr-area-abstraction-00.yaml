abstract:
- content: "<p>Link state routing protocols have hierarchical abstraction already
    built into them. However, when lower levels are used for transit, they must expose
    their internal topologies, leading to scale issues. To avoid this, this document
    discusses extensions to the IS-IS routing protocol that would allow level 1 areas
    to provide transit, yet only inject an abstraction of the level 1 topology into
    level 2.</p>"
