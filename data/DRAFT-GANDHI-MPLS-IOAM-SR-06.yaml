    records\n   operational and telemetry information in the data packet while the\n
    \  packet traverses a path between two nodes in the network.  This\n   document
    defines how IOAM data fields are transported with MPLS data\n   plane encapsulation
    using new Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
