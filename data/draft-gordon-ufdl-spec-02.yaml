abstract:
- content: "<p>The Universal Forms Description Language (UFDL) describes complex business
    forms for use over the Internet. The objective of the UFDL is to enable the creation
    of cross-platform Internet business forms that (1) contain both the complex logic
    and precise layout that administrators require, (2) are simple to maintain and
    distribute, and (3) integrate easily with existing business systems. As more and
    more business is done over the Internet, the need for a form description language
    that incorporates these features grows. HTML is designed for Internet pages, and
    is severely limited as a form language. This document specifies the vocabulary,
    syntax, and meaning of the UFDL.</p>"
