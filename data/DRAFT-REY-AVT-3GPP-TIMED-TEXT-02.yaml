abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an RTP payload format for the transmission
    of \n3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) timed text.  3GPP timed \ntext
    is time-lined decorated text media format based on the ISO \n(International Standardisation
    Organisation) Base Media File Format.  \nAs of today, 3GPP timed text contents
    can be downloaded via HTTP and \nsynchronised with audio/video contents.  There
    is however no \navailable mechanism for streaming 3GPP timed text.  In the following
    \nsections the problems of streaming timed text are addressed and a \npayload
    format for streaming 3GPP timed text over RTP is specified.\n\t </p>\n      "
