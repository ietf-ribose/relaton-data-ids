abstract:
- content: "<p>When an IP multicast tree needs to pass through an MPLS domain, it
    is advantageous to map the tree to a Point-to-Multipoint or Multipoint- to-Multipoint
    Label Switched Path. This document specifies a way to provide a one-one mapping
    between IP multicast trees and Label Switched Paths using mLDP signaling. The
    IP multicast control messages are translated into MPLS control messages when they
    enter the MPLS domain, and are translated back into IP multicast control messages
    at the far end of the MPLS domain. The IP multicast control information is coded
    into the MPLS control information in such a way as to ensure that a single Multipoint
    Label Switched Path gets set up for each IP multicast tree.</p>"
