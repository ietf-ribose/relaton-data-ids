abstract:
  content: "\t <t>When an IP multicast tree needs to pass through an MPLS domain,
    it isadvantageous to map the tree to a Point-to-Multipoint or Multipoint-to-Multipoint
    Label Switched Path. This document specifies a way toprovide a one-one mapping
    between IP multicast trees and LabelSwitched Paths using mLDP signaling. The IP
    multicast controlmessages are translated into MPLS control messages when they
    enterthe MPLS domain, and are translated back into IP multicast controlmessages
    at the far end of the MPLS domain. The IP multicast controlinformation is coded
    into the MPLS control information in such a wayas to ensure that a single Multipoint
    Label Switched Path gets set upfor each IP multicast tree.</p>"
