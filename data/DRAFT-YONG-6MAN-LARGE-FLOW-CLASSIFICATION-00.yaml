abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Network traffic has shown the combination of few very high bit\nrate
    flows (large flow) and huge amount of very low bit flows\n(small flow), which
    causes uneven load balance over ECMP paths.\nDifferentiating large flow and small
    flow packets in IP/MPLS\nnetworks enables enhanced ECMP transport. Enhanced ECMP
    applies\ndifferent distribution methods to large flow packets and small\nflow
    packets to improve the load balance. The classification also\nenables an effective
    congestion control. This draft proposes large\nflow classification in IPv6 protocol
    for this purpose.\n\t </p>\n      "
