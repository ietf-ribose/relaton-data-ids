abstract:
- content: "<p>The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
    to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models in the Internet
    of Things. It was created as a common language for use in the development of the
    One Data Model liaison organization (OneDM) definitions. Tools convert this format
    to database formats and other serializations as needed. An SDF specification often
    needs to be augmented by additional information that is specific to its use in
    a particular ecosystem or application. SDF mapping files provide a mechanism to
    represent this augmentation.</p>"
