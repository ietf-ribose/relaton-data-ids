abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) protocol provides authentication,\n
    \  confidentiality, integrity, data-origin authentication and anti-\n   replay.
    \ Currently, IKEv2 is mainly used as a control channel to\n   negotiate IPsec
    SA(s).  IPsec is not well suited to provide transport\n   layer security for applications
    as it resides at the network layer\n   and most of the IPsec implementations require
    integration into\n   operating systems making it difficult to deploy.  IPsec uses\n
    \  different sessions for control and data traffic which is not NAT and\n   load
    balancer friendly.  TLS/DTLS, the other popular security\n   mechanism to provide
    the above security services does not mandate\n   mutual peer authentication and
    Diffie Hellman exchange.\n\n   This document describes an IKEv2 based lightweight
    secure data\n   communication protocol and a way to provide transport layer security\n
    \  for UDP client/server applications.  The protocol provides integrity\n   protected
    encryption and integrity-only protection based on\n   application needs.  As most
    of the IoT applications are UDP based,\n   IKEv2 can be used for key management
    as well secure data\n   communication in IoT due to its simplicity, scalability,\n
    \  lightweightedness and ease of deployment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
