abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   LISP upgrades the architecture of the IPvN internetworking
    system by\n   separating location and identity, current intermingled in IPvN\n
    \  addresses. This is a change which has been identified by the IRTF as\n   a
    critically necessary evolutionary architectural step for the\n   Internet. In
    LISP, nodes have both a 'locator' (a name which says\n   _where_ in the network's
    connectivity structure the node is) and an\n   'identifier' (a name which serves
    only to provide a persistent handle\n   for the node). A node may have more than
    one locator, or its locator\n   may change over time (e.g. if the node is mobile),
    but it keeps the\n   same identifier.\n\n   This document gives additional architectural
    insight into LISP, and\n   considers a number of aspects of LISP from a high-level
    standpoint.\n\n   [NOTE: This is still a somewhat rough draft version; a few sections\n
    \  at the end are just rough frameworks, but almost all the key\n   sections,
    and all the front part of the document, are here, and in\n   something like reasonably
    complete form.]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
