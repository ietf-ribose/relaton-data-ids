abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how unexpected traffic flows can emerge across
    an autonomous system as the result of other autonomous systems filtering or restricting
    the propagation of more-specific prefixes. We provide a review of the techniques
    to detect the occurrence of this issue and defend against it.</p>"
