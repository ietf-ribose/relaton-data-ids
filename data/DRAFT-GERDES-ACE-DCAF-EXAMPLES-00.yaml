abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Constrained nodes are devices which are limited in terms of\n
    \  processing power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission\n   capacity.
    \ Due to these constraints, commonly used security protocols\n   are not easily
    applicable.  Nevertheless, an authentication and\n   authorization solution is
    needed to ensure the security of these\n   devices.\n\n   The Delegated CoAP Authorization
    Framework (DCAF) specifies how\n   resource-constrained nodes can delegate defined
    authentication- and\n   authorization-related tasks to less-constrained devices
    called\n   Authorization Managers, thus limiting the hardware requirements of\n
    \  the security solution for the constrained devices.\n\n   To realize the vision
    of \"one Internet for all\", constrained devices\n   need to securely establish
    trust relationships with less constrained\n   devices.  This document lists examples
    for using DCAF with less\n   constrained devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
