abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC3986 Section 3.1 defines URI syntax as \"a federated and
    extensible\n   naming system my further restrict the syntax and semantics of\n
    \  identifiers using that scheme.\"  In other words, the structure of a\n   URI
    is defined by its scheme.  While it is common for schemes to\n   further delegate
    their substructure to the URI's owner, publishing\n   standards that mandate particular
    forms of URI substructure is\n   inappropriate, because the effectively usurps
    ownership.\n\n   This document is intended to prevent this practice (sometimes
    called\n   \"URI Squatting\") in standards, but updating RFC3986 to indicate where\n
    \  it is acceptable.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
