abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines HTTP header fields that enable a TLS terminating
    reverse proxy to convey information to a backend server about the validated Token
    Binding Message received from a client, which enables that backend server to bind,
    or verify the binding of, cookies and other security tokens to the client's Token
    Binding key. This facilitates the reverse proxy and backend server functioning
    together as though they are a single logical server side deployment of HTTPS Token
    Binding.</p>"
