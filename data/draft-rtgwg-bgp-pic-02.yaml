abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In the network comprising thousands of iBGP peers exchanging millionsof
    routes, many routes are reachable via more than one path. Giventhe large scaling
    targets, it is desirable to restore traffic afterfailure in a time period that
    does not depend on the number of BGPprefixes. In this document we proposed a technique
    by which trafficcan be re-routed to ECMP or pre-calculated backup paths in atimeframe
    that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. Theobjective is achieved through
    organizing the forwarding chains in ahierarchical manner and sharing forwarding
    elements among the maximumpossible number of routes. The proposed technique achieves
    prefixindependent convergence while ensuring incremental deployment,complete transparency
    and automation, and zero management andprovisioning effort</p>"
