abstract:
  content: '<p>The rules for SIP proxies are organized so that when a UAC sends anout-of-dialog
    request, even if the request is forked to a number ofUASs, (usually) only one
    UAS will accept the request, and only thefinal response from that UAS will be
    returned to the UAC. Thisforking mechanism is optimal for an INVITE intended to
    connect onehuman user with another human uses, but is poor for requests thathave
    a "one to many" nature, especially PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBErequests, but also including
    some INVITEs. This document proposes analternative forking mechanism that better
    supports "one to many"requests, and that mechanism be the standardized meaning
    of the(existing but weakly specified) "Request-Disposition: no-cancel,parallel"
    header.</p>'
