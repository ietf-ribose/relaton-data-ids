abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some applications use DNS messages, or parts of DNS messages,
    as\n   data.  For example, a system that captures DNS queries and responses\n
    \  might want to be able to easily search those without having to decode\n   the
    messages each time.  Another example is a system that puts\n   together DNS queries
    and responses from message parts.  This document\n   describes a general format
    for DNS message data in JSON.  Specific\n   profiles of this document can be described
    in other documents for\n   specific applications and usage scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n
