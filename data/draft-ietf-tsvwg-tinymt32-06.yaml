abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the TinyMT32 Pseudorandom Number Generator
    (PRNG), which produces 32-bit pseudorandom unsigned integers and aims at having
    a simple-to-use and deterministic solution. This PRNG is a small-sized variant
    of the Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNG. The main advantage of TinyMT32 over MT is the
    use of a small internal state, compatible with most target platforms that include
    embedded devices, while keeping reasonably good randomness that represents a significant
    improvement compared to the Park-Miller Linear Congruential PRNG. However, neither
    the TinyMT nor MT PRNG is meant to be used for cryptographic applications.</p>"
