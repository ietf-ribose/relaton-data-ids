abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The unpredictability of consumers, routers, copyholders, and\n
    \  publishers for the in-network data retrievals in Content-Centric\n   Networking
    (CCN) / Named Data Networking (NDN) poses a challenge to\n   design an authentication
    mechanism to inhibit the malicious consumers\n   to flood data requests and prevent
    the fake data from being provided.\n   Signature is adopted as the fundamental
    function in CCN / NDN, which\n   however can only provide publisher authentication
    with additional\n   certificate acquisition.  This document describes the the
    Hop-by-Hop\n   Authentication mechanism (HopAuth) integrating certificate collection\n
    \  and packet forwarding potentially with the assistance from\n   certificate
    authority to provide consumer authentication, copyholder\n   authentication and
    path authentication to enable the in-network data\n   retrieval to be trustworthy,
    besides the publisher authentication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
