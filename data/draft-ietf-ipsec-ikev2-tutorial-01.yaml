abstract:
  content: "<p>The main job of a protocol specification is to document how theprotocol
    works. It is sometimes difficult to learn how a protocolworks from such a document,
    because there are so many details, andthe necessary formalism for accuracy makes
    a specification long andintimidating to read. What also is usually lost in the
    process ofcreating an RFC for a protocol is documentation of the tradeoffs thatwere
    considered when making controversial choices. Sometimes it ispossible to find
    this information on the email archives, but that isa daunting task. This document
    is intended to work both as atutorial to understanding IKEv2, and a summary of
    the controversialissues, with the reasoning on all sides of each issue. If anydifferences
    in details exist between this document and the IKEv2specification, the IKEv2 specification
    is authoritative. Thisdocument is intended only to make the IKEv2 specification
    moreunderstandable on the first reading, as well as documenting reasoningbehind
    decisions.</p>"
