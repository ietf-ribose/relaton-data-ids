abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes two extensions to the POP protocol that
    have\n been supported for several years by some client and servers.  One\n extension,
    MANGLE, allows clients to request that MIME body parts be\n removed or converted
    to a simpler format, that only selected headers\n be transmitted, and/or for the
    message to be transcoded to a\n different character set.  The other extension,
    MACRO, allows clients\n to define macros which are expanded when used, saving
    repetitive\n transmissions.\n \n The MANGLE extension has been useful in at least
    two situations: it\n allows clients on constrained devices to avoid downloading
    body\n parts which cannot be used on the device, and clients which use the\n TOP
    command to \"peek\" at messages can have the preview transformed\n into more usable
    content, as well as avoiding the transmission of\n undesired headers.  The MACRO
    extension has been especially useful\n in conjunction with MANGLE, since a MANGLE
    request can become\n relatively lengthy.\n\t </p>\n      "
