abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes a simple defense mechanism against a specific\ntype
    of network flooding attacks.  The suggested mechanism requires a\nmobile node
    to establish a 'symbiotic relationship' with the\ninfrastructure, in order to
    empower it to repel such attack while\ngiving enough insurance to the source(s)
    of the traffic about the\nneed to cease sending traffic to the targeted network.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
