abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To date, the HTTP access authentication framework, as described
    in \n[RFC2617] and as used in [SIPbis05], has permitted limited SIP \nmessage
    authentication from UAC to Proxy/UAS, Proxy to Proxy, and \nProxy to UAS. This
    draft addresses some of the shortcomings of SIP \nusage of Digest for message
    authentication between a SIP User Agent \nand a Proxy one hop away (e.g., an outbound
    Proxy). For the messages \nexchanged between the UA and a Proxy one hop away,
    the Service \nProvider may want to provide a different level of protection than
    \nthat possible for the same messages end-to-end.\n\t </p>\n      "
