abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The interconnection of Content Distribution Networks (CDNs)
    is\n   predicated on the ability of downstream CDNs (dCDNs) to handle end-\n   user
    requests in a functionally equivalent manner to the upstream CDN\n   (uCDN).  The
    uCDN must be able to assess the ability of the dCDN to\n   handle individual requests.
    \ A CDN interconnection (CDNI) interface\n   is needed to facilitate the advertisement
    of capabilities by the dCDN\n   to the uCDN.  This document describes an approach
    to implementing a\n   CDNI capabilities advertisement interface.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
