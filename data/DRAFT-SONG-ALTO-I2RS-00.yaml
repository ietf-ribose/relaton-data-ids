abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the scenarios that applications can
    use the\n   network layer especially the network routing system exposed\n   information,
    so as to optimize application layer traffic.  The use\n   cases in this document
    include the ISP broadband network (using P2P\n   and CDN as examples) and the
    data center network.  And this document\n   also describes which information should
    be collected for\n   ALTO[I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] service, and eventually optimize
    the\n   traffic.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
