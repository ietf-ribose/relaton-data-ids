abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       Opaque Link-State Advertisements (LSA) extend the topological
    \n       link state of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). The information \n       contained
    in Opaque LSA may be used directly by OSPF or \n       indirectly by some application
    wishing to distribute information \n       throughout the OSPF domain. However
    the Link-State Database \n       (LSDB) synchronization process is kept unified,
    i.e., there is  \n       no messaging or processing allowing to order the exchanges
    in \n       the link state database synchronization process. We call this \n       ordering,
    phasing of logically segmented LSDB into Opaque and \n       non-Opaque. The motivation
    is to prevent delaying reaching Full \n       state whereas synchronizing over
    the entire LSDB would delay \n       full adjacency establishment. \n\t </p>\n
