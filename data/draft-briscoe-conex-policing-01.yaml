abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes why policing using congestion information can
    isolate users from network performance degradation due to each other's usage,
    but without losing the multiplexing benefits of a LAN- style network where anyone
    can use any amount of any resource. Extensive numerical examples and diagrams
    are given. The document is agnostic to how the congestion information reaches
    the policer. The congestion exposure (ConEX) protocol is recommended, but other
    tunnel feedback mechanisms have been proposed.</p>"
