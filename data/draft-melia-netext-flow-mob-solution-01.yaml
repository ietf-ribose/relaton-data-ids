abstract:
  content: "<p>The Netext WG has been recently rechartered to determine what ProxyMobile
    IPv6 extensions are required for flow mobility support of a MNimplementing the
    single IP interface hiding mechanism. This documentbriefly introduces the single
    IP interface hiding mechanism and itderives the associated protocol operations
    to enable seamless flowmobility across multiple access networks. These extensions
    areintended to allow such mobile nodes to send and receive IP packets onmultiple
    physical media in a simultaneous and possibly discriminatedmanner when attached
    to a PMIPv6 domain. A typical usage of theseextensions is to perform downlink
    flow discrimination throughmultiple interfaces based on filtering rules (i.e.
    dedicate one MNphysical media to VOIP traffic and another MN media to HTTP traffic).The
    proposed extensions to PMIPv6 attempt to increment in a backwardcompatible manner
    the current PMIPv6 specification. In additionthese extensions use, when possible,
    existing specifications relatedto multihoming support at IETF and conform to the
    problem statementof Netext Working Group.</p>"
