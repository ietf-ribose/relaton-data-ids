abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   FSP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol that
    provides\n   mobility and multihoming support by introducing the concept of 'upper\n
    \  layer thread ID', which is associated with some shared secret that is\n   applied
    to protect authenticity of the origin of the FSP packets.\n\n   It introduces
    the concept of transmit transaction to facilitate a\n   quad-party sub-protocol
    for shared secret installation.\n\n   It provides transport layer features of
    zero round-trip connection\n   multiplication and on-the-wire compression, in
    addition to ubiquitous\n   message authentication with optional encryption service.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
