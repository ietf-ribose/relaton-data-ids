abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer\n
    \  Reachability Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be used\n   to
    distribute traffic Flow Specifications.  This allows the routing\n   system to
    propagate information regarding more specific components of\n   the traffic aggregate
    defined by an IP destination prefix.\n\n   It also specifies BGP Extended Community
    encoding formats, that can\n   be used to propagate Traffic Filtering Actions
    along with the Flow\n   Specification NLRI.  Those Traffic Filtering Actions encode
    actions a\n   routing system can take if the packet matches the Flow Specification.\n\n
    \  Additionally, it defines two applications of that encoding format:\n   one
    that can be used to automate inter-domain coordination of traffic\n   filtering,
    such as what is required in order to mitigate\n   (distributed) denial-of-service
    attacks, and a second application to\n   provide traffic filtering in the context
    of a BGP/MPLS VPN service.\n   Other applications (e.g. centralized control of
    traffic in a SDN or\n   NFV context) are also possible.  Other documents may specify
    Flow\n   Specification extensions.\n\n   The information is carried via BGP, thereby
    reusing protocol\n   algorithms, operational experience, and administrative processes
    such\n   as inter-provider peering agreements.\n\n   This document obsoletes both
    RFC5575 and RFC7674.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
