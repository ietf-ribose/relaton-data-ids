abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Redundancy protection provides a mechanism to achieve the high\n
    \  reliability of the service transmission in network.  Specifically,\n   packets
    of flows are replicated into two or more copies, which are\n   transported through
    different paths in parallel.  When copies of\n   packets are merged at network
    node, the redundant packets are\n   eliminated to guarantee one copy of the flow
    is successfully\n   transmitted.\n\n   This document extends the capabilities
    in SR paradigm to support\n   redundancy protection function, including the definitions
    of new\n   Segments and a variation of Segment Routing Policy.  The new\n   mechanism
    applies equally to both Segment Routing with MPLS data\n   plane (SR-MPLS) and
    Segment Routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
