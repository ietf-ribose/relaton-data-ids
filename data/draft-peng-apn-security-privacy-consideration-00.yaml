abstract:
- content: "<p>APN (Application-aware Networking) architecture aims to convey Application-aware
    Information including application/user/flow identifiers and SLA/service requirements
    along with the data packets into the network and make the network aware of applications
    and their requirements in order to provide corresponding application-aware network
    services and guarantee their SLA requirements. There have been challenges of the
    privacy and security issues that could potentially be introduced by conveying
    the application-aware information into the network. This document describes the
    security and privacy considerations of APN in various possible scenarios wherein
    APN will be deployed.</p>"
