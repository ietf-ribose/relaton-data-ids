abstract:
- content: "<p>Typically applications developers have requested static IANA assignments
    for the applications, even if the applications would typically be only used within
    a site, between consenting sites, or would not eventually even use multicast at
    all. This memo describes this problem space, and summarizes a number of proposed
    approaches to mitigating these problems.</p>"
