abstract:
- content: "<p>The Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol
    defines two entities: a Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and an Access Controller
    (AC). The CAPWAP protocol binding for IEEE 802.11 defines two MAC (Medium Access
    Control) modes for IEEE 802.11 WTP: Split and Local MAC, and describes the required
    functionality split between the WTP and AC for each mode. However, in the Split
    MAC mode, the partitioning of encryption/decryption functions are not clearly
    defined. In the Split MAC mode description, IEEE 802.11 encryption is specified
    as located in either at the AC or the WTP, with no clear way for the AC to inform
    the WTP of where the encryption functionality should be located. This lack of
    specification leads to interoperability issues, especially when the AC and WTP
    come from different vendors. To prevent interoperability issues, this specification
    defines an IEEE 802.11 MAC profile message element in which each profile specifies
    an unambiguous division of encryption functionality between the WTP and AC. The
    IEEE 802.11 MAC profile is used as follows: the WTP informs the AC of the supported
    profiles during the discovery or join process and the AC configures the WTP with
    one of the supported profiles when configuring the WLAN.</p>"
