abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a protocol, called kx509, for using
    Kerberos\n   tickets to acquire X.509 certificates.  These certificates may be\n
    \  used for many of the same purposes as X.509 certificates acquired by\n   other
    means, but if a Kerberos infrastructure already exists then the\n   overhead of
    using kx509 may be much less.\n\n   While not standardized, this protocol is already
    in use at several\n   large organizations, and certificates issued with this protocol
    are\n   recognized by the International Grid Trust Federation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
