abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Because one MPLS label only identifies one single flow on a
    link\n   between two MPLS routers, information related to one MPLS label is\n
    \  exchanged only between (physically and logically) neighbour routers.\n   In
    other words, MPLS label have a link-local significance on which\n   two neighbour
    routers have previously agreed on.  It is therefore not\n   a trivial task for
    a network operator to know where a flow is going\n   as it implies to retreive
    the MPLS labels mappings on each hops in\n   order to get a complete view of end-to-end
    LSP paths.  This taks is\n   even harder when it comes to get the MPLS label mappings
    over time in\n   a purpose of monitoring and/or troubleshooting network services.\n\n
    \  This document thus defines a new method to monitor MPLS label\n   mappings
    that collects and stores MPLS labels mapping information so\n   as to offer to
    one IP/MPLS network operator a reliable and clear view\n   of its network LSPs
    end-to-end establishment over time while\n   minimising the impact on network
    convergence and router CPU.\n\t </p>\n      "
