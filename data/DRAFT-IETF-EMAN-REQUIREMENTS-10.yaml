abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines requirements for standards specifications
    for\n   energy management.  The requirements defined in this document concern\n
    \  monitoring functions as well as control functions: Monitoring\n   functions
    include identification of energy-managed devices and their\n   components, monitoring
    of their power states, power inlets, power\n   outlets, actual power, power properties,
    received energy, provided\n   energy, and contained batteries.  Control functions
    serve for\n   controlling power supply and power state of energy-managed devices\n
    \  and their components.\n   This document does not specify the features that
    must be implemented\n   by compliant implementations but rather features that
    must be\n   supported by standards for energy management.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
