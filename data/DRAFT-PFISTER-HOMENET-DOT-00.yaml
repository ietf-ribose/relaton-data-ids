abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the behavior that is expected from
    the Domain\n   Name System with regard to DNS queries for names ending with\n
    \  '.homenet.', thereby defining this top-level domain as a special-use\n   domain
    name [RFC6761].  The '.homenet' top-level domain intends to\n   replace '.home'
    which was originally proposed in [RFC7788] as default\n   domain-name for home
    networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
