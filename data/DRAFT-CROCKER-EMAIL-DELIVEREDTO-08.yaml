abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The address to which email is delivered might be different
    than any\n   of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields, created\n
    \  by the email's author.  For example, the address used by the email\n   transport
    service is provided separately, such as through SMTP's\n   \"RCPT TO\" command.
    \ Before final delivery, handling can entail a\n   sequence of submission/delivery
    events, using different destination\n   addresses that lead to the recipient.
    \ Also, a receiving system's\n   delivery process can produce local address transformations.\n\n
    \  It can be helpful for a message to have a common way to record each\n   delivery
    in such a sequence, and to include each address used for\n   that recipient, such
    as for analyzing the path a message has taken,\n   for loop detection, or for
    formulating the author's address in a\n   reply message.  This document defines
    a header field for this\n   information.\n\n   Email handling information discloses
    details about the email\n   infrastructure, as well as about a particular recipient;
    this can\n   raise possible privacy concerns.  A header field such as this is
    not\n   automatically assured of widespread use.  Therefore this is being\n   published
    as an Experiment, looking for constituency and for\n   operational utility.  The
    document is produced through the\n   Independent RFC stream and was not subject
    to the IETF's approval\n   process.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
