abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step,
    file\ntransfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a\nremote
    host.\nThis document describes a new TFTP option. This new option will allow\nthe
    multiple clients to receive the same file concurrently through\nthe use of Multicast
    packets. The TFTP Option Extension mechanism is\ndescribed in [2].\nOften when
    similar computers are booting remotely they will each\ndownload the same image
    file. By adding multicast into the TFTP\noption  set,  two  or  more  computers
    \ can  download  a  file\nconcurrently, thus increasing network efficiency.\nThis
    document assumes that the reader is familiar with the\nterminology and notation
    of both [1] and [2].\n\t </p>\n      "
