abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the network.
    Instead, links with restricting Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) must either
    drop each too-large packet and return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) message or
    perform link-specific fragmentation and reassembly (also known as "link adaptation")
    at a layer below IPv6. This latter category of links is often performance-challenged
    to accommodate steady-state link adaptation. This document therefore proposes
    an update to the base IPv6 specification to better accommodate links that require
    link-specific adaptation.</p>
