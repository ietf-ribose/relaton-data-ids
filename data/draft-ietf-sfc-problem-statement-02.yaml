abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides an overview of the issues associated with the
    deployment of service functions (such as firewalls, load balancers) in large-scale
    environments. The term service function chaining is used to describe the definition
    and instantiation of an ordered set of such service functions, and the subsequent
    "steering" of traffic flows through those service functions. The set of enabled
    service function chains reflect operator service offerings and is designed in
    conjunction with application delivery and service and network policy.</p>
