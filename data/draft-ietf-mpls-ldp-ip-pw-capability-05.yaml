abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, no LDP capability is exchanged for LDP applications like
    IP Label Switching and L2VPN P2P PW signaling. When an LDP session comes up, an
    LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state for such LDP applications
    even when the peer session is established for some other applications like mLDP
    or ICCP. This document defines a solution by which an LDP speaker announces to
    its peer its disinterest in such non-negotiated applications. This, in turn, disables
    the advertisement of corresponding application state, which would have otherwise
    be advertised by default, over the established LDP session.</p>"
