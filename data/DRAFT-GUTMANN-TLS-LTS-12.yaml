abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an update of TLS 1.2 for long-term
    support on\n   systems that can have multi-year or even decade-long update cycles,\n
    \  one that incoporates as far as possible what's already deployed for\n   TLS
    1.2 but with the security holes and bugs fixed.  This document\n   also recognises
    the fact that there is a huge amount of TLS use\n   outside the web content-delivery
    environment with its resource-rich\n   hardware and software that can be updated
    whenever required and\n   provides a long-term stable, known-good version that
    can be deployed\n   to systems that can't roll out ongoing changes on a continuous
    basis.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
