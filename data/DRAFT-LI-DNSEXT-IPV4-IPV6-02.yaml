abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the DNS architecture, two kinds of record types for maintaining\nhost's
    IP addresses are supported: one is A type which records IPv4\nand AAAA for IPv6
    addresses. This document defines a new TYPE, which\nis mainly used in queries
    in order to get both IPv4 and IPv6\naddresses. The main advantage is to avoid
    sending several requests\nin order to resolve the location of a given resource.
    A single\nrequest may be sufficient. The proposed solution does not require\nthe
    definition of any new record type.\n\t </p>\n      "
