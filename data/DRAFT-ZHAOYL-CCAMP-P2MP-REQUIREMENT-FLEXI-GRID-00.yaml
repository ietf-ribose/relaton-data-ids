abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multicasting over WDM optical networks has enabled many popular\n
    \  Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) applications, such as video conference,\n   interactive
    distance learning, replicated database, distributed\n   computing, and so on.
    \ However, the low-rate multicasting traffic\n   demands cannot make full use
    of the capacity of the entire wavelength\n   .  Flexi-grid network overcomes the
    fixed grid constraint of\n   Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON) by flexible
    spectrum\n   allocation based on the demand of the client request.  It is an\n
    \  effective solution to address the problem of inefficient spectrum\n   utilization.
    \ Therefore, it is essential to exploit multicasting over\n   flexi-grid networks.
    \ This document covers the requirements for\n   supporting P2MP over flexi-grid
    infrastructure.  Specifically, the\n   scope of requirements listed in this document
    covers the\n   functionality that should be supported by the control plane.\n\n\t
