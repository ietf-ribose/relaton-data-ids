abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet Draft aims at describing a wide spread set of
    possible\n   connectivity scenarios involving mobile ad-hoc networks, in order
    to\n   provide a reference for the AUTOCONF Working Group.  The aspects\n   considered
    for definition and classification of the scenarios are\n   number and characteristics
    of the gateways that connect MANET nodes\n   to external networks.  Analysis will
    range from a scenario where no\n   connectivity is provided, i.e. an isolated
    MANET, to more complex\n   scenario where a MANET has multiple mobile gateways.\n\n\n\t
