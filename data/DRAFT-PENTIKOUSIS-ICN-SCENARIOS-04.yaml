abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document aims at establishing a common understanding about
    the\n   evaluation of different information-centric networking (ICN)\n   approaches
    so that they can be tested and compared against each other\n   while showcasing
    their own advantages.  Towards this end, we review\n   the ICN literature and
    document scenarios which have been considered\n   in previous performance evaluation
    studies.  We discuss a variety of\n   aspects that an ICN solution can address.
    \ This includes general\n   aspects, such as, network efficiency, reduced complexity,
    increased\n   scalability and reliability, mobility support, multicast and caching\n
    \  performance, real-time communication efficacy, energy consumption\n   frugality,
    and disruption and delay tolerance.  We detail ICN-\n   specific aspects as well,
    such as information security and trust,\n   persistence, availability, provenance,
    and location independence.  We\n   then survey the evaluation tools currently
    available to researchers\n   in this area and provide suggestions regarding methodology
    and\n   metrics.  Finally, this document sheds some light on the impact of\n   ICN
    on network security.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
