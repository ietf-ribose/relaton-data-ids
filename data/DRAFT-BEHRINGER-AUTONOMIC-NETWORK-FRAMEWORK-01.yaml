abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Autonomic systems were first described in 2001.  The fundamental
    goal\n   is self-management, including self-configuration, self-optimization,\n
    \  self-healing and self-protection.\n\n   This document applies the concepts
    of autonomic systems to a network,\n   and describes a framework for Autonomic
    Networking.  The goal is a\n   network where nodes have minimal dependencies on
    human administrators\n   or centralized management systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
