abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Currently, the most efficient techniques for multicast key managementare
    based on the Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) scheme. In currentpractice, LKH trees
    are organized as balanced binary trees, whichgive a uniform O(log n) complexity
    for compromise recovery in an n-member group. In this draft, we propose organizing
    the LKH trees withrespect to the members' compromise probabilities instead of
    keeping abalanced tree, in a spirit similar to data compression techniquessuch
    as Huffman and Shannon-Fano coding. We describe two suchprobabilistic algorithms
    which improve the performance of an LKHscheme by probabilistic organization of
    the tree. Preliminarysimulation results show that significant gains can be obtained
    bythese techniques.</p>"
