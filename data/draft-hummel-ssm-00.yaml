abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft addresses several aspects of multicast services like IP-based
    TV but also like n-party conferences. It breaks withtraditional concepts:An IP-based
    TV-broadcast's delivery tree shall be identified by thesource address S and a
    Multicast-ID provided by S. The same shallapply to each from n well correlated
    point-to(n-1)point deliverytrees of a small n-party conference. Consequently,
    a TV-host maysend out more than one program and any user-host may participate
    inmore than one conference. Mapping to a globally unique multicastgroup address
    G is not needed, would be complex, and does not work.QoS/Policy-Routing, the degree
    of state (Layer-3, Layer-3 plus MPLS-label, or no state), and several more aspects
    need to be respectedHOMOGENEOUSLY all over the entire delivery tree. This cannot
    beprovided by reverse path setup while depending on each receiver'sguesses. Therefore,
    the tree (i.e. an initial tree as well asadditional branches at a later time)
    must be established indownstream direction.No RP- and no BSR-routers are required.</p>"
