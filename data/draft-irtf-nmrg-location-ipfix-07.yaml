abstract:
- content: "<p>IP Flow-based monitoring lacks a mechanism to associate measured IP
    Flow information with the geographic location of the device where the IP Flows
    have been observed. This document defines a set of guidelines and best practices
    to extend IP Flow monitoring protocols with location information of the device
    (both fixed and mobile) that acts as an IP Flow metering process.</p>"
