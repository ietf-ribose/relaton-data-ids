abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC7030: Enrollment over Secure Transport
    (EST)\n   to resolve some errata that was reported, and which has proven to\n
    \  cause interoperability issues when RFC7030 was extended.\n\n   This document
    deprecates the specification of \"Content-Transfer-\n   Encoding\" headers for
    EST endpoints.  This document fixes some\n   syntactical errors in ASN.1 that
    was presented.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
