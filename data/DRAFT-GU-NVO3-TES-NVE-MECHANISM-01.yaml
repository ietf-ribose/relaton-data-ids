abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   his draft introduces the interaction required between TES to
    NVE when\n   NVE is located in an external box to TES .  The signaling between
    TES\n   and NVE has to be designed carefully to reflect all the interaction\n
    \  requirements.  This document describes the relevant considerations\n   for
    such design and also provides a basic analysis of the potential\n   reusable protocols.
    \ Currently this draft focuses on the general\n   interaction procedures with
    relevant parameters and the signaling\n   design consideration.  It may be extended
    to show more detailed\n   signalling design recommendation and/or solution recommendation
    in\n   the future with the progress of NVO3's work.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
