abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new architecture
    that\n   provides optimal multicast forwarding without requiring intermediate\n
    \  routers to maintain any per-flow state by using a multicast-specific\n   BIER
    header.  PIM is a well-known multicast-specific routing protocol\n   which is
    widely deployed either in a VRF context or in a Non-VRF\n   context.  This document
    describes PIM extensions to signal a P2MP\n   Tree with BIER information, which
    is called a P2MP based BIER in\n   [I.D.xie-bier-mvpn-mpls-p2mp].  PIM is required
    to alloc Label to\n   build a P2MP tree hop-by-hop, and build a P2MP based BIER
    forwarding\n   table further.  This requires a BitMask being carried as a PIM
    Join\n   Attribute by downstream node to upstream node hop-by-hop, and the\n   behavior
    is like precedures as specified in [RFC6807].\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
