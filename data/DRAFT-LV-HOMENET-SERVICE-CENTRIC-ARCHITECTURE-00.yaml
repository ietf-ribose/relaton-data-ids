abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We propose a general service centric homenet architecture,
    which can\n   handle the diversity of devices, services, applications and context.\n
    \  Especially, we focus on building an overall home network topology,\n   routing
    and naming structures, to fit SCN into a home network.  In\n   the future, we
    will discuss homenet caching, mobility and security in\n   details.\n\n\t </p>\n
