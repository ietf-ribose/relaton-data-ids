abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization (ALTO), and is used in basic services including both the\n   cost
    map service and the endpoint cost service.\n\n   Different applications may use
    different cost metrics, but the ALTO\n   base protocol documents only one single
    cost metric, i.e., the\n   generic \"routingcost\" metric; see Sec. 14.2 of ALTO
    base\n   specification [RFC7285].  Hence, if the resource consumer of an\n   application
    prefers a resource provider that offers low-delay\n   delivery to the resource
    consumer, the base protocol does not define\n   the cost metric to be used.\n\n
    \  ALTO cost metrics can be generic metrics and this document focuses on\n   network
    performance metrics, including network delay, jitter, packet\n   loss, hop count,
    and bandwidth.  Additional cost metrics may be\n   documented in other documents.\n\n
    \  When using an ALTO performance metric, applications need additional\n   information
    beyond the metric.  In particular, its \"cost-source\",\n   such as it being an
    estimation or an SLA, is key to define the\n   meaning of a performance metric.
    \ Hence, each ALTO performance metric\n   should include the \"cost-source\" of
    the metric.  To report an\n   estimated value of a performance metric, the ALTO
    server may derive\n   and aggregate from routing protocols with different granularity
    and\n   scope, such as BGP-LS, OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE, or from end-to-end\n   traffic
    management tools.  These metrics may then be exposed by an\n   ALTO Server to
    allow applications to determine \"where\" to connect\n   based on network performance
    criteria.\n\n   \n\t </p>\n      "
