abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends PASSporT, which is a token object that conveys
    cryptographically-signed information about the participants involved in communications,
    to include information defined as part of the SHAKEN specification from ATIS (Alliance
    for Telecommunications Industry Solutions) and the SIP Forum IP-NNI Joint Task
    Force. These extensions provide a level of confidence in the correctness of the
    originating identity for a telephone network that has communications coming from
    both STIR participating originating communications as well as communications that
    does not include STIR information.</p>"
