abstract:
- content: '<p>AFS-3 relies upon XDR to carry Rx RPC call payloads. XDR discriminated
    unions are ill-suited to cases where the protocol needs to evolve without inventing
    new RPCs, i.e., unknown discriminant values cause the entire XDR payload to fail
    the decoding step. While this can be circumvented through the use of opaque payloads
    (and recursive XDR invocations), such solutions are inelegant and difficult to
    implement. This memo defines a new XDR primitive type, "ext-union", which is derived
    from the XDR discriminated union primitive type, but with two key variations:
    1) each leg contains a length field, and 2) no default leg is supported.</p>'
