abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a common protocol data unit (PDU) used between\nRAQMON
    Data Source (RDS) and RAQMON Report Collector (RRC) to report\na QOS statistics
    using RTCP and SNMP as Transport Protocol.\nThe original RAQMON draft [SIDDIQUI3]
    was split into 3 parts to\nidentify the RAQMON Framework, RAQMON QOS PDU and RAQMON
    MIB.\nThis memo defined RAQMON QOS Protocol Data Unit (PDU). This memo also\noutlines
    mechanisms to use Real Time Transport Control Protocol\n(RTCP) and Simple Network
    Management Protocol (SNMP) to transport\nthese PDUs between RAQMON Data Source
    (RDS) and RAQMON Report\nCollector (RRC) as outlined in RAQMON Charter of the
    RMON Workgroup.\nThe memo [SIDDIQUI2] defines a Real-Time Application QOS Monitoring\n(RAQMON)
    Framework that extends the RMON Framework to allow Real-time\nApplication QoS
    information as outlined by RAQMON Charter of the RMON\nWorkgroup.\nThe memo [SIDDIQUI1]
    defines a portion of the Management Information\nBase (MIB) for use with network
    management protocols in the Internet\ncommunity. The document proposes an extension
    to the Remote\nMonitoring MIB [RFC2819] to accommodate RAQMON solution.\nDistribution
    of this memo is unlimited.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
