abstract:
- content: "<p>Experience has indicated that the role of the various components of
    the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) in developing and setting policies
    is not sufficiently clear in the defining documents. This document provides an
    explicit statement of principles for policy formulation and decision-making about
    areas of IASA responsibility.</p>"
