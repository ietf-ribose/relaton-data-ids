abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an xinclude1() scheme for use in XPointer-\nbased
    fragment identifiers.  This scheme, like other XPointer\nFramework [12] schemes,
    is designed primarily for use with the XML\nMedia Types defined in RFC 3023 [5],
    to identify locations within a\ngiven XML representation of a resource.  The xinclude()
    scheme\nnotifies an XPointer processor whether the creator of the XPointer\nintended
    for XInclude 1.0 [9] processing to take place.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
