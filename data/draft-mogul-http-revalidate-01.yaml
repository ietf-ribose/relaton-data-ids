abstract:
- content: "<p>The HTTP/1.1 specification [1] currently defines a ``proxy-revalidate''
    Cache-control directive, which forces a proxy to revalidate a stale response before
    using it in a reply. There is no mechanism defined that forces a proxy, but not
    an end-client, to revalidate a fresh response. The lack of such a mechanism is
    due to an error in drafting RFC2068, and appears to create problems for use of
    the Authorization header, the Digest Access Authentication extension [2], the
    State Management Mechanism [3], and several other proposed extensions. This document
    discusses the problem and several possible solutions, and proposes to add a new
    ``s-maxage'' directive as the best available solution.</p>"
