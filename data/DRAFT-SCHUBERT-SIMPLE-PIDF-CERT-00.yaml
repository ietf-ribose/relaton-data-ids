abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document specifies a means to integrate Certificate
    Management\n   Service for The Session Initiation Protocol(SIP) with presence.\n
    \  Presentities employing the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF)\n   can
    use the extensions in this draft to advertise their ability to\n   exchange signalling
    using S/MIME, and thus allow secure signalling\n   between the two peers.  In
    a presence application, the presence of\n   this information could be displayed
    to watchers as the padlock\n   \"secure signalling available\" of the presentity.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
