abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Most protocols and applications are designed for connections that
    arefairly static. When a node changes its point of attachment to theInternet frequently,
    it must be able to rapidly adapt to the newenvironment. Traditionally, each application
    and protocol tries to dothis independently of each other. In some cases, applications
    havebeen tailored to communicate with one other protocol layer to noticesuch changes.
    The main problem with this approach is that adding newprotocols and applications
    to the node cannot be made in a genericway. In order to obtain at least some level
    of context awareness,protocols and applications must be specifically tailored
    tointercommunicate. This also adds complexity to application and protocoldesign,
    since protocols and applications perform a wide range of tasksfor which they have
    not originally been designed. To overcome theseproblems, we add a new Context
    Aware Management (CAM) layer to theInternet Protocol stack. The purpose of CAM
    is to optimize thefunctionality of the node by monitoring the environment for
    changesand by adapting the behavior of the node accordingly. The protocolsand
    applications thus perform the tasks for which they have beendesigned in the first
    place, and CAM makes the decisions regardingwhich protocols to use and with what
    parameters.</p>"
