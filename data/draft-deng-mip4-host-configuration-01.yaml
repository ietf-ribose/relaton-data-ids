    parameters needed for network service from home network based on DHCPINFORM. DHCPINFORM
    message has been widely used by client to obtain other configuration information
    and could be sent to local broadcast address or server unicast address. Mobile
    IP specification could support DHCPINFORM broadcast or unicast message straightfully
    without any revision.</p>"
