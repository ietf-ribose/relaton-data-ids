abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The NSIS Work group will develop the requirements, architecture
    and\nprotocols for the next IETF steps on signaling.  Two approaches for a\nsignaling
    model have been discussed: path-coupled and path-decoupled\n(previously denoted
    as on-path and off-path).  This draft provides a\nconceptual comparison between
    path-coupled and path-decoupled\nsignaling together with reasons for why an NSIS
    protocol should be\ndesigned to support both cases.  The collection of data objects
    to be\ncarried by the protocol should basically be the same in both cases\nand
    will evolve over time as new usages for NSIS protocol are\nidentified.  The differences
    between the two flavors of this NSIS\nprotocol are then explained.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n
