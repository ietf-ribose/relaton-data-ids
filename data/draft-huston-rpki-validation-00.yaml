abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reviews the certificate validation procedure specified
    in RFC6487 and highlights aspects of operational management of certificates in
    the RPKI in response to the movement of resources across registries, and the associated
    actions of Certification Authorities to maintain certification of resources during
    this movement. The document describes an alternative validation procedure that
    reduces the operational impact of certificate management during resource movement.</p>"
