abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a multicast protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc
    networks,\ncalled the Multicast routing protocol based on Zone Routing (MZR).
    MZR\nis a source-initiated on-demand protocol, in which a multicast delivery\ntree
    is created using a concept based on the zone routing mechanism.\nIt belongs to
    the family of source-tree-based protocols, in which a\ndelivery tree rooted at
    the source is created for each active multicast\nsession.  MZR does not depend
    on any underlying unicast protocol for a\nglobal routing substructure.  The protocol's
    reaction to topological\nchanges is restricted to a node's neighborhood and is
    not propagated\nthroughout the network.\n\t </p>\n      "
