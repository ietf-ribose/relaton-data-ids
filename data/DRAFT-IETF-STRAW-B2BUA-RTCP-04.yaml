abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) are often envisaged to
    also be\n   on the media path, rather than just intercepting signalling.  This\n
    \  means that B2BUAs often implement an RTP/RTCP stack as well, whether\n   to
    act as media transcoders or to just passthrough the media\n   themselves, thus
    leading to separate multimedia sessions that the\n   B2BUA correlates and bridges
    together.  If not disciplined, though,\n   this behaviour can severely impact
    the communication experience,\n   especially when statistics and feedback information
    contained in RTCP\n   packets get lost because of mismatches in the reported data.\n\n
    \  This document defines the proper behaviour B2BUAs should follow when\n   also
    acting on the signalling/media plane in order to preserve the\n   end-to-end functionality
    of RTCP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
