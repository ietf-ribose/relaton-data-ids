abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [1] provides a standard
    method for transporting messages over IP, with features such as multi-homing and
    multi-stream built into the protocol for additional reliability and real-time
    delivery. This memo defines a method for tunneling SCTP over a single UDP port
    in order to simplify initial implementations. This memo is intended to become
    an Experimental document and is not intended as a standard of any kind.</p>"
