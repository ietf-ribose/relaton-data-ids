abstract:
  content: "<p>The Simple Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [1] provides a standard
    method for transporting messages over IP, with featuressuch as multi-homing and
    multi-stream built into the protocol for additional reliability and real-time
    delivery. This memodefines a method for tunneling SCTP over a single UDP port
    inorder to simplify initial implementations. This memo is intendedto become an
    Experimental document and is not intended as astandard of any kind.</p>"
