abstract:
- content: "<p>Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way to represent links between Web
    resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes of such a
    link. In constrained networks, a collection of Web links can be exchanged in the
    CoRE link format (RFC6690). Outside of constrained environments, it may be useful
    to represent these collections of Web links in JSON format (RFC7159). This specification
    defines a common format for representing Web links in JSON format.</p>"
