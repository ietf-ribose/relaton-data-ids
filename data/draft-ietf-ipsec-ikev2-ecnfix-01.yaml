abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IPsec (IP Security) tunnel encapsulation and decapsulation were
    specified prior to the addition of ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) to IP,
    with the potential result that ECN congestion indications could be discarded by
    IPsec tunnel decapsulators. The current ECN specification includes two ECN operating
    modes for IPsec tunnels to avoid this situation, and IKEv1/ISAKMP (Internet Key
    Exchange/Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol) negotiation
    extensions to enable ECN to be used correctly with IPsec tunnels. To simplify
    this situation, IKEv2 requires changes to tunnel decapsulation that prevent discarding
    of ECN congestion indication, obviating the need for multiple ECN operating modes
    and associated negotiation support.</p>"
