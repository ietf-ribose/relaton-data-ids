abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a UDP/IP adaptation of the IEEE 802.15.4- based
    ZigBee Application Protocol that enables IP hosts to communicate using the application
    profiles and data models described by that protocol, over a wide range of links.
    This modified version of the ZigBee Application Protocol is named CAP (Compact
    Application Protocol), and it is intended to provide a complete stack of application
    profiles, data exchange, binding operations, security protocols, and discovery
    to IP-networked hosts and embedded devices. The protocol's domain of applicability
    includes IEEE 802.15.4-based 6LoWPAN devices, but also those on conventional wired
    and wireless links and emerging powerline communication networks.</p>"
