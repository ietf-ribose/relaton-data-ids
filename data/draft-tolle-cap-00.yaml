abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a UDP/IP adaptation of the IEEE 802.15.4-based
    ZigBee Application Protocol that enables IP hosts tocommunicate using the application
    profiles and data models describedby that protocol, over a wide range of links.
    This modified versionof the ZigBee Application Protocol is named CAP (Compact
    ApplicationProtocol), and it is intended to provide a complete stack ofapplication
    profiles, data exchange, binding operations, securityprotocols, and discovery
    to IP-networked hosts and embedded devices.The protocol's domain of applicability
    includes IEEE 802.15.4-based6LoWPAN devices, but also those on conventional wired
    and wirelesslinks and emerging powerline communication networks.</p>"
