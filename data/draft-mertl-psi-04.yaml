abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a protocol that builds upon UDP/IP to transport
    illumination and control data for stage, architectural and other illumination
    requirements. It may be understood as a spiritual successor of the traditional
    DMX (Digital MultipleX) specification series, removing it's limitations and adding
    flexibility and usability enhancements like auto-discovery and metadata, among
    other useful features. Due to the complexity and length, versions 4 and above
    only describe a subset of the full PSI.</p>"
