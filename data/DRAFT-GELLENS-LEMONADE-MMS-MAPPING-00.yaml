abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The cellular telephone industry has defined a service known as
    the\nMultimedia Messaging Service (MMS).  This service uses formats and\nprotocols
    which are similar to, but differ in key ways from those\nused in Internet mail.\nThis
    document specifies how to exchange messages between these two\nservices, including
    mapping information elements as used in MMS\nX-MMS-* headers to and from that
    used in ESMTP and Internet message\nheaders.\n\t </p>\n      "
