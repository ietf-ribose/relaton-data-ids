abstract:
  content: "<p>The REGISTER function is used in a SIP system primarily to associatea
    temporary contact address with an address-of-record. This contactis generally
    in the form of a URI, such as Contact:&lt;sip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com&gt; and is
    generally dynamic and associatedwith the IP address or hostname of the SIP UA.
    The problem is thatnetwork topology may have one or more SIP proxies between the
    UA andthe registrar, such that any request travelling from the user's homenetwork
    to the registered UA must traverse these proxies. TheREGISTER method does not
    give us a mechanism to discover and recordthis sequence of proxies in the registrar
    for future use. Thisdocument defines an extension header field, 'Path' which providessuch
    a mechanism</p>"
