abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IP fragmentation has been shown to be problematic through operationalexperience
    and through studies conducted over the course of manyyears. Some transports (e.g.,
    TCP) have the abilitiy to adjust theirmessage sizes to avoid IP fragmentation,
    however no such capabilityis built into the UDP transport. UDP applications such
    as DHCP musttherefore have a means to perform their own segmentation prior tosubmitting
    their data to UDP/IP in order to avoid IP fragmentation.This document specifies
    a segmentation/reassembly capability for DHCPusing SEAL.</p>"
