abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet is an amazing achievement - any of the thousand million
    hosts can freely use any of the resources anywhere on the public network. At least
    that was the original theory. Recently issues with how these resources are shared
    among these hosts have come to the fore. Applications are innocently exploring
    the limits of protocol design to get larger shares of available bandwidth. Increasingly
    we are seeing ISPs imposing restrictions on heavier usage in order to try to preserve
    the level of service they can offer to lighter customers. We believe that these
    are symptoms of an underlying problem: fair resource sharing is an issue that
    can only be resolved at run-time, but for years attempts have been made to solve
    it at design time. In this document we show that fairness is not the preserve
    of transport protocols, rather the design of such protocols should be such that
    fairness can be controlled between users and ISPs at run-time.</p>"
