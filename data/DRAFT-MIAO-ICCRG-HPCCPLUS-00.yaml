abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Congestion control (CC) is the key to achieving ultra-low latency,\n
    \  high bandwidth and network stability in high-speed networks.\n   However, the
    existing high-speed CC schemes have inherent limitations\n   for reaching these
    goals.\n\n   In this document, we describe HPCC++ (High Precision Congestion\n
    \  Control), a new high-speed CC mechanism which achieves the three\n   goals
    simultaneously.  HPCC++ leverages inband telemetry to obtain\n   precise link
    load information and controls traffic precisely.  By\n   addressing challenges
    such as delayed signaling during congestion and\n   overreaction to the congestion
    signaling using inband and granular\n   telemetry, HPCC++ can quickly converge
    to utilize all the available\n   bandwidth while avoiding congestion, and can
    maintain near-zero in-\n   network queues for ultra-low latency.  HPCC++ is also
    fair and easy\n   to deploy in hardware, implementable with commodity NICs and\n
    \  switches.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
