abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Without doubt the Internet infrastructure developed far beyond theexpectations
    of the original funding agencies, architects,developers, and early users. The
    society's current use andexpectations often lead to the need to take the economical
    andpolitical context in which technology is deployed into consideration.This document
    aims to make protocol designers aware of the publicpolicy-related questions that
    may impact standards development. Thisdocument contains questions, as opposed
    to guidelines or strict rulesthat should in all cases be followed. This document
    provides aframework for identifying and discussing questions of public policyconcern
    and serves as an umbrella for related policy documents.</p>"
