abstract:
- content: <p>The registration and use of interface types ("ifType" values) predated
    the use of IANA Considerations sections and YANG modules, and so confusion has
    arisen about the interface type allocation process. Tunnel types were then added
    later, with the same requirements and allocation policy as interface types. This
    document updates RFC 2863, and provides updated guidelines for the definition
    of new interface types and tunnel types, for consideration by those who are defining,
    registering, or evaluating those definitions.</p>
