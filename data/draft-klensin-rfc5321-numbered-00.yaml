abstract:
  content: "\t <t>20 This document is a specification of the basic protocol for Internet21
    electronic mail transport. It consolidates, updates, and clarifies22 several previous
    documents, making all or parts of most of them23 obsolete. It covers the SMTP
    extension mechanisms and best practices24 for the contemporary Internet, but does
    not provide details about25 particular extensions. Although SMTP was designed
    as a mail26 transport and delivery protocol, this specification also contains27
    information that is important to its use as a \"mail submission\"28 protocol for
    \"split-UA\" (User Agent) mail reading systems and mobile29 environments.56 58
