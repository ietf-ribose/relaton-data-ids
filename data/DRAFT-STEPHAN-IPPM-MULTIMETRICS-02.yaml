abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group has standardized\n
    \  metrics for measuring end-to-end performance between 2 points.  This\n   memo
    defines 2 sets of metrics to extend these end-to-end ones.  It\n   defines spatial
    metrics for measuring the performance of segments\n   along a path and metrics
    for measuring the performance of a group of\n   users in multiparty communications.\n\t
