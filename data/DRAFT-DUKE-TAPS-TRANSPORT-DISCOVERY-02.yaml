abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Transport Services architecture decouples applications
    from the\n   protocol implementations that transport their data.  While it is\n
    \  often straightforward to connect applications with transports that\n   are
    present in the host operating system, providing a means of\n   discovering user-installed
    implementations dramatically enlarges the\n   use cases.  This document discusses
    considerations for the design of\n   a discovery mechanism and an example of such
    a design.\n\n   Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the TAPS IETF\n
    \  mailing list taps@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository which contains\n   the
    draft: https://github.com/martinduke/draft-duke-taps-transport-\n   discovery.\n\n\t
