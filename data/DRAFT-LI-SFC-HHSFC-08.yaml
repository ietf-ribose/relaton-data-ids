abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a Hybrid Hierarchical Multi-Domain
    Service\n   Function Chaining (hhSFC) architecture that extends Service Function\n
    \  Chaining (SFC) to multiple domains with different technology,\n   administration
    or ownership.\n\n   The goals of Hybrid Hierarchical SFC are to reduce the complexity
    of\n   the control plane in a multi-domain scene and make the negotiation\n   between
    different domains possible.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
