abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo describes an investigation of how some common mailers(Eudora,
    Pine, Hotmail, Outlook Express, Netscape, First Class, KOM2000) handled the use
    of multipart/alternative with different languagesin the different body parts.None
    of the mailers handled this very well. It seems as if none of themailers can actually
    choose the part in the language preferred by theuser. Some of them displayed all
    language parts, some arbitrarily choseto display only one part.The study compares
    different methods of specifying language translationin e-mail, but finds that
    no format seems to give satisfactory resultswith all the tested mailers.</p>"
