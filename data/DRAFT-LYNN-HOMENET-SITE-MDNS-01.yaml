abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like\n
    \  operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional\n   unicast
    DNS server.  Extended mDNS (xmDNS) extends the specification\n   of mDNS to site-local
    scope in order to support multi-hop LANs that\n   forward multicast packets but
    do not provide a unicast DNS service.\n\n   Like mDNS, xmDNS designates a portion
    of the DNS namespace to apply\n   to the site-local network and specifies rules
    for its use.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
