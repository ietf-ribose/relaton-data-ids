abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3777 specifies the process by which members of the Internet Architecture
    Board, Internet Engineering Steering Group and IETF Administrative Oversight Committee
    are selected, confirmed, and recalled. This document updates RFC 3777 to increase
    the number of volunteers who are eligible to serve on NomCom and to increase the
    selection of volunteers having different primary affiliations. It also makes some
    updates to include the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee.</p>"
