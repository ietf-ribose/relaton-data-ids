abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo presents recommendations to the Internet community\n
    \  concerning measures to improve and preserve Internet performance.  It\n   presents
    a strong recommendation for testing, standardization, and\n   widespread deployment
    of active queue management in routers, to\n   improve the performance of today's
    Internet.  It also urges a\n   concerted effort of research, measurement, and
    ultimate deployment of\n   router mechanisms to protect the Internet from flows
    that are not\n   sufficiently responsive to congestion notification.\n\n\t </p>\n
