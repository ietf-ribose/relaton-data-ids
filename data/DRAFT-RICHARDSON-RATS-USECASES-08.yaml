abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document details mechanisms created for performing Remote\n
    \  Attestation that have been used in a number of industries.  The\n   document
    initially focuses on existing industry verticals, mapping\n   terminology used
    in those specifications to the more abstract\n   terminology used by the IETF
    RATS Working Group.\n\n   The document aspires to describe possible future use
    cases that would\n   be enabled by common formats.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
