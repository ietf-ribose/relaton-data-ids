abstract:
- content: <p>The framework for preparation and comparison of internationalized strings
    ("PRECIS") defines several classes of strings for preparation and comparison.
    Case mapping is defined because many protocols perform case-sensitive or case-insensitive
    string comparison and so preparation of the string is mandatory. The Internationalized
    Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS problem statement describes
    mappings for internationalized strings that are not limited to case, but include
    width mapping and mapping of delimiters and other specials that can be taken into
    consideration. This document provides guidelines for authors of protocol profiles
    of the PRECIS framework and describes several mappings that can be applied between
    receiving user input and passing permitted code points to internationalized protocols.
    The mappings described here are expected to be applied as an additional mapping
    and locale-/context- dependent case mapping.</p>
