abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how to carry colored path advertisement via
    an enhancement to the existing protocol BGP Label Unicast. It would allow backward
    compatibility with RFC8277. The targeted solution is to use stack of labels advertised
    via BGP Label Unicast 2.0 for end to end traffic steering across multiple IGP
    domains. The operation is similar to Segment Routing. This proposed protocol will
    convey the necessary reachability information to the ingress PE node to construct
    an end to end path. Another two problems addressed here are the interworking with
    Flex-Algo, and the MPLS label space limit problem. Please note that there is a
    major change of protocol format starting from version 01 draft. Except the optional
    BGP capability code, these rest of BGP attributes used in this draft are defined
    in previous RFC or in use today in other scenario.</p>"
