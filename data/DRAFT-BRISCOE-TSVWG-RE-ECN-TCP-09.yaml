abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document introduces a new protocol for explicit congestion\nnotification
    (ECN), termed re-ECN, which can be deployed\nincrementally around unmodified routers.
    \ The protocol works by\narranging an extended ECN field in each packet so that,
    as it crosses\nany interface in an internetwork, it will carry a truthful prediction\nof
    congestion on the remainder of its path.  The purpose of this\ndocument is to
    specify the re-ECN protocol at the IP layer and to\ngive guidelines on any consequent
    changes required to transport\nprotocols.  It includes the changes required to
    TCP both as an\nexample and as a specification.  It briefly gives examples of\nmechanisms
    that can use the protocol to ensure data sources respond\ncorrectly to congestion,
    but these are described more fully in a\ncompanion document.\n\t </p>\n      "
