abstract:
- content: <p>The first implementation of NTPv4 was released in 2003. NTPv4 is defined
    by RFC 5905 [RFC5905]. It contains a public-key security protocol, autokey, which
    is defined by RFC 5906 [RFC5906]. Until very recently, autokey has been the only
    defined "user" of NTP packet Extension Fields. New proposals for extension fields
    are being written and there is currently no convenient way to learn if a remote
    instance of NTP supports any extension fields or not. This proposal contains a
    method to tell a remote instance of NTP what we support, and ask what they support.</p>
