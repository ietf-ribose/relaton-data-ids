abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Document proposes two extension schemes of PMIPv6, called\n
    \  Query-based PMIPv6 (QPMIPv6) and Signaling Query-based PMIPv6 (S-\n   QPMIPv6),
    which send the binding query messages to LMA to get the\n   care-of-address of
    a mobile node and to deliver the subsequent data\n   packet over optimized data
    path. The proposed two schemes have some\n   differences with each other. We will
    show that the performances of\n   the schemes comparing PMIPv6 with QPMIPv6 and
    S-QPMIPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
