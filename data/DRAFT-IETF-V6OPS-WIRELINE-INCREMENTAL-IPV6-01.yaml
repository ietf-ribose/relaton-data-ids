abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Operators worldwide are in various stages of preparing for,
    or\n   deploying IPv6 into their networks.  The operators often face\n   difficult
    challenges related to both IPv6 introduction along with\n   those related to IPv4
    run out.  Operators will need to meet the\n   simultaneous needs of IPv6 connectivity
    and continue support for IPv4\n   connectivity for legacy devices with a depleting
    supply of IPv4\n   addresses.  The IPv6 transition will take most networks from
    an IPv4-\n   only environment to an IPv6 focused environment with long period
    of\n   dual stack operation varying by operator.  This document helps\n   provide
    a framework for Wireline providers who are faced with the\n   challenges of introducing
    IPv6 along meeting the legacy needs of IPv4\n   connectivity utilizing well defined
    and commercially available IPv6\n   transition technologies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
