abstract:
  content: "<p>Developments in storage systems have made it important forapplications
    to have control over the characteristics of the storagethat will be used for their
    particular files. The development ofpNFS has added to the usefulness of such control
    mechanisms as it hascreated the opportunity for the hierarchical organization
    of filenames to be separated from the control of storage characteristics forindividual
    files, including the assignment to storage locations toreflect the performance
    or other needs of those specific files. Thisdocument proposes extensions to NFS
    version 4 to allow storagerequirements to be communicated to the NFS version 4
    server.</p>"
