abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SIP endpoints are subject to unwanted communication often perceived\nas
    Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT).  This document describes\ncaveats on various
    layers which can be abused to send unsolicited\nmessages.  As a result users receive
    a degraded experience.  The\nissues found are based on case studies of various
    events seen in VoIP\nprovider networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
