abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the biggest hurdles for FTP in real life usage is its
    use of\n   two connections.  First, it uses a primary connection to send control\n
    \  commands on, and when it sends or receives data, it opens a second\n   TCP
    stream for that purpose.  This document specifies a new FTP LOCK\n   command to
    be used by clients to request the server to use the\n   control connection for
    data transfers, using a single port instead of\n   two.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
