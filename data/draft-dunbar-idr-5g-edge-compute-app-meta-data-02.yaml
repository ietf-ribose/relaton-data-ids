abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a new BGP Network Layer Reachability Information
    (BGP NLRI) Path Attribute, AppMetaData, for egress router to advertise the running
    status and environment of the directly attached 5G Edge Computing servers. The
    AppMetaData can be used by the ingress routers in the 5G Local Data Network to
    make intelligent path selection for flows from UEs. The goal is to improve latency
    and performance for 5G Edge Computing services. The extension enables a feature,
    called soft anchoring, which makes one Edge Computing Server at one specific location
    to be more preferred than others for the same application to receive packets from
    a specific source (UE).</p>"
