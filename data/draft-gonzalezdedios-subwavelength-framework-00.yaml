abstract:
  content: "<p>This document discusses the framework for enhancements to the GMPLSarchitecture
    to control sub-wavelength switching optical networks.Sub-wavelengths refer to
    the time-shared utilization of a singlewavelength by optical bursts, packets or
    slots.Sub-wavelngth technologies are the base of new cost-effective networkarchitectures.
    In particular, they are sutited for metro areas, tocope with high traffic volumens
    as well as more demandingrequirements of networked applications.</p>"
