abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the framework for enhancements to the GMPLS
    architecture to control sub-wavelength switching optical networks. Sub-wavelengths
    refer to the time-shared utilization of a single wavelength by optical bursts,
    packets or slots. Sub-wavelngth technologies are the base of new cost-effective
    network architectures. In particular, they are sutited for metro areas, to cope
    with high traffic volumens as well as more demanding requirements of networked
    applications.</p>"
