abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For efficient network operation, most network operators rely
    on\n   traditional Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) methods,\n
    \  which include proactive and reactive techniques, running in active\n   and
    passive modes.  As networks increase in scale, they become more\n   susceptible
    to measurement accuracy and misconfiguration errors.\n\n   With the advent of
    programmable data-plane, emerging on-path\n   telemetry techniques provide unprecedented
    flow insight and fast\n   notification of network issues (e.g., jitter, increased
    latency,\n   packet loss, significant bit error variations, and unequal load-\n
    \  balancing).\n\n   This document outlines an In-situ Flow Information Telemetry
    (iFIT)\n   reference framework, which enumerates several high level components\n
    \  and describes how these components can be assembled to achieve a\n   complete
    and closed-loop working solution for on-path telemetry.\n\n   iFIT addresses several
    deployment challenges for on-path telemetry\n   techniques, especially in carrier
    networks.  As an open framework, it\n   does not detail the implementation of
    the components as well as the\n   interface between the components.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
