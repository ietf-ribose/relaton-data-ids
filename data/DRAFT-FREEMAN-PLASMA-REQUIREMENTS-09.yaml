abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  S/MIME has a proven track record in delving confidentiality,
    integrity\n  and data origination authentication for email. However, there are
    many\n  situations where organizations want robust access control applied to\n
    \ information in messages. The Enhanced Security Services (ESS) RFC5035\n  for
    S/MIME defines an access control mechanism for email, but the\n  access check
    happens after the data is decrypted by the recipient\n  which devalues the protection
    afforded by the cryptography and\n  provides very week guarantees of policy compliance.
    Another major\n  issues for S/MIME is its dependency on a single type of identity\n
    \ credential, an X.509 certificate. Many users on the Internet today do\n  not
    have X.509 certificates and therefore cannot use S/MIME.\n  Furthermore, the requirement
    to discover the X.509 certificate for\n  every recipient of an encrypted message
    by the sender has proven to be\n  an unreliable process for a number of reasons.\n\n
    \ This document presents requirements for an alternative model to ESS to\n  address
    the identified issues with access control to deliver more\n  robust compliance
    with S/MIME protected messages. This document\n  describes an access control model
    which uses cryptographic keys to\n  enforce access control policy decisions where
    the policy check is\n  performed prior to the decryption of the message contents.
    The model\n  also abstracts the specifics of the authentication technology thereby\n
    \ removing the dependency on X.509 certificate making it possible for\n  other
    forms of credential to be used for S/MIME enabling much broader\n  adoption. This
    model can be instantiated in many areas using existing\n  standards, or with only
    minor updates to existing standards. This\n  model in not intended to be a one
    off just for email and can also be\n  applied to other data types. The model also
    removes the dependency on\n  the need to discover encryption certificates at send
    time.\n\n  The name Plasma was assigned to this effort as part of the IETF\n  process.
    It is derived from PoLicy enhAnced Secure eMAil.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
