abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a use-case and requirements that address
    the\n   need for facilitating dynamic change of an operation plane, which\n   includes
    virtually prepared multiple networks and/or data\n   transmission paths, from
    a current operation one to a backup one\n   during scheduled maintenance or an
    emergency such as a network\n   disaster.  Specifically, the necessity of interfaces
    to establish\n   consistent end-to-end data transmission paths over multiple domain\n
    \  networks is addressed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
