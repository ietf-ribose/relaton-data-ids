abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Next Steps in Signaling protocol suite aims to provide a way
    to\ncommunicate with network intermediaries.  As such, it is desirable to\noffer
    generic diagnostics function for NSIS users and system\nadministrators to make
    the functionality provided by the network more\ntransparent (e.g., to identify
    particular NSLPs, to determine to\nwhich degree the network supports NSIS, GIST
    state or specific NSLP\nsession information along a given path).\n\nInstead of
    suggesting one specific solution we highlight the\ndifferent design options of
    some simple, stateless diagnostics\nfunctions from a querying node to a responding
    node.  These\npreliminary thoughts should help the working group to have a more\nstructure
    discussion in this problem space.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
