abstract:
- content: "<p>Many end user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly
    IPv4 internal infrastructures. These sites range in size from small home/office
    networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but share the commonality that
    IPv4 continues to provide operational internal routing and addressing services
    for most applications. As more and more IPv6-only services are deployed, however,
    end user devices within such sites will increasingly require at least basic IPv6
    functionality. This document therefore discusses updates to the Intra-Site Automatic
    Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) to better accommodate these needs.</p>"
