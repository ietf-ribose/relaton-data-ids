abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an architecture that allows clients to dynamically
    discover designated resolvers that offer encrypted DNS services, and use them
    in an adaptive way that improves privacy while co-existing with locally provisioned
    resolvers. These resolvers can be used directly when looking up names for which
    they are designated. These resolvers also provide the ability to proxy encrypted
    queries, thus hiding the identity of the client requesting resolution.</p>"
