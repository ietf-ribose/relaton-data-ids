abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some Internet Service Providers and enterprises desire to be
    aware of\n   more information about each packet, so that packets can be treated\n
    \  differently and efficiently. Packet-level differentiating can also\n   enable
    flow-level and user-level differentiating.\n\n   IPv6, with a large address space,
    allows semantics to be embedded\n   into addresses. Routers can easily apply relevant
    operations\n   accordingly. This document provides analysis on how to form semantic\n
    \  prefix and corresponding use cases, and identifies the technical\n   requirements
    to maximize the benefits of the semantic prefix\n   approach. It is recommended
    to use 4~12 bits in prefix for embedded\n   semantics.\n\n   This informational
    document only discusses usage of semantics in a\n   semantic prefix domain. It
    does NOT intent or suggest to standardize\n   any common global semantics.\n\n\t
