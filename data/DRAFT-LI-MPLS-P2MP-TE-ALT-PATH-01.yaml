abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document proposes a solution to be able to set up the alternative\n
    \  path for specific leaf nodes of a P2MP TE LSP.  Corresponding RSVP-TE\n   protocol
    extension is also defined.  The solution is used to cope\n   with the issue that
    in some scenarios traffic loss happens even if\n   there exists possible path
    for the leaf nodes.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
