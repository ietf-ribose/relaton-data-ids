abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an architecture for security management
    in\n   the Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) framework.  This\n
    \  security management architecture consists of I2NSF Client, Security\n   Management
    System (i.e., Security Controller and Developer's\n   Management System), and
    Network Security Functions (NSFs) in the\n   I2NSF framework.  I2NSF Client consists
    of Application Logic, Policy\n   Updater, and Policy Collector.  Security Controller
    consists of\n   Security Policy Manager and NSF Capability Manager.  This document\n
    \  explains their missions and the processing of security management in\n   a
    high level.  It also describes representative use cases, such as\n   security
    management for the list of malware domains and security\n   management for VoIP-VoLTE.\n\n\t
