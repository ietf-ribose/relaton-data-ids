abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Since NAT function on CGN box will make the IPv4 address re-used
    by\nmore than one user, the packets sent outside CGN are not able to be\nidentifid
    where they are from or which user they belong to according\nto the source address
    within the packets.  However, under some\ncertain circumstances, knowing the original
    source IP address and the\nidentity of the user who sends the packet out is necessary.
    \ This\ndocument states the requirement of source address tracing briefly,\nand
    discusses the possible solution models for this issue.\n\t </p>\n      "
