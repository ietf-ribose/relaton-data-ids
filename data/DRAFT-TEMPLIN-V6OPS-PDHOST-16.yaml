abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers
    which\n   then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks.\n
    \  This document considers prefix delegation models according to whether\n   the
    requesting router acts as a router on behalf of any downstream\n   networks, as
    host on behalf of its local applications or as both.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
