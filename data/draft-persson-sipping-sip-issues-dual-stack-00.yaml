abstract:
- content: "<p>The advent of IPv6 in addition to IPv4 makes hosts and servers dual-
    stack. SIP communications can be used in both environments but there is little
    understanding what will happen if some nodes are dual-stack while others, presently
    the majority, is IPv4 only enabled. This document describes some scenarios and
    associated issues when dual- stack users and servers try to communicate with IPv4
    only hosts using SIP. It is not evident that interoperability is achieved, and
    if that is not the case, this would severely limit the usability of both SIP and
    IPv6.</p>"
