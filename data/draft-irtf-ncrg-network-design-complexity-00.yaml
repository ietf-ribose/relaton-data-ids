abstract:
- content: <p>Network architecture revolves around the concept of fitting the design
    of a network to its purpose; of asking the question, "what network will best fit
    these needs?" A part of fitting network design to requirements is the problem
    of complexity, an idea often informally measured using intuition and subjective
    experience. When would adding a particular protocol, policy, or configuration
    be "too complex?" This document suggests a series of continuums along which network
    complexity might be measured. No suggestions are made on how to measure complexity
    for each of these continuums; this is left for future documents.</p>
