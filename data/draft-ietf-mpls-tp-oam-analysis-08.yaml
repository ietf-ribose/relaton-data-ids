abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of the OAM toolset for MPLS based
    Transport Networks. The toolset consists of a comprehensive set of fault management
    and performance monitoring capabilities (operating in the data-plane) which are
    appropriate for transport networks as required in RFC 5860 and support the network
    and services at different nested levels. This overview includes a brief recap
    of MPLS-TP OAM requirements and functions, and of generic mechanisms created in
    the MPLS data plane to allow the OAM packets run in-band and share their fate
    with data packets. The protocol definitions for each of the MPLS-TP OAM tools
    are defined in separate documents (RFCs or Working Group drafts) which are referenced
    by this document.</p>"
