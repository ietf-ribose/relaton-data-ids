abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides an overview of the draft requirements for
    IPv6\nsupport in the CableLabs DOCSIS 3.0 specifications.  Our goal is to\nshare
    high-level IPv6 requirements and design architecture in draft\nstatus with the
    IETF community.\n\nWe first introduce the main network elements involved in the
    support\nof IPv6 in DOCSIS cable networks and expand on the deployment\nscenarios
    in scope of the DOCSIS 3.0 efforts.  We elaborate on the\nroles played by some
    network elements in enabling IPv6 in DOCSIS: the\nbroadband access device (Cable
    Modem), the headend or network side\nequipment (Cable Modem Termination System)
    and the various backoffice\nservers.  Some high-level requirements are then summarized
    with a\nspecial focus on three network services: IPv6 provisioning and\nmanagement
    of cable modems, IPv6 transport via a DOCSIS network using\na cable modem acting
    as an IPv6 bridge or router, and IP multicast.\nFinally, we conclude with a theory
    of operations section to provide\nmore details and sample flows on how an IPv6-capable
    cable modem\nacquires its IPv6 address and configuration parameters over a DOCSIS\n3.0
    network.\n\nCableLabs, its members, the vendors participating in the DOCSIS\nspecifications
    and the co-authors of this document are seeking\ngeneral feedback from the IETF
    community on the overall DOCSIS IPv6\napproach.  The level of requirements provided
    in this document may\nvary; we also welcome feedback on where more details should
    be\nprovided in future versions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
