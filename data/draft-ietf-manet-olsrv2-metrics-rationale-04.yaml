abstract:
- content: "<p>The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) includes
    the ability to assign metrics to links and to use those metrics to allow routing
    by other than minimum hop count routes. This document provides a historic record
    of the rationale for, and design considerations behind, how link metrics were
    included in OLSRv2.</p>"
