abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>It is commonly agreed the continuous increase of routing tables
    is a\nsensitive issue which may question the sustainability of the\nInternet.
    \ This document describes a solution which makes use of\nmultiple paths without
    inducing drastic increase of routing tables.\nA constrained procedure to install
    additional paths in the RIB is\ndescribed.  Multiple paths are installed according
    to rules agreed\nbetween adjacent peers and also based on external events (e.g.,
    pro-\nactive detection of link congestion).\n\t </p>\n      "
