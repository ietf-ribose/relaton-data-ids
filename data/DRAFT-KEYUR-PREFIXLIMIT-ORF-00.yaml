abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BGP specification allows for \"the ability to impose an
    (locally\n   configured) upper bound on the number of address prefixes the speaker\n
    \  is willing to accept from a neighbor\".  In this specification, we\n   define
    a new Outbound Route Filter type for BGP, termed \"Prefix Limit\n   Outbound Route
    Filter\", which the speaker can use to communicate that\n   upper bound to its
    peer.  The peer is then required to abide by the\n   limit.  This is expected
    to have benefits in terms of resource\n   consumption and more importantly, transparency
    of operation.\n\t </p>\n      "
