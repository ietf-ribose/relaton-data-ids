abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes enhancements of bootstrapping a remote
    secure\n   key infrastructure (BRSKI) to also operate in domains featuring no
    or\n   only timely limited connectivity between involved components.\n   Moreover,
    newly introduced are methods to perform the BRSKI approach\n   in environments,
    in which the role of the pledge changes to a server\n   instead of the client.
    \ This changes the interaction model as the\n   pledge is pushed to interact with
    the registrar instead of pulling\n   information from the registrar.  To support
    both, BRSKI-AE relies on\n   the exchange of it authenticated self-contained objects
    (signature-\n   wrapped objects) also for requesting and distributing of domain\n
    \  specific device certificates.  The defined approach is agnostic\n   regarding
    the utilized enrollment protocol allowing the application\n   of existing and
    potentially new certificate management protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
