abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes an experimental application level protocol
    for\n   data transmission over tcp/ip or other streaming protocols. It is\n   also
    useful for data transmission over serial lines such as rs232.\n   This is an experimental,
    not recommended standard.  Distribution of\n   this memo is unlimited.\n\n\n\t
