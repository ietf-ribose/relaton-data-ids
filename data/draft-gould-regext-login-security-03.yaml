abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) includes a client authentication
    scheme that is based on a user identifier and password. The structure of the password
    field is defined by an XML Schema data type that specifies minimum and maximum
    password length values, but there are no other provisions for password management
    other than changing the password. This document describes an EPP extension that
    allows longer passwords to be created and adds additional security features to
    the EPP login command and response.</p>"
