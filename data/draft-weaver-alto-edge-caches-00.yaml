abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Without caches in the infrastructure, peer to peer content delivery'sprimary
    effect is cost shifting rather than cost savings. Even withperfect localization,
    depending on the relative cost of last-mileuplink bandwidth verses transport bandwidth,
    P2P may substantiallyincrease aggregate cost. Yet the addition of edge caches,
    cacheslocated in the ISPs near the customers, radically change theeconomics of
    P2P content delivery. Edge caches interact verystrongly with localization services
    for P2P content delivery, and anylocalization service must be tightly integrated
    into edge-cacheoperation.</p>"
