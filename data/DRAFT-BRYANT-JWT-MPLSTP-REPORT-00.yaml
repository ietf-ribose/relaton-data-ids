    Team\n(JWT) on the application of MPLS to Transport Networks.  The JWT\nrecommended
    of Option 1: The IETF and the ITU-T jointly agree to work\ntogether and bring
    transport requirements into the IETF and extend\nIETF MPLS forwarding, OAM, survivability,
    network management and\ncontrol plane protocols to meet those requirements through
    the IETF\nStandards Process.  There are two versions of this RFC.  An ASCII\nversion
