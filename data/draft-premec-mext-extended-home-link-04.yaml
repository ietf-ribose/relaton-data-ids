abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Mobile IPv6 for Dual Stack Hosts and Routers enables mobility for
    themobile node's IPv6 home address or prefix as well as an IPv4 homeaddress, irrespective
    of the IP version supported on the link thatthe mobile node is attached to. The
    home agent maintains bindingcache entries for the IPv6 and IPv4 home addresses
    assigned to themobile node when the mobile node is connected via a foreign link.The
    binding cache entries are deprecated when the mobile nodeattaches to its home
    link. This document addresses an issue relatedto the de-registration procedure
    and the continued connectivity forthe IPv4 home address when the mobile node attaches
    to its IPv6-onlyhome link.</p>"
