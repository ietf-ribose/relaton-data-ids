abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the 608 (Rejected) SIP response code. This response
    code enables calling parties to learn their call was rejected by an intermediary
    and will not be answered. As a 6xx code, the caller will be aware that future
    attempts to contact the same UAS will be likely to fail. The present use case
    driving the need for the 608 response code is when the intermediary is an analytics
    engine. In this case, the rejection is by a machine or other process. This contrasts
    with the 607 (Unwanted) SIP response code, which a human at the target UAS indicated
    the call was not wanted. In some jurisdictions this distinction is important and
    may have additional requirements beyond the 607 response code. Specifically, this
    document defines the use of the Call-Info header in 608 responses to enable rejected
    callers to contact entities that blocked their calls in error.</p>"
