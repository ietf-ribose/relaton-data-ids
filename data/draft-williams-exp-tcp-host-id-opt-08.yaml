abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent RFCs have discussed issues with host identification in IP address-sharing
    systems, such as address/prefix-sharing devices and application-layer proxies.
    Potential solutions for revealing a host identifier in shared address deployments
    have also been discussed. This memo describes the design, deployment, and privacy
    considerations for one such solution in operational use on the Internet today
    that uses a TCP option to transmit a host identifier.</p>"
