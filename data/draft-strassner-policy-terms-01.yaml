abstract:
  content: "<p>Recent work in the IETF has led to multiple protocols which supportthe
    classification of packets for the purposes of treating certainclasses or flows
    of packets in a particular way compared to otherpackets. The successful wide-scale
    deployment of these protocolsdepends on the ability to administer and distribute
    consistent policyinformation to the multiple devices in the network which perform
    theclassification and packet conditioning or treatment. As a result,there is a
    clear need to develop a scalable framework for policyadministration and distribution
    that will enable interoperabilityamong multiple devices and device types that
    must work together toachieve a consistent implementation of policy. Unfortunately,
    terms like 'policy' and 'service' are notcurrently defined in sufficient detail
    as to enable the definition,specification, and implementation of policy servers
    and how policy isrecognized and enforced at the device level. At present, both
    'policy'and 'service' (as well as other related terms) are overloaded withmultiple
    (often conflicting) meanings. This makes communication aboutpolicy in general
    and specifically policy-based networking cumbersomeand difficult. This document
    defines a set of terms that the Internet community canuse to exchange ideas on
    how policy creation, administration,management, and distribution could work among
    policy servers andmultiple device types.</p>"
