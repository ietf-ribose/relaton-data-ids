abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are use cases, specifically in Internet of Things (IoT)
    and\n   constrained environments that do not require confidentiality, though\n
    \  mutual authentication during tunnel establishment and message\n   integrity
    is still mandated.  This document defines the use of HMAC\n   only as ciphersuites
    in TLS 1.3.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
