abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Some networks require certain packet flows to be transported with
    \npreferential treatment over others of the same type (e.g., voice or \nvideo).
    \ This document defines a new PHB (Per Hop Behavior), the \nMulti-Level Expedited
    Forwarding (MLEF) PHB, which is a minor \nextension to EF defined in RFC 3246.
    \ RFC 3246 defines the Expedited \nForwarding PHB for applications requiring low
    latency, but with a \nsingle DSCP and treatment per queue.  Although EF suggests
    that \npacket discard should be used to achieve this behavior, it does not \ndefine
    an algorithm for packet discard.  This document extends that \nconcept and defines
    a PHB with multiple discard treatments for \npacket flows for applications requiring
    low latency and multiple \npriority levels. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
