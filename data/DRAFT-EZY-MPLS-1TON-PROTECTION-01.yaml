abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As part of the Transport Profile for Multiprotocol Label Switching\n
    \  (MPLS-TP) there is a requirement to support 1:n linear protection for\n   transport
    paths.  This requirement is elaborated on in the MPLS-TP\n   Survivability Framework
    document [SurvivFwk].  The basic protocol for\n   linear protection was specified
    in the MPLS-TP Linear Protection\n   document [LinProt] but is limited to 1+1
    and 1:1 protection.  This\n   document extends the protocol defined there to address
    the additional\n   functionality necessary to support scenarios of a single protection\n
    \  path preconfigured to provide protection of multiple transport paths\n   between
    two joint endpoints.\n\n   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering
    Task Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications\n
    \  Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile
    within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and
    functionalities of a packet transport network as\n   defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\t
