abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an event package for content push delivery
    protocol over SIP. The purpose is to allow an application on a UA to subscribe
    to updates to its own application events containing either content or references
    to the content. This document describes how content can be pushed out to an application
    by the use of push events. A new SIP event package is defined for notification
    of push events for content delivery.</p>"
