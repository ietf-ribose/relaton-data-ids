abstract:
- content: <p>Some IPsec implementations support Security Labels otherwise known as
    Security Contexts, to be configured as a selector within the Security Policy Database
    (SPD) for IPsec SAs. This document adds support to IKEv2 to negotiate these Security
    Labels or Contexts using a new Traffic Selector (TS) Type TS_SECLABEL. The approach
    is named "Labeled IPsec". It assumes that the SPD processing of RFC 4303 is already
    extended to support Security Labels. This document only adds the ability for IKE
    to negotiate the Security Labels used with the SPD.</p>
