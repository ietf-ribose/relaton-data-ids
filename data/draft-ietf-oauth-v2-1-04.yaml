abstract:
- content: "<p>The OAuth 2.1 authorization framework enables a third-party application
    to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner
    by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and an authorization
    service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own
    behalf. This specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 2.0 Authorization
    Framework described in RFC 6749.</p>"
