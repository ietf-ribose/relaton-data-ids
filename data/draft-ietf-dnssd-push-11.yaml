abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) was designed to return matching records
    efficiently for queries for data that is relatively static. When those records
    change frequently, DNS is still efficient at returning the updated results when
    polled. But there exists no mechanism for a client to be asynchronously notified
    when these changes occur. This document defines a mechanism for a client to be
    notified of such changes to DNS records, called DNS Push Notifications.</p>"
