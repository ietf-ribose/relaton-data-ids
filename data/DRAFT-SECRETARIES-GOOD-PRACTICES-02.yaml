abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The role of Working Group Secretaries has greatly evolved and\n
    \  increased in value since the writing of RFC 2418 (\"IETF Working Group\n   Guidelines
    and Procedures\"). This document further refines and\n   enriches the description
    of the Working Group Secretarial role, and\n   consequently updates RFC 2418.
    This document complements the succinct\n   description of the role of Working
    Group Secretaries by providing a\n   compilation of good practices and some general
    guidelines regarding\n   the fulfilment of the role.\n\n   This document may also
    be useful for Working Group Chairs to help\n   develop and better appreciate the
    value of Working Group Secretaries.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
