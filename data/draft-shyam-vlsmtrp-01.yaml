abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a light weight routing protocol applicable inside a network
    that appears in the form of a tree and distribution of address space takes place
    with the approach of VLSM. It is based on setting default route inside VLSM tree.
    With this approach, routing information of the external world need not be passed
    down to the VLSM tree. Thus, load inside a router gets reduced substantially.
    This document includes IP-VPN with MPLS inside VLSM tree by extending RSVP-TE.</p>"
