abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for protecting hosts connected
    to a broadcast network against rogue DHCPv6 servers. The aforementioned mechanism
    is based on DHCPv6 packet-filtering at the layer-2 device on which the packets
    are received. The aforementioned mechanism has been widely deployed in IPv4 networks
    ('DHCP snooping'), and hence it is desirable that similar functionality be provided
    for IPv6 networks.</p>"
