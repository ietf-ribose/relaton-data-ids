abstract:
- content: <p>In BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), VPN data packets traveling
    from one Provider Edge (PE) router to another generally carry two MPLS labels,
    an "inner" label that corresponds to a VPN- specific route, and an "outer" label
    that corresponds to a Label Switched Path (LSP) between the PE routers. In some
    circumstances, it is desirable to support the same type of VPN architecture, but
    using an IPsec Security Association in place of that LSP. The "outer" MPLS label
    would thus be replaced by an IP/IPsec header. This enables the VPN packets to
    be carried securely over non-MPLS networks, using standard IPsec authentication
    and/or encryption functions to protect them. This draft specifies the procedures
    which are specific to support of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs using the IPsec encapsulation.</p>
