abstract:
- content: "<p>Experience in implementing and deploying the Forwarding and Control
    Element Separation (ForCES) architecture has demonstrated the need for a few small
    extensions both to ease programmability and to improve wire efficiency of some
    transactions. The ForCES protocol is extended with a table range operation and
    a new extension for error handling. This document updates the semantics in RFCs
    5810 and 7121 to achieve that end goal.</p>"
