abstract:
- content: "<p>There are a number of instances in which the search for a particular
    value (for instance, a cryptographic key) can be distributed across a large number
    of machines, however there is not currently a standard protocol for doing so.
    A great many algorithms may be used for searches; because these algorithms may
    differ greatly, the protocol used must be flexible enough to be easily extended.</p>"
