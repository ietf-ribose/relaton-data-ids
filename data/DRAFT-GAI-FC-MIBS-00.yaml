abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Fibre Channel (FC) is a high speed serial interface technology
    that   \nsupports several Upper Layer Protocols including Small Computer \nSystem
    Interface (SCSI) and IP. Fibre Channel is standardized by the \nINCITS T11 Technical
    Committee. Fibre Channel Standards include \nFraming and Signaling protocols [FC-FS],
    Generic Services protocols \n[FC-GS-3], Switch Fabric protocols [FC-SW-2], etc.\nThe
    management of a Fibre Channel network requires to monitor and set \nmany parameters
    related to these protocols and this may be \naccomplished defining a proper set
    of MIBs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
