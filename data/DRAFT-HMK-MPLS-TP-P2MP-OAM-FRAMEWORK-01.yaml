abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized
    to enable\n   carrier-grade packet transport.\n\n   This document discusses and
    specifies P2MP framework primarily\n   related to OAM, management, and recovery.
    This document is mainly\n   based on RFC5654 and RFC6371. The main focus is on
    the details not\n   covered in relevant RFCs such as RFC5654, RFC5860, RFC5921,
    RFC5951,\n   RFC6371 and the draft-fbb-mpls-tp-p2mp-framework. Other requirements\n
    \  for p2mp transport paths, such as recovery, will also be specified in\n   a
    future version on the premise that there are return paths.\n\n   Note: This I-D
    was made and updated based on discussions in ITU-T\n   SG15, which were described
    in Liaison Statements: Request advance\n   work on the P2MP framework in the MPLS-TP\n
    \  (https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1163/) and Progressing work on\n   P2MP
    MPLS-TP connections (https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1202/)\n\n   This document
    is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) / International
    Telecommunications Union Telecommunications\n   Standardization Sector (ITU-T)
    effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3
    architectures to support the\n   capabilities and functionalities of a packet
    transport network.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
