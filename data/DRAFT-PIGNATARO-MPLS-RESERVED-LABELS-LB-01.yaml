abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In addition to being used for forwarding, an MPLS label stack
    may\n   also be used as an entropy source to perform load balancing\n   computation
    in various ways.  RFC 4928 and RFC 6790 describe this\n   mechanism in great detail.
    \ However, those two RFCs differ in the use\n   of MPLS special purpose labels
    (previously referred to as \"reserved\n   labels\") for computation of load balancing.
    \ This document addresses\n   this difference in specifications by providing a
    more comprehensive\n   set of recommendations.\n\n   This document updates RFC
    4928 and RFC 6790.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
