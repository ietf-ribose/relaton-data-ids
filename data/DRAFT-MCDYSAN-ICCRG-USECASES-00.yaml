abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft proposes some use cases for consideration by the
    iccrg.\n   These use cases are in addition to and/or complement those described\n
    \  by the conex working group[UseCases]. The conex working group had\n   determined
    that these use cases were out of scope of the current\n   charter, and/or could
    potentially be built out of the conex abstract\n   mechanism. The focus of the
    use cases in this draft is on forms of\n   congestion exposure that involve resources
    other than queues and\n   timeframes other than real-time. Background and motivation
    for these\n   use cases is first discussed. Expanded material on the usage\n   tier/volume
    use case is also provided.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
