abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an open and extensible log format to
    be used\n   by any cloud entity or cloud application to log and trace activities\n
    \  that occur in the cloud.  The logs and traces can be utilized for\n   billing,
    charging, and debugging purposes.  In addition, these logs\n   and traces are
    equally applicable for cloud infrastructure (IaaS),\n   platform (PaaS), and application
    (SaaS) services.  CloudLog is\n   different in content, but not in nature from
    the traditional logging\n   as it takes in account transient nature of Identities
    and resources\n   in the cloud.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
