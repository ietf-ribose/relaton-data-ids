abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is always confronted with
    many\n   security threats based on IP address spoofing. Unfortunately, the\n   Internet
    architecture fails to provide the defense mechanism. Source\n   Address Validation
    Improvement (SAVI) was developed to prevent IP\n   source address spoofing which
    can enable impersonation and malicious\n   traffic redirection. Thus, the mechanism
    is essential for ISPs.\n   However, due to the diversity of address assignment
    methods, SAVI\n   solution is also different accordingly. This document describes
    five\n   scenarios of ISPs'IPv6 access network, and moreover, states its SAVI\n
    \  requirements and tentative solutions accordingly.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
