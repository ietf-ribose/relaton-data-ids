abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft presents an NSIS operation over IP tunnels scheme usingQoS
    NSLP as the NSIS signaling application. Both sender-initiatedand receiver-initiated
    reservation modes are discussed. The schemeproposes the use of separate signaling
    sessions inside the tunnel forthe end-to-end sessions. Packets belonging to qualified
    tunnelsessions are assigned special flow IDs to be distinguished from therest
    of the tunnel traffic. The end-to-end session and itscorresponding tunnel session
    are associated with each other whennecessary; so that adjustment in one session
    may be reflected in theother.</p>"
