abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN) specifications
    defines\n   P-tunnels for carrying multicast traffic across the backbone.  A\n
    \  variety of P-tunnel types are supported.  Bit Index Explicit\n   Replication
    (BIER) is a new architecture that provides optimal\n   multicast forwarding through
    a \"multicast domain\", without requiring\n   intermediate routers to maintain
    any per-flow state.  The purpose of\n   the current document is to specify one
    way of carrying multicast\n   traffic over an SP MPLS backbone network using compatible
    method and\n   encapsulation of BIER.  It uses a pre-build P2MP as the BIER\n
    \  topology, and uses mLDP/RSVP-TE protocol extension to build BIER-\n   related
    underlay routing and forwarding information in-band when\n   building the P2MP
    topology.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
