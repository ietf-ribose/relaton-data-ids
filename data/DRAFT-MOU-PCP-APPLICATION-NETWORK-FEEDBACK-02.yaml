abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Nowadays users consumption style for video and multimedia\n
    \  applications is strongly changing.  Users are consuming content\n   through
    multi-screen and are heavily counting on wireless and mobile\n   devices for video
    streaming and interactive video and multimedia\n   applications.  This necessitates
    more intelligence in the service and\n   the network infrastructure to better
    suit a differentiated users\n   consumption style, which can be achieved through
    having: (i) a\n   knowledge in the network and service platform about the available\n
    \  device and network conditions for the end-user and (ii) a knowledge\n   in
    the network about the content requirements in terms of devices\n   capabilities
    and network resources for content stored either in the\n   network or in the application
    server.  To obtain such knowledge with\n   no need for changing the current infrastructure
    and in a generalized\n   way to all applications, feedback/notification mechanisms
    between the\n   end-user application, the network and the service platform is
    needed\n   to provide information helping the content delivery and adaptation\n
    \  decisions.  This document is investigating such application-agnostic\n   track.\n\n
    \  This document extends the Port Control Protocol (PCP) RFC 6887\n   [RFC6887]
    to allow: (i) the users application to notify the network\n   and application
    server about its available resources in terms of\n   devices capabilities and
    network conditions as well as information\n   about the user (e.g., location,
    mobility status) and (ii) the\n   application server to notify the network about
    the requirements of\n   the content it stores in terms of devices and network
    resources.  A\n   new PCP option, denoted the FEEDBACK, is specified to allow
    such\n   feedback notification signaling.  This option is used with both PEER\n
    \  and MAP Opcodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
