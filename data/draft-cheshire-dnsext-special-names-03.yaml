abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes what it means to say that a Domain Name (DNS
    name) is reserved for special use, when reserving such a name is appropriate,
    and the procedure for doing so. It establishes an IANA registry for such domain
    names, and seeds it with entries for some of the already established special domain
    names.</p>"
