abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of tag switching. Tag switching
    is a way to combine the label-swapping forwarding paradigm with network layer
    routing. This has several advantages. Tags can have a wide spectrum of forwarding
    granularities, so at one end of the spectrum a tag could be associated with a
    group of destinations, while at the other a tag could be associated with a single
    application flow. At the same time forwarding based on tag switching, due to its
    simplicity, is well suited to high performance forwarding. These factors facilitate
    the development of a routing system which is both functionally rich and scalable.
    Finally, tag switching simplifies integration of routers and ATM switches by employing
    common addressing, routing, and management procedures.</p>"
