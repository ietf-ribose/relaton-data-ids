abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an extension to the ACME protocol [RFC8555]\n
    \  to enable ACME servers to validate a client's control of an email\n   identifier
    using single sign-on (SSO) technologies.  An extension to\n   the CAA [RFC8659]
    resource record specification is also defined to\n   provide domain owners a means
    to declare a set of SSO providers that\n   ACME servers may rely upon when employing
    SSO for identifier\n   validation on their domain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
