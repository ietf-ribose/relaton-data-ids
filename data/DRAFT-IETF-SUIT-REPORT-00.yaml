abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Software Update for the Internet of Things (SUIT) manifest\n
    \  provides a way for many different update and boot workflows to be\n   described
    by a common format.  However, this does not provide a\n   feedback mechanism for
    developers in the event that an update or boot\n   fails.\n\n   This specification
    describes a lightweight feedback mechanism that\n   allows a developer in possession
    of a manifest to reconstruct the\n   decisions made and actions performed by a
    manifest processor.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
