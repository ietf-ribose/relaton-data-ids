- content: "<p>The document details use cases to mitigate DDoS attacks. These use
    cases are expected to illustrates involved communications to detect and mitigate
    DDoS attacks. It is expected that these communications will be in the future handled
    by the DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS). These scenarios are intended to be useful
    to derive requirements for the design of DDoS Open threat Signaling.</p>"
