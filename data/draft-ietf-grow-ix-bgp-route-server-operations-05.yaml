abstract:
- content: "<p>The popularity of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) brings new challenges
    to interconnecting networks. While bilateral External BGP (EBGP) sessions between
    exchange participants were historically the most common means of exchanging reachability
    information over an IXP, the overhead associated with this interconnection method
    causes serious operational and administrative scaling problems for IXP participants.
    Multilateral interconnection using Internet route servers can dramatically reduce
    the administrative and operational overhead associated with connecting to IXPs;
    in some cases, route servers are used by IXP participants as their preferred means
    of exchanging routing information. This document describes operational considerations
    for multilateral interconnections at IXPs.</p>"
