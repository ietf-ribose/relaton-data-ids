abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document describes three distinct SDWAN scenarios and discusses\n
    \  the applicability of BGP for each of those scenarios. The goal of\n   the document
    is to demonstrate how BGP-based control plane is used\n   for large scale SDWAN
    overlay networks with little manual\n   intervention.\n\n   SDWAN edge nodes are
    commonly interconnected by multiple underlay\n   networks which can be owned and
    managed by different network\n   providers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
