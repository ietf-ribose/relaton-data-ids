- content: "<p>Cabletron's SecureFast VLAN (SFVLAN) product implements a distributed
    connection-oriented switching protocol that provides fast forwarding of data packets
    at the MAC layer. The product uses the concept of virtual LANs (VLANs) to determine
    the validity of call connection requests and to scope the broadcast of certain
    flooded messages. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
