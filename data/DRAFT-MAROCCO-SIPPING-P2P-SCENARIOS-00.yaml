abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides a detailed description of some scenarios
    where\nSIP Connectivity could be easily achieved only in a peer to peer\nfashion.
    \ Other than identifying use cases where a P2P SIP overlay\nNetwork is the only
    affordable solution, it describes how, under some\ncircumstances, signaling and
    media communications both to and from\npublic domains can be achieved with P2P
    SIP.  Furthermore, it\nidentifies some additional elements which can be shared
    by community\nmembers or let out by access providers for extending SIP Connectivity\nto
    such limited environments.\n\t </p>\n      "
