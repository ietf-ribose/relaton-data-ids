abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The memo provides information and suggests processes for developersof
    applications based on the DNS protocol and for administratorsof servers and networks.
    It suggests new procedures for DNS andDNSSEC implementations that would prevent
    abuse of the DNSprotocol such as those seen by \"Double Flux\" service networks.Specifically,
    this document recommends that all resource records forNS records with Time-To-Live
    (TTL) settings under 24 hours bedropped as potentially malicious records designed
    to attack users.This document would update RFCs 1123, 1912, 2181 and 2535.Conventions
    used in this document The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [KWORDS].</p>"
