abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery can use naming
    systems\n   other than the Domain Name System when looking for services.\n   Different
    name systems use different conventions for the characters\n   allowed in any name.
    \ In order for DNS-SD to be used effectively in\n   environments where multiple
    different name systems are in use, it is\n   important to follow a common set
    of conventions for naming.  This\n   memo presents an outline of the reqiurements
    for selection of labels\n   for mDNS and DNS when they are expected to interoperate
    in this\n   manner.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
