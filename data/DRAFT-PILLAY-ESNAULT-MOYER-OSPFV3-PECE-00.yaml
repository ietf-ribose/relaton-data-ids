abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many Service Providers (SPs) offer the Virtual Private Network
    (VPN)\nservices to their customers, using a technique in which Customer Edge\n(CE)
    routers are routing peers of Provider Edge (PE) routers.  The\nBorder Gateway
    Protocol (BGP) is used to distribute the customer's\nroutes across the provider's
    IP backbone network, and Multiprotocol\nLabel Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel
    customer packets across the\nprovider's backbone.  This is known as a \"BGP/MPLS
    IP VPN\".\nOriginally only IPv4 was supported and it was later extended to\nsupport
    IPv6 VPNs as well.  Extensions were later added for the\nsupport of the Open Shortest
    Path First protocol version 2 (OSPFv2)\nas a PE-CE routing protocol for the IPv4
    VPNs.  This document extends\nthose specifications to support OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3)
    as a PE-CE\nrouting protocol.  The OSPFv3 PE-CE functionality is identical to\nthat
    of OSPFv2 except for the differences described in this document.\n\t </p>\n      "
