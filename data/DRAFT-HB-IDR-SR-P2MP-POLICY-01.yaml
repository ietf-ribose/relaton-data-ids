abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SR P2MP policies are set of policies that enable architecture
    for\n   P2MP service delivery.\n\n   A P2MP policy consists of candidate paths
    that connects the Root of\n   the Tree to a set of Leaves.  The P2MP policy is
    composed of\n   replication segments.  A replication segment is a forwarding\n
    \  instruction for a candidate path which is downloaded to the Root,\n   transit
    nodes and the leaves.\n\n   This document specifies a new BGP SAFI with a new
    NLRI in order to\n   advertise P2MP policy from a controller to a set of nodes.\n\n
    \  This document introduces two new route types within this NLRI, one\n   for
    P2MP policy and its candidate paths that need to be programmed on\n   the Root
    node and another for the replication segment and forwarding\n   instructions that
    needs to be programmed on the Root, and optionally\n   on Transit and Leaf nodes.\n\n
    \  It should be noted that this document does not specify how the Root\n   and
    the Leaves are discovered on the controller, it only describes\n   how the P2MP
    Policy and Replication Segments are programmed from the\n   controller to the
    nodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
