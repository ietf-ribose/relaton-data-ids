abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a protocol intended to transfer the whole contents
    of a disk partition (or the whole directory tree placed under a given directory
    on the disk) to a backup server. The protocol lies on top of TCP or other stream-oriented
    transport protocol, and is based on the exchange of messages between the client
    (the host sending data) and the server (the host storing the received data).</p>"
