abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol is commonly\n
    \  used to verify connectivity between two systems.  BFD packets are\n   typically
    very small.  It is desirable in some circumstances to know\n   that not only is
    the path between two systems reachable, but also\n   that it is capable of carrying
    a payload of a particular size.  This\n   document discusses thoughts on how to
    implement such a mechanism\n   using BFD in Asynchronous mode.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
