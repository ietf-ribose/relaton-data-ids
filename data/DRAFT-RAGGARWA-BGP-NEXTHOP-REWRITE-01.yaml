abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A BGP speaker uses the NEXT_HOP attribute or the MP_REACH_NLRI\n
    \  attribute to advertise the IP address that should be used as the next\n   hop
    to the destinations listed in the Network Layer Reachability\n   Information (NLRI).
    \ This next hop may be rewritten by other BGP\n   speakers when the NLRI is re-advertised.
    Some applications depend on\n   the original BGP next hop. This document proposes
    a mechanism to\n   preserve the original BGP next hop.\n\t </p>\n      "
