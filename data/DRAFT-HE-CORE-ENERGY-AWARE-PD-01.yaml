abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoRE defines a mechanism for resource discovery based on Web
    linking\n   with discovery, registration,modification, and other procedures. But\n
    \  energy efficiency is very important for resource constrained devices.\n   This
    specification shows an efficient method for CoAP proxy finding\n   the resource
    from end-points by reducing multicast messages.\n\n   The current version -01
    of this document is just an initial draft\n   that is modified according to related
    comments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
