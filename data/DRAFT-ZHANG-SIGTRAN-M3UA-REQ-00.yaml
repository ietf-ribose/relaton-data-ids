abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RFC 4666 defines a protocol for supporting the transport of any
    SS7 \n   MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the
    \n   services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol. \n\n   M3UA is designed
    for SEP-(TDM)-SG-(IP)-IPSEP and IPSEP-(IP)-IPSEP \n   applications, so the network
    level management function isn't required. \n   SSNM(SS7 Signalling Network Management)
    messages defined in M3UA are \n   only used for interworking with SS7. RFC 4666
    doesn't define IPSEP-\n   IPSTP-IPSEP application of M3UA. The signalling network
    management \n   function for this application needs to be extended. \n\n   Some
    parts of the specification are unclear,which  may lead to \n   misinterpretations
    and may weaken interoperability. \n\n   This document provides extensions and
    clarifications to RFC 4666. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
