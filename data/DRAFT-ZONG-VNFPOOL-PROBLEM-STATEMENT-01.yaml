abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Virtualization technology has been widely supported by both
    Network\n   Operators and Data Center providers to provide service with reduced\n
    \  operational and capital costs, automated deployment, and enhanced\n   elasticity.
    \ A challenge is how to achieve the reliability and high\n   availability capabilities
    of the virtualized network function to\n   facilitate reliable service.\n\n   This
    document focuses on the problems related to the reliability and\n   high availability
    aspects of virtualized network function.  A\n   discussion of reliable virtualized
    network function pools is\n   presented for scoping solution purpose.  Some related
    works together\n   with potential reuse and extension are also introduced.\n\n\t
