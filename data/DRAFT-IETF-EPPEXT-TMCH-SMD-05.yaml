abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Domain Name Registries (DNRs) may operate in special modes
    for\n   certain periods of time enabling trademark holders to protect their\n
    \  rights during the introduction of a Top Level Domain (TLD).\n\n   One of those
    special modes of operation is the Sunrise Period.  The\n   Sunrise Period allows
    trademark holders an advance opportunity to\n   register domain names corresponding
    to their trademarks before names\n   are generally available to the public.\n\n
    \  This document describes the format of a mark and a digitally signed\n   mark
    used by trademark holders for registering domain names during\n   the sunrise
    phase of generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs).  Three types\n   of mark objects are
    defined in this specification: registered\n   trademarks, court-validated marks,
    and marks protected by statue or\n   treaty.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
