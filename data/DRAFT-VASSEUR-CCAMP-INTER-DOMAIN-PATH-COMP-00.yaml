abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies two path computation methods for computing
    \ninter-domain Traffic Engineering (TE) Multiprotocol Label Switching \n(MPLS)
    and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Label Switched (LSP) paths. In this \ndocument a
    domain is referred to as a collection of network elements \nwithin a common sphere
    of address management or path computational \nresponsibility such as IGP areas
    and Autonomous Systems. \nThe first path computation method is also called per-domain
    path \ncomputation whereby each entry boundary LSR is responsible for \ncomputing
    the path to the next exit boundary LSR (where for instance a \nboundary LSR is
    either an ARB or an ASBR) whereas in the second method \na Path Computation Element
    (PCE)is used to compute an end to end \npartial or complete path across multiple
    domains.\n\t </p>\n      "
