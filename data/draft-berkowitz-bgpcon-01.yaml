  content: "<p>This is an update of an individual contribution that has beenaccepted
    as a work item by the Benchmarking Methodology WorkingGroup, and will split into
    two BMWG documents. It is being postedfor information. T This document defines
    a specific set of tests thatrouter implementers can use to measure and report
    the convergenceperformance of BGP-4 processes. It doe not consider the forwardingperformance
    of such routers once they have converged, or the convergencecharacteristics of
    the global routing system.</p>"
