abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a fat tree, it can be sometimes desirable to guide traffic
    to\n   particular destinations or keep specific flows to certain paths.  In\n
    \  RIFT, this traffic steering/engineering is done by using policy-\n   guided
    prefixes with their associated communities.  Routes based on\n   policy-guided
    prefixes are preferred over regular routes.  Any node\n   can originate a policy-guided
    prefix and advertise it in both north\n   and south directions, and the calculation
    in both directions are\n   distance vector based.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
