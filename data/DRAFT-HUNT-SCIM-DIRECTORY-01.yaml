abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a directory server that implements
    the SCIM\n   protocol and schema [, its capabilities and access control model],\n
    \  and optional support for LDAPv3 protocol.  This specification extends\n   SCIM
    from provisioning to a general purpose access protocol in\n   support of data
    management applications (e.g. self-service systems)\n   and RESTful clients that
    need read/write access to a directory on the\n   Internet, between domains, or
    within a cloud.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
