abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the wire image, an abstraction of the\n
    \  information available to an on-path non-participant in a networking\n   protocol.
    \ This abstraction is intended to shed light on the\n   implications on increased
    encryption has for network functions that\n   use the wire image.\n\n\t </p>\n
