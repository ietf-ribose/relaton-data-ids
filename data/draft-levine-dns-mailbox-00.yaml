abstract:
- content: "<p>Many applications would like to store per-mailbox information securely
    in the DNS. Mapping mailbox local-parts into the DNS is a difficult problem, due
    to the fuzzy matching that most mail systems do, and the DNS design that only
    does exact matching. We propose several experimental approaches that attempt to
    implement the required fuzzy matching through DNS queries.</p>"
