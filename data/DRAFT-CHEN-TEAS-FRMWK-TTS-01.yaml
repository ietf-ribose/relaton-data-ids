abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For existing MPLS LSP tunnel services, it is hard for LSP tunnels
    to\n   be booked in advance.  In addition, once an LSP tunnel is set up, it\n
    \  is assumed to consume a certain amount of resources such as link\n   bandwidth
    forever.\n\n   Temporal LSP tunnel services (TTS) provides an easy way for us
    to\n   book temporal LSP tunnels in advance.  More importantly, a temporal\n   LSP
    is an LSP with one or more time intervals and it is assumed to\n   consume the
    resources and carry traffic only in these time intervals.\n\n   This document
    specifies a framework for temporal LSP tunnel services\n   and provides a few
    of reference models along with logical components\n   required to design a solution
    for TTS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
