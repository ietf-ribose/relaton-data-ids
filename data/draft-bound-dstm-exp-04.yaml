abstract:
- content: "<p>In an IPv6 dominant environment, some applications will still require
    IPv4 addresses to interoperate. Dual stack may be configured on these hosts, but
    this will imply the configuration of network equipments (such as routers) to proceed
    IPv4 packets. The Dual Stack IPv6 Dominant Transition Mechanism (DSTM) is based
    on the use of IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnels to carry IPv4 traffic within an IPv6 network
    and provides a method to allocate a temporary IPv4 address to Dual IP Layer IPv6/IPv4
    capable nodes. DSTM is also a way to avoid the use of Network Address Translation
    for early adopter IPv6 deployment to communicate with IPv4 legacy nodes and applications.</p>"
