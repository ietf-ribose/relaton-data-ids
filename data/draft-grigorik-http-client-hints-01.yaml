abstract:
- content: "<p>An increasing diversity of Web-connected device form factors and software
    capabilities has created a need to deliver varying, or optimized content for each
    device. HTTP Client Hints can be used as input to proactive content negotiation;
    just as the Accept header allowed clients to indicate what formats they prefer,
    Client Hints allow clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences.</p>"
