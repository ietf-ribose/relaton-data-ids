abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces global elements into the SIP Conference\n
    \  Event Package XML schema to make the conference objects and sub-\n   objects
    easily accessible by schemas external to the event package,\n   such as the XCON
    conference control protocols.  This document also\n   defines the way to introduce
    XCON extensions into the SIP Conference\n   Event Package in a backwards compatible
    manner.  This document also\n   defines a set of extensions to the SIP Conference
    Event Package XML\n   schema being used in the XCON conferencing architecture.\n\t
