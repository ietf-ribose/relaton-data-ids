abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to collect and put under discussion
    requirements for a protocol allowing for decomposition of application-awareness
    from packet processing in firewalls. The protocol will be used by application-aware
    entities to control packet flows of applications traversing firewalls dynamically.
    This kind of control allows applications using session control protocols to traverse
    firewalls while still retaining restrictive packet filtering policy. Network management
    tools may also utilize the protocol to manage packet-processing policies. We suggest
    an extensible framework that may be used for management of arbitrary per-flow
    control states in network nodes.</p>"
