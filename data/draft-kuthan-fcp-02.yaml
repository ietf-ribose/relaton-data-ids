abstract:
  content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to collect and put under discussionrequirements
    for a protocol allowing for decomposition ofapplication-awareness from packet
    processing in firewalls. Theprotocol will be used by application-aware entities
    to controlpacket flows of applications traversing firewalls dynamically. Thiskind
    of control allows applications using session control protocolsto traverse firewalls
    while still retaining restrictive packetfiltering policy. Network management tools
    may also utilize theprotocol to manage packet-processing policies. We suggest
    anextensible framework that may be used for management of arbitraryper-flow control
    states in network nodes.</p>"
