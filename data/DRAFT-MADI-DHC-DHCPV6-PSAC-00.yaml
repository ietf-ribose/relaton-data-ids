abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPSec [RFC2401]is pervasive in many scenarios to build the channel
    of\nsecurity mechanism to protect the communication between the host and\nthe
    local servers, such as DNS recursive name server [RFC1304].  In\nthe public wireless
    access environment, an extra trust relationship\nconfiguration between the roaming
    host and the local server, manually\nor by IKE [RFC2409], is indispensible.\n\nDHCP
    is typically the first protocol executed by a mobile host when\nit enters a new
    network, so this document present an extension to\nDHCPv6 to piggyback the parameters
    needed for IPSec, avoiding the\ndelay invited by manual configuration of security
    association or IKE\ninteraction for IPSec.\n\t </p>\n      "
