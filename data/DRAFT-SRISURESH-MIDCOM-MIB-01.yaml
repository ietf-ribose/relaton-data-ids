abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Middlebox communication (midcom) was conceived to move\napplication
    level gateway (ALG) intelligence out of \nmiddleboxes into application specific
    midcom agents. Midcom\nagents will be assumed to use midcom to control middlebox\nresources
    so as to permit applications to traverse a\nmiddlebox. The scope of the middleboxes
    is limited to NAT and\nfirewall devices. This document defines SNMP managed midcom\nobjects
    to control middlebox resources and justifies adapting\nSNMPv3 as the midcom protocol.\n\t
