abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS filtering is widely deployed for network security, but
    filtered\n   DNS responses lack information for the end user to understand the\n
    \  reason for the filtering.  Existing mechanisms to provide detail to\n   end
    users cause harm especially if the blocked DNS response is to an\n   HTTPS website.\n\n
    \  This document defines a mechanism to explain the reason for the DNS\n   filtering
    and provides HTTPS URIs to get more detail.  This\n   information can be parsed
    by the client and displayed, logged, or\n   used for other purposes.\n\n\t </p>\n
