abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SPAN-A (pronounced 'spanner') is a candidate for the pre-midcom
    SPAN\nprotocol.  The scope of SPAN (Simple Protocol for Augmenting NATs) is\nto
    enable protocols involving multiple associated sessions to operate\nacross NATs.
    \ Such protocols typically use transport addresses to\nidentify associated sessions.
    \ This works well for environments where\nend-to-end addressing is in force, but
    is broken by the introduction\nof NATs.  SPAN is intended to operate with symmetric
    NATs by using a\nrelay outside the NAT.  It complements STUN [STUN] which operates\nwith
    various kinds of cone NAT.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
