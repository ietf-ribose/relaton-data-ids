abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the requirements for Trustworthy Multipurpose
    Remote Identification (IETF tm-rid) protocols and services to support Unmanned
    Aircraft System Remote Identification (UAS RID). Objectives include: complementing
    external technical standards as regulator-accepted means of compliance with UAS
    RID regulations; facilitating use of existing Internet resources to support UAS
    RID and to enable enhanced related services; and enabling verification that UAS
    RID information is trustworthy (to some extent, even in the absence of Internet
    connectivity at the receiving node).</p>"
