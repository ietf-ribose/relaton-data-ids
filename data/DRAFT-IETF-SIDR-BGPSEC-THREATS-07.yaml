abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a threat model for the context in which\n
    \  (E)BGP path security mechanisms will be developed.  The threat model\n   includes
    an analysis of the RPKI, and focuses on the ability of an AS\n   to verify the
    authenticity of the AS path info received in a BGP\n   update.  We use the term
    PATHSEC to refer to any BGP path security\n   technology that makes use of the
    RPKI.  PATHSEC will secure BGP\n   [RFC4271], consistent with the inter-AS security
    focus of the RPKI\n   [RFC6480].\n\n   The document characterizes classes of potential
    adversaries that are\n   considered to be threats, and examines classes of attacks
    that might\n   be launched against PATHSEC.  It does not revisit attacks against\n
    \  unprotected BGP, as that topic has already been addressed in\n   [RFC4271].
    \ It concludes with brief discussion of residual\n   vulnerabilities.\n\n\t </p>\n
