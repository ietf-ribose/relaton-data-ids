abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>[LDUP Model] describes the architectural approach to replication
    of\nLDAP directory contents.  This document describes the information\nmodel and
    schema elements which support LDAP Replication Services\nwhich conform to [LDUP
    Model].\n\nDirectory schema is extended to provide object classes, subentries,\nand
    attributes to describe areas of the namespace which are under\ncommon administrative
    authority, units of replication (ie, subtrees,\nor partitions of the namespace,
    which are replicated), servers which\nhold replicas of various types for the various
    partitions of the\nnamespace, which namespaces are held on given servers, and
    the\nprogress of various namespace management and replication operations.\nAmong
    other things, this knowledge of where directory content is\nlocated will provide
    the basis for dynamic generation of LDAP\nreferrals for clients who can follow
    them.\n\t </p>\n      "
