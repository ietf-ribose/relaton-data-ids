abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many enhancements to the email service have appeared since
    its basic\n   format and protocol were defined.  However, the lines between these\n
    \  are sometimes blurred as a result of the evolution of the software\n   that
    implements them.  This document provides observations about\n   these points and
    some clear guidelines for those interested in\n   developing further enhancements.\n\n\t
