abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In DNS Queries over HTTPS [RFC8484], the port that communicates
    with\n   DNS would change from UDP to TCP 443.  This change causes a new\n   problem
    that makes it difficult to identify which is the name\n   resolution request,
    so it is difficult to use web filtering, parental\n   controls and so on.  Furthermore,
    a user-agent in a HTTP header that\n   is necessary for HTTPS communications could
    be a data used to track\n   users.  In summary, DNS Queries over HTTPS has some
    problems that\n   affect users' security and privacy.  This draft proposes a system\n
    \  that is set mediation servers between client side and DNS servers.\n   With
    this proposal, it is expected that those two problems will be\n   solved.\n\n\t
