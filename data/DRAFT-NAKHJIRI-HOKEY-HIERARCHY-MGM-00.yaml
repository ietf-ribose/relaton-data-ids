abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a generic delivery framework for usage
    and/\n   or domain specific keys, derived as part of an EAP EMSK hierarchy,\n
    \  from an EAP server to an intended third party key holder.  The\n   framework
    description includes different scenarios for key delivery,\n   depending on the
    type of keys being delivered.  It also includes,\n   specification of derivation
    of keys required for security protection\n   of key requests and delivery signaling.
    \ The key delivery framework\n   also includes proper specification and conveyance
    of the context and\n   scope of the keys being delivered.  All keys generated
    directly from\n   EMSK as part of the EMSK key hierarchy are derived following
    the\n   guidelines described in [I-D.ietf-hokey-emsk-hierarchy].  Derivation\n
    \  of the EMSK based handover root key (HRK) and domain specific\n   handover
    root keys (DSHRK) for use in the problem of handover keying\n   and re-authentication
    is also described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
