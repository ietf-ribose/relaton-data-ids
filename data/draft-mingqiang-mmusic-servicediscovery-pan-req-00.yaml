abstract:
- content: "<p>Several protocols exist in the industry for device/service discovery.
    Each of these protocols addresses the aspects of device/service discovery in different
    network environments. A Service Discovery in a PAN Personal Area Network (PAN)
    is dynamic in its nature where devices may join and leave the network very frequently.
    A PAN, being an ad- hoc network, also differs from fixed networks in many other
    ways. The current generation of service protocols such as SLP were not designed
    for such an environment. This document specifies the requirements of a service
    discovery protocol for PANs, which specifically can be used for applications such
    as multimedia session transfer between devices within a PAN.</p>"
