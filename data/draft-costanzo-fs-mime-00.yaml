    mappings to file types. The intent of this draft is to both define a new comprehensive
    toplevel type and define a method and usage for one of the to be definedsubtypes.

    to move a structured set of files systemobject structures (directories and/or
    files) as a MIME attachmentfrom one environment to another while preserving common
    elements.</p>"
