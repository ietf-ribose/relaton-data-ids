abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the ChaCha20 stream cipher as well as the use
    of the Poly1305 authenticator, both as stand-alone algorithms and as a "combined
    mode", or Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm. RFC
    7539, The predecessor of this document, did not introduce any new crypto, but
    was meant to serve as a stable reference and an implementation guide. It was a
    product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG). This document merges the errata
    filed against RFC 7539 and adds a little text to the Security Considerations section.</p>
