abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are on-going activities in the networking community to
    develop\n   solutions that aid in IP handover mechanisms between heterogeneous\n
    \  wired and wireless access systems including, but not limited to, IEEE\n   802.21.
    \ Intelligent access selection, taking into account link layer\n   attributes,
    requires the delivery of a variety of different\n   information types to the terminal
    from different sources within the\n   network and vice-versa.  The protocol requirements
    for this\n   signalling have both transport and security issues that must be\n
    \  considered.  The signalling must not be constrained to specific link\n   types,
    so there is at least a common component to the signalling\n   problem which is
    within the scope of the IETF.  This draft presents a\n   problem statement for
    this core problem.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
