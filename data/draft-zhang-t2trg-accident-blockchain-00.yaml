abstract:
- content: "<p>Blockchain is a distributed technology, and it uses cryptography and
    hash functions to store data in a chain to ensure that data are tamper-resistant
    and traceable. So, this document proposes an architecture for collecting traffic
    accident information based on blockchain. At the same time, this document describes
    the working method of collecting traffic accident information under this architecture.</p>"
