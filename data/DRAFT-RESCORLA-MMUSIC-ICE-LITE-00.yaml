abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a technique
    for\n   discovering a set of addresses which two peers can use to\n   communicate,
    even in the face of topological obstacles such as NATs.\n   Because the topologies
    in which ICE may be used are complex, a full\n   ICE implementation is also fairly
    complex.  Implementation which will\n   only be deployed in settings where they
    have public addresses (e.g.,\n   SIP-PSTN gateways) can, however, be substantially
    simpler.  This\n   document describes a subset of ICE suitable for such implementations.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
