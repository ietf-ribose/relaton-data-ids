abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the special requirements for applying
    the \nPath Computation Element (PCE) in Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) \nnetworks,
    including Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), Synchronous \nDigital Hierarchy
    (SDH), and Digital Wrapper (G.709 ODUk). \n\nThe material presented in this document
    is collected here \nfor analysis. The intention is to separate this material into
    \nseparate documents on generic GMPLS requirements, generic \nGMPLS extensions,
    and TDM-specific requirements and extensions. \n\n\n \n \n Conventions used in
    this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\t </p>\n
