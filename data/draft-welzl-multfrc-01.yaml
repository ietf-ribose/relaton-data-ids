abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies the MulTFRC congestion control mechanism.MulTFRC
    is derived from TFRC and can be implemented by carrying out afew small and simple
    changes to the original mechanism. Its behaviordiffers from TFRC in that it emulates
    a number of TFRC flows withmore flexibility than what would be practical or even
    possible usingmultiple real TFRC flows. Additionally, MulTFRC better preserves
    theoriginal features of TFRC than multiple real TFRCs do.</p>"
