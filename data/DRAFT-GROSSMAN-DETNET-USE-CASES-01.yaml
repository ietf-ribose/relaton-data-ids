abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft documents requirements in several diverse industries
    to\n   establish multi-hop paths for characterized flows with deterministic\n
    \  properties.  In this context deterministic implies that streams can\n   be
    established which provide guaranteed bandwidth and latency which\n   can be established
    from either a Layer 2 or Layer 3 (IP) interface,\n   and which can co-exist on
    an IP network with best-effort traffic.\n\n   Additional requirements include
    optional redundant paths, very high\n   reliability paths, time synchronization,
    and clock distribution.\n   Industries considered include wireless for industrial
    applications,\n   professional audio, electrical utilities, building automation\n
    \  systems, radio/mobile access networks, automotive, and gaming.\n\n   For each
    case, this document will identify the application, identify\n   representative
    solutions used today, and what new uses an IETF DetNet\n   solution may enable.\n\n\t
