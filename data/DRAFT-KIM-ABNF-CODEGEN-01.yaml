abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an ABNF extension for code generation.
    ABNF\nhas been widely used for decades. While its popurarity is ascribed to\nits
    simplicity and ease of use,  the demand for code generation\nhas been fulfilled
    only marginally, by some sort of non-standard\nextensions, or by conversion to
    yet another meta language. One\npossible solution is to add more detailed specifications
    to the\nexisting ABNF standard, but this hurts the very competitiveness of\nABNF
    itself.  Another solution is to standardize an extension and\nmake it a 'sister'
    standard in parallel to the existing ABNF\nstandaard.  In this document we propose
    such an extension as a\nstandard. The generated code using the proposed extension
    would be\n\"complete\", meaning no need to modify by hand, if there exist no\nconcepts
    of unordered groups in the specification.\n\t </p>\n      "
