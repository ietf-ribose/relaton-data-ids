abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the DNS Resolver Discovery Protocol
    (RDP)\n   that enables a DNS client to discover various available DNS resolving\n
    \  services instantiated as resolvers.  These resolvers can be local and\n   global.
    \ The discovery is primarily initiated by a DNS client, but a\n   resolver may
    also inform the DNS client with other resolver services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
