abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the transition requirements for an IPv6 Customer
    Edge (CE) router. Specifically, this document extends the "Basic Requirements
    for IPv6-only Customer Edge Routers" ([RFC7084]) in order to allow the provisioning
    of IPv6 transition services for the hosts attached to it. The document covers
    several transition technologies, either for delivering IPv6 in IPv4-only access
    networks and specially for delivering IPv4 "as-a-service" as required in a world
    where IPv4 addresses are no longer available, so hosts in the customer LANs with
    IPv4-only or IPv6-only applications or devices, requiring to communicate with
    IPv4-only services at the Internet, are able to do so.</p>
