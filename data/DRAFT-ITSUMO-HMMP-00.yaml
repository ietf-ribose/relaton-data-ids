abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Host mobility management protocol (HMMP) is a protocol for supporting\nreal-time
    and non-real-time multimedia applications on mobile\nterminals of 3G-IP networks.
    HMMP utilizes as well as extends session\ninitiation protocol (SIP) to provide
    means of domain hand-off (i.e.,\nroaming), and subnet hand-off (i.e., macro mobility)
    so that users\ncan access the network from any location using their own mobile\nterminal.
    An advantage of HMMP is that it can spoof constant\nendpoints for mobile TCP connections
    and supports mobile TCP\napplications in a SIP environment without any changes
    to the TCP.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
