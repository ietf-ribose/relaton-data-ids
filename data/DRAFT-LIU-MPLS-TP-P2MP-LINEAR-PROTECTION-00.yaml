abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In MPLS-TP requirement document(rfc5654), there is a requirement
    to\n   support 1+1 and 1:n linear protection for p2mp connectivity.  The\n   requirement
    was descirbled in MPLS-TP Survivability Framework\n   document(RFC 6372).  The
    basic protocol for linear protection was\n   specified in the MPLS-TP Linear Protection
    document [RFC 6378] but is\n   limited to 1+1 and 1:1 protection for p2p connectivity.
    in addtion,\n   The 1:N protection in which all of working transport paths and
    the\n   protection path have the same end points was specified in MPLS-TP 1:N\n
    \  protection document(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection).This document\n   applies
    the existing PSC(RFC 6378) and extensive PSC\n   protocol(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection)
    to support scenarios of\n   protecting the p2mp path by extending the existing
    p2p linear\n   protection mechanism. .\n\n\n   This document is a product of a
    joint Internet Engineering Task\n   Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications
    Union\n   Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include\n
    \  an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures\n   to
    support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport\n   network
    as defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
