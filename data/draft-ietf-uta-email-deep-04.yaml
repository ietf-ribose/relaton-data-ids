abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a set of requirements and facilities designed
    to improve email confidentiality between a mail user agent (MUA) and a mail submission
    or mail access server. This provides mechanisms intended to increase use of already
    deployed Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology, provide a model for mail user
    agent's confidentiality assurance, and enable mail service providers to advertise
    improved TLS confidentiality facilities.</p>"
