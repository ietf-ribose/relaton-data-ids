abstract:
- content: "<p>Data models for service and network management provides a programmatic
    approach for representing services or networks and deriving (1) configuration
    information that will be communicated to network and service components that are
    used to build and deliver the service and (2) state information that will be monitored
    and tracked. Indeed, data models can be used during various phases of the service
    and network management life cycle, such as service instantiation, provisioning,
    optimization, monitoring, diagnostic, and assurance. Also, data models are instrumental
    in the automation of network management. They also provide closed-loop control
    for the sake of adaptive and deterministic service creation, delivery, and maintenance.
    This document describes an architecture for service and network management automation
    that takes advantage of YANG modeling technologies. This architecture is drawn
    from a network provider perspective irrespective of the origin of a data module;
    it can thus accommodate modules that are developed outside the IETF. The document
    aims in particular to exemplify an approach that specifies the journey from technology-agnostic
    services to technology-specific actions.</p>"
