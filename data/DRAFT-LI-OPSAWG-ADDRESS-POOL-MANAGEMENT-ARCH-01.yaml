abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IP addresses work as a basic element for providing broadband
    network\n   services.  However, the increase in number, diversity and complexity\n
    \  of modern network devices and services creates unprecedented\n   challenges
    for the currently prevailing approach of manual IP address\n   management.  Manually
    maintaining IP addresses could always be sub-\n   optimal for IP resource utilization.
    \ Besides, it requires heavy\n   human effort from network operators.  To achieve
    high utilization and\n   flexible scheduling of IP network addresses, it is necessary
    to\n   automate the address scheduling process.  This document describes an\n
    \  architecture for the IP address space management.  It includes\n   architectural
    concepts and components used in the CASM (Coordinated\n   Address Space Management),
    with a focus on those interfaces to be\n   standardized in the IETF.\n\n\t </p>\n
