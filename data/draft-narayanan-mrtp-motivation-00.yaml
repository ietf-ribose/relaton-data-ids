abstract:
- content: "<p>We proposed a new multi-flow real time protocol (MRTP) in our earlier
    internet-draft [1] for carrying real-time data through multiple paths between
    the source and the destination. There are a various advantages in multipath data
    transport as demonstrated by [2][3] [5][8]. MRTP would provide an end-to-end transport
    services over multiple flows and paths to real time data. In this draft we discuss
    the motivation for needing such a standardized protocol to encourage further discussion
    on the requirement for a multi-path transport protocol.</p>"
