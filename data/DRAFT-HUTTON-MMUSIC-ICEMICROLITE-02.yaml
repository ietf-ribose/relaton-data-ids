abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a mechanism for conveying multiple IP\naddresses
    of different address families (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) for a\ngiven medium, in the same
    Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer.\nThis proposed mechanism solves the
    backward compatibility which\nexists with ANAT, due to its syntax, and provides
    a migration path\ntowards support for ICE.  The proposed mechanism is significantly\nless
    complex then ICE or ICE-Lite but uses ICE syntax.  The mechanism\ndescribed in
    this document has been named ICE-microLite.\n\t </p>\n      "
