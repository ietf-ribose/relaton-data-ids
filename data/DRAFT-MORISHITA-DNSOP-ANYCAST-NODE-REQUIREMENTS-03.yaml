abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IP anycast [1] is a technology to share one IP address for
    Internet\n   services with multiple server nodes.  It is now being deployed for\n
    \  improving service reliability, scalability, and stability.\n\n   Especially,
    \"Global-Scope\" IP anycast is now being deployed for\n   authoritative name servers,
    typically for root servers.\n\n   RFC 3258 [2] describes a set of practices to
    apply IP anycast\n   technology for authoritative name servers.  And \"Operation
    of Anycast\n   Services\" Internet-Draft [3] (hereafter, called \"Anycast BCP\")\n
    \  describes a series of recommendations and considerations for\n   distribution
    of services using IP anycast.\n\n   On the other hand, operators of authoritative
    name servers can also\n   refer to RFC 2182 [4] and 2870 [5] for general guidances
    on\n   appropriate practices for authoritative name servers.\n\n   This memo describes
    the details of requirements and preconditions for\n   making \"Global-Scope\"
    IP anycast nodes for authoritative name\n   servers, with the conformance of the
    practices in RFC 2182, 2870,\n   3258 and Anycast BCP.\n\n   And this memo also
    describes our findings and experiences for making\n   IP anycast nodes for us.
    \ Authors hope that it is useful for DNS\n   operators that they will walk on
    the same way in the future,\n   especially for TLD operators.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
