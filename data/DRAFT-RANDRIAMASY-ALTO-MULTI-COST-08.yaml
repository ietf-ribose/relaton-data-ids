abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IETF is designing a new service called ALTO (Application Layer\n
    \  traffic Optimization) that includes a \"Network Map Service\", an\n   \"Endpoint
    Cost Service\" and an \"Endpoint (EP) Ranking Service\" and\n   thus incentives
    for application clients to connect to ISP preferred\n   Endpoints.  These services
    provide a view of the Network Provider\n   (NP) topology to overlay clients.\n\n
    \  The present draft proposes a simple way to extend the information\n   provided
    by the current ALTO protocol in two ways.  First, including\n   information on
    multiple Cost Types in a single ALTO transaction\n   provides a better mapping
    of the Selected Endpoints to needs of the\n   growing diversity of Content and
    Resources Networking Applications\n   and to the network conditions.  Second,
    one ALTO query and response\n   exchange on N Cost Types is faster and more efficient
    than N single\n   cost transactions.  All this also helps producing a faster and
    more\n   robust choice when multiple Endpoints need to be selected.  Last, the\n
    \  draft proposes to enrich the filtering capabilities by allowing\n   constraints
    involving several metrics combined by several types of\n   logical operators.
    \ This allows the applications to set finer\n   requirements and above all to
    include compromises on those\n   requirements.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
