abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo documents a proposed mechanism for a first stage of atransition
    from an unsigned DNS root to a signed root, such thatthe data in the root zone
    is accompanied by DNSSEC signatures toallow validation.The underlying reason for
    signing the root is to be able to providea more secure DNS hierarchy, where it
    is possible to distinguishfalse answers from correct answers. For the special
    case of the DNS root zone, an interim scheme isproposed. This scheme is mostly
    aimed at securing the root zoneitself for technical and operational reasons, and
    to giveoperational experience of DNSSEC.</p>"
