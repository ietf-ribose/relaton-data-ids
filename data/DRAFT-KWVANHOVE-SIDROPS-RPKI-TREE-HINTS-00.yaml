abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), holders of
    IP\n   address space can become a Certification Authority (CA), optionally\n   hosting
    their repository.  They can also delegate (part of) their\n   resources to subordinate
    CAs, who in turn may do the same.  This CA\n   hierarchy forms a tree structure.
    \ Relying Party (RP) software walks\n   this tree and determines the current valid
    objects.  An underlying\n   assumption is that this tree is finite and kept at
    a reasonable size.\n   This assumption is not guaranteed to hold.  This document
    proposes a\n   new Tree Hint object on RPKI manifests that can add constraints
    for\n   use in RP processing that ensure this assumption holds.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
