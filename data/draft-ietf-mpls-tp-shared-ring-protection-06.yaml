abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes requirements, architecture, and solutions for
    MPLS-TP Shared-Ring Protection (MSRP) in a ring topology for point- to-point (P2P)
    services. The MSRP mechanism is described to meet the ring protection requirements
    as described in RFC 5654. This document defines the Ring Protection Switching
    (RPS) protocol that is used to coordinate the protection behavior of the nodes
    on an MPLS ring.</p>"
