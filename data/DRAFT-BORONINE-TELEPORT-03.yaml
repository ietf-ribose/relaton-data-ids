abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Teleport is a minimal type system designed as an extension
    of JSON.\n   It comes with 10 types sufficient for basic use and provides two\n
    \  patterns for extending it with new types.  Teleport's type\n   definitions
    are JSON values, for example, an array of strings is\n   defined as {\"Array\":
    \"String\"}.\n\n   Teleport implementations can be used for data serialization,
    input\n   validation, for documenting JSON APIs and for building API clients.\n\n
    \  This document provides the mathematical basis for Teleport and can be\n   used
    for implementing libraries.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
