abstract:
- content: "<p>Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery can use naming systems
    other than the Domain Name System when looking for services. Moreover, when it
    uses the DNS, DNS-Based Service Discovery uses the full capability of DNS, rather
    than using a subset of available octets. In order for DNS-SD to be used effectively
    in environments where multiple different name systems and conventions for their
    operation are in use, it is important to attend to differences in the underlying
    technology and operational environment. This memo presents an outline of the requirements
    for selection of labels for conventional DNS and other resolution systems when
    they are expected to interoperate in this manner.</p>"
