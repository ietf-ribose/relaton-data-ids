abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When network address translation (NAT) is used in an address
    resource\n   restricted environment, or when a lot of users are located under
    a\n   NAT device, IP addresses and port resources may be eaten up, and this\n
    \  affects user experiences very negatively.  This situation can be\n   greatly
    mitigated by tweaking mapping behavior and session timer\n   handling in NAT functions.
    \ This document proposes extension for\n   optimizing NAT IP address and port
    resources in address resource\n   restricted environments.  The extension makes
    use of TCP timestamps\n   and sequence numbers for TIME_WAIT assassination.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
