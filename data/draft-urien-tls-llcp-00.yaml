abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the implementation, named LLCPS, of the TLS
    protocol over the NFC (Near Field Communication) LLCP layer. The NFC peer to peer
    (P2P) protocol may be used by any application that needs communication between
    two devices at very small distances (a few centimeters). LLCPS enforces a strong
    security in NFC P2P exchanges, and may be deployed for many services, in the Internet
    Of Things ecosystem, such as access control or ticketing operations.</p>"
