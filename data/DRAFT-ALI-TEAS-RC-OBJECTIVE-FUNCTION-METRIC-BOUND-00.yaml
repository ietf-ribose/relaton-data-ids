abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     In particular networks such as those used by financial\n
    \    institutions, network performance criteria such as latency are\n     becoming
    critical to data path selection.  However cost is still an\n     important consideration.
    \ This leads to a situation where path\n     calculation involves multiple metrics
    and more complex objective\n     functions.\n\n     When using GMPLS control plane,
    there are many scenarios in which a\n     node may need to request a remote node
    to perform path computation\n     or expansion, like for example multi-domain
    LSP setup, Generalized\n     Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User-Network
    Interface (UNI)\n     or simply the utilization of a loose ERO in intra domain
    signaling.\n     In such cases, the node requesting the setup of an LSP needs
    to\n     convey the required objective function to the remote node, to\n     enable
    it to perform route computation in the desired fashion.\n     Similarly, there
    are cases where the ingress node needs to indicate\n     a TE metric bound for
    a loose segment that is expanded by a remote\n     node.\n\n     This document
    defines extensions to the RSVP-TE Protocol to allow\n     an ingress node to request
    the required objective function for the\n     route computation, as well as a
    metric bound to influence route\n     computation decisions at a remote node(s).\n\n
