abstract:
- content: <p>Experience with the "Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds (6to4)"
    IPv6 transition mechanism has shown that the mechanism is unsuitable for widespread
    deployment and use in the Internet, especially in its anycast mode. This document
    requests that RFC 3068, "An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers", be made obsolete
    and moved to historic status. It also recommends that future products should not
    support 6to4 anycast and that existing deployments should be reviewed.</p>
