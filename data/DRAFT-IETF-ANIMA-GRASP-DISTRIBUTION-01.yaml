abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a solution for information distribution
    in the\n   autonomic network infrastructure (ANI).  Information distribution is\n
    \  categorized into two different modes: 1) instantaneous distribution\n   and
    2) publication for retrieval.  In the former case, the\n   information is sent,
    propagated and disposed of after reception.  In\n   the latter case, information
    needs to be stored in the network.\n\n   The capability to distribute information
    is a basic and fundamental\n   need for an autonomous network ([RFC7575]).  This
    document describes\n   typical use cases of information distribution in ANI and
    requirements\n   to ANI, such that rich information distribution can be natively\n
    \  supported.  The document proposes extensions to the autonomic nodes\n   and
    suggests an implementation based on GRASP\n   ([I-D.ietf-anima-grasp]) extensions
    as a protocol on the wire.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
