abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In order for DNSSEC to be deployed operationally with large zonesand
    little operational impact, there needs to be included amechanism that allows for
    the separation of secure versus unsecureviews of zones. This needs to be done
    in a transparent fashion thatallows DNSSEC to be deployed in an incremental manner.
    Thisdocument proposes the use of an extended RCODE to signify that aDNSSEC-aware
    requestor may have to re-query for the information, ifand only if, the delegation
    is not yet secure. Thus, one canmaintain two views of the zone and expand the
    DNSSEC zone as demandwarrants.</p>"
