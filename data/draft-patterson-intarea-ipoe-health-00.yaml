abstract:
  content: "<p>PPPoE clients have the functionality to detect path unavailability
    by using PPP Keepalives. IPoE does not have this functionality, and it's not specified
    when an IPoE client should consider its WAN connectivity down, unless there is
    a physical layer link down event. This document describes a way for IPoE clients
    to achieve connectivity validation, similar to that of PPPoE, by using existing
    ARP and Neighbor Discovery functions.</p>"
