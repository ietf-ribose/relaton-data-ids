  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification introduces an alternative way to select
    a HTTP\n   response from a cache based upon its request headers, using the HTTP\n
    \  \"Variants\" and \"Variant-Key\" response header fields.  Its aim is to\n   make
    HTTP proactive content negotiation more cache-friendly.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
