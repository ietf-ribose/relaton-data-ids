abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the applicability of the Generic Associated channel
    Label (GAL), enabling the realization of the communication between a Maintenance
    End Point (MEP) and a Maintenance Intermediate Point (MIP) in the MPLS-TP OAM
    architecture. This mechanism can only be used in the point-to-point co-routed
    bidirectional path of MPLS- TP networks. By introducing the MPLS-TP Sign Label,
    it enables the peer MEP to obtain the path information along the MPLS Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs) or MPLS pseudowires (PWs). After that, it could number the MIPs along
    the path, and each MIP could record the pairing relationship of the forward and
    the backward directions of that transport path.</p>"
