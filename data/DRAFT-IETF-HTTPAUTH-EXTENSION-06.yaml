abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies extensions of HTTP authentication framework\n
    \  for interactive clients.  Recently, fundamental features of HTTP-\n   level
    authentication are insufficient for complex requirements of\n   various Web-based
    applications.  This forces these applications to\n   implement their own authentication
    frameworks using HTML Forms and\n   other means, which becomes one of the hurdles
    against introducing\n   secure authentication mechanisms handled jointly by servers
    and user-\n   agent.  The extended framework fills gaps between Web application\n
    \  requirements and HTTP authentication provisions to solve the above\n   problems,
    while maintaining compatibility against existing Web and\n   non-Web uses of HTTP
    authentications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
