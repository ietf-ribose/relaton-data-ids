abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Application/BatchBeep content-type, like the Multipart/Relatedcontent-type,
    provides a mechanism for representing objects thatconsist of multiple components.
    An Application/BatchBeep entitycontains the wire representation of the client-to-server
    part of aBEEP (Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol) session, which consists ofsequence
    of frames. Each frame contains a message or a part of amessage. Each message (other
    than channel 0 messages) represents acomponent of the compound object, just as
    a body part of aMultipart/Related entity represents a component.</p>"
