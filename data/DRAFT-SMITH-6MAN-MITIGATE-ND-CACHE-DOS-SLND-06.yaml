abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the functions of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery is to discover\n
    \  whether a specified neighbor is present.  During the neighbor\n   presence
    discovery process state is created.  A node's capacity for\n   this state can
    be intentionally exhausted to perform a denial of\n   service attack, known as
    the \"Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack\".  This\n   memo proposes a stateless form
    of neighbor presence discovery to\n   prevent this Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack.\n\n\t
