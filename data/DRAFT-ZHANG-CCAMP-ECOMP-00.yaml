abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a usecase, called enhanced coordinated
    multi-\n   point (eCoMP), for integreting radio and optical networks.  It focus\n
    \  on the fronthaul flexibility that allows \"any-RRH_A to any-BBU_A\"\n   connection
    to improve the eCoMP service performance.  The procedure\n   of the usecase is
    based on the unified radio and optical control\n   archtecture, and an extended
    OpenFlow protocol is introduced to\n   realize the procedure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
