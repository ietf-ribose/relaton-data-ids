abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a new Session Description Protocol
    (SDP)\n   Grouping Framework extension, 'BUNDLE'.  The extension can be used\n
    \  with the SDP Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a\n   single
    transport (5-tuple) for sending and receiving media described\n   by multiple
    SDP media descriptions (\"m=\" sections).  Such transport\n   is referred to as
    a BUNDLE transport, and the media is referred to as\n   bundled media.  The \"m=\"
    sections that use the BUNDLE transport form\n   a BUNDLE group.\n\n   This specification
    updates RFC 3264, to also allow assigning a zero\n   port value to a \"m=\" section
    in cases where the media described by\n   the \"m=\" section is not disabled or
    rejected.\n\n   This specification defines a new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) source\n
    \  description (SDES) item and a new RTP header extension that can be\n   used
    to correlate bundled RTP/RTCP packets with their appropriate\n   \"m=\" section.\n\n
    \  This specification updates RFC 7941, by adding an exception, for the\n   MID
    RTP header extension, to the requirement regarding protection of\n   an SDES RTP
    header extension carrying an SDES item for the MID RTP\n   header extension.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
