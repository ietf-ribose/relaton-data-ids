abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The standardization of Real time communication between browsers
    is to\n   provide the infrastructure for audio, video, text communication using\n
    \  standard interface so that interoperable communication can be\n   established
    between any compatible browsers.  RTCWeb specific\n   Javascript API will be provided
    by browsers for developing real-time\n   web application.  It is possible to develop
    signaling protocol like\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) or Jingle or websocket
    extension or\n   custom-made signaling protocol in Javascript.  There are lots
    of\n   issues in Javascript based signaling protocol.  This document list\n   the
    need for standard signaling protocol between RTCWeb client\n   (browser) and RTCWeb
    server and possible signaling protocol for the\n   same.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
