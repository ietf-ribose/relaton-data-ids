abstract:
- content: "<p>In industrial field/backhaul networks, joint real-time scheduling method
    is important to make end-to-end flows meet their deadline. This document proposes
    four joint scheduling methods, and these methods have considered four scenarios:
    time-slotted industrial backhaul network, regarding industrial backhaul network
    as a black box system, ignoring delay of industrial backhaul and establishing
    latency model of industrial backhaul network.</p>"
