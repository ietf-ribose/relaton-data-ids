abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies an Open Provisioning Standard (OPS) thataddresses
    the needs of an Integrated Communications Network (ICN)for remote and automatic
    service turn-up and for the simplificationof monitoring and fault management across
    multiple network elementswithin the Loop Access environment and within the Customer
    PremisesEnvironment (CPE) environment. OPS extends the standard SimpleNetwork
    Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Information Base (MIB)by defining voice/data
    integration and flow-through provisioningcapabilities for the various devices
    within the ICN, such asIntegrated Access Devices (IADs).OPS enables Carriers or
    Service Providers to control theirIntegrated Access Services (IAS) from the network
    management systemin the Network Operation Center (NOC). Flow-through provisioningallows
    administrators to send provisioning commands to multiplenetwork elements across
    the ICN. The provisioning commands are usedto define or modify a customer's services
    and to turn those serviceson and off. Similarly, customer-initiated service requests
    as wellas performance and fault management information for existingservices can
    flow back to the carrier or service provider.</p>"
