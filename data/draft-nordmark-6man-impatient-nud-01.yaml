abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery includes Neighbor Unreachability Detection.
    That function is very useful when a host has an alternative, for instance multiple
    default routers, since it allows the host to switch to the alternative in short
    time. This time is 3 seconds after the node starts probing. However, if there
    are no alternatives, this is far too impatient. This document proposes an approach
    where an implementation can choose the timeout behavior to be different based
    on whether or not there are alternatives.</p>"
