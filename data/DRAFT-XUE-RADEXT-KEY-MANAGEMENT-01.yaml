abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is a general case in operators networks that Authenticator
    is\n   deployed on Service Gateway (SGW) to avoid overload on the Access\n   Controller
    (AC).  In this scenario, the encryption/decryption node\n   can't obtain Pairwise
    Master Key (PMK) information during Extensible\n   Authentication Protocol (EAP)
    procedure, it is not sufficent to\n   achieve traffic encryption/decryption requirement
    in Wireless Local\n   Area Network (WLAN) network.\n\n   This document analyzes
    the requirement and issue for key management\n   that has arisen so far during
    authentication process in WLAN network.\n   Meanwhile, the control messages for
    key management are defined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
