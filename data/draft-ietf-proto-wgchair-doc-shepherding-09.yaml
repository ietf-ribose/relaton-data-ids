abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes methodologies that have been designed to improve
    and facilitate IETF document flow processing. It specifies a set of procedures
    under which a working group chair or secretary serves as the primary Document
    Shepherd for a document that has been submitted to the IESG for publication. Before
    this, the Area Director responsible for the working group has traditionally filled
    the shepherding role. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
