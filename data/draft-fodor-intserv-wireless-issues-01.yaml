abstract:
- content: "<p>We consider a scenario wherein a QoS enabled application uses an Integrated
    Services based API (IntServ). Where the network interface is over a cellular wireless
    access network, we examine the feasibility of the radio management function to
    establish appropriate spectrum efficient bearers to support the requested service.</p>"
