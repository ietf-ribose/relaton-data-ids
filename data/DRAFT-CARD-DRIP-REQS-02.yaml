abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the requirements for Drone Remote\n   Identification
    Protocol (DRIP) Working Group protocols and services\n   to support Unmanned Aircraft
    System Remote Identification (UAS RID).\n\n   Objectives include: complementing
    external technical standards as\n   regulator-accepted means of compliance with
    UAS RID regulations;\n   facilitating use of existing Internet resources to support
    UAS RID\n   and to enable enhanced related services; and enabling verification\n
    \  that UAS RID information is trustworthy (to some extent, even in the\n   absence
    of Internet connectivity at the receiving node).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
