abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet is currently being confronted with service demands from
    a new generation of applications. Supporting these applications effectively and
    efficiently will require extending the current Internet 'best-effort' service
    model to one that offers an integrated suite of services. The purpose of this
    memo is to describe a proposed 'core' service model for an integrated services
    Internet. In the Appendix we discuss the process by which such a service model
    could be standardized by the IETF.</p>"
