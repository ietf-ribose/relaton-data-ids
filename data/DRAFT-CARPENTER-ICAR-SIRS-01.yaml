abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     IETF specifications do not receive formal review until\n
    \    they are submitted to the IESG. Hence, significant\n     problems with a
    specification often are not detected\n     until considerable effort has been
    wasted and changes\n     to fix the problems are difficult to add. The procedure\n
    \    described in this document is intended to solve, or\n     palliate, a number
    of related problems that have been\n     observed in the IETF process. The basic
    model is to\n     create a team of Senior IETF Reviewers (SIRS), and have\n     all
    documents receive a certain number of reviews by\n     SIRs, prior to being submitted
    for publication. Review\n     at a very early stage is strongly encouraged.\n\t
