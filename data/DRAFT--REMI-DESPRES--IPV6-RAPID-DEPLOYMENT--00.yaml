abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPv6 rapid deployment (6rd) builds upon mechanisms of 6to4 (RFC3056)\nto
    enable a service provider to rapidly deploy IPv6 unicast service\nto its existing
    IPv4 sites.  Like 6to4, it utilizes stateless IPv6 in\nIPv4 encapsulation in order
    to transit IPv4-only network\ninfrastructure.  Unlike 6to4, 6rd requires a service
    provider to use\none of its own IP prefixes rather than the fixed 6to4 prefix.
    \ A\nservice provider has used this mechanism for its own \"rapid\ndeployment\"
    of IPv6 (five weeks from first exposure to \"opt-in\"\ndeployment for 1,500,000
    residential sites).\n\t </p>\n      "
