abstract:
- content: "<p>A Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) router uses the Reverse Path
    Forwarding (RPF) procedure to select an upstream interface and router in order
    to build forwarding state. When there are equal cost multipaths (ECMPs), existing
    implementations often use hash algorithms to select a path. Such algorithms do
    not allow the spread of traffic among the ECMPs according to administrative metrics.
    This usually leads to inefficient or ineffective use of network resources. This
    document introduces the ECMP Redirect, a mechanism to improve the RPF procedure
    over ECMPs. It allows ECMP selection to be based on administratively selected
    metrics, such as data transmission delays, path preferences, and routing metrics.
