abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IASA2 effort changes the terminology associated with several\n
    \  roles and the relationships among existing bodies and functions to\n   the
    successors of others.  In some cases, the relevant earlier\n   documents address
    other matters, including ones that are critical to\n   IETF processes, and are
    better dealt with by updating the relevant\n   terminology or provisions rather
    than attempting to replace the\n   earlier documents in their entirety.  This
    document provides those\n   updates for RFCs 2418 and 5377 [[and perhaps others
    in later\n   versions]].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
