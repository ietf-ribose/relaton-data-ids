abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery includes Neighbor Unreachability Detection.
    That function is very useful when a host has an alternative, for instance multiple
    default routers, since it allows the host to switch to the alternative in short
    time. This time is 3 seconds after the node starts probing by default. However,
    if there are no alternatives, this is far too impatient. This document specifies
    relaxed rules for Neighbor Discovery retransmissions that allows an implementation
    to choose different timeout behavior based on whether or not there are alternatives.
    This document updates RFC 4861.</p>"
