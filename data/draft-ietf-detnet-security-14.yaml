abstract:
- content: <p>A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance guarantees
    to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency (including
    bounded latency variation, i.e. "jitter"). As a result, securing a DetNet requires
    that in addition to the best practice security measures taken for any mission-critical
    network, additional security measures may be needed to secure the intended operation
    of these novel service properties. This document addresses DetNet-specific security
    considerations from the perspectives of both the DetNet system-level designer
    and component designer. System considerations include a taxonomy of relevant threats
    and attacks, and associations of threats versus use cases and service properties.
    Component-level considerations include ingress filtering and packet arrival time
    violation detection. This document also addresses security considerations specific
    to the IP and MPLS data plane technologies, thereby complementing the Security
    Considerations sections of those documents.</p>
