abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC3986 Section 1.1.1 defines URI syntax as \"a federated and\n
    \  extensible naming system wherein each scheme's specification may\n   further
    restrict the syntax and semantics of identifiers using that\n   scheme.\"  In
    other words, the structure of a URI is defined by its\n   scheme.  While it is
    common for schemes to further delegate their\n   substructure to the URI's owner,
    publishing independent standards\n   that mandate particular forms of URI substructure
    is inappropriate,\n   because the essentially usurps ownership.  This document
    clarifies\n   both this problematic practice and some acceptable alternatives
    in\n   standards.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
