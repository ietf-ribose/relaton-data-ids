abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field
    or\n   green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport such as MPLS LDPv6, SR-\n
    \  MPLSv6 or SRv6, Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP)now plays an important role\n   in
    the transition of the core from IPv4 to IPv6 being able to\n   continue to support
    legacy IPv4, VPN-IPv4, and Multicast VPN IPv4\n   customers.\n\n   Multiprotocol
    BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of usable next-hop\n   address families is
    determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI)\n   and the Subsequent Address
    Family Identifier (SAFI).  Historically\n   the AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4
    address family only have\n   provisions for advertising a Next Hop address that
    belongs to the\n   IPv4 protocol when advertising IPv4 or VPN-IPv4 Network Layer\n
    \  Reachability Information (NLRI).  [RFC5549] specifies the extensions\n   necessary
    to allow advertising IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next\n   Hop address that
    belongs to the IPv6 protocol.  This comprises an\n   extension of the AFI/SAFI
    definitions to allow the address of the\n   Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4
    NLRI to also belong to the IPv6\n   Protocol.  [RFC5549] defines the encoding
    of the Next Hop to\n   determine which of the protocols the address actually belongs
    to, and\n   a new BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers to dynamically discover\n
    \  whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6\n   Next
    Hop.\n\n   With this new MP-BGP capability exchange allows the BGP peering\n   session
    to act as a pure transport to allow the session to carry\n   Address Family Identifier
    (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family\n   Identifier (SAFI) for both IPv4 and
    IPv6.\n\n   This document describes the critical use case and OPEX savings of\n
    \  being able to leverage the MP-BGP capability exchange usage as a pure\n   transport
    allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 to be carried over the same BGP\n   TCP session.  By
    doing so, allows for the elimination of Dual\n   Stacking on the PE-CE connections
    making the peering IPv6-ONLY to now\n   carry both IPv4 and IPv6 Network Layer
    Reachability Information\n   (NLRI).  This document also provides a possible solution
    for IXPs\n   (Internet Exchange points) that are facing IPv4 address depletion
    at\n   these peering points to use BGP-MP capability exchange defined in\n   [RFC5549]
    to carry IPv4 (Network Layer Reachability Information) NLRI\n   in an IPv6 next
    hop using the [RFC5565] softwire mesh framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
