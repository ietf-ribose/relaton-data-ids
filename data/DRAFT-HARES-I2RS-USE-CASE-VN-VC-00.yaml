abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Software Defined Networks (SDN) provide a way to virtualize
    and\n   abstract the network and present the virtual or abstract resources to\n
    \  the third-party applications running in software.  The application\n   can
    utilize a programmable interface to receiving these virtual or\n   abstract resources
    in a form that allows monitoring or manipulation\n   of resources.  Various programmatic
    interfaces have been proposed to\n   interface directly to the forwarding plane
    (OpenFlow, ForCES), or do\n   device configuration (NETCONF).  ALTO has proposed
    a informational\n   interface to the application.  Only the progammatic Interface
    to the\n   Routing System (IRS) provides an interface directly to the routing\n
    \  system to utilize all aspects of the routing system as a system.\n\n   The
    IRS system interacts with the control plane processes to monitor\n   best paths
    to any destination and to change the routing information\n   base (RIB) or MPLS
    label information Base (LIB) which feeds the\n   forwarding tables the information
    needed to actually switch traffic\n   at a local level.\n\n   This document outlines
    how SDN networks can use the IRS interface to\n   implement an automated set of
    network services for Virtual Connection\n   on Demand (VCoD) and Virtual Network
    on Demand (VNoD)\n\n\t </p>\n      "
