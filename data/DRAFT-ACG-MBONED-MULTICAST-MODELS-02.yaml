abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a high-level overview of more commonly
    used\n   multicast service models, principally the Any-Source Multicast (ASM)\n
    \  and Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) models, and discusses the\n   applicability
    of the models to certain scenarios.  As a result, this\n   document recommends
    that ASM is not used for interdomain scenarios,\n   and the use of SSM is strongly
    recommended for all multicast\n   scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
