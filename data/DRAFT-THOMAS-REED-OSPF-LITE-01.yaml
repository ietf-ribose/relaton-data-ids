abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo documents what needs to be removed and added to OSPF
    [RFC2328]\nto create a working implementation of the experimental protocol ospf-\nlite.
    ospf-lite runs over TCP and UDP ports 8899.\n\nospf-lite has been designed to
    provide a simpler version of the OSPF\nprotocol. A router running ospf-lite requires
    little configuration.\n\nMany of the Protocol complexities have been removed.
    Areas are not\nimplemented and Designated Router functionality has been removed
    from\nthe protocol. In almost every case with these removals the protocol is\nmade
    more scalable.\n\nospf-lite will run over non fully meshed NBMA clouds without
    explicit\nconfiguration.\n\nospf-lite contains support for External LSA's and
    opaque LSA's. The\nprotocol removes the support of LSA's type 2,3,4,7 and the
    DR function.\nPromiscuous hellos are introduced and a unified interface link type\nreplaces
    existing link types.\n\nThis work is intended to keep pace with the vast increases
    in processor\nperformance, memory size and link capacity since OSPF was originally\nconceived.\n\nWhere
    further details are required the authors refer the reader to [RFC\n2328].\n\nPlease
    send comments to mrthom@essex.ac.uk\n\t </p>\n      "
