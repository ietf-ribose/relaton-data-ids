abstract:
- content: "<p>Extensions are proposed to NFS version 4 which enable it to support
    long-lived sessions, endpoint management, and operation atop a variety of RPC
    transports, including TCP and RDMA. These extensions enable support for reliably
    implemented client response caching by NFSv4 servers, enhanced security, multipathing
    and trunking of transport connections. These extensions provide identical benefits
    over both TCP and RDMA connection types.</p>"
