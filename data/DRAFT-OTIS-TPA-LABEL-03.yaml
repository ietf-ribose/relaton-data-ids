abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This experimental specification proposes a Third-Party Authorization\n
    \  Label (TPA-Label) as a DNS-based method that allows Trusted Domains\n   an
    efficient means to authorize acceptable Third-Party Domains.  This\n   method
    permits autonomous unilateral authorizations and uses scalable\n   individual
    DNS transactions.\n\n   A TPA-Label Resource Record transaction asserts an alignment\n
    \  exception to convey informally Federated Domains.  It affords\n   recipients
    a practical and safe means to extend Domain Alignment.\n   Exceptions are managed
    by either the Trusted Domain, or their agent,\n   seeking to avoid disruption
    of informal services enjoyed by their\n   users.  Third-Party Authorization of
    a Federated Domain eliminates a\n   need to share private credentials.\n\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
