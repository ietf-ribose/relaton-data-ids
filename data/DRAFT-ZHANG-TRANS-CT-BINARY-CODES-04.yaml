abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a solution extending the Certificate\n
    \  Transparency protocol [I-D.ietf-trans-rfc6962-bis] for transparently\n   logging
    the software binary codes (BC)or its digest with their\n   signature, to enable
    anyone to monitor and audit the software\n   provider activity and notice the
    distribution of suspect software as\n   well as to audit the BC logs themselves.
    \ The solution is called\n   \"Binary Transparency\" in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n
