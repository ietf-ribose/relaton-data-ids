abstract:
  content: "<p>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality
    ofservice for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. Theoverall PCN
    architecture is described in ID.PCNArch. This memo isone of a series describing
    possible boundary node behaviours for aPCN domain. The behaviour described here
    is that for three-statemeasurement-based load control, known informally as CL.
    Therequirement for three encoding states means that CL is forexperimental use
    only pending further standards action.</p>"
