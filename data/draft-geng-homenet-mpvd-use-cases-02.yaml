abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use cases of multiple provisioning domain
    (MPVD) in homenet. Although most residential networks nowadays are connected to
    a single ISP and normally subscribed to standard internet service, it is expected
    that much wider range of devices and services will become common in home networks.
    Homenet defines such home network topologies with increasing number of devices
    with the assumption that it requires minimum configuration by residential user.
    As described in the homenet architecture ([RFC7368]), multihoming and multi-service
    residential network will be more common in the near future. Nodes in such network
    may commonly have multiple interfaces or subscribe to multiple services. Potential
    types of PVD-aware nodes concerning interface and service specific provisioning
    domains are introduced in this document. Based on this, different MPVD configuration
    examples are given. These examples illustrate how PVD may be implemented in home
    network. PVDs provide independent provisioning domains for different interfaces
    and services, which enables robust and flexible network configuration for these
    networks.</p>"
