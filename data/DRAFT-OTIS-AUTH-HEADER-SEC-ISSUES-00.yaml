abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The proposed [I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header] defines a header\nfield
    used to capture email verification results of border\nreceptions.  These results
    are then conveyed to Mail User Agents\n(MUA) and downstream filters.  This header
    field is to augment\nfiltering decisions and message annotations that can be made
    visible\nto recipients.  The annotations could affirm originating domains or\ncontent
    integrity when based upon Domainkeys or DKIM results, or a\ndomain's authorization
    of a publicly transmitting SMTP client IP\naddress when based upon Sender-ID or
    SPF results, or that the SMTP\nclient IP address maps to a matching domain within
    the DNS reverse\nnamespace.\n\nAlthough the draft acknowledges the conflation
    of authorization with\nauthentication in section 1.5.2, and explicitly declares
    Sender-ID\nand SPF as the authorization of the transmitting SMTP client, it\nstill
    fails to offer the authenticated entity being trusted in the\nexchange, the IP
    address of the SMTP client.  An authenticated entity\nis essential for reputation
    assessments which section 4.1 indicates\nshould be made prior to results being
    revealed.  A reputation check\nis often a necessary step to mitigate abuse and
    fraud.  Even so, the\nheader offers no assurance that any reputation check has
    been made,\nnor does it ensure that the trusted entity, the IP address of the\nSMTP
    client, can be determined by the MUA or downstream filter.\n\t </p>\n      "
