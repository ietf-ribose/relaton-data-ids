abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the use of the 3GPP Generic Bootstrapping Architecture
    (GBA) for authenticating and securing constrained devices. While GBA re-uses the
    3GPP credentials, it does not require mobile network access, such as LTE, but
    requires only IP connectivity. Though building devices that employ GBA is obviously
    well known, this document specifically focuses on techniques necessary to minimize
    memory and energy consumption which is essential for constrained device networks.</p>"
