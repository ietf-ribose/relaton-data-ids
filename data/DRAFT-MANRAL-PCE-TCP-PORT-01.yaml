abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    defined\n   in [RFC 5440] states that \"All PCEP messages MUST be sent using the\n
    \  registered TCP port for the source and destination TCP port.\"  This\n   has
    however lead to a lot of restrictions for the implementation.\n   With these considerations
    in mind this document updates the TCP\n   behavior.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
