abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes IPv6 DNS operational requirements and\ndeployment
    roadmap. It is the result of discussion from members of\nthe IPv6, NGtrans, DNSops
    and DNSext working groups. The DNS is\nlooked as a critical part of the Internet
    infrastructure and is used\nfor much more purposes than name to address resolution.
    \ Thus a\nsmooth operation of the DNS is critical in the IPv6 transition.\n\t
