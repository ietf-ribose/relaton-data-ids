abstract:
  content: "<p>It will take a long time and mass computation to do sessionresumption
    among IKE/IPsec gateways possibly maintaining huge numbersof IKEv2/IPsec SAs,
    when the serving gateway fails or over-loaded.The major reason is that the prcocedure
    of IKEv2 SA re-establishmentwill incur a time-consuming computation especially
    in the Diffie-Hellman exchange. In this draft, a new IKE security associationssynchronization
    solution is proposed to do fast IKE SA sessionresumption by directly transferring
    the indexed IKE SA (named stub)from old gateway to new gateway, wherein the most
    expensive Diffie-Hellman calculation can be avoided. Without some time-consumingIKEv2
    exchanges, the huge amount of IKE/IPsec SA session resumptionprocedures can be
    finished in a short time.</p>"
