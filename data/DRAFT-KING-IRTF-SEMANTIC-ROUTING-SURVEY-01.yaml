abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify
    an\n   interface on a network device.  Routing protocols were developed\n   based
    on the assumption that a destination address had this semantic.\n\n   Over time,
    routing decisions were enhanced to route packets according\n   to additional information
    carried within the packets and dependent on\n   policy coded in, configured at,
    or signaled to the routers.\n\n   Many proposals have been made to add semantics
    to IP addresses.  The\n   intent is usually to facilitate routing decisions based
    solely on the\n   address and without the need to find and process information
    carried\n   in other fields within the packets.\n\n   This document presents a
    brief survey of technologies related to IP\n   semantic addressing and routing
    proposals.  Inclusion of a proposal\n   or technique in this document does not
    imply any level of support.  A\n   partner document examines the challenges for
    routing in this context.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
