abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides enhancements for RFC 4103 real-time
    text\n   mixing suitable for a centralized conference model that enables\n   source
    identification and rapidly interleaved transmission of text\n   from different
    sources.  The intended use is for real-time text\n   mixers and participant endpoints
    capable of providing an efficient\n   presentation or other treatment of a multiparty
    real-time text\n   session.  The specified mechanism builds on the standard use
    of the\n   Contributing Source (CSRC) list in the Realtime Protocol (RTP) packet\n
    \  for source identification.  The method makes use of the same \"text/\n   t140\"
    and \"text/red\" formats as for two-party sessions.\n\n   Solutions using multiple
    RTP streams in the same RTP session are\n   briefly mentioned, as they could have
    some benefits over the RTP-\n   mixer model.  The possibility to implement the
    solution in a wide\n   range of existing RTP implementations made the RTP-mixer
    model be\n   selected to be fully specified in this document.\n\n   A capability
    exchange is specified so that it can be verified that a\n   mixer and a participant
    can handle the multiparty-coded real-time\n   text stream using the RTP-mixer
    method.  The capability is indicated\n   by use of an RFC 8866 Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) media\n   attribute \"rtt-mixer\".\n\n   The document updates RFC
    4103 \"RTP Payload for Text Conversation\".\n\n   A specification of how a mixer
    can format text for the case when the\n   endpoint is not multiparty-aware is
    also provided.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
