abstract:
  content: <p>Remote triggered black hole filtering describes a method of mitigating
    the effects of denial-of-service attacks by selectively discarding traffic based
    on source or destination address. Remote triggered black hole routing describes
    a method of selectively re- routing traffic into a sinkhole router (for further
    analysis) based on destination address. This document updates the "IPv6 Special
    Purpose Address Registry" by explaining why a unique IPv6 prefix should be formally
    assigned by IANA for the purpose of facilitating IPv6 remote triggered black hole
    filtering and routing. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>
