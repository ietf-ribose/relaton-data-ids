abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Currently, IPv6 Internet is, globally considered, inseparable fromthe
    6bone network. The 6bone has been built as a tighly meshedtunneled topology. As
    the number of participants has grown, it hasbecome an untangible mess, hindering
    the real deployment of IPv6 dueto low quality of connections. This memo discusses
    the nature andthe state of 6bone/IPv6 Internet, points out problems and outlines
    afew ways to start fixing them; also, some rough operationalguidelines for different-sized
    organizations are presented. The mostimportant issues are: not offering transit
    to everyone and realtransit operators being needed to take a more active role.</p>"
