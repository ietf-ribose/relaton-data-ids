abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document contains recommendations of maximum tolerable
    delays to\n   be added by methods which improve bandwidth utilization through\n
    \  compression, multiplexing, and tunneling over a network path.\n   Recommendations
    are presented only for real-time network services for\n   which such bandwidth
    optimization techniques are applicable (i.e.,\n   services with low payload size
    to header size ratio).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
