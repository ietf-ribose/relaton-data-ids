abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many protocols in the Internet Protocol suite use packet\nencapsulations.
    \ This runs into the danger of forming a tunnel loop.\nSince each tunnel entry
    point encapsulates the inner packet with a\ntunnel packet header that contains
    a new hop count, a packet entering\na tunnel loop may be routed infinitely, consuming
    network resources.\nAlthough there exist methods to cause a packet in a tunnel
    loop to be\ndiscarded eventually, it would be more desirable to detect the\npresence
    of a tunnel loop and act accordingly.  This draft explores\nthe possibility for
    tunnel entry points to detect the presence of a\ntunnel loop by using an extra
    identifier tagged to the outer packet\nheader.\n\t </p>\n      "
