abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SMTP STARTTLS option, used in negotiating transport-level\n
    \  encryption of SMTP connections, is not as useful from a security\n   standpoint
    as it might be because of its opportunistic nature;\n   message delivery is, by
    default, prioritized over security.  This\n   document describes an SMTP service
    extension, REQUIRETLS, and message\n   header field, RequireTLS.  If the REQUIRETLS
    option or RequireTLS\n   message header field is used when sending a message,
    it asserts a\n   request on the part of the message sender to override the default\n
    \  negotiation of TLS, either by requiring that TLS be negotiated when\n   the
    message is relayed, or by requesting that recipient-side policy\n   mechanisms
    such as MTA-STS and DANE be ignored when relaying a\n   message for which security
    is unimportant.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
