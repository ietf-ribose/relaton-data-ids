abstract:
- content: "<p>As network scale increases and network operation becomes more sophisticated,
    traditional Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) methods, which include
    proactive and reactive techniques, running in active and passive modes, are no
    longer sufficient to meet the monitoring and measurement requirements. On-path
    telemetry techniques which provide high-precision flow insight and real-time issue
    notification are emerging to support suitable quality of experience for users
    and applications, and fault or network deficiency identification before they become
    critical. Centering on the new data plane on-path telemetry techniques, this document
    outlines a high-level framework to provide an operational environment that utilizes
    these techniques to enable the collection and correlation of performance information
    from the network. The framework identifies the components that are needed to coordinate
    the existing protocol tools and telemetry mechanisms, and addresses key deployment
    challenges for flow-oriented on-path telemetry techniques, especially in carrier
    networks. The framework is informational and intended to guide system designers
    attempting to apply the referenced techniques as well as to motivate further work
    to enhance the ecosystem .</p>"
