abstract:
- content: '<p>The logs in Certificate Transparency are untrusted in the sense that
    the users of the system don''t have to trust that they behave correctly since
    the behavior of a log can be verified to be correct. This document tries to solve
    the problem with logs presenting a "split view" of their operations or failing
    to incorporate a submission within MMD. It describes three gossiping mechanisms
    for Certificate Transparency: SCT Feedback, STH Pollination and Trusted Auditor
    Relationship.</p>'
