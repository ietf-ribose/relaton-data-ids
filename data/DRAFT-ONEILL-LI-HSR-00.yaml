abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo overviews the need for intra-domain Host specific routing
    \n(HSR) in the Internet. Host Specific Routing provides a number of \nbenefits
    if route entry and look-up scalability issues can be \nadequately addressed. These
    benefits are the enabling of flat \nrouting domains that eliminate the need for
    hierarchy and associated \nconfiguration, and the potential to support rapid movement
    of IP \naddresses through the routing fabric. This draft describes some of \nthe
    current work in this area, including TORA and Wireless Internet \nProtocol (WIP),
    and the as yet unresolved research issues associated \nwith large-scale host routing.
    This draft requires and makes no \ntopological assumptions for HSR. Specifically
    it does not require a \nstrict tree, as implied by CIP and HAWAII. These micro-mobility
    \nprotocols do however share many of the scalability and inter-\nprotocol issues
    associated with host specific routes. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
