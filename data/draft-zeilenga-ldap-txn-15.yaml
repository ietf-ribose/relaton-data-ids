abstract:
- content: "<p>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) update operations, such
    as Add, Delete, and Modify operations, have atomic, consistency, isolation, durability
    (ACID) properties. Each of these update operations act upon an entry. It is often
    desirable to update two or more entries in a single unit of interaction, a transaction.
    Transactions are necessary to support a number of applications including resource
    provisioning. This document extends LDAP to support transactions. This document
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
