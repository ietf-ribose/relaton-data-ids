abstract:
  content: "\t <t>RSVP signaling may be used to enhance the manageability ofapplication
    traffic's QoS in a differentiated service (diff-serv)network [intdiff]. In this
    model, certain network elements within orat the edges of the diff-serv network
    may use RSVP messages toeffect admission control or to apply QoS policy. One mechanism
    bywhich network elements may apply QoS policy is by causing a DCLASSobject to
    be returned to a sending host in an RSVP RESV message. TheDCLASS object indicates
    the diff-serv DSCP that the sender shouldinclude when submitting packets on the
    admitted flow, to the diff-serv network. This draft describes the usage and format
    of theDCLASS object.</p>"
