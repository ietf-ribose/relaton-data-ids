abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The -phonebcp draft currently requires endpoints to disable sending
    a\nBYE on an emergency call.  Insufficient justification and lack of\nattention
    to the entire problem has caused comment on that section of\nthe document.  This
    document attempts to define the problem and the\nrequirements to controlling disconnect
    on emergency calls.\n\t </p>\n      "
