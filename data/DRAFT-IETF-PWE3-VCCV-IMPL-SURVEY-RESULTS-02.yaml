abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Most pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations
    mandate\n   the use of the Control Word (CW) to carry information essential to\n
    \  the emulation, to inhibit Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) behavior, and\n   to
    discriminate Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)\n   from Pseudowire
    (PW) packets.  However, some encapsulations treat the\n   Control Word as optional.
    \ As a result, implementations of the CW,\n   for encapsulations for which it
    is optional, vary by equipment\n   manufacturer, equipment model and service provider
    network.\n   Similarly, Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) supports\n
    \  three Control Channel (CC) types and multiple Connectivity\n   Verification
    (CV) Types.  This flexibility has led to reports of\n   interoperability issues
    within deployed networks and associated\n   drafts to attempt to remedy the situation.
    \ This survey of the PW/\n   VCCV user community was conducted to determine implementation
    trends.\n   The survey and results is presented herein.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
