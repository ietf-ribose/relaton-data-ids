abstract:
- content: "<p>Deeply embedded in some ICN architectures, especially Named Data Networking
    (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) is the notion of flow balance. This
    captures the idea that there is a one-to-one correspondence between requests for
    data, carried in Interest messages, and the responses with the requested data
    object, carried in Data messages. This has a number of highly beneficial properties
    for flow and congestion control in networks, as well as some desirable security
    properties. For example, neither legitimate users nor attackers are able to inject
    large amounts of un-requested data into the network. Existing congestion control
    approaches however have a difficult time dealing effectively with a widely varying
    MTU of ICN data messages, because the protocols allow a dynamic range of 1-64K
    bytes. Since Interest messages are used to allocate the reverse link bandwidth
    for returning Data, there is large uncertainty in how to allocate that bandwidth.
    Unfortunately, most current congestion control schemes in CCNx and NDN only count
    Interest messages and have no idea how much data is involved that could congest
    the inverse link. This document proposes a method to maintain flow balance by
    accommodating the wide dynamic range in Data message size.</p>"
