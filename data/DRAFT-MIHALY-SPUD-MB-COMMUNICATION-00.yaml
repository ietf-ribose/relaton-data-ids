abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this draft we address some of the key discussion points
    related\n   to the scope of Substrate Protocol for User Datagrams (SPUD).\n   Specifically,
    we show how we can define the middlebox communication\n   framework such that
    it allows uneven resource sharing on the path\n   among the endpoints enhancing
    in this way the user experience.\n   Issues related to trust and incentives as
    well as how to support\n   user decisions in this eco-system are clarified.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
