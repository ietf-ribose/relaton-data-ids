abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a multicast solution for SR-MPLS. It
    is\n   consistent with the Segment Routing architecture in that an IGP is\n   augmented
    to distribute information in addition to the link state. In\n   this solution
    it is multicast group membership information sufficient\n   to synchronize state
    in a given network domain. Computation is\n   employed to determine the topology
    of any loosely specified multicast\n   distribution tree.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
