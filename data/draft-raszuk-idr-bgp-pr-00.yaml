abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP protocol today contains number of build in mechanisms which record
    critical for its loop free operation data along the path of BGP message propagation.
    Those are encoded in AS_PATH, CLUSTER_LIST or ORIGINATOR_ID attributes. However
    in the same time there is no provisioning to record other useful information along
    the path which can be helpful to the operator in order to enhance end to end visibility
    of BGP control plane. In order to solve this problem this document proposes a
    new single BGP attribute designed as an generic and extensible container to carry
    number of new optional information corresponding to the BGP speakers given BGP
    advertisement (or withdraw) message traverses.</p>"
