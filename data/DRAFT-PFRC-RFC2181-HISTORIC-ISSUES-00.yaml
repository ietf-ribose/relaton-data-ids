abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 2181 is an amalgamation of eight independent components
    that were\n   lumped together into a single document, ostensibly because none
    were of\n   enough interest to create a standalone reference for each idea.  After\n
    \  nearly two decades, and a number of RFCs that update portions of RFC 2181,\n
    \  it seems reasonable to move RFC 2181 to historic status and focus on each\n
    \  idea independentally.  This document introduces eight standalone docuements,\n
    \  one for each of the ideas collected in RFC 2181 and allows for examination\n
    \  of each idea independently.   In doing so, this document moves RFC 2181\n   to
    historic status.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
