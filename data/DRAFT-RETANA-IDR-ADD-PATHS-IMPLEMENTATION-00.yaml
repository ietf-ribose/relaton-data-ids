abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document reports the results of an ADD-PATH implementation\n
    \  survey.  The survey had 22 questions about implementations' support\n   for
    advertising multiple paths in BGP.  After a brief summary of the\n   results,
    each response is listed.  This document contains responses\n   from three implementers
    who completed the survey (Cumulus Networks,\n   Cisco Systems and Exa Networks).\n\n
    \  The editor did not use external means to verify the accuracy of the\n   information
    submitted by the respondents.  The respondents are\n   considered experts on the
    products they reported on.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
