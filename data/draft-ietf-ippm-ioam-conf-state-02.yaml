abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the echo request/reply mechanisms
    used in IPv6 (including SRv6), MPLS (including SR-MPLS), SFC and BIER environments,
    which can be used within the IOAM domain, allowing the IOAM encapsulating node
    to discover the enabled IOAM capabilities of each IOAM transit and IOAM decapsulating
    node.</p>"
