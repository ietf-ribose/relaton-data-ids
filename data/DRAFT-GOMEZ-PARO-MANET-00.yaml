abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Due to fact that mobile ad hoc nodes have a critical need to preserve\nbattery
    power, MANET routing protocols need to consider power saving\ntechniques during
    operations. In this Internet-Draft we discuss PARO,\na Power-Aware Routing Optimization
    protocol that minimizes the\ntransmission power necessary to forward packets between
    wireless\ndevices. Using PARO, intermediate nodes can forward packets between\nsource-destination
    pairs thus reducing the aggregate transmission\npower consumed by wireless devices.
    An important property of PARO is\nthat it outperforms traditional broadcast-based
    routing protocols due\nto its power efficient point-to-point on-demand nature.
    The protocol\nis designed to operate as a stand-alone multihop routing protocol
    for\nlocal-area wireless networks (e.g., single-hop home networks, single-\nhop
    sensor networks, WLANs, etc.) and as a power-aware enhancement\nfor routing in
    wide-area MANETs.\n\t </p>\n      "
