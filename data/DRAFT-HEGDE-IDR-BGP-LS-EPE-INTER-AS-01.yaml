abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain network deployments, a single operator has multiple\n
    \  Autonomous Systems(AS) to facilitate ease of management.  A multiple\n   AS
    network design could also be a result of network mergers and\n   acquisitions.
    \ In such scenarios, a centralized Inter-domain TE\n   approach could provide
    most optimal allocation of resources and the\n   most controlled path placement.
    \ BGP-LS-EPE\n   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe] describes an extension
    to\n   BGP Link State (BGP-LS) for the advertisement of BGP Peering Segments\n
    \  along with their BGP peering node and inter-AS link information, so\n   that
    efficient BGP Egress Peer Engineering (EPE) policies and\n   strategies can be
    computed based on Segment Routing.  This document\n   describes extensions to
    the BGP-LS EPE to enable it to be used for\n   inter-AS Traffic-Engineering (TE)
    purposes.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
