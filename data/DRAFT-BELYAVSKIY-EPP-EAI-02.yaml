abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document permits usage of Internationalized Email Addresses
    in\n   the EPP protocol.  The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), being\n
    \  developed before appearing the standards for Internationalized Email\n   Addresses
    (EAI), does not support such email addressed.  This\n   document describes an
    EPP extension that allows EAI addresses to be\n   used with an EPP object mapping
    like the EPP contact mapping.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED on turning to RFC: The document
    is edited in the\n   dedicated github repo (https://github.com/beldmit/eppeai).
    \ Please\n   send your submissions via GitHub.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
