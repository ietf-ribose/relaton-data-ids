abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This problem statement examines how existing protocols that
    separate\n   identifiers from their location may benefit from the concept of\n
    \  identity.  The proposal laid out herein advocates for a standardized\n   identity/identifier
    network infrastructure that provides a framework\n   to support identity services
    in addition to enhancing existing\n   identifier/location mapping and resolution
    services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
