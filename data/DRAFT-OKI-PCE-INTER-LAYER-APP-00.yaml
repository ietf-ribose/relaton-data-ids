abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A network may comprise of multiple layers. It is important to
    \nglobally optimize network resources utilization, taking into \naccount all layers,
    rather than optimizing resource utilization at \neach layer independently. This
    allows better network efficiency to \nbe achieved through a process that we call
    inter-layer traffic \nengineering. The Path Computation Element (PCE) can be a
    powerful \ntool to achieve inter-layer traffic engineering. \n      \nThis document
    describes the applicability of the PCE-based path \ncomputation architecture to
    inter-layer MPLS and GMPLS traffic \nengineering. It provides suggestions for
    the deployment of PCE in \nsupport of multi-layer networks. This document also
    describes \nnetwork models where PCE performs inter-layer traffic engineering,
    \nand the relationship between PCE and a functional component called \nthe Virtual
    Network Topology Manager (VNTM). \n\t </p>\n      "
