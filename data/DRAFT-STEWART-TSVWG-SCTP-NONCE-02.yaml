abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the addition of the ECN-nonce RFC 3540\n[RFC3540]
    to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) RFC 2960\n[RFC2960].  The ECN-nonce
    reduces the vulnerability of ECN senders to\nmisbehaving receivers that conceal
    congestion signals like ECN marks\nand packet losses.  The ECN-nonce approach
    is different in SCTP\nbecause SCTP uses chunks for extensible protocol features
    and is\nselective acknowlegement (SACK)-based; this document describes those\ndifferences.
    \ In particular this document describes (1) protocol\nextensions in the form of
    a single new parameter for the INIT/\nINIT-ACK chunks, and a single bit flag in
    the SACK chunk, and (2)\nrules governing the sender and receiver side implementation.\n\nThis
    document outlines a minimum response that an SCTP sender should\napply after detecting
    a misbehaving receiver.\n\t </p>\n      "
