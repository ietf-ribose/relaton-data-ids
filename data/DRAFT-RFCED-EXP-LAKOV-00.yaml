abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides a proposal for a new Internet protocol,\nwhich
    should improve the relevance of results of search requests\nfor information in
    the WWW.  It contains a description of the\nbasic model and the minimum set of
    commands necessary to run\nproperly.  It is neither meant to nor should be regarded
    as a\ndefinitive version, but rather as a suggestion to a new way of\nlooking
    at the relations between the search engines on one hand\nand hosts running WEB
    servers on the other.\n\t </p>\n      "
