abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo describes a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payloadformat
    for the MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) commandlanguage. The format
    encodes all commands that may legally appear ona MIDI 1.0 DIN cable. The format
    is suitable for interactiveapplications (such as network musical performance)
    and content-delivery applications (such as file streaming). The format may beused
    over unicast and multicast UDP and TCP, and it defines tools forgraceful recovery
    from packet loss. Stream behavior, including theMIDI rendering method, may be
    customized during session setup. Theformat also serves as a mode for the mpeg4-generic
    format, to supportthe MPEG 4 Audio Object Types for General MIDI, Downloadable
    SoundsLevel 2, and Structured Audio.</p>"
