abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document specifies a new BGP NLRI and SAFI for advertising
    WAN\n   ports properties of a SDWAN edge node. SDWAN edge node's WAN ports\n   may
    face untrusted networks, such as the public internet, may get\n   assigned IP
    addresses from the Internet Service Providers (ISPs),\n   may get assigned dynamic
    IP addresses via DHCP, or may have private\n   addresses (e.g. inside third party
    Cloud DCs). Packets forwarded\n   through those SDWAN WAN ports might need to
    be encrypted (depending\n   on the user policies) or need to go through NAT. SDWAN
    edge nodes\n   need to propagate those WAN ports properties to the peers who are\n
    \  authorized to communicate across different types of underlay\n   networks including
    the untrusted networks.\n\n   BGP Route Reflectors (RR) are proposed as the entities
    to propagate\n   the WAN ports properties of SDWAN edge nodes to a controlled
    group\n   of edges reachable via overlay networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
