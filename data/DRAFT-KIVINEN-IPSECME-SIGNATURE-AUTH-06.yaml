abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has limited\n
    \  support for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).\n   The
    current version only includes support for three Elliptic Curve\n   groups, and
    there is a fixed hash algorithm tied to each group.  This\n   document generalizes
    IKEv2 signature support to allow any signature\n   method supported by the PKIX
    and also adds signature hash algorithm\n   negotiation.  This is a generic mechanism,
    and is not limited to\n   ECDSA, but can also be used with other signature algorithms.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
