abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for a root node to discover
    the\n   leaf nodes of an mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP.  Such kind of function\n   could
    be used for multiplexing/aggregating root initiated and leaf\n   initiated application
    which will use mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP.\n   Examples of root initiated applications
    are P2MP PW\n   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw], VPLS multicast [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast],\n
    \  L3VPN multicast [RFC6513].  And examples of leaf initiated\n   applications
    are statically configured mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP,\n   mLDP in-band signaling
    [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
