abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces extensions to Fast-handover Mobile
    IPv6 [6]\n   that improves handover latency in Mobile IPv6 procedures in case\n
    \  mobile nodes have multiple wireless interfaces. In the basic Fast\n   MIPv6
    [6], the PAR (previous access router) forwards the arriving\n   packets for the
    mobile node to the NAR (new access router) by setting\n   up a tunnel to the NAR
    in order to prevent packet losses incurred by\n   handover latency during handover
    procedure. Recently, many mobile\n   nodes begin to have multiple wireless interfaces,
    and multiple active\n   IPv6 Care-of-Addresses are assigned and registered simultaneously
    to\n   a Home Agent [2] in order to utilize multiple wireless interfaces in\n
    \  terms of bandwidth, delay, etc. Furthermore, the Mobile IPv6 with\n   extension
    to multiple CoA registration also needs fast handover\n   procedure to reduce
    handover latency and packet losses. However, in\n   the Mobile IPv6 with multiple
    CoA registration, packet tunneling to a\n   NAR during handoff of one interface
    can incur performance degradation\n   due to severe packet reordering when multiple
    interfaces are\n   simultaneously used for load sharing. This is because the partial\n
    \  traffic flow coming from the interface involved in handover is\n   suspended
    during handover and later tunneled to a NAR, while the\n   other partial traffic
    flow is continuously forwarded to the mobile\n   node through the other stable
    interface, which could incur severe\n   reordering if the handover is delayed
    or unstable by ping-pong\n   effects. We thus propose in this document an extension
    to Fast\n   handover Mobile IPv6 procedure which can indicate a specific\n   tunneling
    destination except the NAR, for example, other interfaces\n   (or CoAs) in the
    same mobile node. This extension not only enhances\n   the traffic quality during
    handoff but also improves the handover\n   signaling performance because data
    traffic is redirected to another\n   interface during handover signaling.\n\n\t
