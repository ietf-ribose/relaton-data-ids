abstract:
- content: "<p>[EVPN-AR] specifies an optimized ingress replication solution for more
    efficient multicast and broadcast delivery in a Network Virtualization Overlay
    (NVO) network for EVPN. This document extends the optimized ingress replication
    procedures specified in [EVPN-AR] to overcome the limitation that an AR- REPLICATOR
    may have. An AR-REPLICATOR may be unable to retain the source IP address or include
    the expected ESI label that is required for EVPN split horizon filtering when
    replicating the packet on behalf of its multihomed AR-LEAF. Under this circumstance,
    the extended procedures specified in this document allows the support of EVPN
    multihoming on the AR-LEAFs as well as optimized ingress replication for the rest
    of the EVPN overlay network.</p>"
