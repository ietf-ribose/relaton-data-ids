abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Authenticated Encryption with Replay prOtection
    (AERO), a cryptographic technique that provides all of the essential security
    services needed for communication security. AERO offers several advantages over
    other methods: it has more compact messages, provides stronger misuse resistance,
    avoids the need to manage implicit state, and is simpler to use. This document
    defines a particular AERO algorithm as well as a registry for such algorithms.</p>"
