abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses translators to enable direct communication between
    IPv4 hosts and IPv6 hosts. Three translation mechanisms are described. From the
    address mapping point of view, the translators are categorized into four types
    and each feasibility is considered. This memo is based on a paper appeared in
    Proceedings of INET98[INET].</p>"
