abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet Draft describes a framework, consistent with the
    model defined\nin the PINT group in the IETF, for controlling voice and voice-band
    data\n(e.g., FAX) calls on the PSTN from an IP Client. As such, it is solely\nconcerned
    with call control and associated functions. It is not concerned\nwith how to convert
    packetized voice into a form suitable for carriage over\nthe PSTN.\n \nWe introduce
    a logical entity (called CallBroker) that initiates and manages\ncalls on the
    PSTN and controls the session on behalf of an IP Client to\nestablish a telephone
    connection between two or more end points specified by\nthe customer (i.e., IP
    Client). By way of this session, as mediated by the\nCall Broker, the customer
    can set up calls and receive notifications\nregarding the status of the calls
    and its participants.\n \nThe interface between the CallBroker and the Service
    Control Function (as\ndefined in the work on Intelligent Network Standards in
    ITU-T) in the\nService Node (SN) in the PSTN will be defined and standardized
    as part of\nthis activity. The interface between the IP client and the CallBroker
    also\nnees to be defined and standardized as part of this activity.\n \nThis Internet
    Draft further advances the discussion on the issues involved in interconnecting
    the Internet and the Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs), focusing on potential
    interfaces between Internet-based entities\nand Intelligent Network (I.N.) entities.
    The services identified and\ndiscussed earlier (e.g., Click-to-Dial, Click-to-FAX,
    etc.) can be provided using the architecture identified here.\n\t </p>\n      "
