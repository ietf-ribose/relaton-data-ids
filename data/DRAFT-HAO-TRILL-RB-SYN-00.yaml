abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In TRILL multi-homing scenario, the concept of virtual RBridge
    in\n   [TRILLPN], was introduced to address the MAC flip-flopping problem\n   at
    remote RBridges. Based on virtual RBridge mechanism, Coordinated\n   Multicast
    Trees (CMT) solution in [CMT] was introduced to solve the\n   related RPF issues.
    In this document, additional problems are\n   described regarding virtual Bridges
    members' state synchronization\n   in multi-homing scenario, including virtual
    RBridge membership auto\n   discovery, pseudo-nickname static configuration consistency
    check,\n   dynamic pseudo-nickname allocation, CMT configuration\n   synchronization
    ,LACP configuration and state synchronization, and\n   node/link failure detection.
    To address these problems, a\n   communication protocol among members of a virtual
    RBridge group\n   should be provided. Requirements for this protocol is also discussed.\n\n\t
