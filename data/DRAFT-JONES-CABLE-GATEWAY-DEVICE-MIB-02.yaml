abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB)\nfor use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\nIn
    particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-\nbased management
    of CableHome compliant WAN Gateway Devices and home\nrouters.\nThis memo specifies
    a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the\nSNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The
    set of objects is consistent with the SNMP\nframework and existing SNMP standards.\nThis
    memo is a product of the IPCDN working group within the Internet\nEngineering
    Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should be\naddressed to the working group's
    mailing list at ipcdn@ietf.org\nand/or the editor.\n\t </p>\n      "
