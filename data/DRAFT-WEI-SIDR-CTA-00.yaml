abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes an enhanced certificate profile for trust\nanchors,
    in which the issuer field of the TA certificate is\ncryptographically generated.
    \ In the RPKI architecture, the trust\nanchor uses self-signed certificate.  However,
    this sort of\ncertificate is vulnerable to various attacks.  For example, the\nattackers
    can easily create its own public-private key pair and\ndeclaims that the issuer
    field belongs to him.  This means attackers\ncan easily impersonate the trust
    anchor.  To address it, this\ndocument adds identity based cryptographic technique
    to the self-\nsigned certificate.  Since the issuer field of the trust anchor's\ncertificate
    is cryptographically generated from the trust anchor's\npublic key, the attacker
    will not be able to create another key pair\nand declaim that the issuer field
    generated by the trust anchor\nbelongs to him.  Therefore, attackers can not impersonate
    the trust\nanchor.\n\t </p>\n      "
