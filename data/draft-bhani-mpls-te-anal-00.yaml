abstract:
  content: "<p>We compare the service received by TCP and UDP flows when they shareeither
    a link or an MPLS traffic trunk. Since traffic trunks allow nonshortest path links
    also to be used, the total network throughput goesup with proper traffic engineering.
    If UDP and TCP flows are mixed in atrunk, TCP flows receive reduced service as
    the UDP flows increase theirrates. Also, we found that in order to benefit from
    trafficengineering, MPLS trunks should be implemented end-to-end (first routerto
    last router). If some part of the network is MPLS-unaware, thebenefits are reduced
    or eliminated.</p>"
