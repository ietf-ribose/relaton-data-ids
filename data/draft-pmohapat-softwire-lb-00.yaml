abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Payloads carried over a Softwire mesh service as defined by BGPEncapsulation
    Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) informationexchange often carry a
    number of identifiable, distinct flows. Itcan in some circumstances be desirable
    to distribute these flows overthe equal cost multiple paths (ECMPs) that exist
    in the packetswitched network. Currently, the payload of a packet entering theSoftwire
    can only be interpreted by the ingress and egress routers.Thus the load balancing
    decision of a core router is only based onthe encapsulating header, presenting
    much less entropy than availablein the payload or the encapsulated header since
    the Softwireencapsulation acts in a tunneling fashion. This document describes
    amethod for achieving comparable load balancing efficiency in anetwork carrying
    Softwire mesh service over Layer Two TunnelingProtocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3) over
    IP or Generic RoutingEncapsulation (GRE) encapsulation to what would be achieved
    withoutsuch encapsulation.</p>"
