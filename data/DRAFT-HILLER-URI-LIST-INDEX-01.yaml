abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft extends the schema of the resource list specified
    in \n   draft-ietf-simple-xcap-list-usage-01 by defining an index attribute \n
    \  (membercode).  It also defines two MIME types that  refer to subsets \n   of
    a resource list. These MIME types can be used to identify subsets \n   of a resource
    list for use with SIP requests.\n\t </p>\n      "
