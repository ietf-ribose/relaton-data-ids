abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)
    defines a\n   specification to encapsulate a station's data frames between the\n
    \  Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and Access Controller (AC).\n   Specifically,
    the station's IEEE 802.11 data frames can be either\n   locally bridged or tunneled
    to the AC.  When tunneled, a CAPWAP data\n   channel is used for tunneling.  In
    many deployments encapsulating\n   data frames to an entity other than the AC
    (for example to an Access\n   Router (AR)) is desirable.  Furthermore, it may
    also be desirable to\n   use different tunnel encapsulation modes between the
    WTP and the\n   Access Router.  This document defines extension to CAPWAP protocol\n
    \  for supporting this capability and refers to it as alternate tunnel\n   encapsulation.
    \ The alternate tunnel encapsulation allows 1) the WTP\n   to tunnel non-management
    data frames to an endpoint different from\n   the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel
    using one of many known encapsulation\n   types such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, CAPWAP.
    \ The WTP may advertise support\n   for alternate tunnel encapsulation during
    the discovery and join\n   process and AC may select one of the supported alternate
    tunnel\n   encapsulation types while configuring the WTP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
