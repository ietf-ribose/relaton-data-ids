abstract:
- content: "<p>Coding is a reliability mechanism that is distinct and separated from
    the loss detection of congestion controls. Using coding can be a useful way to
    better deal with tail losses or with networks with non- congestion losses. However,
    coding mechanisms should not hide congestion signals. This memo offers a discussion
    of how coding and congestion control can coexist. This document can help the comparison
    of FEC schemes by identifying at which level they are operating with respect to
    the transport congestion control. This document is the product of the Coding for
    Efficient Network Communications Research Group (NWCRG). The scope of the document
    is end-to-end communications: coding for tunnels is out-of-the scope of the document.</p>"
