abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of
    objects\n   to the Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in\n
    \  different domains, the current trend is to develop a common, \"thin\n   waist\"
    of protocols to enable a horizontally unified IoT\n   architecture.  The objective
    of such an architecture is to make\n   resource objects securely accessible to
    applications across\n   organizations and domains.  Towards this goal, quite a
    few proposals\n   have been made to build an application-layer based unified IoT\n
    \  platform on top of today's host-centric Internet.  However, there is\n   a
    fundamental mismatch between the host-centric nature of today's\n   Internet and
    the mostly information-centric nature of the IoT domain.\n   To address this mismatch,
    the common set of protocols and network\n   services offered by an information-centric
    networking (ICN)\n   architecture can be leveraged to realize an ICN-based IoT
    (or ICN-\n   IoT) architecture that can take advantage of the salient features
    of\n   ICN such as naming, security, mobility, compute and efficient content\n
    \  and service delivery support offered by it.\n\n   In this draft, we summarize
    the general IoT demands, and ICN features\n   that support these requirements,
    and then discuss the challenges to\n   realize an ICN-based IoT framework.  Beyond
    this, the goal of this\n   draft is not to offer any specific ICN-IoT architectural
    proposal.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
