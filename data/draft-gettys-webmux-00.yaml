abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines the experimental multiplexing protocol referred
    to as'WebMUX'. WebMUX is a session management protocol separating the underlyingtransport
    from the upper level application protocols. It provides a lightweightcommunication
    channel to the application layer by multiplexing data streams ontop of a reliable
    stream oriented transport. By supporting coexistence ofmultiple application level
    protocols (e.g. HTTP and HTTP/NG), WebMUX should easetransitions to future Web
    protocols, and communications of client applets usingprivate protocols with servers
    over the same TCP connection as the HTTPconversation. WebMUX is intended for,
    but by no means restricted to, transport of Web relatedprotocols; the name has
    been chosen to reduce confusion with other existingmultiplexing protocols. This
    document is part of a suite of documents describing the HTTP-NG design andprototype
    implementation: * HTTP-NG Short- and Longterm Goals, ID * HTTP-NG Architectural
    Model, ID * HTTP-NG Wire Protocol, ID * The Classic Web Interfaces in HTTP-NG,
    ID * Description of the HTTP-NG Testbed, ID</p>"
