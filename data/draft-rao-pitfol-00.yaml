abstract:
- content: "<p>Software applications typically generate a large amount of log data
    in the course of their operation in order to help with monitoring, troubleshooting,
    etc. However, like all data generated and operated upon by software systems, logs
    can contain information sensitive to users. Personal data identification and anonymization
    in logs is thus crucial to ensure that no personal data is being inadvertently
    logged and retained which would make the logging application run afoul of laws
    around storing private information. This document focuses on exploring mechanisms
    to specify personal or sensitive data in logs, to enable any server collecting,
    processing or analyzing logs to identify personal data and thereafter, potentially
    enforce any redaction.</p>"
