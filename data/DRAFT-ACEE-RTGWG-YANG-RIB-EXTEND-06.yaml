abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Routing Information Base (RIB) is a list of routes and
    their\n   corresponding administrative data and operational state.\n\n   The document
    [ROUTING-CFG] defines the basic building blocks for RIB,\n   and this model augments
    it to support multiple next-hops (aka, paths)\n   for each route as well as additional
    attributes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
