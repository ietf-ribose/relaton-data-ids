abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, a mechanism to grasp the network situation is proposed
    for improving end-to-end path throughput. The proposed mechanism is based on the
    active packet-train probing based estimation. The proposed mechanism defines three
    cases of the difference between the average output gap and the input gap, and
    then reflects fully them. Since three cases are handled respectively by appropriate
    corresponding manners, the proposed mechanism can be expected to reduce the detection
    error for the turning point. Therefore, through the proposed mechanism, the available
    bandwidth can be estimated more reliably.</p>"
