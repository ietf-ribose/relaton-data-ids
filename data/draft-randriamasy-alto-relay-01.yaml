abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IETF is designing a new service called ALTO (Application Layertraffic
    Optimization) that includes a \"Network Map Service\" and an\"Endpoint Ranking
    Service\" and thus incentives for applicationclients to connect to ISP preferred
    Endpoints. These servicesprovide a view of the Network Provider (NP) topology
    to overlayclients. However, NPs remain reluctant to implement the ALTOprotocol
    for security reasons. In particular, they do not want theirtopology to be easily
    unveiled to third parties and thus morevulnerable to misuse.This document proposes
    a scheme to preserve Network Providerconfidentiality while allowing the use of
    ALTO information forapplications. It introduces an \"ALTO Relay\" that gets the
    providerconfidential ALTO response and hands it to a functional entity calleda
    Connection Relay. Meanwhile the ALTO Client gets a status anddirections to connect
    to Connection Relay, that then will hand thedesired application data. The benefit
    for Application Clientsaccepting ALTO transactions involving ALTO Relays is a
    better qualityof experience.</p>"
