abstract:
- content: <p>IETF is designing a new service called ALTO (Application Layer traffic
    Optimization) that includes a "Network Map Service" and an "Endpoint Ranking Service"
    and thus incentives for application clients to connect to ISP preferred Endpoints.
    These services provide a view of the Network Provider (NP) topology to overlay
    clients. However, NPs remain reluctant to implement the ALTO protocol for security
    reasons. In particular, they do not want their topology to be easily unveiled
    to third parties and thus more vulnerable to misuse. This document proposes a
    scheme to preserve Network Provider confidentiality while allowing the use of
    ALTO information for applications. It introduces an "ALTO Relay" that gets the
    provider confidential ALTO response and hands it to a functional entity called
    a Connection Relay. Meanwhile the ALTO Client gets a status and directions to
    connect to Connection Relay, that then will hand the desired application data.
    The benefit for Application Clients accepting ALTO transactions involving ALTO
    Relays is a better quality of experience.</p>
