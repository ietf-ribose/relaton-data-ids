abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes additions to the Domain-based Message\n
    \  Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) Tag Registry to\n   enable
    Mail administrators to specify the domain-wide policies for S/\n   MIME and PGP
    key usage in their mail domains, in conjunction with use\n   of the DANE SMIMEA
    and OPENPGPKEY resource records.  This would mean\n   adding to the authentication
    mechanisms specified in RFC 7489, but it\n   would specify only the domain-wide
    policies for S/MIME and PGP, such\n   as what the policies are for signing and
    encrypting (does the sender\n   mandate it, not allow it, etc.).  This document
    also suggests the\n   specification of the type of encoding of the left-hand sides
    used in\n   the DANE resource records.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
