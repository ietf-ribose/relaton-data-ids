abstract:
- content: "<p>Computing in the network may require the embedded computing capability
    in the network device, such as gateway, switch, etc, and there might be so much
    distributed computing task in the network. Some new applications like AR/VR, motion
    control put forward higher demand of network than before, and AI is also considered
    to be used in the app and network. In order to satisfy the demands, it needs to
    guarantee both the bandwidth resource and the computing resource which is linked
    by the network.</p>"
