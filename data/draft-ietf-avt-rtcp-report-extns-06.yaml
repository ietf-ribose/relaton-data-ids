abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for the
    RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR packets can be signaled
    by an application if it employs the Session Description Protocol (SDP). XR packets
    are composed of report blocks, and seven block types are defined here. The purpose
    of the extended reporting format is to convey information that supplements the
    six statistics that are contained in the report blocks used by RTCP's Sender Report
    (SR) and Receiver Report (RR) packets. Some applications, such as multicast inference
    of network characteristics (MINC) or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring, require
    other and more detailed statistics. In addition to the block types defined here,
    additional block types may be defined in the future by adhering to the framework
    that this document provides.</p>"
