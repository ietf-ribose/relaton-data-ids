abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document considers administrative processes for ENUM and
    \noffers a general administrative model for an environment where \nnumber portability
    has been implemented.  The ENUM administrative \nprocess is a critical piece in
    making ENUM operational.  The \nadministrative process involves several entities.
    \ A telephony \nuser's identity and his/her assignment of a telephone number must
    \nbe validated before ENUM service can be granted.  Therefore, the \nentity that
    assigns telephone numbers (often but not always \ntelephony user's telephony service
    provider) plays an important \nand sometimes necessary role in making the ENUM
    administrative \nprocess successful.\n\t </p>\n      "
