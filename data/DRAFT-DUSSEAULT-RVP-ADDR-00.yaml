abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A core part of a presence and instant messaging protocol, such
    as\n         RVP [7], must be the ability to find users online. This draft\n         defines
    several aspects of finding a user online:\n \n         - Schema of RVP URL\n         -
    How to find a user\\022s RVP address (URL)\n         - How to find a RVP server\n
    \n         The problem may be generalized to finding a non-user object online.\n
    \        In this draft, the client is the process which is searching for a\n         RVP
    object.  This can be a RVP server acting as a client or on\n         behalf of
    a user.  The server is the process which is responsible\n         for answering
    queries and receiving messages for a RVP object.  A\n         RVP client may sometimes
    act as its own server.\n\t </p>\n      "
