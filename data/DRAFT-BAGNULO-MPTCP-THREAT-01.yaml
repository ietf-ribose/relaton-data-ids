abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multi-addresses/Multi-path TCP (MPTCP for short) describes the\nextensions
    proposed for TCP so that each endpoint of a given TCP\nconnection can use multiple
    IP addresses to exchange data (instead of\na single IP address per endpoint as
    currently defined).  Such\nextensions enable the exchange of segments using different
    source-\ndestination address pairs, resulting in the capability of using\nmultiple
    paths in a significant number of scenarios.  In particular,\nsome level of multihoming
    and mobility support can be achieved\nthrough these extensions.  However, the
    support for multiple IP\naddresses per endpoint may have implications on the security
    of the\nresulting MPTCP protocol.  This note includes a threat analysis for\nMPTCP.\n\t
