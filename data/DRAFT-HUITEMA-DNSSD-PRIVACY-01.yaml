abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS-SD allows discovery of services published in DNS or MDNS.
    \ The\n   publication normally discloses information about the device\n   publishing
    the services.  There are use cases where devices want to\n   communicate without
    disclosing their identity, for example two mobile\n   devices visiting the same
    hotspot.\n\n   We propose to solve this problem by a two-stage approach.  In the\n
    \  first stage, hosts discover Private Discovery Service Instances via\n   DNS-SD
    using special formats to protect their privacy.  These service\n   instances correspond
    to Private Discovery Servers running on peers.\n   In the second stage, hosts
    directly query these Private Discovery\n   Servers via DNS-SD over TLS.  A pairwise
    shared secret necessary to\n   establish these connections is only known to hosts
    authorized by a\n   pairing system.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
