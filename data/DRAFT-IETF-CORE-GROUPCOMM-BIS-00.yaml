abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the use of the Constrained Application\n
    \  Protocol (CoAP) for group communication, using UDP/IP multicast as\n   the
    underlying data transport.  Both unsecured and secured CoAP group\n   communication
    are specified.  Security is achieved by use of the\n   Group Object Security for
    Constrained RESTful Environments (Group\n   OSCORE) protocol.  The target application
    area of this specification\n   is any group communication use cases that involve
    resource-\n   constrained networks.  The most common of such use cases are also\n
    \  discussed.  This document replaces [RFC7390] and updates [RFC7252]\n   and
    [RFC7641].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
