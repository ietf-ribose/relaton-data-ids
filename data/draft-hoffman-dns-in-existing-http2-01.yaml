abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft is now a tombstone. The -00 version of this document has
    a likely-bad suggestion of how to run DNS service over existing HTTP/2 connections
    over TLS, such as those being used for HTTP for basic web service. The author
    no longer recommends to do this.</p>"
