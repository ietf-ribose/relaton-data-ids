abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) technology
    enables\n   establishing a logical link-aggregation connection with a redundant\n
    \  group of independent nodes.  The purpose of multi-chassis LAG is to\n   provide
    a solution to achieve higher network availability, while\n   providing different
    modes of sharing/balancing of traffic.  RFC7432\n   defines EVPN based MC-LAG
    with single-active and all-active\n   multi-homing load-balancing mode.  The current
    draft expands on\n   existing redundancy mechanisms supported by EVPN and introduces\n
    \  support for a new port-active load-balancing mode.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
