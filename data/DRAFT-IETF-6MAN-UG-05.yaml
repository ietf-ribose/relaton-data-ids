abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IPv6 addressing architecture includes a unicast interface\n
    \  identifier that is used in the creation of many IPv6 addresses.\n   Interface
    identifiers are formed by a variety of methods.  This\n   document clarifies that
    the bits in an interface identifier have no\n   meaning and that the entire identifier
    should be treated as an opaque\n   value.  In particular, RFC 4291 defines a method
    by which the\n   Universal and Group bits of an IEEE link-layer address are mapped\n
    \  into an IPv6 unicast interface identifier.  This document clarifies\n   that
    those two bits are significant only in the process of deriving\n   interface identifiers
    from an IEEE link-layer address, and updates\n   RFC 4291 accordingly.\n\n\t </p>\n
