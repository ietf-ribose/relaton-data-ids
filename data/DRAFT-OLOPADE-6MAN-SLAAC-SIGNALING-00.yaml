abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   After a renumbering event in an IPv6 network utilizing SLAAC,
    hosts\n   might continue to use stale addresses, as they are unaware of the\n
    \  changes. Likewise, routers, who may deprecate the use of these\n   prefixes,
    are unaware of their use on the hosts. This scenario could\n   have an adverse
    effect on communication with the host. This document\n   proposes changes to the
    SLAAC algorithm that will explicitly allow\n   routers to learn of these stale
    prefixes that are still assigned on\n   the network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
