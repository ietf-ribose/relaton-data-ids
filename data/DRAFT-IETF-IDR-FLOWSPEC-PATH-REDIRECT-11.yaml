abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new extended community known as \"FlowSpec\n
    \  Redirect to indirection-id Extended Community\".  This extended\n   community
    triggers advanced redirection capabilities to flowspec\n   clients.  When activated,
    this flowspec extended community is used by\n   a flowspec client to retrieve
    the corresponding next-hop and encoding\n   information within a localised indirection-id
    mapping table.\n\n   The functionality detailed in this document allows a network\n
    \  controller to decouple the BGP flowspec redirection instruction from\n   the
    operation of the available paths.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
