abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet standards serve and are used by a variety of communities.\n
    \  This document contains guidelines for explicitly identifying them,\n   serving
    them, and determining how to resolve conflicts between their\n   interests, when
    necessary.\n\n   It also mandates end users as the highest priority concern for\n
    \  Internet standards.\n\nNote to Readers\n\n   The issues list for this draft
    can be found at\n   https://github.com/mnot/I-D/labels/for-the-users .\n\n\t </p>\n
