abstract:
- content: <p>A certain maximum amount of data can be safely encrypted when encryption
    is performed under a single key. This amount is called "key lifetime". This specification
    describes a variety of methods to increase the lifetime of symmetric keys. It
    provides two types of re-keying mechanisms based on hash functions and on block
    ciphers, that can be used with modes of operations such as CTR, GCM, CBC, CFB
    and OMAC. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG)
    in the IRTF.</p>
