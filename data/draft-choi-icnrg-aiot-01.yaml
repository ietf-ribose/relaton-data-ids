abstract:
  content: <p>This document describes the requirements and challenges to employ artificialintelligence
    (AI) into the constraint Internet of Things (IoT) service environment forembedding
    intelligence and increasing efficiency. The IoT service environment includes heterogeneous
    and multiple IoT devices andsystems that work together in a cooperative and intelligent
    way to manage homes, buildings,and complex autonomous systems. Therefore, it is
    becoming very essential to integrate IoTand AI technologies to increase the synergy
    between them. However, there areseveral limitations to achieve AI enabled IoT
    as the availability of IoT devices is not alwayshigh, and IoT networks cannot
    guarantee a certain level of performance in real-timeapplications due to resource
    constraints. This document intends to present a right direction to empower AI
    in IoT for learningand analyzing the usage behaviors of IoT devices/systems and
    human behaviors basedon previous records and experiences. With AI enabled IoT,
    the IoT service environment canbe intelligently managed in order to compensate
    for the unexpected performancedegradation often caused by abnormal situations.
