abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a methodology for testing the operation, administration
    and maintenance (OA&amp;M) of a general VPN service, that is applied here to Hierarchical
    Virtual Private LAN Services (HVPLS) as described in [VPLS]. As part of this methodology,
    the MPLS ping concepts described in [LSP- PING] are extended to enable HVPLS spoke-to-spoke
    connectivity testing. A method to provide the information necessary for this spoke-to-spoke
    OA&amp;M is also proposed. These are the goals of this draft: - checking connectivity
    between 'service-aware' nodes of a network, - verifying data plane and control
    plane integrity, - verifying service membership There are two specific requirements
    to which we call attention because of their seemingly contradictory nature: -
    the checking of connectivity MUST involve the ability to use packets that look
    like customer packets - the OAM packets MUST not propagate beyond the boundary
    of the provider network</p>"
