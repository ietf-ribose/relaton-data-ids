abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a methodology for testing theoperation, administration
    and maintenance (OA&amp;M) of a generalVPN service, that is applied here to Hierarchical
    VirtualPrivate LAN Services (HVPLS) as described in [VPLS]. As partof this methodology,
    the MPLS ping concepts described in [LSP-PING] are extended to enable HVPLS spoke-to-spoke
    connectivitytesting. A method to provide the information necessary forthis spoke-to-spoke
    OA&amp;M is also proposed.These are the goals of this draft:- checking connectivity
    between 'service-aware'nodes of a network,- verifying data plane and control plane
    integrity,- verifying service membershipThere are two specific requirements to
    which we call attentionbecause of their seemingly contradictory nature:- the checking
    of connectivity MUST involve theability to use packets that look like customerpackets-
    the OAM packets MUST not propagate beyond theboundary of the provider network</p>"
