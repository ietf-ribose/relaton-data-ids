abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  At present, the multimedia services such as IPTV are gaining
    \n  importance. Multicast technologies play an inevitable role in these \n  multimedia
    services.  \n   \n  The main factors affecting the multicast technologies are
    the \n  convergence speed and the capacity of the multicast routing table. \n
    \  \n  One of the easiest and the most commonly practiced methods in \n  nowadays
    multicast deployment is to push the data to the end router \n  by static configurations
    (igmp static group). This will reduce the \n  delay in channel switching. The
    data flow of multiple channels from \n  one or several servers are transmitted
    along the distribution tree. \n  The distribution tree for multiple channels may
    be composed of only \n  one same distribution tree. A router, however, maintains
    separate \n  protocol-status and provides separate protocol-packets content for
    \n  each channel. This prolongs the route convergence, increases the \n  status-space
    and reduces the exchange rate of protocol-packets.  \n   \n  This document proposes
    a solution to speed up the route convergence, \n  reduce the states in the multicast
    forwarding table and increase the \n  exchange rate of packets. This can be achieved
    by using the same \n  state for the data flows that passes the same path in the
    \n  distribution tree. This same state is called Multicast Forwarding \n  Equivalent
    Class (MFEC). In other words, MFEC is a group of multicast \n  packets that are
    forwarded over the same path with the same traffic \n  handling treatment. This
    solution extends various multicast protocols \n  such as PIM- SSM, PIM-SM, Bidir-PIM,
    PIM-DM and DVMRP, and perfects \n  application of multicast. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
