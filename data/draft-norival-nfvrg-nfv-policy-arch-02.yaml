abstract:
- content: "<p>A policy architecture and framework is discussed to support NFV environments,
    where policies are used to enforce business rules and to specify resource constraints
    in a number of subsystems. This document approaches the policy framework and architecture
    from the perspective of overall orchestration requirements for services involving
    multiple subsystems. The analysis extends beyond common orchestration constraints
    across compute, network, and storage subsystems to also include energy conservation
    constraints. This document also analyses policy scope, global versus local policies,
    policy actions and translations, policy conflict detection and resolution, interactions
    among policies engines, and a hierarchical policy architecture/framework to address
    the demanding and growing requirements of NFV environments, that could also be
    applicable to cloud infrastructures in general.</p>"
