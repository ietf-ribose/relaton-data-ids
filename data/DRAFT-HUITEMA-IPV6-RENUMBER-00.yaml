abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There has been recently a lot of the discussion in the IPNG, NGTRANS
    \nand DNSEXT working group about the level at which IPv6 shall support \nrenumbering.
    A specific question is whether we need special support \nin the DNS to enable
    renumbering, as specified in [RFC2874], or if \nthe simpler mechanisms specified
    in [RFC1886] are sufficient. In \norder to organize the discussion, this memo
    presents a set of \nrealistic renumbering scenarios, discusses the possible frequency
    at \nwhich such scenarios can be repeated, presents some tools that can \nbe used
    to organize the renumbering, and summarizes the operational \nrequirements that
    have to be met by any renumbering solution.\n\t </p>\n      "
