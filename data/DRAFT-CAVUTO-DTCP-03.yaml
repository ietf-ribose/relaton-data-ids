abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Dynamic Tasking Control Protocol is a message-based interface
    by \n   which an authorized client may connect to a server -- usually a \n   network
    element (NE) or security policy enforcement point (PEP) -- \n   and issue dynamic
    requests for data. These tasking requests contain, \n   among other parameters,
    packet matching criteria that may apply to \n   certain packets flowing through
    that network element. The primary \n   intent of the tasking request is to instruct
    that network element to \n   send copies of packets matching those criteria to
    a destination \n   (usually via tunneling) for further inspection or other action.
    The \n   protocol contains a security architecture to address client or server
    \n   spoofing as well as replay prevention. The protocol assumes that \n   multiple
    clients may simultaneously control a single server.\n\t </p>\n      "
