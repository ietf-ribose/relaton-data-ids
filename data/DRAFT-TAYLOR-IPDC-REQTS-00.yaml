abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the requirements for a protocol to
    control  a\n   device  which  supports  telephone  lines  or  trunks on one side
    and\n   packet network ports on the other.   The  primary  functions  of  the\n
    \  device  are  to  make,  modify,  and  break  media stream connections\n   between
    \ these  edge-points,  to  perform  operations  on  the  media\n   streams,  and
    \ to  detect  and report specific events associated with\n   those streams or
    the edge-points. This device may also terminate call\n   signalling  which  it
    \ processes  itself  and/or passes to the device\n   which controls it.  Using
    the terminology provided by  Cuervo  et  al\n   [1],  the device just described
    is a Media Gateway, and is controlled\n   by a Media Gateway Controller.\n \n
    \  The requirements for the protocol  separate  into  two  major  parts:\n   operational
    \  and   functional.   The  operational  requirements  are\n   concerned with
    reliability and security of control messaging, control\n   session  startup  and
    takedown, handling of control session failures,\n   and control system performance.
    \ The  functional  requirements  cover\n   connection   control,   media  processing,
    \ event  notification,  and\n   resource status tracking.  They may also include
    signalling  backhaul\n   from the Media Gateway to the Media Gateway Controller.\n
    \n   The protocol should extend to the control of  devices  which  contain\n   telephony
    edge-points only (such as digital cross-connects) or packet\n   network ports
    only (such as transcoders or announcement servers).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
