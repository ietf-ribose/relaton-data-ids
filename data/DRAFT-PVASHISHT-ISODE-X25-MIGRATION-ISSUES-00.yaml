abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ISODE (International Standard Organization Development Environment)
    \n   is one of the most mature implementation of the ISO (International \n   Standard
    Organization) protocol stack. The majority of the ISODE \n   implementation work
    over TCP. This draft presents some of the \n   possible issues that MAY arise
    while porting the ISODE protocol \n   stack over X.25.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
