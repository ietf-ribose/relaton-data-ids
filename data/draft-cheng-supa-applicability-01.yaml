abstract:
- content: "<p>SUPA will define a generic policy model, an imperative ECA (Event Condition
    Action) policy information model and a declarative (intent- based) policy information
    model which is the extension of the generic model, and a set of policy data models
    which will make use of the common concepts defined in the generic model. This
    memo will explore some typical use cases and demonstrate the applicability of
    SUPA policy models.</p>"
