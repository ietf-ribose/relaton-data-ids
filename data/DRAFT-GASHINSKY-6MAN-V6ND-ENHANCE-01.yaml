abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough
    to cover\n   the actual number of machines on the subnet.  In contrast, the\n
    \  default IPv6 subnet size is a /64, a number so large it covers\n   trillions
    of addresses, the overwhelming number of which will be\n   unassigned.  Consequently,
    simplistic implementations of Neighbor\n   Discovery can be vulnerable to denial
    of service attacks whereby they\n   attempt to perform address resolution for
    large numbers of unassigned\n   addresses.  Such denial of attacks can be launched
    intentionally (by\n   an attacker), or result from legitimate operational tools
    that scan\n   networks for inventory and other purposes.  As a result of these\n
    \  vulnerabilities, new devices may not be able to \"join\" a network, it\n   may
    be impossible to establish new IPv6 flows, and existing IPv6\n   transported flows
    may be interrupted.\n\n   This document describes a modification to the [RFC4861]
    neighbor\n   discovery protocol aimed at improving the resilience of the neighbor\n
    \  discovery process.  We call this process Gratuitous neighbor\n   discovery
    and it derives inspiration in part from analogous IPv4\n   gratuitous ARP implementation.\n\n\t
