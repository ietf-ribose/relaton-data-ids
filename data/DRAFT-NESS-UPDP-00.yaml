abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet Draft describes the Universal Packet Driver Protocol
    \n(UPDP).  This protocol is intended to provide a standardized method \nfor a
    device to communicate its interface information.  It is a \nprotocol based on
    extending ICMP [1] within the bounds of the \noriginal intention of ICMP.  The
    protocol can be used by any device \nto send and receive device interface information.
    \n\n\t </p>\n      "
