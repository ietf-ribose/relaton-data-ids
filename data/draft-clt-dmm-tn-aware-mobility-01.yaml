abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework and a mapping function for 5G mobile
    user plane with transport network slicing, integrated with Mobile Radio Access
    and a Virtualized Core Network. The integrated approach specified in a way to
    address all the mobility scenarios defined in [TS23.501] and to be backward compatible
    with LTE [TS.23.401-3GPP] network deployments. It focuses on an optimized mobile
    user plane functionality with various transport services needed for some of the
    5G traffic needing low and deterministic latency, real-time, mission-critical
    services. This document describes, how this objective is achieved agnostic to
    the transport underlay used (IPv4, IPv6, MPLS) in various deployments and with
    a new transport network underlay routing, called Preferred Path Routing (PPR).</p>"
