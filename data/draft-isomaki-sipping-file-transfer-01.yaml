abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes use cases and defines requirements for how
    different types of file transfer services could be integrated into the general
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based communication framework. It also explores
    some of the possible solutions to meet those requirements, either based on existing
    protocol mechanisms or defining minor extensions to them. The purpose of the document
    is to start the discussion on whether some new standardization work is needed
    in this area.</p>"
