abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes use cases and defines requirements for howdifferent
    types of file transfer services could be integrated intothe general Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) based communicationframework. It also explores some of the possible
    solutions to meetthose requirements, either based on existing protocol mechanisms
    ordefining minor extensions to them. The purpose of the document is tostart the
    discussion on whether some new standardization work isneeded in this area.</p>"
