abstract:
  content: "\t <t>While the RTP payload format defined in RFC 2250 is generally applicableto
    all forms of MPEG audio or video, it is less suitable for MPEG 1 or 2,layer III
    audio (commonly known as 'MP3'). The reason for this is thatan MP3 frame is not
    a true 'Application Data Unit' - it contains aback-pointer to data in earlier
    frames, and so cannot be decodedindependently of these earlier frames. Because
    RFC 2250 defines that packetboundaries coincide with frame boundaries, it handles
    packet lossinefficiently when carrying MP3 data. The loss of an MP3 frame will
    rendersome data in previous (or future) frames useless, even if they are receivedwithout
    loss. In this document we define a new RTP payload format for MP3 audio. The newformat
    is essentially the same as that defined in RFC 2250, except for adata-preserving
    rearrangement of the original MPEG frames, so that packetboundaries now coincide
    with true MP3 'Application Data Units'. This newformat is therefore more data
    efficient in the face of packet loss.</p>"
