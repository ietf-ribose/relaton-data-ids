abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC4458 defines a \"cause\" URI parameter, which may appear
    in the\n   Request-URI of a SIP request, that is used to indicate a reason why\n
    \  the request arrived to the User Agent Server (UAS) receiving the\n   message.
    \ This document creates a new predefined value for the\n   \"cause\" URI parameter
    to cover service number translation for cases\n   of retargeting due to specific
    service action leading to the\n   translation of a called service access number.
    \ This document also\n   provides guidance, which was missing in RFC4458, for
    using the\n   \"cause\" URI parameter within the History-Info header field since
    this\n   use is mandatory in some IP networks' implementations.\n\n   This document
    updates RFC4458.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
