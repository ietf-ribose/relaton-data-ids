abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF Community Hubs are geographically-focused groups that facilitate
    participation in IETF activities. An IETF Community Hub may have different focuses,
    depending upon the interests of those participating, such as cross-area learning,
    outreach, mentoring, problem refinement, implementation and interop testing, and
    social. An IETF Community Hub's focuses and the energy of its coordinators will
    determine what types of activities are organized. Sample activities may include
    sessions of technical talks, social get- togethers, remote hubs during some IETF
    WG meetings, hackathons, etc.</p>"
