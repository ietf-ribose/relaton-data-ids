abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This RFC document envisages the need and necessity in utilizing
    or\nextending the compute resource technologies in such as networking(NW),\nremote
    computing(RC),cloud computing(CC),distributed computing(DC),\nMachine Learning(ML)
    and other related fields of AI to the biological\nfield of electron microscopy(EC)
    for use in rapid and timely\nidentification or diagnosis of virological/bacterial
    elements in\nclinical samples in the current world scenario, within the given\ntime
    frame irrespective of the place of origin and with having\ngeographical presence.\n\nElectron
    microscopy (EM) is a pioneering methodology used in\nidentification and diagnosing
    of viral and microbiological elements.\nIt is able to identify in morphological
    form the tiniest of the\nviruses in minimum amount of time by clinical scientists.\n\n\t
