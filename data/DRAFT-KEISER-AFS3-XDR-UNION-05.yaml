abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   AFS-3 relies upon XDR to carry Rx RPC call payloads.  XDR\n
    \  discriminated unions are ill-suited to cases where the protocol needs\n   to
    evolve without inventing new RPCs, i.e., unknown discriminant\n   values cause
    the entire XDR payload to fail the decoding step.  While\n   this can be circumvented
    through the use of opaque payloads (and\n   recursive XDR invocations), such solutions
    are inelegant and\n   difficult to implement.  This memo defines a new XDR primitive
    type,\n   \"ext-union\", which is derived from the XDR discriminated union\n   primitive
    type, but with two key variations: 1) each leg contains a\n   length field, and
    2) no default leg is supported.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
