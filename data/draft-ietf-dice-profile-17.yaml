abstract:
- content: "<p>A common design pattern in Internet of Things (IoT) deployments is
    the use of a constrained device that collects data via sensors or controls actuators
    for use in home automation, industrial control systems, smart cities, and other
    IoT deployments. This document defines a Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram
    Transport Layer Security (DTLS) 1.2 profile that offers communications security
    for this data exchange thereby preventing eavesdropping, tampering, and message
    forgery. The lack of communication security is a common vulnerability in IoT products
    that can easily be solved by using these well-researched and widely deployed Internet
    security protocols.</p>"
