abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When a Path Computation Element (PCE) is a Label Switching
    Router\n   (LSR) participating in the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even
    a\n   server participating in IGP, its presence and path computation\n   capabilities
    can be advertised using IGP flooding.  The IGP\n   extensions for PCE discovery
    (RFC 5088 and RFC 5089) define a method\n   to advertise path computation capabilities
    using IGP flooding for\n   OSPF and IS-IS respectively.  However these specifications
    lack a\n   method to advertise PCEP security (e.g., Transport Layer\n   Security(TLS),
    TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO)) support\n   capability.\n\n   This document
    proposes new capability flag bits for PCE-CAP-FLAGS\n   sub-TLV that can be announced
    as attribute in the IGP advertisement\n   to distribute PCEP security support
    information.  In addition, this\n   document updates RFC 5088 and RFC 5089 to
    allow advertisement of Key\n   ID or Key Chain Name Sub-TLV to support TCP AO
    security capability.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
