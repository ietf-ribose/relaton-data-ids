abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a topology-transparent zone in an area. A zone
    is a block/piece of an area, which comprises a group of routers and a number of
    circuits connecting them. It is abstracted as a virtual entity such as a single
    virtual node or zone edges mesh. Any router outside of the zone is not aware of
    the zone. The information about the circuits and routers inside the zone is not
    distributed to any router outside of the zone.</p>"
