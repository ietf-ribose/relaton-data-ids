abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document contains a straw man proposal for a method for
    sharing\n   symmetric session keys between a TLS client and a middlebox, so that\n
    \  the middlebox can decrypt the TLS-protected traffic.\n\n   This method is an
    alternative to the middlebox becoming a proxy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
