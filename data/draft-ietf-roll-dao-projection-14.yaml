abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC 6550 to enable a RPL Root to install and
    maintain Projected Routes within its DODAG, along a selected set of nodes that
    may or may not include self, for a chosen duration. This potentially enables routes
    that are more optimized or resilient than those obtained with the classical distributed
    operation of RPL, either in terms of the size of a Routing Header or in terms
    of path length, which impacts both the latency and the packet delivery ratio.</p>"
