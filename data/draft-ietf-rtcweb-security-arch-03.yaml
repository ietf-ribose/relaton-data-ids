abstract:
- content: <p>The Real-Time Communications on the Web (RTCWEB) working group is tasked
    with standardizing protocols for enabling real-time communications within user-agents
    using web technologies (e.g JavaScript). The major use cases for RTCWEB technology
    are real-time audio and/or video calls, Web conferencing, and direct data transfer.
    Unlike most conventional real-time systems (e.g., SIP-based soft phones) RTCWEB
    communications are directly controlled by some Web server, which poses new security
    challenges. For instance, a Web browser might expose a JavaScript API which allows
    a server to place a video call. Unrestricted access to such an API would allow
    any site which a user visited to "bug" a user's computer, capturing any activity
    which passed in front of their camera. [I-D.ietf-rtcweb- security] defines the
    RTCWEB threat model. This document defines an architecture which provides security
    within that threat model.</p>
