abstract:
- content: "<p>It is becoming clear that next generation telephony networks will be
    built on top of IP-based networks, as opposed to the traditional voice technology.
    There are several reasons for this, among them lower cost and greater flexibility.
    While there are several Voice on IP (VoIP) solutions, the H.323 [2] standard from
    the ITU seems to be a major player. Other solutions will probably resemble H.323,
    even if they do not comply with the standard. This memo proposes an Application
    Interface to permit H.323 devices to open 'pinholes' in an otherwise opaque firewall,
    to permit the traffic necessary for H.323 through, and nothing else. Since other
    VoIP solutions resemble H.323, at least approximately, the same Application Interface
    may well be useful for them. In particular, Real-Time Protocol (RTP), defined
    in RFC1889 [3], is likely to be the underlying voice transport for any VoIP solution.</p>"
