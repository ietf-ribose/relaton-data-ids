abstract:
- content: "<p>In this memo, the extended (per-hop) BGP metrics are proposed to allow
    network operators to implement routing policies which are common cases in the
    practice but require complicated ad-hoc configurations given the virtual absence
    of globally significant metrics in BGP-4. BGP is an inter-autonomous system routing
    protocol designed for TCP/IP internets. The current version is BGP-4 documented
    in RFC 1654, versions 1-3 are documented in RFCs 1105, 1163 and 1267 accordingly.
    This document is a supplement to RFC 1654, and describes the new features in terms
    of differences from BGP-4.</p>"
