abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reflects apparent ambiguities in RFC 821 that remain
    after the clarifications in RFC 1123. It also includes some material from RFC
    1123 that appeared to need amplification. These have been identified in multiple
    ways, mostly by tracking flaming on the header-people list and problems of unusual
    readings or interpretations that have turned up as the SMTP extensions have been
    deployed. It is important to note that everything here is in response to some
    identified confusion or bad behavior, not just paranoia. Although SMTP was designed
    as a mail transport and delivery protocol, this specification also contains information
    that is important to its use as a 'mail posting' protocol, as recommended for
    POP3 [RFC-POP3] and IMAP4 [RFC-IMAP4]. Except when the historical terminology
    is necessary for clarity, this document uses the current 'client' and 'server'
    terminology to identify the sending and receiving SMTP processes, respectively.
    A companion document discusses mail bodies and formats: RFC-822, MIME, and their
    relationship.</p>"
