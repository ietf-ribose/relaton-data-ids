abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol
    (LDP) for the setup of point to multi-point (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
    in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks. The solution relies on LDP
    without requiring a multicast routing protocol in the network. Protocol elements
    and procedures for this solution are described. There can be various applications
    for P2MP LSPs such as IP multicast. Specification of how such applications can
    use a LDP signaled P2MP LSP is outside the scope of this document.</p>"
