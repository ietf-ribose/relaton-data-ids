abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) architecture\n
    \  allows data flows over the public Internet to predictably achieve\n   ultra-low
    queuing latency, generally zero congestion loss and scaling\n   of per-flow throughput
    without the problems of traditional TCP.  To\n   achieve this, L4S data flows
    use a 'scalable' congestion control\n   similar to Data Centre TCP (DCTCP) and
    a form of Explicit Congestion\n   Notification (ECN) with modified behaviour.
    \ However, until now,\n   scalable congestion controls did not co-exist with existing
    TCP Reno/\n   Cubic traffic---scalable controls are so aggressive that 'Classic'\n
    \  TCP algorithms drive themselves to starvation.  Therefore, until now,\n   L4S
    controls could only be deployed where a clean-slate environment\n   could be arranged,
    such as in private data centres (hence the name\n   DCTCP).  This specification
    defines `DualQ Coupled Active Queue\n   Management (AQM)', which enables these
    scalable congestion controls\n   to safely co-exist with Classic Internet traffic.\n\n
    \  The Coupled AQM ensures that a flow runs at about the same rate\n   whether
    it uses DCTCP or TCP Reno/Cubic.  It achieves this\n   indirectly, without having
    to inspect transport layer flow\n   identifiers, When tested in a residential
    broadband setting, DCTCP\n   also achieves sub-millisecond average queuing delay
    and zero\n   congestion loss under a wide range of mixes of DCTCP and `Classic'\n
    \  broadband Internet traffic, without compromising the performance of\n   the
    Classic traffic.  The solution also reduces network complexity\n   and eliminates
    network configuration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
