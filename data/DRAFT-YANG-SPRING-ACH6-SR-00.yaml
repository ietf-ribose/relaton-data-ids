abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Associated Channel over IPv6 (ACH6) provides a control channel
    to one\n   specific IPv6 forwarding path for control and management purpose.\n
    \  When ACH6 is used in a Segment Routing network, it provides a control\n   channel
    to an SRv6 path.  This document specifies an SRv6 ACH6\n   mechanism and describes
    how ACH6 is applied in a Segment Routing\n   network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
