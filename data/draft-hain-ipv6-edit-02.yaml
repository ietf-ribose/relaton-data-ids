abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There will be IPv4-only applications that remain in use as networkmanagers
    begin deploying IPv6-only networks, or turning off IPv4 inthe exiting dual-stack
    networks. These applications require a dual-stack capable host operating system,
    but that OS may find that thelocal network has not provided on-link IPv4 provisioning
    or routingsupport for the resulting packets. Skepticism that this situationwill
    exist is widespread; because it is easy to ignore the costssomeone else will incur
    and focus on the local situation. Taking thesystem level viewpoint, that skepticism
    makes no sense when it iswidely acknowledged that people will resist replacing
    something thatis working, particularly when the reason it might artificially stopis
    due to 'someone else's problem'. The reality of IPv4-onlyapplications persisting
    in an IPv6-only provisioned network isspecifically ignored by RFC 4038. This document
    deals with thesituation by defining a new tunneling type for use within the edge
    orleaf network to the border where it interconnects with an IPv4routing domain.The
    draft is being discussed on the ipv6@ietf.org list.LegalThis documents and the
