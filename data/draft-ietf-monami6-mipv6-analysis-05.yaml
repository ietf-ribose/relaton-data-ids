abstract:
  content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 as specified in RFC 3775 allows a mobile node to maintainits
    IPv6 communications while moving between subnets. This documentinvestigates configurations
    where a mobile node running Mobile IPv6is multihomed. The use of multiple addresses
    is foreseen to provideubiquitous, permanent and fault-tolerant access to the Internet,particularly
    on mobile nodes which are more prone to failure orsudden lack of connectivity.
    However, Mobile IPv6 currently lackssupport for such multihomed nodes. The purpose
    of this document isto detail all the issues arising through the operation of Mobile
    IPv6on multihomed mobile nodes.</p>"
