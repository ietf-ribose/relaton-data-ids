abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OSPF is a fundamental component for a routing system.  It depends
    on\n   the flooding mechanism to advertise and synchronize link-state\n   database
    among distributed nodes in a network.  As modern networks\n   become larger and
    more complex, more and more nodes and adjacencies\n   are involved.  As a result,
    massive link-state information are\n   generated and synchronized which are becoming
    an overhead of networks\n   nowadays.\n\n   This document proposes a new design
    of OSPF database synchronization\n   that is slightly different from the one stated
    in OSPF.  This new\n   design can help to alleviate the overhead by dividing OSPF
    routers\n   into independent synchronization groups and limiting synchronization\n
    \  across the group border.  Since less burden from synchronization, it\n   is
    possible to accommodate more OSPF routers and adjacencies in a\n   network.\n\n\n\t
