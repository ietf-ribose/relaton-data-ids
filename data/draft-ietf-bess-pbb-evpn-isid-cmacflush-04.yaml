abstract:
- content: "<p>Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) can be combined with Ethernet VPN
    (EVPN) to deploy Ethernet Local Area Network (ELAN) services in large Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) networks (PBB-EVPN). Single- Active Multi-homing and per-I-SID
    (per Service Instance Identifier) Load-Balancing can be provided to access devices
    and aggregation networks. In order to speed up the network convergence in case
    of failures on Single-Active Multi-Homed Ethernet Segments, PBB-EVPN defines a
    flush mechanism for Customer MACs (CMAC-flush) that works for different Ethernet
    Segment Backbone MAC (BMAC) address allocation models. This document complements
    those CMAC-flush procedures for cases in which no PBB-EVPN Ethernet Segments are
    defined (the attachment circuit is associated to a zero Ethernet Segment Identifier)
    and a Service Instance Identifier based (I-SID-based) CMAC-flush granularity is
    required.</p>"
