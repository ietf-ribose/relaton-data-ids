abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a mechanism aimed at providing a solution
    for\n   network slicing in the transport network for 5G services.  The\n   proposed
    mechanism uses a unified administrative instance identifier\n   to distinguish
    different virtual network resources for both intra-\n   domain and inter-domain
    network slicing scenarios.  Combined with the\n   segment routing technology,
    the mechanism could be used for both\n   best-effort and traffic engineered services
    for tenants.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
