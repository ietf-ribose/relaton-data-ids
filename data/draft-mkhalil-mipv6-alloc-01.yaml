abstract:
- content: "<p>Static configuration of the MN's (Mobile Node) home address is a very
    cumbersome task and a provisioning nightmare for the Service Providers. With millions
    of subscribers, a typical Service Provider stands to incur considerable expenses
    in order to manually configure all of its MN's home address. The ability to dynamically
    and securely allocate MN's home address, therefore, can immensely aid in providing
    a cost-effective and efficient device management alternative to the Service Providers.
    This draft provides a simple method for dynamically allocating MN's home address
    in a secure manner.</p>"
