    YANG\n   model, which provides explanations and guidelines for the deployment\n
    \  of multicast service in all kinds of multicast scenarios.  The\n   multicast
    technologies include BIER multicast, PIM multicast, MPLS\n   multicast and so
    on.  And also, there defines several possible RPCs\n   about how to interact between
