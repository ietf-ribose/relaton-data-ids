abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Currently, the most efficient techniques for multicast key management\nare
    based on the Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) scheme. In current\npractice, LKH trees
    are organized as balanced binary trees, which\ngive a uniform O(log n) complexity
    for compromise recovery in an n-\nmember group. In this draft, we propose organizing
    the LKH trees with\nrespect to the members' compromise probabilities instead of
    keeping a\nbalanced tree, in a spirit similar to data compression techniques\nsuch
    as Huffman and Shannon-Fano coding. We describe two such\nprobabilistic algorithms
    which improve the performance of an LKH\nscheme by probabilistic organization
    of the tree. Preliminary\nsimulation results show that significant gains can be
    obtained by\nthese techniques.\n\t </p>\n      "
