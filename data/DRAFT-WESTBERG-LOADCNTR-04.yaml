abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There is an increased interest of simple and scalable resource
    \n   provisioning solution for Diffserv networks. This is an updated \n   version
    of the old draft (previous version was submitted in \n   April 2000) describing
    a concept called Load Control. \n\n   Load Control addresses the following issues:\n\n
    \    1. Admission control for real time data flows in stateless domains\n\n     2.
    Dropping of flows in case of exceptional events, such as \n        severe congestion
    after re-routing\n\t </p>\n      "
