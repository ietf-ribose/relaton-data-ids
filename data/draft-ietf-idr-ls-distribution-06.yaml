abstract:
- content: "<p>In a number of environments, a component external to a network is called
    upon to perform computations based on the network topology and current state of
    the connections within the network, including traffic engineering information.
    This is information typically distributed by IGP routing protocols within the
    network. This document describes a mechanism by which links state and traffic
    engineering information can be collected from networks and shared with external
    components using the BGP routing protocol. This is achieved using a new BGP Network
    Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) encoding format. The mechanism is applicable
    to physical and virtual IGP links. The mechanism described is subject to policy
    control. Applications of this technique include Application Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) servers, and Path Computation Elements (PCEs).</p>"
