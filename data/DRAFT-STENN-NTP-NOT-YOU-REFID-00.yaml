abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NTP has been widely used through several revisions, with the
    latest\n   being RFC 5905 [RFC5905].  A core component of the protocol and the\n
    \  algoritms is the Reference ID, or REFID, which is used to identify\n   the
    source of time used for synchronization (aka the \"system peer\").\n   Traditionally,
    when the source of time was another system, the REFID\n   was the IPv4 address
    of that other system.  The purpose of the REFID\n   is to prevent a one-degree
    \"timing loop\": where if A has several\n   timing sources that include B, if
    B decides to get its time from A,\n   then A should not then decide to get its
    time from B.  The REFID is\n   therefore a vital core-component of the base NTP
    packet.  If a\n   system's REFID is the IPv4 address of its time source, then
    with a\n   simple query a remote attacker can learn the target's REFID.  The\n
    \  remote attacker can then try to use that information to send spoofed\n   NTP
    packets to the target or the target's time source, attempting to\n   cause a disruption
    in time service [NDSS16].  Since the core purpose\n   of the REFID is to prevent
    a one-degree timing loop, this proposal is\n   a backward-compatible way to limit
    the amount of information that is\n   leaked in the REFID.  Specifically, it allows
    the prevention of one-\n   degree timing loops by allowing a system A to reveal
    to a querying\n   system B that B is not A's time source, but without revealing
    the\n   actual time source to which A is synchronized.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
