abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a framework for using Session Initiation\nProtocol
    sessions to create user interface components for network\napplication interaction.
    \ These Network Applications Sessions\nprovide a number of services to the application
    server and user\nagent including application identification, co-operation,\nassociation,
    and authentication.  In addition to these services the\nframework allows for differing
    modes of interaction to be managed in\na homogenous manner with similar expectations
    for security,\nestablishment, update, closure and the handling of certain user\ninterface
    operations.\n\t </p>\n      "
