abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document outlines a specialized, dynamic routing protocol
    for\n   Clos and fat-tree network topologies.  The protocol (1) deals with\n   fully
    automated construction of fat-tree topologies based on\n   detection of links,
    (2) minimizes the amount of routing state held at\n   each level, (3) automatically
    prunes and load balances topology\n   flooding exchanges over a sufficient subset
    of links, (4) supports\n   automatic disaggregation of prefixes on link and node
    failures to\n   prevent black-holing and suboptimal routing, (5) allows traffic\n
    \  steering and re-routing policies, (6) allows loop-free non-ECMP\n   forwarding,
    (7) automatically re-balances traffic towards the spines\n   based on bandwidth
    available and finally (8) provides mechanisms to\n   synchronize a limited key-value
    data-store that can be used after\n   protocol convergence to e.g.  bootstrap
    higher levels of\n   functionality on nodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
