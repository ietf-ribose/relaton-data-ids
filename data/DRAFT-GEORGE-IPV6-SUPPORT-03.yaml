abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document recommends that the IETF formally require its
    standards\n   work to be IP version agnostic or to explicitly include support
    for\n   IPv6, with some exceptions, to ensure that it is possible to operate\n
    \  without dependencies on IPv4.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
