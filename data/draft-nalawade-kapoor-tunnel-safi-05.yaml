abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There is a growing requirement for network operators to supportmulti-address
    familiy routing and forwarding services across theirbackbone networks. In general
    this is accomplished by constructing amesh of tunnels between the backbbone provider
    edge routers and thenadvertising reachability to prefixes through specific tunnels.
    Thisdocument defines a new subsequence address family identifierassociated with
    a tunnel end-point information. This enables a singleegress provider edge router
    to use the border gateway protocol as ascalable and efficient means to distribute
    its tunnel end-pointinformation to many ingress provider edge routers. The result
    is thatthe mesh of tunnels is in place and packets can be forwarded throughthese
    tunnels based on advertised reachability.</p>"
