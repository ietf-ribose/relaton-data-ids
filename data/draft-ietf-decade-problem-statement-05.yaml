abstract:
- content: "<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on the Internet
    today and make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks. In P2P applications,
    one technique for reducing the transit and uplink P2P traffic is to introduce
    storage capabilities within the network. Traditional caches (e.g., P2P and Web
    caches) provide such storage, but they are complex (due to explicitly supporting
    individual P2P application protocols and cache refresh mechanisms) and they do
    not allow users to manage access to content in the cache. For example, content
    providers wishing to use in- network storage cannot easily control cache access
    and resource usage policies to satisfy their own requirements. This document discusses
    the introduction of in-network storage for P2P applications, and shows the need
    for a standard protocol for accessing this storage.</p>"
