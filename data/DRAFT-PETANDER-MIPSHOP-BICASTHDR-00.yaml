abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bicasting or multicasting of traffic can be used to reduce
    the impact \n   of a handoff by allowing a Mobile Node to receive a stream via
    \n   multiple paths simultaneously. However, receiving of multiple copies \n   of
    the packets may have a negative impact on applications which \n\n   cannot distinguish
    duplicate packets. This holds true for all \n   applications using TCP which mistakes
    the packet duplication from \n   bicasting with congestion and reduces the sending
    rate drastically. \n   This document specifies an IPv6 destination option header
    which can \n   be used to identify and discard duplicate copies of bicasted packets.
    \n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
