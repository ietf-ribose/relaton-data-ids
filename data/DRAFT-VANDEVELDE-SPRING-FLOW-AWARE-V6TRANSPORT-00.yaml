abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Flow-Aware transport of Pseudowires over an MPLS Packet Switched\n
    \  Network (RFC6391) introduces an ECMP use-case, making assumption that\n   the
    payload of a pseudowire comprises of a number of distinct flows.\n   RFC6391 provides
    a mechanism for fine flow granularity beyond the\n   individual pseudowire, helping
    better flow granularity for ECMP\n   purpose.  To identify the granular pseudowire
    flows the concept of\n   MPLS Flow Label is introduced.  Furthermore RFC6391 defines
    the\n   required LDP protocol extensions to exchange the MPLS Flow Label\n   between
    LDP speakers.\n\n   Another method to exchange MPLS flow labels is found in draft-ietf-\n
    \  bess-fat-pw-bgp.  Draft-ietf-bess-fat-pw-bgp defines extensions\n   required
    to synchronise flow label state between PEs using BGP-based\n   signalling procedures.
    \ This draft assumes MPLS is the transport\n   technology used.\n\n   This draft
    extends the applicability of draft-ietf-bess-fat-pw-bgp\n   and uses the BGP derived
    flow label for IPv6 Segment Routing\n   transport.  The PE responsible for imposing
    the IPv6 Segment Routing\n   top level header will in addition to an IPv6 header
    AND the IPv6\n   Source Routing header ALSO impose the BGP derived Flow Label
    as the\n   IPv6 outer header flow Label.  This functionality will provide fine\n
    \  ECMP granularity of IPv6 Segment routing enabled pseudowire transport\n   services.\n\n\n\t
