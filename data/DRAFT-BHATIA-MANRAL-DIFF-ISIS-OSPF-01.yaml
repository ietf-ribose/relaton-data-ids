abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The increasing popularity of IS-IS [IS-IS] and OSPF [OSPF] over
    \   \n   the years has drawn significant attention to the relative merits and
    \n   de-merits of one with respect to the other. This draft presents an \n   elaborate
    comparison between the two routing protocols to explain how \n   the features
    and functionalities of one differs from the other. \n   Wherever applicable the
    differences between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3[OSPFv3] \n   have also been pointed out.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
