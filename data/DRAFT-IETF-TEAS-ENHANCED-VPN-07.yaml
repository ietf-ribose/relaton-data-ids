abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the framework for Enhanced Virtual
    Private\n   Network (VPN+) services.  The purpose of enhanced VPNs is to support\n
    \  the needs of new applications, particularly applications that are\n   associated
    with 5G services, by utilizing an approach that is based\n   on existing VPN and
    Traffic Engineering (TE) technologies and adds\n   characteristics that specific
    services require over and above\n   traditional VPNs.\n\n   Typically, VPN+ will
    be used to underpin network slicing, but could\n   also be of use in its own right
    providing enhanced connectivity\n   services between customer sites.\n\n   It
    is envisaged that enhanced VPNs will be delivered using a\n   combination of existing,
    modified, and new networking technologies.\n   This document provides an overview
    of relevant technologies and\n   identifies some areas for potential new work.\n\n
    \  Compared to traditional VPNs, it is not envisaged that large numbers\n   of
    VPN+ services will be deployed in a network.  In other word, it is\n   not intended
    that all existing VPNs supported by a network will use\n   VPN+ techniques.\n\n\t
