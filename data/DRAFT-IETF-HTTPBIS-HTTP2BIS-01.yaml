abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification describes an optimized expression of the
    semantics\n   of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), referred to as HTTP\n
    \  version 2 (HTTP/2).  HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network\n   resources
    and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header\n   field compression
    and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the\n   same connection.  It also
    introduces unsolicited push of\n   representations from servers to clients.\n\n
    \  This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the\n   HTTP/1.1
    message syntax.  HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
