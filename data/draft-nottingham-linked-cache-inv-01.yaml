abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines Web link types that invalidate HTTP caches, along
    with an HTTP cache-control extension that allows caches that understand those
    link types to use responses containing them. Together, these mechanisms offer
    a way to avoid use of a response that has become stale due to another request
    that changes server-side state. Collectively, this is referred to as Linked Cache
    Invalidation (LCI).</p>"
