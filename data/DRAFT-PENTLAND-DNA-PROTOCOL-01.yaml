abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Efficient detection of network attachment in IPv6 needs the
    following\n   two components: a method for the host to query routers on the link
    to\n   identify the link (Link Identification) and a method for the routers\n
    \  on the link to consistently respond to such a query with minimal\n   delay
    (Fast RA).  Solving the link identification based strictly on\n   RFC 2461 is
    difficult because of the flexibilities offered to routers\n   in terms of prefixes
    advertised in a router advertisement (RA)\n   message.  Similarly, the random
    delay in responding to router\n   solicitation messages imposed by RFC 2461 makes
    to it difficult to\n   achieve fast RA.  A known set of solutions to these two
    problems was\n   identified and catalogued by the DNA design team.  In this memo,
    an\n   integrated solution is presented, based on a sub-set of the\n   catalogued
    solutions.  This integrated solution consolidates most of\n   the advantages of
    all known solutions while addressing most of the\n   disadvantages.\n\t </p>\n
