abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       Opportunistic networks have attracted attention due to
    their inherent\n       characteristics, such as long latency, low data rate, and\n
    \      intermittent connectivity. Extensive research has been conducted on\n       opportunistic
    networks, including the architecture, and routing.\n       However, few in the
    literature report the performance of TCP in\n       opportunistic networks, especially
    in the case of Epidemic Routing.\n       This document investigates the performance
    of TCP [1] in\n       opportunistic networks with Epidemic Routing. Our results
    show that\n       the Epidemic Routing in opportunistic networks degrades the\n
    \      performance of TCP because multicopy data packets cause duplicate\n       ACKs,
    and in turn reduce the transmission rate of TCP. An enhanced\n       congestion
    control for TCP, named A-TCP/Reno is proposed. A-TCP/Reno\n       avoids the duplicate
    ACK problem caused by Epidemic Routing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
