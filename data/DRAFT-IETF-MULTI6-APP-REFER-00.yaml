abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In order to fully solve the scalable multihoming problem there
    is a\n   need to separate the current IP address functionality into\n   identifiers
    (which are used to identify e.g., TCP connections) and\n   locators which are
    used to forward packets in the routing system.\n   Such a separation has an impact
    on the current use of IP address in\n   the application layer.\n\n   This document
    presents these issues for the purposes of stimulating\n   discussions.\n\t </p>\n
