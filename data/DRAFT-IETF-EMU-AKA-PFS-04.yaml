abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many different attacks have been reported as part of revelations\n
    \  associated with pervasive surveillance.  Some of the reported attacks\n   involved
    compromising smart cards, such as attacking SIM card\n   manufacturers and operators
    in an effort to compromise shared secrets\n   stored on these cards.  Since the
    publication of those reports,\n   manufacturing and provisioning processes have
    gained much scrutiny\n   and have improved.  However, the danger of resourceful
    attackers for\n   these systems is still a concern.\n\n   This specification is
    an optional extension to the EAP-AKA'\n   authentication method which was defined
    in [I-D.ietf-emu-rfc5448bis].\n   The extension, when negotiated, provides Perfect
    Forward Secrecy for\n   the session key generated as a part of the authentication
    run in EAP-\n   AKA'.  This prevents an attacker who has gained access to the
    long-\n   term pre-shared secret in a SIM card from being able to decrypt any\n
    \  past communications.  In addition, if the attacker stays merely a\n   passive
    eavesdropper, the extension prevents attacks against future\n   sessions.  This
    forces attackers to use active attacks instead.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
