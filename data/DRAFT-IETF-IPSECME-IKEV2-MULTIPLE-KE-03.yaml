abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to extend the Internet Key Exchange\n
    \  Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) to allow multiple key exchanges to take\n   place
    while computing a shared secret during a Security Association\n   (SA) setup.
    \ The primary application of this feature in IKEv2 is the\n   ability to perform
    one or more post-quantum key exchanges in\n   conjunction with the classical (Elliptic
    Curve) Diffie-Hellman key\n   exchange, so that the resulting shared key is resistant
    against\n   quantum computer attacks.  Another possible application is the\n   ability
    to combine several key exchanges in situations when no single\n   key exchange
    algorithm is trusted by both initiator and responder.\n\n   This document updates
    RFC7296 by renaming a transform type 4 from\n   \"Diffie-Hellman Group (D-H)\"
    to \"Key Exchange Method (KE)\" and\n   renaming a field in the Key Exchange Payload
    from \"Diffie-Hellman\n   Group Num\" to \"Key Exchange Method\".  It also renames
    an IANA\n   registry for this transform type from \"Transform Type 4 - Diffie-\n
    \  Hellman Group Transform IDs\" to \"Transform Type 4 - Key Exchange\n   Method
    Transform IDs\".  These changes generalize key exchange\n   algorithms that can
    be used in IKEv2.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
