abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a few changes to cookies inspired by
    the\n   properties of the HTTP State Tokens mechanism proposed in\n   [I-D.west-http-state-tokens].
    \ First, cookies should be treated as\n   \"SameSite=Lax\" by default.  Second,
    cookies that explicitly assert\n   \"SameSite=None\" in order to enable cross-site
    delivery should also be\n   marked as \"Secure\".  Third, same-site should take
    the scheme of the\n   sites into account.  Fourth, cookies should respect schemes.
    \ Fifth,\n   cookies associated with non-secure schemes should be removed at the\n
    \  end of a user's session.  Sixth, the definition of a session should\n   be
    tightened.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
