abstract:
  content: "<p>Although the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) needs no specialmechanism
    to enable network services and applications, in complexarchitectures, feature
    composition and service invocation becomeunmanageable without a mechanism for
    specifying the services that areassociated with routes. This draft introduces
    distributed applicationarchitectures that span multiple administrative domains
    and proposesthe use of ServiceCodes in SIP to allow service providers to composechains
    of features across application servers.</p>"
