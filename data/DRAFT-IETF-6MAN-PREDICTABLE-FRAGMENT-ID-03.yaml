abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 specifies the Fragment Header, which is employed for the\n
    \  fragmentation and reassembly mechanisms.  The Fragment Header\n   contains
    an \"Identification\" field which, together with the IPv6\n   Source Address and
    the IPv6 Destination Address of a packet,\n   identifies fragments that correspond
    to the same original datagram,\n   such that they can be reassembled together
    at the receiving host.\n   The only requirement for setting the \"Identification\"
    value is that\n   it must be different than that employed for any other fragmented\n
    \  packet sent recently with the same Source Address and Destination\n   Address.
    \ Some implementations use a simple global counter for\n   setting the Identification
    field, thus leading to predictable values.\n   This document analyzes the security
    implications of predictable\n   Identification values, and provides implementation
    guidance for\n   selecting the Identification field of the Fragment Header, such
    that\n   the aforementioned security implications are mitigated.\n\n\t </p>\n
