abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Is the concept of Domain Names owned by the DNS protocol or
    does the\n   DNS protocol exist to support the concept of Domain Names?  This\n
    \  question has become pertinent in light of proposals to use Domain\n   Names
    in protocols in ways incompatible with the DNS protocol and the\n   operational
    environment built to run the protocol.\n\n   This document is intended to help
    answer this question by presenting\n   a look into the recorded history of relevant
    Requests for Comments.\n   This document comprises the research and views of the
    author and has\n   benefited from review and input from many IETF experts, but
    it does\n   not represent the consensus opinion of the IETF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
