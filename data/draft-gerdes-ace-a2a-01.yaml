abstract:
- content: "<p>Constrained nodes are devices which are limited in terms of processing
    power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission capacity. Due to these constraints,
    commonly used security protocols are not easily applicable. Nevertheless, an authentication
    and authorization solution is needed to ensure the security of these devices.
    During the lifecycle of a constrained device, responsibility for managing authorization
    policies for the constrained device may change several times. To ensure the security
    of the constrained devices, the authorization to authorize must be transferred
    to the new principal in a secure way. Resource-constrained nodes benefit from
    delegating defined authentication- and authorization-related tasks to less-constrained
    devices called Authorization Managers, thus limiting the hardware requirements
    of the security solution for the constrained devices. This document defines how
    security relationships between constrained nodes and their Authorization Managers
    can be established and managed in a RESTful way, thus providing for a flexible
    authorization solution for the whole lifecycle of a constrained node.</p>"
