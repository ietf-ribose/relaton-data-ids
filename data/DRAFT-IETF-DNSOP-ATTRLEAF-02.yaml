abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Formally, any DNS \"RR\" may occur for any domain name.  However
    some\n   services have defined an operational convention that applies to DNS\n
    \  leaf nodes that have a reserved node name, beginning with an\n   underscore.
    \ The underscore construct is used to define a semantic\n   scope for DNS records
    that are associated with the parent domain.\n   This specification explores the
    nature of this DNS usage and defines\n   the \"DNS Global Underscore Scoped Entry
    Registry\" registry with IANA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
