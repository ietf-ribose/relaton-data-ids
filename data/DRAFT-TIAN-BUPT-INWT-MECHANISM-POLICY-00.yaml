abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes INT-path, a cost-effective network-wide\n
    \  telemetry framework based on INT(In-band Network Telemetry), by\n   decoupling
    the network monitoring system into a routing mechanism and\n   a routing path
    generation policy.  INT-path embed SR(Source Routing)\n   into INT probes to allow
    specifying the route that the probe packet\n   takes through the network.  Above
    this probing path control\n   mechanism, an Euler trail-based path planning policy
    is developed to\n   generate non-overlapped INT paths that cover the entire network
    with\n   a minimum path member, reducing the overall telemetry overhead.  INT-\n
    \  path is very suitable for deployment in data center networks thanks\n   to
    their symmetric topologies.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
