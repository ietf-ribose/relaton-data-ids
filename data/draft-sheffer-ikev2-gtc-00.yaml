abstract:
  content: "<p>Despite many years of effort, simple username-password authenticationis
    still prevalent. In many cases a password is the only credentialavailable to the
    end user. IKEv2 uses EAP as a sub-protocol for userauthentication. This provides
    a well-specified and extensiblearchitecture. To this day EAP does not provide
    a simple password-based authentication method. The only existing passwordauthentication
    methods either require the peer to know the passwordin advance (EAP-MD5), or are
    needlessly complex when used withinIKEv2 (e.g. PEAP). This document codifies the
    common practice ofusing EAP-GTC for this type of authentication, with the goal
    ofachieving maximum interoperability. The various security issues areextensively
    analyzed.</p>"
