abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       Record Route is a useful administrative tool that has been
    used\n       extensively by the service providers. However, when TE links are\n
    \      bundled, identification of label resource in Record Route object\n       (RRO)
    is not sufficient to determine the component link within a TE\n       link that
    is being used by a given LSP. In other words, when link\n       bundling is used,
    resource recording requires mechanisms to specify\n       the component link identifier,
    along with the TE link identifier and\n       Label. As it is not possible to
    record component link in the RRO,\n       this document defines the extensions
    to RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and\n       [RFC3473] to specify component link identifiers
    for resource\n       recording purposes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
