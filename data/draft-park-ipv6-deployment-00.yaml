- content: "<p>This document presents a new configuration of EUI-64 format through
    defined Device ID for identification and characteristic of all Devices in unmanaged
    network especially 'Home network'. Because of configured Device ID, all Devices
    in network must be classified and communicated each other. The main purpose of
    this document is to deploy IPv6 easily and widely.</p>"
