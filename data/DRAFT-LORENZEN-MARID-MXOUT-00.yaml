abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document offers a recommended standardized FQDN (Fully
    \n   Qualified   Domain Name) naming convention pattern for servers \n   used
    to send outbound internet email. \n      \n   The purpose is to allow inbound
    internet email servers to \n   recognize outbound email servers designated as
    authorized or  \n   unauthorized by those in control of DNS for the sending server
    \n   IP addresses.\n\t </p>\n      "
