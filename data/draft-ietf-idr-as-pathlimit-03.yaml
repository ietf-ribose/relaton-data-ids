abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the 'AS path limit' (AS_PATHLIMIT) path attribute
    for BGP. This is an optional, transitive path attribute that is designed to help
    limit the distribution of routing information in the Internet. By default, prefixes
    advertised into the BGP graph are distributed freely, and if not blocked by policy
    will propagate globally. This is harmful to the scalability of the routing subsystem
    since information that only has a local effect on routing will cause state creation
    throughout the default-free zone. This attribute can be attached to a particular
    path to limit its scope to a subset of the Internet.</p>"
