abstract:
- content: "<p>The design of scheduling data amongst multiple asynchronous paths impacts
    the performance of multipath transport protocols. This draft proposes a path-aware
    scheduling scheme, which adaptively selects the most suitable scheduling scheme
    according to the path characteristics in a time-variant multipath transport scenario.
    When the path characteristics are unknown, the redundant mode is employed to achieve
    at least as good performance as that of the best single path. The condition for
    choosing the most suitable scheduling mode relies on the measured path characteristics
    and the application requirements. Especially, the path-aware scheduling scheme
    is designed in this draft in terms of of the delay difference of multiple paths,
    compared with a pre-defined delay threshold.</p>"
