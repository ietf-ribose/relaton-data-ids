abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the usage and applicability of BGP MPLS-based
    Ethernet VPN (EVPN) in a simple and fairly common deployment scenario. The different
    EVPN procedures are explained in the example scenario along with the benefits
    and trade-offs of each option. This document is intended to provide a simplified
    guide for the deployment of EVPN networks.</p>"
