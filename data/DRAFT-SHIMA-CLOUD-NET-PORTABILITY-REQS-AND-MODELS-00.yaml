abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Recent progress of virtual machine technology made it possible
    to\nhost various Internet service nodes in a so called cloud environment.\nThe
    virtual machine hosting technology provides a method to migrate a\nvirtual machine
    from one hypervisor to another.  However, such a\ntechnology is mainly focusing
    on a migration between hypervisors\nattached to the same link, and tend not to
    consider migration over\nthe Internet.  This document mentions the purpose of
    that type of\noperation and describe several possible operation methods to provide\nnetwork
    portability in cloud systems.\n\t </p>\n      "
