abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates the generalized MANET packet/message
    format,\n   specified in RFC5444, by providing prescriptive guidelines for how\n
    \  protocols can use that packet/message format.  In particular, these\n   mandatory
    guidelines prohibit a number of uses of RFC5444 that have\n   been suggested in
    various proposals, and which would have lead to\n   interoperability problems,
    to impediment of protocol extension\n   development, and to inability to use generic
    RFC5444 parsers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
