abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Transport layer mobility management is presented in addition to\nMobile
    IP for providing seamless mobility in the Internet.  By use of\nSCTP (Stream Control
    Transmission Protocol) and some of its currently\nproposed extensions a seamless
    handover can be fully accomplished in\nthe mobile client without any provisions
    in the network, only\nassisted by functions embedded in Mobile SCTP enabled servers.\nClient
    mobility management based on Mobile SCTP seems not to require\nany new protocol
    development.  It is a particular application of SCTP\neventually solving the requirements
    of transport layer mobility in\nthe Internet.\n\t </p>\n      "
