abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     SONAR is a service which, when presented with a list of Internet\nProtocol
    addresses, attempts to order that list according to the\nproximity from the SONAR
    server to each address.  Given multiple\nlocations for a network accessible resource,
    SONAR is designed to help\nnetworked applications make a reasonable choice between
    those\nalternatives.  This memo describes the SONAR protocol as well as an\nexperimental
    implementation of the SONAR service.\n \n     While the name 'SONAR' is intended
    as a pun on the 'ping' utility\nthat uses ICMP echo requests to verify network
    connectivity, the SONAR\nservice does not specify use of any particular means
    of estimating\nnetwork proximity.  To the contrary, the design of SONAR assumes
    that\nthe best means of estimating network proximity will change over time and\nperhaps
    from one network location to another.  The SONAR protocol is\nintended to provide
    a stable interface for applications that need to\nmeasure network proximity, thus
    allowing proximity measurement\nalgorithms to evolve separately from those applications.\n\n\t
