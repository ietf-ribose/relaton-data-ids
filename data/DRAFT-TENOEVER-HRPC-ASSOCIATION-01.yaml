abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document aims to scope the relation between Internet protocols\n
    \  and the rights to freedom of assembly and association.  The Internet\n   increasingly
    mediates our lives and our ability to excercise human\n   rights.  Since Internet
    protocols play a central role in the\n   management, development and use of the
    Internet, the relation between\n   the mentioned rights should be documented and
    adverse impacts should\n   be mitigated.  As there have been methods of protest
    on the Internet\n   -a form of freedom of assembly- that have proven to be harmful
    to\n   connectivity and infrastructure, such as DDoS attacks, this text aims\n
    \  to document forms of protest, association and assembly that do not\n   have
    a negative impact on the Internet infrastructure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
