abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an abstract model for high assurance\n
    \  cryptographic modules.  It defines the relevant terminology and high-\n   level
    descriptions of the types of services and operations offered by\n   such modules.
    \ The goal is to provide a common vocabulary for\n   discussing the programming
    of high assurance modules.\n\n   Comments are solicited and should be addressed
    to the mailing list at\n   cicm@ietf.org.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
