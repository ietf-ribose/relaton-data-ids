abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo reclassifies ECT(1) to be an early notification of\n
    \  congestion on ECT(0) marked packets, which can be used by AQM\n   algorithms
    and transports as an earlier signal of congestion than CE.\n   It is a simple,
    transparent, and backward compatible upgrade to\n   existing IETF-approved AQMs,
    RFC3168, and nearly all congestion\n   control algorithms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
