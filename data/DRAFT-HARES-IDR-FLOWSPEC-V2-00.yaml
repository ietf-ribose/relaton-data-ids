abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP flow specification version 1 (RFC5575) describes the distribution\n
    \  of traffic filter policy (traffic filters and actions) which are\n   distributed
    via BGP to BGP peers.  Three applications utilize this\n   traffic filter policy:
    (1) mitigation of Denial of Service (DoS), (2)\n   enabling of traffic filtering
    in BGP/MPLS VPNS, and (3)centralized\n   traffic control for networks with SDN
    or NFV controllers.\n   Application of centralized traffic utilizing BGP Flow
    Specification\n   traffic filters may need user-ordered filters rather than RFC5575's\n
    \  strict ordering of filters and defined ordering of actions.\n\n   This document
    proposes a new BGP Flow specification version 2 that\n   supports user-order of
    filters and actions plus allowing more actions\n\n\t </p>\n      "
