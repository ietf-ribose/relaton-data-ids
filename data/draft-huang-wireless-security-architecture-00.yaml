abstract:
  content: <p>After analysis and comparison of domestic and international wireless
    network secure schemes and standards, security threats for heterogeneous wireless
    network are investigated in theory and practice. According to the comprehensive
    summing-up of current secure standards' application, existing secure vulnerabilities
    and secure hidden troubles which may happen in future, "network layered,security
    classified and trusted domain departed" secure standard model is proposed, and
    corresponding standards for heterogeneous wireless network security architecture
    are also put forward.</p>
