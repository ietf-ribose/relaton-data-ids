abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There are times when pseudowires must be transported over physicallinks
    with limited bandwidth. We shall use the term \"bonding\" (alsovariously known
    as inverse multiplexing, link aggregation, trunking,teaming, etc.) to mean an
    efficient mechanism for separating the PWtraffic over several links. Unlike load
    balancing and equal costmultipath, bonding makes no assumption that the PW traffic
    can bedecomposed into distinguishable flows, and thus bonding requiresdelay compensation
    and packet reordering. Furthermore, PW bondingcan optionally track bandwidth constraints
    in order to minimizepacket loss.</p>"
