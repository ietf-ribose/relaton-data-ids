abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Test Automation is a process that is being adopted by vendors\naggresively
    to broaden the scope for testing. Automation\nof testing of L2/L3 devices can
    also enable faster and 'always on'\nmode of test environment in the Test labs,
    thus maximizing usage of\nlab infrastructure, round the clock, without human intervention.\nMore
    often than not, lack of standards, can cause an automation\narchitecture to go
    awry and the cost of the same could be catastrophic.\nHence this informational
    draft endeavours to bring forth a standard\nframework for automation, which can
    be referred to, by test teams of\nvarious network equipment vendors and users.\n\t
