abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a secure method to configure/reconfigure
    a key\n   for a resource constrained node when it initially joins to network\n
    \  that is currently in operation. The method is suited for a scenario,\n   where
    resource constrained nodes are interconnected with each other\n   and thus form
    a network called Internet of Things. It is assumed that\n   communications for
    all nodes are based on TCP/IP protocols and the\n   nodes use the constrained
    application protocol (CoAP). The presented\n   method does not cover all operations
    of secure bootstrapping for IoT\n   networks, but it is intended to securely support
    self-reconfiguration\n   of the pre-installed temporary key of joined node.\n\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
