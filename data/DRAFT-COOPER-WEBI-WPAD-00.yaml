abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A mechanism is needed to permit web clients to locate nearby\n(caching)
    web proxy. Current best practice is for end users to hand\nconfigure their web
    client (i.e., browser) with the URL of an 'auto\nconfiguration file'. In large
    environments this presents a\nformidable support problem.  It would be much more
    manageable for\nthe web client software to automatically learn the configuration\ninformation
    for its web proxy settings. This is typically referred\nto as a resource discovery
    problem.\n\t </p>\n      "
