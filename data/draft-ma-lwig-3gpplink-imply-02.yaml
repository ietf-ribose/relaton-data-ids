abstract:
- content: "<p>In 3GPP Release 12, the work item Machine Type Communication (MTC)
    is specifying low cost terminals for Machine to Machine communications. Since
    IETF has already developed a suite of protocols for device communication, it is
    useful to analyze the limitation of 3GPP MTC and the impact on the implementation
    of IETF protocol suite. This document analyzes the feature of 3GPP MTC and the
    impact on light weight protocol implementation for the MTC terminals.</p>"
