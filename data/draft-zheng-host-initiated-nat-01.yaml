abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document presents a new method to implement the NAT function,which
    requires the cooperating of the hosts and the NAT gateway. Theproposed NAT mechanism
    is called Host-initiated NAT, or HI-NAT forshort. Traditional NAT function is
    performed in the gateway, whilethe hosts are not aware of the address translation
    at all. Onedrawback of such mechanism is that all translation works need to bedone
    in one device, the NAT gateway, which may bring performancebottleneck. The presented
    HI-NAT mechanism shows another possiblesolution to improve network performance
    by the cooperating of thehosts and the Gateway. In more details, the hosts will
    initiate theNAT procedure with its local IP address. After getting the translatedIP
    address, the hosts will use it in every packet sending out to easethe translating
    workload of the NAT gateway.</p>"
