abstract:
  content: <p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) requires that messages are
    transmitted at regular intervals and provides a way to negotiate the interval
    used by BFD peers. Some BFD implementations may be restricted to only support
    several interval values. When such BFD implementations speak to each other, there
    is a possibility of two sides not being able to find a common value for the interval
    to run BFD sessions. This document defines a small set of interval values for
    BFD that we call "Common Intervals", and recommends implementations to support
    the defined intervals. This solves the problem of finding an interval value that
    both BFD speakers can support while allowing a simplified implementation as seen
    for hardware-based BFD. It does not restrict an implementation from supporting
    more intervals in addition to the Common Intervals.</p>
