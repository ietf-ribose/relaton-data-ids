abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Operations, Administration and Maintenance is an integral part
    of\n   transport connections, hence it is required that Operations,\n   Administration
    and Maintenance functions are activated/deactivated in\n   sync with connection
    commissioning/decommissioning; avoiding spurious\n   alarms and ensuring consistent
    operation.  In certain technologies,\n   Operations, Administration and Maintenance
    entities are inherently\n   established once the connection is set up, while other
    technologies\n   require extra configuration to establish and configure Operations,\n
    \  Administration and Maintenance entities.  This document specifies\n   extensions
    to RSVP-TE to support the establishment and configuration\n   of Operations, Administration
    and Maintenance entities along with\n   Label Switched Path signaling.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
