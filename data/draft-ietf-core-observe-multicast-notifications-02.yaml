abstract:
- content: <p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) allows clients to "observe"
    resources at a server, and receive notifications as unicast responses upon changes
    of the resource state. In some use cases, such as based on publish-subscribe,
    it would be convenient for the server to send a single notification addressed
    to all the clients observing a same target resource. This document updates RFC7252
    and RFC7641, and defines how a server sends observe notifications as response
    messages over multicast, synchronizing all the observers of a same resource on
    a same shared Token value. Besides, this document defines how Group OSCORE can
    be used to protect multicast notifications end-to-end between the server and the
    observer clients.</p>
