abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this draft, we discuss the challenges and requirements related
    to\n   migration, mobility, and interconnection of Virtual Machines (VMs)and\n
    \  Virtual Network Elements (VNEs).  We also describe the limitations of\n   various
    types of virtual local area networking (VLAN) and virtual\n   private networking
    (VPN) techniques that are traditionally expected\n   to support such migration,
    mobility, and interconnections.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
