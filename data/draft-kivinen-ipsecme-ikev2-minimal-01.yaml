abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes minimal version of the Internet Key Exchange
    version 2 (IKEv2) protocol. IKEv2 is a component of IPsec used for performing
    mutual authentication and establishing and maintaining Security Associations (SAs).
    IKEv2 includes several optional features, which are not needed in minimal implementations.
    This document describes what is required from the minimal implementation, and
    also describes various optimizations which can be done. The protocol described
    here is compliant with full IKEv2 with exception that this document only describes
    shared secret authentication (IKEv2 requires support for certificate authentication
    in addition to shared secret authentication). This document does not update or
    modify RFC 5996, but provides more compact description of the minimal version
    of the protocol. If this document and RFC 5996 conflicts then RFC 5996 is the
    authoritative description.</p>"
