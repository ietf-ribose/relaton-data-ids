abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is an HTTP authentication\n
    \  method with credentials that are not vulnerable to simple phishing\n   attacks,
    and that does not require a server-side password database.\n   It is an alternative
    to HTTP authentication that requires passwords\n   and all the negative attributes
    that come with password-based\n   systems.  HOBA can be integrated with account
    management and other\n   applications running over HTTP and supports portability,
    so a user\n   can associate more than one device or origin-bound certificate with\n
    \  the same service.  HOBA has many other useful features such as a\n   mechanism
    to handle state-loss if one of a user's credentials is lost\n   and a logout mechanism.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
