abstract:
- content: <p>When security risks are discovered by independent security researchers,
    they often lack the channels to disclose them properly. As a result, security
    issues may be left unreported. This document defines a standard ("security.txt")
    to help organizations describe the process for security researchers to follow
    in order to disclose security vulnerabilities securely.</p>
