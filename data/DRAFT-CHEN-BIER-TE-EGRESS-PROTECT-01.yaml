abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for fast protection against
    the\n   failure of an egress node of an explicit point to multipoint (P2MP)\n
    \  multicast path/tree in a \"Bit Index Explicit Replication\" (BIER)\n   Traffic
    Engineering (TE) domain.  It does not have any per-flow state\n   in the core
    of the domain.  For a multicast packet to the egress\n   node, when the egress
    node fails, its upstream hop as a PLR sends the\n   packet to the egress' backup
    node once the PLR detects the failure.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
