abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Formally, any DNS resource record may occur for any domain
    name.\n   However some services have defined an operational convention that\n
    \  applies to DNS leaf nodes that are under a DNS branch that has one or\n   more
    reserved node names that begin with an underscore.  The\n   underscore naming
    construct defines a semantic scope for DNS records\n   that are associated with
    the parent domain, above the underscored\n   branch.  This specification explores
    the nature of this DNS usage and\n   defines the \"DNS Global Underscore Scoped
    Entry Registry\" with IANA.\n   The purpose of the Underscore registry is to avoid
    collisions\n   resulting from the use of the same underscore-based name, for\n
    \  different services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
