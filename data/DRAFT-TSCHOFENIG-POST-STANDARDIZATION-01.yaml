abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Advancements in the design of web browsers have introduced\n
    \  fundamental changes to the architecture of application protocols.\n   The widespread
    availability and growing sophistication of JavaScript\n   interpreters in browsers
    enables web servers to push to browsers all\n   of the application logic required
    to implement a client-server\n   protocol.  Consequently, many client-server applications
    that once\n   required an installed client on a host computer now can rely simply\n
    \  on a modern browser to act as a client for the purposes of a\n   particular
    application.  For example, where once email clients\n   required a custom application
    to access an inbox, increasingly a web\n   browser can serve this purpose as well
    as the purpose-built\n   applications of the past.  Similarly, HTTP with the assistance
    of\n   JavaScript can subsume the functions performed by the protocols like\n
    \  POP3 and IMAP.  The need for Internet standards beyond HTTP to\n   implement
    an email inbox application consequently diminishes - why\n   author standards
    and worry about interoperability of clients and\n   servers when the server can
    simply push to the client all the code it\n   needs to be interoperable?\n\n   Many
    client-server applications on the Internet could potential\n   migrate to this
    code distribution methodology.\n\n   [Note: A separate mailing list has been created
    for discussions\n   related to this document and it can be found here:\n   https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/webapps
