abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This paper is the product of the W3C URI Interest Group.  It\naddresses
    and attempts to clarify two issues pertaining to URIs, and\npresents recommendations.
    \ Section 1 addresses how URI space is\npartitioned and the relationship between
    URIs, URLs, and URNs.\nSection 2 describes how URI schemes and URN namespace ids
    are\nregistered.  Section 3 mentions additional unresolved issues not\nconsidered
    by this paper and section 4 presents recommendations.\nQuestions concerning this
    document should be directed to the\nuri@w3.org mailing list.\n\t </p>\n      "
