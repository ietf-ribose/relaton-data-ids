abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It has become clear that many users would like to use the DNS\n
    \  resolution system for names which do not have meaning in the global\n   context
    but do have meaning in a context internal to their network.\n   This document
    reserves the string \".internal\" for this purpose.\n\n   [ Ed note: Text inside
    square brackets ([]) is additional background\n   information, answers to frequently
    asked questions, general musings,\n   etc.  They will be removed before publication.
    \ RFC Editor: Please\n   remove these before publication. ]\n\n   [ This document
    is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-internal.
    \ The most\n   recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be\n
    \  available here.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]\n\n   [ Ed
    note: This document is intended to drive discussion.  It is\n   clear that there
    has been a desire for an \"RFC 1918-style\" TLD for a\n   long time; in its absence,
    people have just started using whatever\n   seemed convenient.  This document
    requests that the allocation of\n   .internal for this use.  There is no existing
    process for this - some\n   of the purpose of this document is to explore the
    process\n   implications. ]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
