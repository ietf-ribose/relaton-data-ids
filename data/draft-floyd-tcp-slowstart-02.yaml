abstract:
  content: "<p>This note describes an optional modification for TCP's slow-start foruse
    with TCP connections with large congestion windows. For TCPconnections that are
    able to use congestion windows of thousands (ortens of thousands) of MSS-sized
    segments (for MSS the sender'sMAXIMUM SEGMENT SIZE), the current slow-start procedure
    can result inincreasing the congestion window by thousands of segments in a singleround-trip
    time. Such an increase can easily result in thousands ofpackets being dropped
    in one round-trip time. This is often counter-productive for the TCP flow itself,
    and is also hard on the rest ofthe traffic sharing the congested link. This note
    describes LimitedSlow-Start as an optional mechanism for limiting the number ofsegments
    by which the congestion window is increased for one windowof data during slow-start,
    in order to improve performance for TCPconnections with large congestion windows.</p>"
