abstract:
- content: "<p>It is a common practice for multiple interface terminals to use a connection
    manager to perform provisioning domain selection and interface configuration.
    The concept of connection managers for personal computers is well known, and similar
    logic is now common in mobile phones that have multiple radio interfaces [3GPP
    TS 23.402]. The Problem Statement document highlights the lack of standardized
    behavior for terminals in regard to managing multiple interfaces and their respective
    properties. To address this issue, this document proposes a set of functional
    requirements for a generic MIF Connection Manager.</p>"
