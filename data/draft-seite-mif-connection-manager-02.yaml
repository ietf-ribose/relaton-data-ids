abstract:
  content: "<p>It is a common practice for multiple interface terminals to use aconnection
    manager to perform provisioning domain selection andinterface configuration. The
    concept of connection managers forpersonal computers is well known, and similar
    logic is now common inmobile phones that have multiple radio interfaces [3GPP
    TS 23.402].The Problem Statement document highlights the lack of standardizedbehavior
    for terminals in regard to managing multiple interfaces andtheir respective properties.
    To address this issue, this documentproposes a set of functional requirements
    for a generic MIFConnection Manager.</p>"
