abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) are a means by which
    devices\n   can establish expectations about how they are intended to behave,
    and\n   how the network should treat them.  Earlier work focused on access\n   control.
    \ This draft specifies a means by which manufacturers can\n   express to deployments
    what form of bandwidth profile devices are\n   expected to have with respect to
    specific services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
