abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification\n
    \  is an HTTP based protocol that makes managing identities in multi-\n   domain
    scenarios easier to support through a standardized service.\n   Examples include
    but are not limited to enterprise to cloud service\n   providers, and inter-cloud
    based scenarios.  This specification\n   extends the SCIM Protocol to include
    support for HTTP SEARCH.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
