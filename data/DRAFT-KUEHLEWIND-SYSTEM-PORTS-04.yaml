abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number
    Registry,\n   a large number of System Ports is currently assigned to individuals\n
    \  or companies who have registered the port for the use with a certain\n   protocol
    before RFC6335 was published.  For some of these ports, RFCs\n   exist that describe
    the respective protocol; for others, RFCs are\n   under development that define,
    re-define, or assign the protocol used\n   for the respective port, e.g. in case
    of so-far unused UDP ports that\n   have been registered together with the respective
    TCP port.  In these\n   cases the IESG has the change control about the protocol
    used on the\n   port (as described in an RFC) but does not have the change control\n
    \  about the port usage itself.  Currently, to transfer the change\n   control
    to the IESG, the original assignee has to be contacted to\n   initialize this
    transfer.  As it is not always possible to get in\n   touch with the original
    assignee, e.g. because of out-dated contact\n   information or other reasons,
    and the current practice of case-by-\n   case changes does not scale well, this
    document instructs IANA to\n   perform actions with the goal to reassigns all
    System Ports to the\n   IESG that have been assigned to individuals prior to the
    publication\n   of RFC6335.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
