abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Domain Name System Resource Records are identified in part
    by their\n   class.  The class field is not effective, and it is not used the
    way\n   it appears to have been intended.  This memo closes the DNS class\n   registry
    and requires those defining new RRTYPEs to define them for\n   all classes.\n\n\t
