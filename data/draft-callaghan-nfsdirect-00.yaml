abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The RDMA transport for ONC RPC supports direct data placement for
    NFSdata. Direct data placement not only reduces the amount of data thatneeds to
    be copied in an NFS call, but allows much of the datamovement over the network
    to be implemented in RDMA hardware. Thisdraft describes the use of direct data
    placement by means of server-initiated RDMA Writes into client-supplied buffers
    in a Write listfor implementations of NFS versions 2, 3, and 4 over an RDMAtransport.</p>"
