abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DHCPv6 Prefix Pool option provides a mechanism for DHCPv6
    Prefix\n   Delegation (DHCPv6-PD), allowing the DHCPv6 server to notify a DHCPv6\n
    \  relay agent implemented on a Provider Edge (PE) router about active\n   prefix
    pools allocated by the DHCPv6 server to the PE router.  The\n   information of
    active prefix pools can be used to enforce IPv6 route\n   aggregation on the PE
    router by adding or removing aggregated routes\n   according to the status of
    the prefix pools.  The advertising of the\n   aggregated routes in the routing
    protocol enabled on the network-\n   facing interface of PE routers will dramatically
    decreases the number\n   of the routing table entries in the ISP network.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
