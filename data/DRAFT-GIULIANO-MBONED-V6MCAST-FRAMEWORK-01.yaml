abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an architectural framework for deploying\ninterdomain
    multicast for IPv6 with simplicity, scalability,\nefficiency and security as the
    primary goals, applying the lessons\nlearned from deploying IPv4 multicast. In
    order to achieve this\nobjective, the deprecation of network-based source discovery,
    and\ntherefore Any Source Multicast, is proposed.  Source-Specific\nMulticast
    is proposed as the service model supported for deploying\ninterdomain IPv6 multicast.
    \ The architectural components responsible\nfor providing source discovery are
    also discussed.\n\t </p>\n      "
