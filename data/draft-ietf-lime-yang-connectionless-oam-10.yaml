abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a base YANG Data model for connectionless Operations
    Administration, and Maintenance(OAM) protocols. It provides a technology-independent
    abstraction of key OAM constructs for connectionless protocols. The base model
    presented here can be extended to include technology specific details. This is
    leading to uniformity between OAM protocols and support both nested OAM workflows
    (i.e., performing OAM functions at different or same levels through a unified
    interface) and interacting OAM workflows ( i.e., performing OAM functions at same
    levels through a unified interface).</p>"
