abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a new Hop-by-Hop IPv6 option that is
    used to\n   record the minimum Path MTU along the forward path between a source\n
    \  to a destination host.  This collects a minimum recorded MTU along\n   the
    path to the destination.  The value can then be communicated back\n   to the source
    using the return Path MTU field in the option.\n\n   This Hop-by-Hop option is
    intended to be used in environments like\n   Data Centers and on paths between
    Data Centers, to allow them to\n   better take advantage of paths able to support
    a large Path MTU.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
