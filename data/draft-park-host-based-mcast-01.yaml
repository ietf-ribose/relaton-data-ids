abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies an extension to the multicast addressingarchitecture
    of the IPv6 protocol. The extension allows for singinterface-ID to allocate multicast
    addresses. When the link-localunicast address is configured at each interface
    of host, interfaceID is uniquely determined. By delegating multicast addresses
    atthe same time as interface ID, each host can identify theirmulticast addresses
    automatically at Layer 1 without needing to runan intra- or inter-domain allocation
    protocol in the serverlessenvironments.</p>"
