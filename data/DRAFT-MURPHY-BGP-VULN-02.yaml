abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>BGP, along with a host of other infrastructure protocols designed
    before the Internet environment became perilous, was originally designed with
    little consideration for protection of the information it carries. There are no
    mechanisms internal to the BGP protocol to protect against attacks that modify,
    delete, forge, or replay data, any of which has the potential to disrupt overall
    network routing behavior.\nThis internet draft discusses some of the security
    issues with BGP\nrouting data dissemination.  This internet draft does not discuss\nsecurity
    issues with forwarding of packets.\n\t </p>\n      "
