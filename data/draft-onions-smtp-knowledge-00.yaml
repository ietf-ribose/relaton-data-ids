abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a number of folklore issues associated with the
    SMTP protocol and attempts to tie down some loose ends. This document is an extension
    to RFC-821 and its extensions, not a replacement. This document is for information
    and does not set any standard. It indicates what is correct, what is pragmatic,
    and what is religious.</p>"
