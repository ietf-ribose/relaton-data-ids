abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing Transport Network Aware Mobility for 5G [TN-AWARE- MOBILITY]
    draft specifies a framework for mapping the 5G mobile systems Slice and Service
    Types (SSTs) to corresponding underlying network paths in IP and Layer 2 Transport
    networks.The focus of that work is limited to the mobility domain and transport
    network characteristics till the UPF and doesn't go beyond the UPF to the Data
    Network. To maintain E2E transport network characteristics the framework needs
    to be extended beyond UPF. This document describes a framework for extending the
    mobility aware transport network characteristics from the UPF through the Data
    Network.</p>"
