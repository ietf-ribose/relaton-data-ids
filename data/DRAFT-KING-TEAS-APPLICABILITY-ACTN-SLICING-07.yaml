abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network abstraction is a technique that can be applied to a
    network\n   domain that utilizes a set of policies to select network resources\n
    \  and obtain a view of potential connectivity across the network.\n\n   Network
    slicing is an approach to network operations that builds on\n   the concept of
    network abstraction to provide programmability,\n   flexibility, and modularity.
    \ It may use techniques such as Software\n   Defined Networking (SDN) and Network
    Function Virtualization (NFV) to\n   create multiple logical or virtual networks,
    each tailored for a set\n   of services share the same set of requirements.\n\n
    \  Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) is\n   described
    in RFC 8453.  It defines an SDN-based architecture that\n   relies on the concept
    of network and service abstraction to detach\n   network and service control from
    the underlying data plane.\n\n   This document outlines the applicability of ACTN
    to transport network\n   slicing in a Traffic Engineering (TE) network that utilizes
    IETF\n   technology.  It also identifies the features of network slicing not\n
    \  currently within the scope of ACTN, and indicates where ACTN might be\n   extended.\n\n\t
