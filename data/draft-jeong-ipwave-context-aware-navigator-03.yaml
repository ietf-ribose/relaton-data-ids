abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a Context-Aware Navigation Protocol (CNP) for
    IP-based vehicular networks for cooperative navigation among vehicles in road
    networks. This CNP aims at the enhancement of driving safety through a light-weight
    driving information sharing method. The CNP protocol uses an IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
    (ND) option to convey driving information such as a vehicle's position, speed,
    acceleration/deceleration, and direction, and a driver's driving action (e.g.,
    braking and accelerating).</p>"
