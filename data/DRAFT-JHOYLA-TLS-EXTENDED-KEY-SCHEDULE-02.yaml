abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TLS 1.3 is sometimes used in situations where it is necessary
    to\n   inject extra key material into the handshake.  This draft aims to\n   describe
    methods for doing so securely.  This key material must be\n   injected in such
    a way that both parties agree on what is being\n   injected and why, and further,
    in what order.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
