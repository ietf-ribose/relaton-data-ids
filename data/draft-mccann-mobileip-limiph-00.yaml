abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There are currently a number of proposals for different mechanismsintended
    to reduce the overhead of IP mobility management. Generallyspeaking, the goal
    of these proposals is twofold: first, to reducethe latency or interruption due
    to handoffs; and second, to reducethe signaling load on the Mobile IP Home Agent
    (and CorrespondentNodes, for the case of Mobile IPv6). These techniques are meant
    toimprove the performance of real-time applications like voice orvideo over IP
    over wireless networks. By minimizing the period ofinterruption during a handoff
    from one point of attachment toanother, the proposals attempt to minimize packet
    loss when theseevents occur. This draft argues that the best solution to thisproblem
    is a 'transparent' one that requires no changes to theMobile IP clients in mobile
    nodes and that gives control overrouting functionality to the operator of a wireless
    network. Wereview some of the existing proposals and describe in detail a newproposal
    that can provide for low interruption handoffs in a moretransparent manner.</p>"
