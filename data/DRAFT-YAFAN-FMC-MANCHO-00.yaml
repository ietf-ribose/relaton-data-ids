abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the use of SIP between the dual mode handset\n(DMH)
    and the mobility SIP proxy to enable network controlled\nhandovers across voice
    over IP (VoIP) and cellular networks.  The\nmobility SIP proxy has a peering relationship
    with the cellular\nnetwork.  Mobile assisted and network controlled handovers
    require\nthe exchange of cellular radio parameters between the DMH and the\nmobility
    SIP proxy.  The set of cellular related parameters is\ncollectively called Session
    Handover Protocol (SHP).  The SHP is a\nresidual protocol of SIP, where all of
    its messages are transported\nas MIME attachment to SIP messages.\n\nThis document
    describes the requirements, various SIP message flows\nfor cross-domain roaming
    and bidirectional handovers between VoIP and\ncellular domains, and detailed specification
    of the residual SHP\nprotocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
