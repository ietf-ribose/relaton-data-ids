abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is hard to adjust traffic and optimize traffic paths on
    a\n   traditional IP network from time to time through manual\n   configurations.
    \ It is desirable to have an automatic mechanism for\n   setting up routing policies,
    which adjust traffic and optimize\n   traffic paths automatically.  This document
    describes BGP Extensions\n   for Routing Policy Distribution (BGP RPD) to support
    this.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
