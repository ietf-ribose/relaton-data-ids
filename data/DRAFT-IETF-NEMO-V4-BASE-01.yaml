abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the support of Mobile Networks, as defined
    in\nMobile IPv4, by the Mobile Router and Home Agent.  A Mobile Router is\nresponsible
    for the mobility of one or more network segments or\nsubnets moving together.
    \ The Mobile Router hides its mobility from\nthe nodes on the mobile network.
    \ The nodes on the Mobile Network may\nbe fixed in relationship to the Mobile
    Router and may not have any\nmobility function.\n\nExtensions to Mobile IPv4 are
    introduced to support Mobile Networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
