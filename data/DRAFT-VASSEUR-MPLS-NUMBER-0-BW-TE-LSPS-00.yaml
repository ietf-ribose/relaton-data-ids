abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Several Link-type sub-TLVs have been defined for OSPF and ISIS
    in the\n   context of MPLS Traffic Engineering in order to convery some link\n
    \  characteristics such as the available bandwidth, traffic enginering\n   metric,
    adminstrative group and so on.  There are various\n   circumstances where it would
    be useful to also know the number of\n   unconstrained Traffic Engineering Label
    Switched Path(s) (TE LSP).\n   This document specifies a new Link-type Traffic
    Engineering sub-TLV\n   used to advertise the number of unconstrained TE LSP(s)
    signalled\n   across a specific link.\n\t </p>\n      "
