abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) aims to communicate QoS-,\n
    \  service- and subscriber-related operations between a Network Access\n   Server
    (NAS) and an Access Node (e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line\n   Access Multiplexer
    (DSLAM)).  The main goal of this protocol is to\n   configure and manage access
    equipments and allow them to report\n   information to the NAS in order to enable
    and optimize configuration.\n\n   This document investigates security threats
    that all ANCP nodes could\n   encounter, developing a threat model for ANCP security
    aiming to\n   decide which security functions are required at the ANCP level.\n
    \  Based on this, security requirements regarding the Access Node\n   Control
    Protocol are defined.\n\t </p>\n      "
