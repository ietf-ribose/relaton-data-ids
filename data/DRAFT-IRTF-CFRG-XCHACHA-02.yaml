abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The eXtended-nonce ChaCha cipher construction (XChaCha) allows
    for\n   ChaCha-based ciphersuites to accept a 192-bit nonce with similar\n   guarantees
    to the original construction, except with a much lower\n   probability of nonce
    misuse occurring.  This helps for long running\n   TLS connections.  This also
    enables XChaCha constructions to be\n   stateless, while retaining the same security
    assumptions as ChaCha.\n\n   This document defines XChaCha20, which uses HChaCha20
    to convert the\n   key and part of the nonce into a subkey, which is in turn used
    with\n   the remainder of the nonce with ChaCha20 to generate a pseudorandom\n
    \  keystream (e.g. for message encryption).\n\n   This document also defines AEAD_XChaCha20_Poly1305,
    a variant of\n   [RFC8439] that utilizes the XChaCha20 construction in place of\n
    \  ChaCha20.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
