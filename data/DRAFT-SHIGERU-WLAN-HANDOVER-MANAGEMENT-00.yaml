abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses handover management scheme for WLAN
    handover \n   across different IP subnets.  To achieve seamless handover, the
    \n   following three requirements should be satisfied.  (I) prompt and \n   reliable
    detection of degradation in wireless link quality, \n   (II) elimination of handover
    processing delay on layer 2 and 3, \n   (III) selection of a better WLAN.  We
    then describe our proposed \n   handover management scheme satisfying these requirements,
    and \n   explain an architecture design and implementation for our proposed \n
    \  scheme.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
