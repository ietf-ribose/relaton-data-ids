abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>      This note describes the Service Allocation Profile scheme
    for\n      differential service allocation within the Internet. The scheme is\n
    \     based on a simple packet drop preference mechanism at interior\n      nodes,
    and highly flexible service profiles at edges and inter-\n      provider boundary
    points within the net. The service profiles\n      capture a wide variety of user
    requirements and expectations, and\n      allow different users to receive different
    levels of service from\n      the network in a scalable and efficient manner.\n\n
    \     The note describes the basic form of the mechanism, discusses the\n      range
    of services that users and providers can obtain by employing\n      it, and gives
    a more detailed presentation of particular\n      technical, deployment, standardization,
    and economic issues\n      related to its use.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
