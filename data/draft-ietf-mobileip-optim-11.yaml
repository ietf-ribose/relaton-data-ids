abstract:
  content: "<p>Using the base Mobile IP protocol, all datagrams destined to a mobilenode
    are routed through that mobile node's home agent, which thentunnels each datagram
    to the mobile node's current location. Thisdocument defines Route Optimization
    messages and extensions to thebase protocol to optimize datagram routing to a
    mobile node. Usingthese protocol extensions, correspondent nodes may cache the
    bindingof a mobile node, and then tunnel their datagrams for the mobile nodedirectly
    to the care-of address, bypassing the mobile node's homeagent. Extensions are
    also provided to allow datagrams in flightwhen a mobile node moves, and datagrams
    sent based on an out-of-datecached binding, to be forwarded directly to the mobile
    node's newbinding.</p>"
