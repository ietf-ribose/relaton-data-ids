abstract:
- content: "<p>In network based mobility, flow mobility also should be network based.
    This document defines two new Mobility Headers for a Local Mobility Anchor to
    control flow binding in a mobile node. The proxy binding update messages containing
    these mobility headers are exchanged with Mobile Access Gateways.</p>"
