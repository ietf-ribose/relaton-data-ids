abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the Next Steps in Signaling extensibility model.
    This model is based upon a two-layer model, where there is a transport layer and
    a signaling application model. This two-layer provides the ability to develope
    new signaling applications, while retaining the use of a common transport layer.
    This document will serve as guidence on how the NSIS architecture can be extended.</p>"
