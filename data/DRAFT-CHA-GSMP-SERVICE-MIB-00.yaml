abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>General switch management protocol (GSMP) is an open interface
    \nprotocol between a label switch and a controller, and it provides \nconnection,
    configuration, event, performance management and \nsynchronization. Traditionally,
    network management services are \nclassified into five categories: those are configuration,
    performance, \nfault, accounting, and security management. The companion draft
    \ndocument discussed the implementation complexity of a label switch \nand the
    efficiency of resource usage according to the location of \nnetwork management
    functions. This document defines managed objects \nto support network management
    services in the GSMP interface. \n                 \n\n\t </p>\n      "
