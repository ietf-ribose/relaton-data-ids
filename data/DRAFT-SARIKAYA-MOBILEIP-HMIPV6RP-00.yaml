abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Regional Paging
    \n(HMIPv6RP), a small and link-layer independent extension to the \nHierarchical
    Mobile IPv6 with regional registrations, to support \npower-constrained operation
    in the mobile nodes and to reduce routing \nstate information in the visited domain.
    \ The extension allows a \nmobile node to enter a power saving idle mode during
    which its \nlocation is known with the coarse accuracy defined by a paging area.
    \nIn the visited domain only the paging mobility anchor point (PMAP) is \nresponsible
    for keeping the binding cache entries for idle mobile \nnodes and, it re-establishes
    the downlink routes on demand by means \nof paging. This does not require snooping
    of data packets but is a \nnatural extension to network-level routing. Optionally,
    the mobile \nnode and the visited domain can agree on time slot based paging used
    \nfor Paging Agent Advertisements to restrict link interface power-on \ntime in
    the mobile node. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
