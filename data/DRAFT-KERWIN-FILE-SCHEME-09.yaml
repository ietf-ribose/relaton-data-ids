abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the file Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI)\n   scheme that was originally specified in RFC 1738.  The purpose of\n
    \  this document is to keep the information about the scheme on\n   standards
    track, since RFC 1738 has been made obsolete, and to\n   promote interoperability
    by resolving disagreements between various\n   implementations.\n\nNote to Readers\n\n
    \  This draft should be discussed on its github project page [github].\n\n\t </p>\n
