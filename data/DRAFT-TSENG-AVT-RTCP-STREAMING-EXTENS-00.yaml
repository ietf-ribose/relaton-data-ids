abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a new streaming report block for the Extended
    \nReport (XR) packet type for the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [1].  \nXR packets
    are an extension to the reception report blocks of RTCP \nsender report (SR) or
    Receiver Report (RR) packets. In [1] seven report \nblocks are defined to receive
    various information that helps the sender \nto monitor the network and assess
    quality of VoIP delivery. In this \ndocument we define a new report block for
    the XR packet, namely the \nstreaming report block, to receive statistics about
    the quality of an \naudio and/or video streaming session.\n\t </p>\n      "
