abstract:
- content: "<p>IGMP is used by IPv4 system to report their multicast group memberships
    to multicast routers. This document adds support for router annoucing information,
    that is, the ability for a multicast router to annouce information about a group
    to host. For example, some hosts may send reports to join a group that do not
    exist, so the router would send some message to inform the hosts.</p>"
