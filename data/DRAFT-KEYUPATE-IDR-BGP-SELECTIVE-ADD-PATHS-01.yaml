abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [draft-ietf-idr-add-paths] defines a BGP extension that allows
    the\n   advertisement of multiple paths for the same address prefix without\n
    \  the new paths implicitly replacing any previous ones.  The essence of\n   the
    extension is that each path is identified by a path identifier in\n   addition
    to the address prefix.  This draft augments functionality\n   defined in [draft-ietf-idr-add-paths]
    to facilitate advertisement of\n   multiple paths for a subset of prefixes in
    a given address family.\n   Prefixes are selected through specification of a well-known
    BGP\n   extended community.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
