abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Circuit Cross-Connect (CCC) was the ground-breaking design and\n
    \  implementation of the transport of Layer 2 frames over Multi-Protocol\n   Label
    Switching (MPLS), which is now seen as an important application\n   of MPLS.  Thus,
    documenting CCC is important from a historical point\n   of view.  Furthermore,
    CCC is still in production in many networks,\n   providing yet another reason
    to document it.  It is hoped that those\n   interested in this area will see where
    it started, how far we have\n   come, and the strengths and weaknesses of this
    particular approach,\n   and thereby gain some perspective of the area.  If in
    the process\n   they get new insights for the future development in this area,
    that\n   is a bonus.\n\t </p>\n      "
