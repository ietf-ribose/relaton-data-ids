abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a network diagnostic tool called PROBE. PROBE
    is similar to PING in that it can be used to query the status of a probed interface,
    but it differs from PING in that it does not require bidirectional connectivity
    between the probing and probed interfaces. Instead, PROBE requires bidirectional
    connectivity between the probing interface and a proxy interface. The proxy interface
    can reside on the same node as the probed interface, or it can reside on a node
    to which the probed interface is directly connected. This document updates RFC
    4884.</p>"
