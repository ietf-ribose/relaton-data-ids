abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data Centers may have many links between each other. Bandwidth
    over-\n   provisioning sometimes is not a good solution to accommodate the\n   traffic
    between DCs, especially for peak traffic. This draft analyze\n   the use case
    of inter DC traffic optimization, and the applicability\n   of SUPA for this case.\n\n\t
