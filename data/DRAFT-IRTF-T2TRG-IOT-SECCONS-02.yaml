abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet of Things concept refers to the usage of standard\n
    \  Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing or thing-to-thing\n   communication.
    \ The security needs are well-recognized and and many\n   standardization steps
    have been taken, for example, specification of\n   CoAP over DTLS.  However, security
    challenges still exist and there\n   are some use cases that lack a suitable solution.
    \ This document\n   first provides an overview of security architecture, its deployment\n
    \  model, security needs in the context of the lifecycle of a thing, as\n   well
    as the state of the art on IoT security.  Then, we discuss the\n   concept of
    security profiles for the successful roll-out of secure\n   IoT applications and
    describe remaining security challenges in the\n   IoT.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
