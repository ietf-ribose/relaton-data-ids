abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward
    Error\n   Correction (FEC) packets that are generated by the non-interleaved\n
    \  and interleaved parity codes from a source media encapsulated in RTP.\n   These
    parity codes are systematic codes, where a number of repair\n   symbols are generated
    from a set of source symbols.  These repair\n   symbols are sent in a repair flow
    separate from the source flow that\n   carries the source symbols.  The non-interleaved
    and interleaved\n   parity codes offer a good protection against random and bursty
    packet\n   losses, respectively, at a cost of decent complexity.  The RTP\n   payload
    formats that are defined in this document address the\n   scalability issues experienced
    with the earlier specifications\n   including RFC 2733, RFC 5109 and SMPTE 2022-1,
    and offer several\n   improvements.  Due to these changes, the new payload formats
    are not\n   backward compatible with the earlier specifications, but endpoints\n
    \  that do not implement the scheme can still work by simply ignoring\n   the
    FEC packets.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
