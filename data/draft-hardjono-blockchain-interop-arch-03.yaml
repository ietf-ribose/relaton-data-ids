abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increasing interest in the potential use of blockchains and
    decentralized ledger technology (DLT) networksorks for virtual asset management,
    there is a need for these networks to have interoperability to support applications
    and services built atop these networks. An interoperability architecture for DLT
    networks is therefore needed in order to permit the secure flow of digital assets
    different DLT networks, satisfying the properties of transfer atomicity, consistency
    and durability. The architecture must recognize that there are different DLT networks
    and that the interior constructs in these networks maybe incompatible with one
    another. This document proposes an interoperability architecture based on DLT
    Gateways, which are points of interconnection between networks. Among others,
    the gateways implement one or more protocols for the transfer (or exchange) digital
    assets between DLT networks. A gateway belonging to a DLT network peers with another
    gateway belonging to a different DLT network to perform the asset transfer between
    the two networks.</p>"
