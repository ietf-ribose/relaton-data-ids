abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes MASQUE (Multiplexed Application Substrate\n
    \  over QUIC Encryption).  MASQUE is a framework that allows\n   concurrently
    running multiple networking applications inside an\n   HTTP/3 connection.  For
    example, MASQUE can allow a QUIC client to\n   negotiate proxying capability with
    an HTTP/3 server, and subsequently\n   make use of this functionality while concurrently
    processing HTTP/3\n   requests and responses.\n\n   Discussion of this work is
    encouraged to happen on the MASQUE IETF\n   mailing list masque@ietf.org or on
    the GitHub repository which\n   contains the draft: https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
