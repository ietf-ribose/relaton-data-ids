abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Watchers are defined as entities that request (i.e., subscribe to)presence
    information about a user. There is fairly complex stateassociated with this subscription,
    and this state is dynamic. As aresult, it is possible, and indeed useful, to subscribe
    to thewatcher information for a particular subscriber. In order to enablethis,
    a format is needed to describe the state of watchers. Thisspecification describes
    an XML document format for such state.</p>"
