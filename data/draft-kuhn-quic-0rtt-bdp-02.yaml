abstract:
- content: "<p>The NewSessionTicket record carries a field that tells a client the
    volume of early data that it can include in the 0-RTT messages when reconnecting
    to the same peer. There are cases where additional information can significantly
    improve the time-to-service. This memo discusses a solution where path adaptation
    parameters are also shared between the peers. There are use cases where this can
    accelerate the throughput of subsequent 0-RTT connections in both direction.</p>"
