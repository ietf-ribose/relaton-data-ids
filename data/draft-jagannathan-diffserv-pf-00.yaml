abstract:
  content: "\t <t>We propose a new Per Hop Behavior (PHB) for differentiated servicesin
    IP networks. In this PHB, each network subscriber (or flow)receives a bandwidth
    allocation proportional to the subscribedinformation rate. This new PHB is called
    'Proportional ForwardingPHB' or PF PHB. The marking mechanism at the source or
    ingressrouter and the queuing and discard behavior at core routers areclearly
    described.</p>"
