abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Function Chaining (SFC) is the process of directing packets
    through a network so that they can be acted on by an ordered set of abstract service
    functions before being delivered to the intended destination. An architecture
    for SFC is defined in RFC7665. The Network Service Header (NSH) can be inserted
    into packets to steer them along a specific path to realize a Service Function
    Chain. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a widely deployed forwarding technology
    that uses labels placed in a packet in a label stack to identify the forwarding
    actions to be taken at each hop through a network. Actions may include swapping
    or popping the labels as well, as using the labels to determine the next hop for
    forwarding the packet. Labels may also be used to establish the context under
    which the packet is forwarded. This document describes how Service Function Chaining
    can be achieved in an MPLS network by means of a logical representation of the
    NSH in an MPLS label stack. That is, the NSH is not used, but the fields of the
    NSH are mapped to fields in the MPLS label stack. It does not deprecate or replace
    the NSH, but acknowledges that there may be a need for an interim deployment of
    SFC functionality in brownfield networks.</p>"
