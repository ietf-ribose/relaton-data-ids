abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines the SIEVE mail filtering language [SIEVE]\n
    \  \"refuse\" extension.\n   A Joe-job is a spam run forged to appear as though
    it came from an\n   innocent party, who is then generally flooded by the bounces,
    MDNs\n   and messages with complaints.  With the Sieve \"reject\" action, MDNs\n
    \  contribute to the flood of Joe-job spam to victims of Joe-jobs;\n   SMTP level
    refusals usually don't.  With \"refuse\", Sieve gains the\n   ability to simply
    not accept an email during the SMTP transaction\n   (instead of accepting it and
    then sending an MDN [MDN] back to the\n   alleged sender using \"reject\").\n\t
    </p>\n      "
