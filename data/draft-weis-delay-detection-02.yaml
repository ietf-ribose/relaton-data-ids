abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo describes a one-way measurement of IP packet end to end delay.
    Delay detection is enabled by a sender of an IP Internet Protocol datagram placing
    a timestamp in the packet declaring the time at which it was sent. The receiver
    of the datagram can then judge how recently it was sent and choose a policy action,
    which could include discarding packets deemed to be 'too old' (having a timestamp
    too far into the past) or 'too new' (having a timestamp that is too far into the
    future).</p>"
