abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft discusses the use of two DNS record types for storing
    BGP\n   routing information in the reverse DNS.  The RLOCK record allows\n   prefix
    owners to indicate whether the DNS is being used to publish\n   routing data.
    \ The SRO record allows operators to indicate whether an\n   IPv4 or IPv6 prefix
    ought to appear in global routing tables and\n   identifies authorized origin
    Autonomous System Number(s) for that\n   prefix.  The resulting published data
    can be used in a variety of\n   contexts from routing security to address ownership.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
