abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  Dual stack transition mechanism (DSTM) provides connectivity
    between\n  dual stack hosts (i.e., DSTM clients) within an IPv6-only network and\n
    \ IPv4 nodes within an IPv4 internet or intranet. DSTM defined in [DSTM] \n  considers
    only one TEP, that is, packets from an IPv4 node to a DSTM \n  client need to
    be routed through the same DSTM border router as that \n  used in transmitting
    packets from the DSTM client to the IPv4 node.\n  In this draft, we propose a
    DSTM architecture of using \n  multiple TEPs with only one IPv4 address pool for
    a DSTM domain.\n\t </p>\n      "
