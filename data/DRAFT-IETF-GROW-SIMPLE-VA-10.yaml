abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   All BGP routers in the Default Free Zone (DFZ) are required
    to carry\n   all the routes in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT).  A technique\n
    \  is described that allows some BGP routers not to install all of those\n   routes
    into the Forwarding Information Base (FIB).\n\n   Some routers in an Autonomous
    System (AS) announce an aggregate (the\n   VA prefix) in addition to the routes
    they already announce.  This\n   enables other routers not to install the routes
    covered by the VA\n   prefix into the FIB as long as those routes have the same
    next-hop as\n   the VA prefix.\n\n   The VA prefixes that are announced within
    an AS are not announced to\n   any other AS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
