abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748,
    provides support for multiple authentication methods. Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) provides for mutual authentication, integrity-protected ciphersuite negotiation,
    and key exchange between two endpoints. This document defines EAP-TLS, which includes
    support for certificate-based mutual authentication and key derivation. This document
    obsoletes RFC 2716. A summary of the changes between this document and RFC 2716
    is available in Appendix A. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
