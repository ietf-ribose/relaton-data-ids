abstract:
  content: "<p>OSPF requires a router to recalculate its routing table whenever itreceives
    a new router or network LSA. However, a topology change,such as a router down
    event, may cause a number of new LSAs to begenerated. These LSAs may arrive at
    a router at different times. Inorder to avoid several routing table calculations
    in quick successionin such cases, commercial routers enforce a hold time betweensuccessive
    routing table calculations. The hold time based schemes,while limiting the number
    of routing table calculations, may alsocause undesirable delays in convergence
    to the topology change. ThisID describes an alternate approach to schedule routing
    tablecalculations, called LSA Correlation. Rather than using individualLSAs as
    triggers for routing table calculations, LSA Correlationscheme correlates the
    information in the LSAs to identify thetopology change. A routing table calculation
    can be performed whenthe topology change has been identified, which could span
    multipleLSAs.</p>"
