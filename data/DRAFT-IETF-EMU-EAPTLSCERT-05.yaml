abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EAP-TLS and other TLS-based EAP methods are widely deployed
    and used\n   for network access authentication.  Large certificates and long\n
    \  certificate chains combined with authenticators that drop an EAP\n   session
    after only 40 - 50 round-trips is a major deployment problem.\n   This document
    looks at the this problem in detail and describes the\n   potential solutions
    available.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
