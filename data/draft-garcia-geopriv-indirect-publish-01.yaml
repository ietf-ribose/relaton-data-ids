abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A method for indirectly publishing presence information is described.This
    allows a presentity user agent to publish a URI that can be usedby the presence
    agent to retrieve presence information. A presenceagent is then better able to
    acquire dynamic presence informationwithout relying on the presentity user agent.
    This also allows apresentity user agent to delegate responsibility for managingchanging
    presence data to the source of that information.</p>"
