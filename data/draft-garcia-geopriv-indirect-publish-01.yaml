abstract:
- content: "<p>A method for indirectly publishing presence information is described.
    This allows a presentity user agent to publish a URI that can be used by the presence
    agent to retrieve presence information. A presence agent is then better able to
    acquire dynamic presence information without relying on the presentity user agent.
    This also allows a presentity user agent to delegate responsibility for managing
    changing presence data to the source of that information.</p>"
