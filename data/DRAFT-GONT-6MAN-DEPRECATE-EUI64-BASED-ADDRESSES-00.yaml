abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for IPv6 typically\n
    \  results in hosts configuring one or more stable addresses composed of\n   a
    network prefix advertised by a local router, and an Interface\n   Identifier that
    typically embeds a hardware address (e.g., an IEEE\n   LAN MAC address).  The
    security and privacy implications of embedding\n   hardware addresses in the Interface
    Identifier have been known and\n   understood for some time now, and some popular
    IPv6 implementations\n   have already deviated from such scheme to mitigate these
    issues.\n   This document deprecates the use of hardware addresses in IPv6\n   Interface
    Identifiers, and recommends the use of an alternative\n   scheme ([I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses])
    for the generation\n   of IPv6 stable addresses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
