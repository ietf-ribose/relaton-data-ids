abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We are introducing a new method to calculate services KPIs
    and\n   metrics in the network using TWAMP protocol.  Services here ranging\n
    \  from Layer 4 to Layer 7 services.  Some of the examples are Http\n   based
    services, Traffic load balancer, DPI, Video caching, real time\n   streaming and
    IPSec.  The KPIs MAY be service latency, liveliness of\n   an application, number
    of flows and sessions per service, load\n   balancer statistics.\n\n   This draft
    outlines the methodology to calculate these parameters in\n   the service plane
    in the real network using TWAMP protocol.  Some of\n   the existing fields extended
    to support new modes in the TWAMP\n   protocol for calculating these KPIs. set
    of new messages are added in\n   the control protocol between TWAMP client (session
    sender) and the\n   TWAMP server (session reflector).\n\n   There is a separate
    draft \"draft-spv-ippm-monitor-implementation-\n   services-kpi\" that talks about
    implementation of monitoring these\n   KPIs in the network using TWAMP.  Monitoring
    of these KPIs in the\n   service plane with in a network play a vital role in
    optimum usage of\n   network resources and improving the overall performance and
    capacity.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
