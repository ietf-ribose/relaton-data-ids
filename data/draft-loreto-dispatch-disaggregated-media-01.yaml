abstract:
  content: "<p>Disaggregated media refers to the ability for a user to create amultimedia
    session combining different media streams, coming fromdifferent devices under
    his or her control, so that they are treatedby the far end of the session as a
    single media session. Thisdocument lists several use cases that involve disaggregated
    media inSIP. Additionally, this document analyzes what types ofdisaggregated media
    can be implemented using existing protocolmechanisms, and the pros and cons of
    using each of those mechanisms.Finally, this document describes scenarios that
    are not covered bycurrent mechanisms and proposes new IETF work to cover them.</p>"
