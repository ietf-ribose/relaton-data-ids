abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OSPF defines three different kinds of authentication schemes:
    Null \n   authentication, simple password and cryptographic authentication. The
    \n   cryptographic authentication scheme can make use of various \n   cryptographic
    algorithms in order to authenticate the OSPF packets. \n   To ensure interoperability
    between disparate implementations, it is \n   necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement
    algorithms to \n   ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations
    \n   will have available.   \n    \n   This document defines the current set of
    mandatory-to-implement \n   algorithms to be used for the cryptographic authentication
    for OSPF \n   as well as specifying the algorithms that should be implemented
    \n   because they may be promoted to mandatory at some future time. \n\n\t </p>\n
