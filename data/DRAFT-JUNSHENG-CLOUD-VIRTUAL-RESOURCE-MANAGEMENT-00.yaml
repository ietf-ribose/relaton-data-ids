abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In current Cloud and Data Center (DC) environment, the manageable\n
    \  virtualized resources aggregated by the Resource Management Platform\n   (RMP)
    may be supplied by different types of hypervisor\n   implementations.  The RMP
    needs to support a variety of hypervisor\n   APIs to allow access, management
    and integration of different types\n   of resources.  In order to decouple the
    RMP from any particular\n   hypervisor implementation, a unified API needs to
    be developed.  This\n   draft presents the requirements and preliminary implementation\n
    \  considerations for such an API.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
