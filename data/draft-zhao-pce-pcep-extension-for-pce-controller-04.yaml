abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks deployment scenarios, service providers would like
    to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in both MPLS and GMPLS while removing
    the complexity of existing signalling protocols such as LDP and RSVP-TE. In [I-D.zhao-pce-central-controller-user-cases],
    we propose to use the PCE [RFC5440] as a central controller (PCECC) so that LSP
    can be calculated/ signalled/initiated and label forwarding entries are downloaded
    through a centralized PCE server to each network devices along the LSP path while
    leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible. This draft specify
    the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for using the PCE as the central controller
    and user cases where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated and label forwarding
    entries are downloaded through extending the existing PCE architectures and PCEP.
    This document also discuss the role of PCECC in Segment Routing (SR).</p>"
