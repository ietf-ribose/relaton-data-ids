abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enterprise networks deploy a variety of security devices to
    protect\n   the network, hosts and endpoints.  Network security devices, both\n
    \  hardware and virtual, operate at all OSI layers with scanning and\n   analysis
    capabilities for application content.  Multiple specific\n   devices are often
    deployed together for breadth and depth of defense.\n   This document describes
    use cases of Service Function Chaining (SFC)\n   when deploying network security
    devices in the manner described above\n   and also puts forth requirements for
    their effective operation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
