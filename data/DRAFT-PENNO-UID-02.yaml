abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>With the advent of Content Delivery Networks and personalized\nservices
    there is a need to uniquely identify a user in oder to\nbe able to offer customized
    services and content. Unfortunately,\nthe IP Internet makes personalizing content
    and services\ndifficult for the providers.\n\nWith the virtualization of Web resources
    and the widespread use of\nproxies, an IP address no longer uniquely identifies
    a Web user or\ndestination.\n\nSo in oder to uniquely identify a user, the service
    provider has to\nmake the identification on the edge (or access) network, before
    the\nuser looses his identity in the core of the network. We present\nhere a overview
    of these techniques available on the different\ntypes of access networks.\n\t
