abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a mechanism for a CDN to trigger activity
    in\n   an interconnected CDN that is configured to deliver content on its\n   behalf.
    \ The upstream CDN can use this mechanism to request that the\n   downstream CDN
    pre-positions metadata or content, or that it re-\n   validate or purge metadata
    or content.  The upstream CDN can monitor\n   the status of activity that it has
    triggered in the downstream CDN.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
