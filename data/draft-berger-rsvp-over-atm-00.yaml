abstract:
- content: "<p>This note presents a method for running RSVP over ATM switched virtual
    circuits (SVCs). It presents an overall approach to the problem, as well as a
    specific method for running over today's ATM networks. The note includes a review
    of major related issues, an overview of the proposed approach, and a specific
    method usable with UNI 3.0 and 3.1. This note is intended to be used as a basis
    for discussion in the IETF ISSLL working group.</p>"
