abstract:
- content: "<p>The current BGP specification doesn't use network performance metrics
    (e.g., network latency) in the route selection decision process. This document
    describes a performance-based BGP routing mechanism in which network latency metric
    is taken as one of the route selection criteria. This routing mechanism is useful
    for those server providers with global reach to deliver low-latency network connectivity
    services to their customers.</p>"
