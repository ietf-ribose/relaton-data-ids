abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering
    Label\n   Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and\n
    \  Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been\n   identified
    as a key requirement for P2P and P2MP scenarios.  In this\n   context, a domain
    is a collection of network elements within a common\n   sphere of address management
    or path computational responsibility\n   such as an IGP area or an Autonomous
    Systems.  This document\n   specifies a standard representation and encoding of
    a domain\n   sequence, which is defined as an ordered sequence of domains\n   traversed
    to reach the destination domain.  This document also\n   defines new sub-objects
    to be used to encode domain identifiers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
