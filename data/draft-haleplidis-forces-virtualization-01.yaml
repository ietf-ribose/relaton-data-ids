abstract:
  content: "<p>Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an architectural
    framework and associated protocols to standardize information exchange between
    the control plane and the forwarding plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES
    NE). RFC5812 has defined the ForCES Model provides a formal way to represent the
    capabilities, state, and configuration of forwarding elements within the context
    of the ForCES protocol, so that control elements (CEs) can control the FEs accordingly.
    More specifically, the model describes the logical functions that are present
    in an FE, what capabilities these functions support, and how these functions are
    or can be interconnected. The ForCES model provides the necessary abstractions
    to natively support virtualization of the forwarding plane. This documents describes
    a formal approach to model the necessary parameters required for defining and
    managing virtual network forwarding planes to create virtual network elements.</p>"
