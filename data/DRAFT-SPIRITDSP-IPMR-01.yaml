abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes IPMR, a scalable variable adaptive
    multi-\n   rate speech and audio codec designed for use in IP based networks.\n
    \  This codec is suitable for real time communications such as\n   telephony,
    voice&amp;video conferencing.Four different sampling\n   frequencies are supported
    for encoding the audio input signal.\n   Adaptation to network characteristics
    is provided through control of\n   bitrate, packet rate, packet loss resilience
    and use of discontinuous\n   transmission (DTX).\n   IP-MR support different profiles
    for input signal content which\n   should be specified during codec initialization.
    It can be in Speech,\n   Audio or Auto-detection mode. In Auto-detection mode
    codec recognizes\n   type of input content automatically and switch to appropriate
    Speech\n   or Audio mode automatically.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
