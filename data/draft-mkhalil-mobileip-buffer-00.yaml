abstract:
  content: "<p>Security and Smooth handoff with minimal data loss and delay aredesirable
    goals of any mobile network. To minimize data loss whilechanging FAs, a MN can
    request the previous FA to allocate buffersfor storing its (MN's) data. This buffered
    data is then forwardedto the MN when it registers with the new FA. This approach
    maydecrease the window of data loss and delay during handoff.Additionally, it
    may be necessary for the MN to authenticate thenew FA before allowing it (the
    new FA) to receive data from theprevious FA.This draft outlines a buffering protocol
    that minimizes thepotential loss of data while the MN changes its subnetwork point
    ofattachment. This draft also provides a way for the MN to verify thenew FA during
    the handoff, if and when that is needed.</p>"
