abstract:
- content: "<p>Is the concept of Domain Names owned by the DNS protocol or does the
    DNS protocol exist to support the Domain Names concept? This question has become
    pertinent in light of proposals to use Domain Names in protocols in ways incompatible
    with the DNS protocol and the operational environment built to run the protocol.
    To help answer this question, a look into the recorded history of Requests for
    Comments is presented.</p>"
