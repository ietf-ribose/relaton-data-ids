abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     This document considers how so-called \"carrier\" or \n     \"infrastructure\"
    ENUM and \"end user\" or \"public\" ENUM can share a \n     single Tier 1 registry
    yet have independent Tier 2 providers. This \n     approach allows the common
    cooperative infrastructure required by \n     ENUM to be shared by end users and
    carriers reducing costs and \n     facilitating adoption of ENUM generally. The
    essence of the \n     proposal is to populate the Tier 1 registry with non-terminal
    \n     NAPTRs rather than NS records and use different ENUM service \n     fields
    for carrier and end user records. \n\t </p>\n      "
