abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Recently, there have been a variety of proposals submitted to
    the\nMobile IP Working Group and to other IETF working groups for IP\nmobility
    solutions that seek to enhance or replace mobile IP. These\nproposals, often characterized
    as micromobility or fast handoff, are\naddressed primarily at the perceived need
    of multimedia sessions such\nas video or voice over IP for faster handoff between
    radio base\nstations, and are primarily directed at real time multimedia traffic\nin
    3rd generation cellular access networks. In this paper, we discuss\nthe design
    of CDMA radio access networks (RANs) and the applicability\nof IP mobility to
    soft handoff in a CDMA RAN. We attempt to show that\ngiven current IP routing
    algorithms and the constraints on a CDMA\nRAN, IP mobility solutions have little,
    if any, role to play in\nhandoff within the RAN. In contrast, an IP mobility solution
    is\nlikely to play a big role in fast handoff between RANs, also called\nhard
    handoff. While future developments in IP networking may change\nthis situation,
    IP mobility in CDMA networks currently seems to apply\nonly when the mobile node
    roams between disconnected RANs rather than\nbetween base stations within a RAN
    or between connected RANs.\n\t </p>\n      "
