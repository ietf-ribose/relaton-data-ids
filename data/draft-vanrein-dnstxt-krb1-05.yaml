abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a method to determine Kerberos realm names
    for services that are known by their DNS name. Currently, such information can
    only be found in static mappings or through educated guesswork. DNS can make this
    process more flexible, provided that DNSSEC is used to ensure authenticity of
    resource records.</p>"
