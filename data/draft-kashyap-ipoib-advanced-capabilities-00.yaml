abstract:
  content: "<p>InfiniBand Architecture(IBA) defines a high speed, channelbased interconnect
    between systems and devices. The InfiniBandarchitecture provides multiple modes
    of transport serviceswith differing characteristics. IPoIB may be implemented
    overany or multiple such modes to take advantage of the underlyingmode's features.
    IPoIB by default is implemented over the UDmode of IBA. This document describes
    IPoIB over IBA's non-UDtransport modes.</p>"
