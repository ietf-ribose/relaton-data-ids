abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a network implementing Distributed Mobility Management,
    it has\n   been agreed that Mobile Nodes (MNs) should exhibit agility in their\n
    \  use of IP addresses.  For example, an MN might use an old address for\n   ongoing
    socket connections but use a new, locally assigned address\n   for new socket
    connections.  Determining when to assign a new\n   address, and when to release
    old addresses, is currently an open\n   problem.  Making an optimal decision about
    address assignment and\n   release must involve a tradeoff in the amount of signaling
    used to\n   allocate the new addresses, the amount of utility that applications\n
    \  are deriving from the use of a previously assigned address, and the\n   cost
    of maintaining an address that was assigned at a previous point\n   of attachment.
    \ As the MN moves farther and farther from the initial\n   point where an address
    was assigned, more and more resources are used\n   to redirect packets destined
    for that IP address to its current\n   location.  The MN currently does not know
    the amount of resources\n   used as this depends on mobility path and internal
    routing topology\n   of the network(s) which are known only to the network operator.
    \ This\n   document provides a mechanism to communicate to the MN the cost of\n
    \  maintaining a given prefix at the MN's current point of attachment so\n   that
    the MN can make better decisions about when to release old\n   addresses and assign
    new ones.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
