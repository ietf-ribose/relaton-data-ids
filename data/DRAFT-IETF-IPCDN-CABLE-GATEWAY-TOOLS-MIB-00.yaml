abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB) \nfor use with network management protocols in the Internet community. \nIn
    particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-\nbased management
    of CableHome compliant WAN Gateway Devices and home \nrouters.  Specifically,
    this MIB defines managed objects for both a \nconnection speed tool and an ICMP
    'ping' tool between the Gateway and \ndevices on the LAN. \nThis memo specifies
    a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the \nSNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The
    set of objects is consistent with the SNMP \nframework and existing SNMP standards.
    \ \n    \n\n \n\t </p>\n      "
