abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies a new optional extension to IPv6 RouterAdvertisement
    messages to allow IPv6 routers to advertise DS-LiteAFTR addresses to IPv6 hosts
    (i.e., a default IPv6 route for DS-Litetraffic). The provisioning of the AFTR
    address is crucial to accessIPv4 connectivity services in a DS-Lite context. Means
    to ensurereliable delivery of this information to connecting hosts is a must.Furthermore,
    this RA option can be used as a means to distribute DS-Lite serviced customers
    among a set of deployed AFTRs withoutrequiring a central knowledge of the underlying
    topology and deployedAFTRs.</p>"
