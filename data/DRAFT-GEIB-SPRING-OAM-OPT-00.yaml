abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MPLS traceroute implementations validate dataplane connectivity
    and\n   isolate faults by sending messages along every end-to-end Label\n   Switched
    Path (LSP) combination between a source and a destination\n   node.  This requires
    a growing number of path validations in networks\n   with a high number of equal
    cost paths between origin and\n   destination.  Segment Routing (SR) introduces
    MPLS topology awareness\n   combined with Source Routing.  By this combination,
    SR can be used to\n   implement an MPLS traceroute option lowering the total number
    of LSP\n   validations as compared to commodity MPLS traceroute.\n\n\t </p>\n
