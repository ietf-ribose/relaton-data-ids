abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document identifies a need for improvement of the unicast\n
    \  Reverse Path Filtering techniques (uRPF) (see BCP 84) for detection\n   and
    mitigation of source address spoofing (see BCP 38).  The strict\n   uRPF is inflexible
    about directionality, the loose uRPF is oblivious\n   to directionality, and the
    current feasible-path uRPF attempts to\n   strike a balance between the two (see
    BCP 84).  However, as shown in\n   this draft, the existing feasible-path uRPF
    still has shortcomings.\n   This document describes an enhanced feasible-path
    uRPF technique,\n   which aims to be more flexible (in a meaningful way) about\n
    \  directionality than the feasible-path uRPF.  It can potentially\n   alleviate
    ISPs' concerns about the possibility of disrupting service\n   for their customers,
    and encourage greater deployment of uRPF\n   techniques.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
