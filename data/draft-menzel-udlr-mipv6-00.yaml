abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses mechanisms for Mobile IPv6 allowing the efficient
    establishment of bidirectional link layer connectivity of mobile receivers moving
    to access networks with unidirectional links. Scenarios are derived from the need
    to support seamless mobile in heterogeneous networking environment including unidirectional
    downstream link interfaces, such as DVB-H, DVB-T, DVB-S or satellites. In order
    to establish quickly the upstream connectivity of a mobile receiver, when moving
    to downstream unidirectional network in MIPv6 environment, the Link-Layer Tunneling
    Mechanisms defined in RFC 3077 are used in interaction with Mobile IPv6 protocols.</p>"
