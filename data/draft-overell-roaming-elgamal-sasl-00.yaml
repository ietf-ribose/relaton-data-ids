abstract:
- content: "<p>ROAMING-ELGAMAL is an SASL [SASL] authentication mechanism in which
    ElGamal [ELG] public key cryptography is used to encrypt the persona and password
    thus giving a high degree of security. Although specifically designed for the
    Simple Roaming Authentication Protocol [SRAP], ROAMING-ELGAMAL is intended to
    be a registered SASL mechanism and so could be adapted to other protocols. The
    mechanism has been designed to resist attack from interception, man in the middle,
    and replay. The security of the mechanism rests with the protection of the private
    key.</p>"
