abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes splitting of Control Plane (CP) and User Plane
    (UP) for a Proxy Mobile IPv6 based network infrastructure. Existing specifications
    allow a MAG to perform splitting of its control and user plane using Alternate
    Care of address mobility option for IPv6, or Alternate IPv4 Care of Address option
    for IPv4. However, the current specification does not have semantics for allowing
    the LMA to perform such functional split. To realize this requirement, this specification
    defines a mobility option that enables a local mobility anchor to provide an alternate
    LMA address to be used for the bi-directional tunnel between the MAG and LMA.
    With this extension, a local mobility anchor will be able to use an IP address
    for its user plane which is different than what is used for the control plane.</p>"
