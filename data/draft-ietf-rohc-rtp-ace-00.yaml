abstract:
  content: "\t <t>When Real-Time Multimedia over IP is applied to cellular systems,
    itis critical to minimize the overhead of the IP/UDP/RTP header, asspectral efficiency
    is a top requirement. Robustness to errors anderror bursts is also a must.Existing
    IP/UDP/RTP header compression schemes such as that presentedin IETF RFC 2508 [CRTP],
    do not provide sufficient performance insuch environments. This report describes
    a new scheme (ACE, orAdaptive header ComprEssion) , which like RFC 2508, is based
    on theidea that most of the time IP/UDP/RTP fields are either constant orcan be
    extrapolated in a linear fashion. However, ACE incorporatesseveral additional
    concepts which enable it to provide excellentcompression efficiency (exceeds the
    performance of [CRTP]) along witha high degree of error-resiliency. Some of the
    concepts employed,such as Variable Length Encoding (VLE), enable ACE to adapt
    tochanging behavior in the IP/UDP/RTP header fields, such that goodefficiency
    and robustness characteristics are maintained over a widerange of operating conditions.ACE
    is a general framework that can be parameterized to account forthe existence/non-existence
    and performance characteristics of thefeedback channel. Thus, ACE is applicable
    over both bi-directionaland unidirectional links.ACE is also able to perform a
    seamless handoff, i.e. the scheme canresume efficient compression operation immediately
    after handoff.</p>"
