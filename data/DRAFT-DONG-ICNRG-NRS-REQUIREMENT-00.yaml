abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document summarizes the existing approaches for name resolution\n
    \  in various ICN architectures, and categorizes them into two groups:\n   (1)
    standalone name resolution; (2) name based routing. It compares\n   the two types
    of approaches from the aspects of update message\n   overhead, resolution capability,
    node failure impact, and maintained\n   database. And hybrid approaches also exist
    with a subnet of routers\n   carrying out name based routing. Despite the coexistence
    of\n   different name resolution approaches, the Name Resolution Service\n   (NRS)
    is most essential service that shall be provided by the ICN\n   infrastructure.
    The document gives the definition of NRS in ICN and\n   proposes some requirements
    of NRS, i.e. resolution guarantee, delay\n   sensitivity, minimum inter-domain
    traffic, failure resilience,\n   accuracy, security and accessibility, scalability,
    and time\n   transiency, support for manifest, interoperability, resolution\n
    \  result selection, heterogeneity, unspecified Content Name.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
