abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a YANG data model to map service model (e.g.
    L3SM) and Traffic Engineering model (e.g. TE Tunnel or ACTN VN model). This model
    is referred to as TE service Mapping Model. This model is applicable to the operation's
    need for a seamless control and management of their L3VPN with TE tunnel support.</p>"
