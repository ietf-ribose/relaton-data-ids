abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As part of the Internet Multimedia Conferencing Architecture [3],
    \nconference course control deals with the control of running \nconferences after
    the creation of the initial conference state with \nrespect to the membership
    and access control during runtime of the \nsession. The spectrum of scenarios
    reaches from small multiparty \ngatherings up to large scaled meetings with a
    high fluctuation of \nuserâ€™s membership and activity. \nThis document identifies
    the problem areas to define the scope of \nconference course control efforts within
    the IETF. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
