abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) \"Caller Preferences\"
    extension\n   defined in RFC 3840 provides a mechanism that allows a SIP message
    to\n   convey information relating to the originator's supported features/\n   capabilities.
    \ This document defines requirements for a mechanism\n   that would allow SIP
    proxies to convey information relating to the\n   proxy's supported features/capabilities.\n\n\t
