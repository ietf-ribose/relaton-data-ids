abstract:
- content: "<p>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a mechanism for creating shared,
    secret, random bits. This document describes extensions to the IKEv2 protocol
    to use random bits created via QKD as keys for IPsec. The Diffie-Hellman key agreement
    mechanism is replaced with QKD. The use of QKD-generated keys with standard IPsec
    will extend the lifetime of privacy guarantees for IPsec-protected data: future
    technological advances that break Diffie-Hellman key exchange will not disclose
    data until such time as the encryption algorithm used for the IPsec tunnel is
    broken.</p>"
