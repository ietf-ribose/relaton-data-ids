abstract:
- content: "<p>A DNS RRtype numeric range that behaves like DS is reserved. This means:
    being authoritative on the parent side of a delegation; being signed by the parent;
    being provided along with delegations by the parent. If this document had become
    an RFC five years ago, deploying new types (along the lines of NS2/NS2T, DSPKI
    or various other imagined things like DNS ('signed delegation NS')) would be easier
    to deploy and experiment with today.</p>"
