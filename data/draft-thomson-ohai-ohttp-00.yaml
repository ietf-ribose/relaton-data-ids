abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a system for the forwarding of encrypted HTTP
    messages. This allows a client to make multiple requests of a server without the
    server being able to link those requests to the client or to identify the requests
    as having come from the same client. Discussion Venues This note is to be removed
    before publishing as an RFC. Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be
