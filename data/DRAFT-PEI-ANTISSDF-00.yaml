abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In cognitive sensor networks, the cooperative spectrum sensing
    can\n   effectively improve the accuracy of spectrum sensing. However, it is\n
    \  also facing with the security issues caused by attacks of potential\n   malicious
    \ users.  Lots  of  algorithms  are  proposed  in  existing\n   literatures  to
    \ cope  with  the  potential  attacks.  However,  the\n   traditional strategies
    are mainly suitable for relative simple and\n   ideal attack such as the all \"1\"
    or all \"0\" attack. Therefore, we\n   define a more universal anti Spectrum Sensing
    Data Falsification\n   (SSDF) framework in the document, which can better cope
    with the\n   probabilistic attacks and random attacks which are closer to the\n
    \  reality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
