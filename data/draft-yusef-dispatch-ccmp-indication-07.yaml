abstract:
- content: <p>The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) document (RFC
    6503) defines a way for a client to discover a conference control server that
    supports CCMP. However, it does not define a way for a client involved in a conference
    to determine if the conference focus supports CCMP. This information would allow
    a CCMP-enabled client that joins a conference using SIP to also register for the
    Centralized Conferencing (XCON) conference event package and take advantage of
    CCMP operations on the conference. This document describes two mechanisms, depending
    upon the need of the User Agent (UA), to address the above limitation. The first
    mechanism uses the Call-Info header field, and the second mechanism defines a
    new value for the "purpose" header field parameter in the &lt;service-uris&gt;
    element in the SIP conferencing event package.</p>
