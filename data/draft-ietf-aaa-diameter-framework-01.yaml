abstract:
- content: "<p>Current Internet Service Providers (ISPs) scale their networks by using
    the RADIUS protocol, which provides user Authentication, Authorization and Accounting
    (AAA) of Dial-up PPP clients. The recent work done in the Roaming Operations (ROAMOPS)
    Working Group was to investigate whether RADIUS could be used in a roaming network,
    and concluded that RADIUS was ill-suited for inter-domain purposes.</p>"
