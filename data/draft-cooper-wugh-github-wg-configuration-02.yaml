- content: "<p>The use of GitHub in IETF working group processes is increasing. This
    document describes possible uses and conventions for working groups which are
    considering starting to use GitHub. It does not mandate any processes, and does
    not intend to change the processes used by current working groups. Discussion
    of this document takes place on the ietf-and-github mailing list (ietf-and-github@ietf.org),
    which is archived at &lt;https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search?email_list=ietf-and-
