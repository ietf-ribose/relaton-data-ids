abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) [RFC4760] specifies that the set
    of usable\n   next-hop address families is determined by the Address Family\n
    \  Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).\n   The
    current AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4 address family only\n   have provisions
    for advertising a Next Hop address that belongs to\n   the IPv4 protocol when
    advertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability\n   Information (NLRI) or VPN-IPv4
    NLRI.  This document specifies the\n   extensions necessary to allow advertising
    IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI\n   with a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv6
    protocol.  This\n   comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow
    the\n   address of the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong\n
    \  to the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the Next Hop to determine which\n   of
    the protocols the address actually belongs to, and a new BGP\n   Capability allowing
    MP-BGP Peers to dynamically discover whether they\n   can exchange IPv4 NLRI and
    VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
