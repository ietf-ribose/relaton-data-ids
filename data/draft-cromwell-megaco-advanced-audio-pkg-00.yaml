abstract:
  content: "<p>This document is a proposal to add a new event/signal package to theMegaco
    protocol to control an ARF (Audio Resource Function) which mayreside on a Media
    Gateway or specialized Audio Server.This event package provides support for the
    standard IVR operationsof PlayAnnouncement, PlayCollect, and PlayRecord. It supports
    directreferences to simple audio as well as indirect references to simpleand complex
    audio. It provides audio variables, control of audiointerruptibility, digit buffer
    control, special key sequences, andsupport for reprompting during data collection.
    It also provides anarbitrary number of user defined qualifiers to be used in resolvingcomplex
    audio structures. For example, the user could define qualif-iers for any or all
    of the following: language, accent, audio fileformat, gender, speaker, or customer.</p>"
