abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In IPv4, 127/8 is the loopback prefix, where as in IPv6 it
    is\n   ::1/128.  The significant difference between these two prefixes is\n   the
    number of addresses they cover; 127/8 covers 2^24 or 16 777 216\n   addresses,
    where as ::1/128 covers just a single address.\n\n   IPv4's large number of loopback
    addresses has facilitated some novel\n   uses of the loopback function that cannot
    be achieved with the single\n   loopback address available in IPv6.  This memo
    proposes a new larger\n   loopback prefix for IPv6 so that these uses of the loopback
    function\n   become available for IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
