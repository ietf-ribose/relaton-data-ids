abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document, we discuss Location Privacy as applicable
    to IP\n   Mobility.  We discuss two problems:  disclosing a new IP address to
    a\n   correspondent, and revealing a fixed identity to an eavesdropper.  We\n
    \  document some of the previous discussion on possible solutions.\n\t </p>\n
