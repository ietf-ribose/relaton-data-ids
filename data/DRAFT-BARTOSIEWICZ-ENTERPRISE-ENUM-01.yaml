abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This paper presents an extension of NAPTR Resource Records and
    an\n   application of the local DNS (called in further part of this\n   document
    'Enterprise -ENUM') in order to keep information required\n   for costs optimization
    of telecommunication connections.\n   The optimization should cover the cost reduction
    through the\n   selection of cheapest form of telecommunication connections for\n
    \  the calling party (a person initializing a telecommunication\n   connection).\n\t
