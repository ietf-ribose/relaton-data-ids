abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport
    Layer\n   Security (DTLS) protocol to protect user messages sent over the\n   Stream
    Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  It is an improved\n   update of the existing
    rfc6083.\n\n   DTLS over SCTP provides mutual authentication, confidentiality,\n
    \  integrity protection, and replay protection for applications that use\n   SCTP
    as their transport protocol and allows client/server\n   applications to communicate
    in a way that is designed to give\n   communications privacy and to prevent eavesdropping
    and detect\n   tampering or message forgery.\n\n   Applications using DTLS over
    SCTP can use almost all transport\n   features provided by SCTP and its extensions.
    \ This document intends\n   to obsolete RFC 6083 and removes the 16 kB limitation
    due to DTLS on\n   user message size by defining a secure user message fragmentation
    so\n   that multiple DTLS records can be used to protect a single user\n   message.
    \ It further updates the DTLS versions to use, as well as the\n   HMAC algorithms
    for SCTP-AUTH, and simplifies secure implementation\n   by some stricter requirements
    on the establishment procedures.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
