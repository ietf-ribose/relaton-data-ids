abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a way for SSH server applications to send additional
    information to clients as part of authentication failure. A mechanism to relay
    such information can reduce the need for end user support in situations where
    a client would successfully authenticate, but cannot log in for a policy reason,
    such as password age or public key size.</p>"
