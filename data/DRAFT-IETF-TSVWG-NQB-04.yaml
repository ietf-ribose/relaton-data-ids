abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies properties and characteristics of a
    Non-\n   Queue-Building Per-Hop Behavior (NQB PHB).  The purpose of this NQB\n
    \  PHB is to provide a separate queue that enables low latency and, when\n   possible,
    low loss for application-limited traffic flows that would\n   ordinarily share
    a queue with capacity-seeking traffic.  This PHB is\n   implemented without prioritization
    and without rate policing, making\n   it suitable for environments where the use
    of either these features\n   may be restricted.  The NQB PHB has been developed
    primarily for use\n   by access network segments, where queuing delays and queuing
    loss\n   caused by Queue-Building protocols are manifested, but its use is not\n
    \  limited to such segments.  In particular, applications to cable\n   broadband
    links and mobile network radio and core segments are\n   discussed.  This document
    defines a standard Differentiated Services\n   Code Point (DSCP) to identify Non-Queue-Building
    flows.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
