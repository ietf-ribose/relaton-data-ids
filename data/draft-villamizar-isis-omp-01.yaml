abstract:
- content: "<p>IS--IS may form multiple equal cost paths between points. This is true
    of any link state protocol. In the absence of any explicit sup- port to take advantage
    of this, a path may be chosen arbitrarily. Techniques have been utilized to divide
    traffic somewhat evenly among the available paths. These techniques have been
    referred to as Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP). An unequal division of traffic among
    the avail- able paths is generally preferable. Routers generally have no knowl-
    edge of traffic loading on distant links and therefore have no basis to optimize
    the allocation of traffic. Optimized Mulitpath is a extension to IS--IS, utilizing
    additional Type/Length/Value (TLV) tuples to distribute loading information. An
    algorithm to adjust forwarding, gradually enough to insure stability yet provide
    reasonably fast adjustment when needed, is provided in the related document OSPF--OMP
    [5]. The IS--IS encapsulation and minor differences in the dynamics of ISIS--OMP
    relative to OSPF--OMP are described here.</p>"
