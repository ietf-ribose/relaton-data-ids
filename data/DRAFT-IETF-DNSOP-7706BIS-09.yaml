abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip\n
    \  times to the closest DNS root server; those resolvers may have\n   difficulty
    getting responses from the root servers, such as during a\n   network attack.
    \ Some DNS recursive resolver operators want to\n   prevent snooping by third
    parties of requests sent to DNS root\n   servers.  Such resolvers can greatly
    decrease the round-trip time and\n   prevent observation of requests by serving
    a copy of the full root\n   zone on the same server, such as on a loopback address
    or in the\n   resolver software.  This document shows how to start and maintain\n
    \  such a copy of the root zone that does not cause problems for other\n   users
    of the DNS, at the cost of adding some operational fragility\n   for the operator.\n\n
    \  This document obsoletes RFC 7706.\n\n   [ This document is being collaborated
    on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/wkumari/draft-kh-dnsop-7706bis.  The most
    recent\n   version of the document, open issues, and so on should all be\n   available
    there.  The authors gratefully accept pull requests. ]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
