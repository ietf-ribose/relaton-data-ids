abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new architecture
    that\n   provides optimal multicast forwarding without requiring intermediate\n
    \  routers to maintain any per-flow state by using a multicast-specific\n   BIER
    header.  An extension to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)\n   defined in
    [RFC5036] for the setup of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) is\n   described in [RFC6388]
    is called mLDP, and is used for multicast-\n   specific tree building.  This document
    describes mLDP extensions to\n   setup a P2MP with BIER information, which is
    called P2MP based BIER\n   in [I-D.xie-bier-mvpn-mpls-p2mp].\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
