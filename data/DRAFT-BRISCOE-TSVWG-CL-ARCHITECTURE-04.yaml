abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a deployment model for pre-congestion
    \nnotification (PCN) operating in a large DiffServ-based region of the \nInternet.
    PCN-based admission control protects the quality of service \nof existing flows
    in normal circumstances, whilst if necessary (eg \nafter a large failure) pre-emption
    of some flows preserves the quality \nof service of the remaining flows. Each
    link has a configured-\nadmission-rate and a configured-pre-emption-rate, and
    a router marks \npackets that exceed these rates. Hence routers give an early
    warning of \ntheir own potential congestion, before packets need to be dropped.
    \nGateways around the edges of the PCN-region convert measurements of \npacket
    rates and their markings into decisions about whether to admit \nnew flows, and
    (if necessary) into the rate of excess traffic that \nshould be pre-empted. Per-flow
    admission states are kept at the \ngateways only, while the PCN markers that are
    required for all routers \noperate on the aggregate traffic - hence there is no
    scalability impact \non interior routers.  \n\t </p>\n      "
