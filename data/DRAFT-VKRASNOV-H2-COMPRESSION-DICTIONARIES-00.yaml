abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The HTTP/2 [RFC7540] protocol encourages the use of many small
    assets\n   for CSS/JS/HTML, due to its multiplexed nature.  Prior to HTTP/2,\n
    \  asset inlining was encouraged, resulting in fewer, larger assets per\n   website.\n\n
    \  The nature of the compression algorithms, such as DEFLATE [RFC1951]\n   and
    Brotli [BROTLI], used with HTTP in practice, require a certain\n   \"window\"
    of data to perform backward matching.  Therefore, larger\n   files have much better
    compression ratio.  These algorithms also\n   allow the use of custom compression
    dictionaries which can be used as\n   the initial window for backward matches.\n\n
    \  This document specifies a new HTTP/2 frame type and a new HTTP/2\n   setting
    value that would allow a compression algorithm to use\n   previously sent data
    as a compression dictionary, resulting in an\n   improved compression ratio.\n\n\t
