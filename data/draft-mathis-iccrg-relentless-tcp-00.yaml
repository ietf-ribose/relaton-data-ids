abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Relentless congestion control is a simple modification that can
    beapplied to almost any AIMD style congestion control: instead ofapplying a multiplicative
    reduction to cwnd after a loss, cwnd isreduced by the number of lost segments.
    It can be modeled as astrict implementation of van Jacobson's Packet ConservationPrinciple.
    During recovery, new segments are injected into thenetwork in exact accordance
    with the segments that are reported tohave been delivered to the receiver by the
    returning ACKs.This algorithm offers a valuable new congestion control property:
    theTCP portion of the control loop has exactly unity gain, which shouldmake it
    easier to implement simple controllers in network devices toaccurately control
    queue sizes across a huge range of scales.Relentless Congestion Control conforms
    to neither the details nor thephilosophy of current congestion control standards.
    These standardsare based on the idea that the Internet can attain sufficientfairness
    by having relatively simple network devices send uniformcongestion signals to
    all flows, and mandating that all protocolshave equivalent responses to these
    congestion signals.To function appropriately in a shared environment, RelentlessCongestion
    Control requires that the network allocates capacitythrough some technique such
    as Fair Queuing, Approximate FairDropping, etc. The salient features of these
    algorithms are thatthey segregate the traffic into distinct flows, and send differentcongestion
    signals to each flow. This alternative congestion controlparadigm is described
    in a separate document, also underconsideration by the ICCRG.The goal of the document
    is to illustrate some new protocol featuresand properties might be possible if
    we relax the \"TCP-friendly\"mandate. A secondary goal of Relentless TCP is to
    make a distinctionbetween the bottlenecks that belong to protocol itself, vs standardcongestion
    control and the \"TCP-friendly\" paradigm.</p>"
