abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is an emerging demand for solutions that provide redundancy
    and\n   load-sharing across wired and cellular links from a single service\n   provider,
    so that a single subscriber is provided with hybrid access\n   to multiple heterogeneous
    connections at the same time.\n\n   In this document, GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)
    Tunnel Bonding\n   is specified as an enabling approach for Hybrid Access to a
    wired and\n   a wireless network in customer premises, e.g. homes. In GRE Tunnel\n
    \  Bonding, two GRE tunnels, one per network connection, are set up and\n   bonded
    together to form a single GRE tunnel for a subscriber.\n   Compared with each
    composing connection, the bonding connection\n   promises increased access capacity
    and improved reliability. The\n   solution described in this document is currently
    implemented by\n   Huawei and deployed by Deutsche Telekom AG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
