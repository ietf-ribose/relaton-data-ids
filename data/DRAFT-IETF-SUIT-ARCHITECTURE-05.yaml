abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have
    raised the\n   need for a solid and secure firmware update mechanism that is also\n
    \  suitable for constrained devices.  Incorporating such update\n   mechanism
    to fix vulnerabilities, to update configuration settings as\n   well as adding
    new functionality is recommended by security experts.\n\n   This document lists
    requirements and describes an architecture for a\n   firmware update mechanism
    suitable for IoT devices.  The architecture\n   is agnostic to the transport of
    the firmware images and associated\n   meta-data.\n\n   This version of the document
    assumes asymmetric cryptography and a\n   public key infrastructure.  Future versions
    may also describe a\n   symmetric key approach for very constrained devices.\n\n\t
