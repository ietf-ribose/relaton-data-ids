abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the major advantages of SCTP is the support of multi-homed\n
    \  communication.  A multi-homed SCTP end-point has the ability to\n   withstand
    network failures by migrating the traffic from an inactive\n   network to an active
    one.  However, if the failover operation as\n   specified in [RFC4960] is followed,
    there can be a significant delay\n   in the migration to the active destination
    addresses, thus severely\n   reducing the effectiveness of the SCTP failover operation.\n\n
    \  This memo complements [RFC4960] by the introduction of the\n   Potentially
    Failed path state and the associated new failover\n   operation called SCTP-PF
    to apply during a network failure.  In\n   addition, the memo complements [RFC4960]
    by introducing of\n   alternative switchover operation modes for the data transfer
    path\n   management after the recovery of a failed primary path.  These modes\n
    \  offers for more performance optimal operation in some network\n   environments.
    \ The implementation of the additional switchover\n   operation modes is optional.\n\n
    \  The procedures defined in the document require only minimal\n   modifications
    to the current specification.  The procedures are\n   sender-side only and do
    not impact the SCTP receiver.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
