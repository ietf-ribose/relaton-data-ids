abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial\n
    \  information networks (e.g., stock market data providers), network-\n   performance
    criteria (e.g., latency) are becoming as critical to\n   data-path selection as
    other metrics.\n\n   This document describes extensions to IS-IS Traffic Engineering\n
    \  Extensions (RFC 5305) such that network-performance information can\n   be
    distributed and collected in a scalable fashion.  The information\n   distributed
    using IS-IS TE Metric Extensions can then be used to make\n   path-selection decisions
    based on network performance.\n\n   Note that this document only covers the mechanisms
    with which\n   network-performance information is distributed.  The mechanisms
    for\n   measuring network performance or acting on that information, once\n   distributed,
    are outside the scope of this document.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 7810.\n\n\n\t
