abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes several potential price and charge
    issues in\n   CDN interconnection.  It discusses some optional charge models when\n
    \  CDNs are interconnected and presents a need from Content Service\n   Providers
    (CSP) or CDNs to optimize their cost locally and guarantee\n   their performance.
    \ It finally shows how can CDNI frameworks and\n   protocols support price, charge
    and policy information exchanging.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
