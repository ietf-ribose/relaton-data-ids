abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the mechanism to associate network resource
    attributes to Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs). Such SIDs are referred to as
    resource-aware SIDs in this document. The resource- aware SIDs retain their original
    forwarding semantics, but with the additional semantics to identify the set of
    network resources available for the packet processing action. The resource-aware
    SIDs can therefore be used to build SR paths or virtual networks with a set of
    reserved network resources. The proposed mechanism is applicable to both segment
    routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane
    (SRv6).</p>"
