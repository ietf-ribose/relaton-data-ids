abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) have increased\nthe
    use of sensing technologies for IoT applications. However,\nmonitoring sensor
    nodes is still a challenging issue in\ndistributed remote environments, especially
    wireless environments.\nDifferent from conventional centralized mechanism, Fog
    Computing\nbecomes an essential role in a scalable IoT system. Fog Node can\ncontrol
    and monitor its subdomain's devices and perform aggregation\ntasks to support
    the central server at the cloud. Since node\nfault detection can strongly affect
    the performance and accuracy\nin most IoT analysis applications, fault detection
    mechanism\nshould be integrated into IoT Networks. Accordingly, these\nfault nodes
    could be detected and replaced by others available\nnodes in the same domain for
    the analysis by a distributed\nfault detection and node replacement mechanism
    based on their\nsensory values in a considered domain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
