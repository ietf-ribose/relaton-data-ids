abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an architecture for BIER-TE: Traffic Engineering
    for Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER). BIER-TE shares part of its architecture
    with BIER as described in [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]. It also proposes to share
    the packet format with BIER. BIER-TE forwards and replicates packets like BIER
    based on a BitString in the packet header but it does not require an IGP. It does
    support traffic engineering by explicit hop-by-hop forwarding and loose hop forwarding
    of packets. It does support Fast ReRoute (FRR) for link and node protection and
    incremental deployment. Because BIER-TE like BIER operates without explicit in-network
    tree- building but also supports traffic engineering, it is more similar to SR
    than RSVP-TE.</p>"
