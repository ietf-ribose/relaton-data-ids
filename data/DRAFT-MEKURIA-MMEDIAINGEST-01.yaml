abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet draft presents a best industry practice for\n
    \  ingesting encoded live media to media processing entities.\n   Two profiles
    of the media ingest are defined covering the most\n   common use cases. The first
    profile facilates active media\n   processing and is based on the fragmented MPEG-4
    format.\n   The second profile enables efficient ingest of media streaming\n   presentations
    based on established streaming protocols\n   by also adding a manifest besides
    the fragmented MPEG-4 stream.\n   Details on carriage of metadata markers, timed
    text,\n   subtitles and encryption specific metadata are also included.\n\n\t
