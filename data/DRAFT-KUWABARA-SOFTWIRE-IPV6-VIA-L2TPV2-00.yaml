abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo covers two topics: a brief summary of NTT Communications'\ncommercial
    IPv6 service named \"OCN IPv6\", and a digest of the\narchitecture, which includs
    the user network interface specification\nand some service specific parameters,
    of the service.\n\nFor NTT Communications' commercial IPv6 access service, IPv6
    tunnel\nis created over the exiting IPv4 network by Layer two tunneling\nprotocol
    [RFC2661].  By using L2TP, almost all the problems, which is\ndescribed in Softwire
    Problem Statement [I-D. ietf-softwire-problem-\nstatement] , is solved.  The NTT
    Communications service and the\narchitecture is one of a commercial grade solution
    example for\nsoftwire problem statement.\n\t </p>\n      "
