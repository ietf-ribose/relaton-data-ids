abstract:
- content: "<p>A common argument against the use of TLS is that it adds overhead.
    In this document we illustrate in detail how much (or little) processing, latency,
    and traffic overhead TLS adds. Transition to more secure cipher suites (TLS 1.2
    with AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305) actually reduces both traffic and processing
    overhead. AES-GCM combines security, low traffic overhead, and great performance
    on modern hardware. On platforms without hardware support for AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305
    gives the same benefits. For everything but very short connections, TLS is not
    inducing any major traffic overhead (nor CPU or memory overhead).</p>"
