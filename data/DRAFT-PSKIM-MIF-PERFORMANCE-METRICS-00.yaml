abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes a measurement scheme of IP performance metrics
    \nfor mobile networks with multiple interfaces in heterogeneous \nwireless networks.
    In the proposed scheme, mobile nodes (MNs) can \nget IP performance metrics irrespective
    of the presence or absence \nof measurement functionality. Since the multihomed
    mobile router \n(MMR) with heterogeneous wireless multiple interfaces measures
    IP \nperformance metrics on behalf of the MNs inside the mobile network, \nthe
    proposed scheme does not require MNs to be involved in measuring \nIP performance
    metrics. MNs can get measured IP performance metrics \nfrom the MMR using L3 messages.
    Therefore, the proposed scheme can \nreduce burden and power consumption of MNs
    with limited resource and \nbattery power since MNs don't measure directly IP
    performance \nmetrics. In addition, the proposed scheme can reduce considerably
    \ntraffic overhead over wireless links on multiple measurement paths \nsince signaling
    messages and injected testing traffic are reduced.\n\t </p>\n      "
