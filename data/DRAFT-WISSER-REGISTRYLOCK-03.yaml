abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This extensions defines an additional protective layer for
    changes to\n   domain [RFC5731], host xref target=\"RFC5732\" format=\"default\"/&gt;
    and\n   contact [RFC5733] objects managed through EPP.\n\n   EPP allows changes
    to objects only by the sponsoring client.  EPP\n   objects are usually managed
    by the sponsoring client on behalf of the\n   sponsoring clients customers.  All
    of these interactions are ususally\n   fully automated.\n\n   In case of a system
    breach, there is no protection in EPP to changes\n   to any object by the intruder.\n\n
    \  This extension defines a protective layer that aims to break\n   automated
    changes and work flows by requiring manual intervention by\n   the sponsoring
    client or it's customers.\n\n   xxx\n\n\t </p>\n      "
