abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] provides data \n
    \  integrity protection, confidentiality and data origin authentication \n   for
    data transported in an IP packet.  \n    \n   There are various applications and
    protocols that do not require \n   confidentiality but only need data integrity
    assurance or data origin \n   authentication. Since ESP support is mandatory for
    IPSec, such \n   applications end up using ESP with NULL encryption. \n    \n
    \  However, because of the way ESP is defined, it is impossible for \n   firewalls
    and intermediate routers to differentiate between encrypted \n   ESP and ESP NULL
    packets by simply examining them. This poses \n   problems for the firewalls since
    such packets cannot be filtered and \n   identified. It poses a different set
    of problems for routers since \n   such packets cannot be properly filtered, classified
    and prioritized. \n    \n   This document proposes an extension to ESP so that
    firewalls and \n   routers can disambiguate between ESP encrypted and ESP NULL
    encrypted \n   packets. \n\t </p>\n      "
