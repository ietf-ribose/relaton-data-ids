abstract:
- content: "<p>Well-Known BGP Communities are manipulated inconsistently by current
    implementations. This results in difficulties for operators. Network operators
    are encouraged to deploy consistent community handling across their networks,
    taking the inconsistent behaviors from the various bgp implementations they operate
    into consideration. Also, bgp implementors are expected to not create any further
    inconsistencies from this point forward.</p>"
