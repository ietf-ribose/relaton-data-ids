abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a Home Agent assisted Route Optimization\nfunctionality
    to IPv4 Network Mobility Protocol.  The function is\ndesigned to facilitate optimal
    routing in cases where all nodes are\nconnected to a single Home Agent, thus the
    use case is Route\nOptimization within single organization or similar entity.
    \ The\nfunctionality adds possibility to discover eligible peer nodes based\non
    information received from Home Agent, Network Prefixes they\nrepresent, and how
    to establish direct tunnel between such nodes.\n\t </p>\n      "
