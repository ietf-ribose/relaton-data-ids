abstract:
  content: "<p>RxRPC was originally designed as the remote procedure call layer forAFS-3.
    Today there are a number of anonymous RxRPC applicationswhich require identity
    assertions in order to ensure that the desiredpeer receives and processes a procedure
    call. This memo defines areplacement for the rxnull security class which provides
    a means formutually agreeing upon who is communicating, without incurringcryptographic
    overhead. It should be noted that, much like rxnull,this security object is not
    suitable for use in a distributedenvironment due to its inability to provide integrity
    protection.</p>"
