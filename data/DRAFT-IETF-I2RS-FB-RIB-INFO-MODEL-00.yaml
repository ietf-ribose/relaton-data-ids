abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an information model associated with
    the I2RS\n   ephemeral state for filter-based routing of IP packets via a Filter-\n
    \  based Routing Information Base (FB-RIB).  FB-RIBs (ephemeral and non-\n   ephemeral)
    are associated with specific interfaces interfaces on a\n   routing device, and
    process packets received on these interfaces\n   according a filtering policy.
    \ A filtering policy is a a minimalistic\n   event-match_condition-action (ECA)
    policy with only one event - the\n   reception of a frame/packet of data on an
    interface.  The match\n   conditions in the filter policy are n-tuple matches
    based on the\n   content of the frame/packet or the time of its arrival.  Filter-based\n
    \  policy allows actions which modifying the frame/packet, forward the\n   frame
    or packet, or drop the frame/packet.  Filter-Based Policy in\n   FB-RIBs engages
    before any destination based routing so the FB-RIBs\n   provide a destination-based
    default RIB that will be used if none of\n   the filters are matched.\n\n\t </p>\n
