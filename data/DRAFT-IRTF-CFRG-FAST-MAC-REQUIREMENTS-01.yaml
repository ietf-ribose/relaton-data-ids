abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo outlines requirements guiding the development of a fast\nMessage
    Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm suitable for use with\nmany IETF protocols,
    but in particular routing protocols that use a\nMAC for packet authentication.\n\nIt
    is widely conjectured that secure MACs that are fast in software\nare possible,
    and many interesting MACs have appeared in the\nliterature.  Nevertheless, none
    of these MACs have seen broad\nadoption, and none are a good match for the routing
    protocol case.\nWe hope that this memo brings together MAC designers and MAC users\nfor
    a fruitful discussion.\n\t </p>\n      "
