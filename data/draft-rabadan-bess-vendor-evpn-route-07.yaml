abstract:
- content: <p>RFC7432 defines Ethernet VPN as a BGP address family that makes use
    of Typed NLRIs. IANA has a registry called "EVPN Route Types" that allocates values
    to Route Types. The purpose of this document is to solicit IANA the registration
    of a route type value for a vendor specific usage, as well as the definition of
    the EVPN NLRI for that route.</p>
