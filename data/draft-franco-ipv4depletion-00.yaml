abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document addresses the problem of IP v4 address space depletion.This
    document proposes an easy, technical solution based on the useof two options in
    the IP packet. The IP Version is used to extendthe current IP v4 address universe
    to 25 to 30 billion IP addresses.A modified IP packet header Option 3, the Loose
    Source and RecordRouter (LSRR), is used to carry source ip version, source ip
    prefix,destination ip version, and destination ip prefix in the IP networkpacket.
    This document introduces the concepts of RIR nebulae (or IPaddress nebula) and
    mirror prefixes (or pseudo prefixes). RIR nebulaeare concurrent IP v4 address
    spaces which are differentiated from oneanother by the IP Version in the IP network
    packet header. The mirrorprefixes (/33 to /255) emulate or mirror standard prefixes
    (/0 to /31).The single host route (/32 or 255.255.255.255) is supported in all
    RIRnebulae. The new extended IP v4 universe (a new, hypothetical Internet)is comprised
    of multiple IP v4 address spaces and DNS domains of 4.2billion addresses.</p>"
