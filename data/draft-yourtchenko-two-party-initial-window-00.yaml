abstract:
  content: "<p>There are several proposals on increasing the TCP initial congestionwindow
    to a new hardcoded value and subsequent updates of thishardcoded value. This document
    explores the mechanism of dynamicallydetermining the potentially unbounded Initial
    Window. This wouldallow for the future growth after only one software upgrade
    of theexisting TCP stacks. Also this would allow automatic adjustment ofthe Initial
    Window size depending on the connectivity properties ofthe particular Internet
    host, while minimizing the retransmissionsthat result from overly optimistic initial
    congestion windowselection.</p>"
