abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines a YANG 1.1 data model for configuring global
    sets of X.509 certificates and SSH host-keys that can be referenced by other data
    models for trust. While the SSH host-keys are uniquely for the SSH protocol, the
    X.509 certificates may have multiple uses, including authenticating protocol peers
    and verifying signatures. Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor) This draft
