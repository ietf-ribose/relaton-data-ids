abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents new time-based UUID formats which are suited
    for use as a database key. A common case for modern applications is to create
    a unique identifier for use as a primary key in a database table. This identifier
    usually implements an embedded timestamp that is sortable using the monotonic
    creation time in the most significant bits. In addition the identifier is highly
    collision resistant, difficult to guess, and provides minimal security attack
    surfaces. None of the existing UUID versions, including UUIDv1, fulfill each of
    these requirements in the most efficient possible way. This document is a proposal
    to update [RFC4122] with three new UUID versions that address these concerns,
    each with different trade-offs.</p>"
