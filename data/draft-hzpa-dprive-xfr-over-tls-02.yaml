abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS zone transfers are transmitted in clear text, which gives attackers
    the opportunity to collect the content of a zone by eavesdropping on network connections.
    The DNS Transaction Signature (TSIG) mechanism is specified to restrict direct
    zone transfer to authorized clients only, but it does not add confidentiality.
    This document specifies use of DNS-over-TLS to prevent zone contents collection
    via passive monitoring of zone transfers.</p>"
