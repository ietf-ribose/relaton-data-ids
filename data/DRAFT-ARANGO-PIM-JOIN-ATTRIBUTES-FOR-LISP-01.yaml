abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines two PIM Join/Prune attributes that support
    the\n   construction of multicast distribution trees where the root and\n   receivers
    are located in different LISP sites.  These attributes\n   allow the receiver
    site to select between unicast and multicast\n   transport and to convey the receiver
    RLOC address to the control\n   plane of the root xTR.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
