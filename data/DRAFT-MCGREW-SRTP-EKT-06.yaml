abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SRTP Encrypted Key Transport (EKT) is an extension to SRTP that\nprovides
    for the secure transport of SRTP master keys, Rollover\nCounters, and other information,
    within SRTP or SRTCP.  This facility\nenables SRTP to work for decentralized conferences
    with minimal\ncontrol, and to handle situations caused by early media.\n\nThis
    note defines EKT, and also describes how to use it with SDP\nSecurity Descriptions,
    DTLS-SRTP Key Transport (KTR), and MIKEY.\nThese other key management protocols
    provide an EKT key to everyone\nin a session, and EKT coordinates the keys within
    the session.\n\t </p>\n      "
