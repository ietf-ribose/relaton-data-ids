abstract:
- content: "<p>The Softwire working group is currently discussing both encapsulation
    and translation based stateless IPv4/IPv6 solutions in order to be able to provide
    IPv4 connectivity to customers in an IPv6-Only environment. The purpose of this
    document is to describe some operational use cases that would benefit from a translation
    based approach and highlights the operational benefits that a translation based
    solution would allow.</p>"
