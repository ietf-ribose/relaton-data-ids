abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this draft, we present a two-round signing variant of FROST,
    a\n   Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold signature scheme.  FROST\n   signatures
    can be issued after a threshold number of entities\n   cooperate to issue a signature,
    allowing for improved distribution of\n   trust and redundancy with respect to
    a secret key.  Further, this\n   draft specifies signatures that are compatible
    with EdDSA\n   verification of signatures.  However, this draft does not generate\n
    \  deterministic nonces as defined by EdDSA, to ensure protection\n   against
    a key-recovery attack that is possible when even only one\n   participant is malicious.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
