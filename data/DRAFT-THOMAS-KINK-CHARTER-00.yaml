abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The KINK working group is chartered to create a standards track\nprotocol
    to facilitate centralized key exchange in an application\nindependent fashion.
    Participating systems will use the Kerberos\narchitecture as defined in RFC 1510
    for key management and the KINK\nprotocol between applications. The goal of the
    working group is to\nproduce a low latency, computationally efficient, easily
    managed, and\ncryptographically sound protocol that is flexible enough to be able\nto
    be extended for many applications.\nThe focus of the initial working group will
    be keying IPsec security\nassociations as defined in RFC 2401. The working group
    may consider\nmeans to key other protocols in the future, but the initial goal
    of\nthe KINK working group is specifically targeted at producing a low\nlatency
    and computationally efficient keying mechanism for IPsec. The\nworking group will
    not be involved with, nor should it require\nchanges to either IPsec (RFC 2401),
    or Kerberos (RFC 1510).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
