abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   QUIC is a new multiplexed and secure transport atop UDP.  QUIC
    builds\n   on decades of transport and security experience, and implements\n   mechanisms
    that make it attractive as a modern general-purpose\n   transport.  QUIC implements
    the spirit of known TCP loss detection\n   mechanisms, described in RFCs, various
    Internet-drafts, and also\n   those prevalent in the Linux TCP implementation.
    \ This document\n   describes QUIC loss detection and congestion control, and
    attributes\n   the TCP equivalent in RFCs, Internet-drafts, academic papers, and
    TCP\n   implementations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
