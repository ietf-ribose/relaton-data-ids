abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the problems of enterprises face today
    in\n   connecting their branch offices to dynamic workloads in third party\n   data
    centers (a.k.a. Cloud DCs).\n\n   It examines some of the approaches for interconnecting
    workloads &amp;\n   applications hosted in cloud DCs with enterprises' on-premises
    DCs &amp;\n   branch offices. This document also describes some of the (network)\n
    \  problems that many enterprises face when they have workloads &amp;\n   applications
    &amp; data split among hybrid data centers, especially for\n   those enterprises
    with multiple sites that are already\n   interconnected by VPNs (e.g. MPLS L2VPN/L3VPN)
    and leased lines.\n\n   Current operational problems in the field are examined
    to determine\n   whether there is a need for enhancements to existing protocols
    or\n   whether a new protocol is necessary to solve them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
