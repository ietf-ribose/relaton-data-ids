abstract:
  content: <p>This document describes an extension to the NFSv4 protocol to allowclients
    to create and write files with greater efficiency.The first proposal allows the
    server to defer creating the file onstable storage when replying to an OPEN call.
    The aim is to improveserver efficiency and scalability by reducing the number
    of requireddisk accesses when writing a file from scratch.The second proposal
    allows the server to share information about theimplementation of its change attribute
    with the client. The aim isto improve the client's ability to determine the order
    in whichparallel updates to the same file were processed.KeywordsThe key words
    "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>
