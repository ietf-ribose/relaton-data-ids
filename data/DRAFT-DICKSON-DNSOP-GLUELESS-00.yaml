abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet Draft proposes a Best Current Practice for protecting\n
    \  authority servers against MITM and poisoning attacks, using a domain\n   naming
    strategy to not require glue A/AAAA records and use of DNSSEC.\n\n   This BCP
    assumes the use of validating resolvers, which should\n   already be a BCP itself.\n\n
    \  MITM and poisoning attacks should only be effective/possible against\n   unsigned
    domains.\n\n   However, until all domains are signed, this guidance is relevant,
    in\n   that it can limit the attack surface of unsigned domains.\n\n   This guidance
    should be combined with [I-D.dickson-dnsop-ds-hack]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
