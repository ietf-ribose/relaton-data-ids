abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a set of requirements for NATs that handle
    TCP\nthat would allow many applications, such as peer-to-peer applications\nand
    on-line games, to work consistently.  Developing NATs that meet\nthis set of requirements
    will greatly increase the likelihood that\nthese applications will function properly.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
