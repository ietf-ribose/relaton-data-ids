abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a canonical string object or 'token' for verifying
    with non-repudiation the author of the token, their authority to author the token
    and, minimally, the asserted originating identity or persona contained within
    the token corresponding specifically to the originator of 'personal communications',
    or any signalled communications between a set of parties with identities. A cryptographic
    signature is defined to protect the integrity of the information used to identify
    the originator of a personal communications session (e.g. the telephone number
    or URI) and verify the assertion of the identity information at the destination.
    The cryptographic signature is defined with the intention that it can confidently
    verify the originating persona even when the signature is sent to the destination
    party over an insecure channel. The Persona Assertion Token (PASSporT) is particularly
    useful for many personal communications applications over IP networks and other
    multi-hop interconnection scenarios where the originating and destination parties
    may not have a direct trusted relationship.</p>"
