abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the Interzone Routing Protocol (IERP),
    the\nreactive routing component of the Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP).  \nIERP adapts
    existing reactive routing protocol implementations to\ntake advantage of the known
    topology of each node's surrounding \nR-hop neighborhood (routing zone), provided
    by the Intrazone \nRouting Protocol (IARP).  The availability of routing zone
    routes \nallows IERP to suppress route queries for local destinations.  \nWhen
    a global route discovery is required, the routing zone based \nbordercast service
    can be used to efficiently guide route queries \noutward, rather than blindly
    relaying queries from neighbor to\nneighbor.   Once a route has been discovered,
    IERP can use routing\nzones to automatically redirect data around failed links.
    \ \nSimilarly, suboptimal route segments can be identified and traffic\nre-routed
    along shorter paths.\n\t </p>\n      "
