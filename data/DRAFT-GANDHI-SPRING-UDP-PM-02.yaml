abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label\n
    \  Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  This document\n   specifies
    procedures for using UDP path for sending and processing\n   in-band probe query
    and response messages for Performance\n   Measurement.  The procedure uses the
    RFC 6374 defined mechanisms for\n   Delay and Loss performance measurement.  The
    procedure specified is\n   applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes for both
    links and\n   end-to-end measurement for SR Policies.  This document also defines\n
    \  mechanisms for handling Equal Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) for SR\n   Policies.
    \ In addition, this document defines Return Path Segment\n   List TLV for two-way
    performance measurement and Block Number TLV for\n   loss measurement.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
