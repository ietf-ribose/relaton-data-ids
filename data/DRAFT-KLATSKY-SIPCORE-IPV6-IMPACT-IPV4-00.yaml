abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document captures potential impacts to IPv4 SIP implementations\n
    \  when interworking with IPv6 SIP implementations.  Although some\n   amount
    of interworking translation will occur at the network and\n   application layers,
    an IPv4 SIP application may still encounter a SIP\n   message with some IPv6 values
    in it, resulting in unforeseen error\n   conditions.  Such potential scenarios
    will be identified in this\n   document so that SIP application developers can
    define solutions to\n   handle these cases.  Note, this document is not intended
    to be an\n   exhaustive list, rather to provide an overview of some of the more\n
    \  commonly encountered potential scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
