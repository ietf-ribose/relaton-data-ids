abstract:
- content: "<p>A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information on
    the current network state, including: computed Label Switched Path (LSPs), reserved
    resources within the network, and the pending path computation requests. This
    information may then be considered when computing new traffic engineered LSPs,
    and for the associated and the dependent LSPs, received from a Path Computation
    Client (PCC). RFC 7470 defines a facility to carry vendor-specific information
    in Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP). This document extends
    this capability for the Stateful PCEP messages.</p>"
