abstract:
- content: "<p>This document replaces RFC 6779; it contains revisions and extensions
    to the original document. It defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In
    particular, it describes objects for configuring parameters of the Neighborhood
    Discovery Protocol (NHDP) process on a router. The extensions described in this
    document add objects and values to support the NHDP optimization specified in
    RFC 7466. The MIB module defined in this document, denoted NHDP-MIB, also reports
    state, performance information, and notifications about NHDP. This additional
    state and performance information is useful to troubleshoot problems and performance
    issues during neighbor discovery.</p>"
