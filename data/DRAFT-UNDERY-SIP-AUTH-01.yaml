abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>HTTP Digest has some shortcomings if applied for SIP. Firstly,
    SIP \nUA has serious difficulties to distinguish the source of \nAuthentication-Info
    and Proxy-Authentication-Info headers in SIP \nforking situations. This is due
    to the absence of the ‘realm’ \nparameter in these headers. Secondly, HTTP authentication
    is \nparticularly vulnerable against MITM bid-down attacks on the list of \nalgorithms
    (e.g., MD-5, SHA-1) or the desired security level (auth, \nauth-int). Thirdly,
    HTTP authentication provides limited integrity \nprotection of only the message
    body. In SIP, important information \ncan be carried in many of the headers that
    may need integrity \nprotection. This draft proposes to add the realm parameter
    in the *-\nAuthentication-Info headers, recommends a format for computing the
    \nnonce for detection of bid-down attack and proposes a mechanism for \nintegrity
    protection of SIP headers using MIME body.\n\t </p>\n      "
