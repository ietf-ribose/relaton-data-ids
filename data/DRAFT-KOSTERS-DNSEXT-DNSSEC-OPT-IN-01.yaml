abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In order for DNSSEC to be deployed operationally with large zones\nand
    little operational impact, there needs to be included a\nmechanism that allows
    for the separation of secure versus unsecure\nviews of zones. This needs to be
    done in a transparent fashion that\nallows DNSSEC to be deployed in an incremental
    manner.  This\ndocument proposes the use of an extended RCODE to signify that
    a\nDNSSEC-aware requestor may have to re-query for the information, if\nand only
    if, the delegation is not yet secure. Thus, one can\nmaintain two views of the
    zone and expand the DNSSEC zone as demand\nwarrants.\n\t </p>\n      "
