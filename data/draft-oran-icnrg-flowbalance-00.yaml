abstract:
  content: "<p>Deeply embedded in some ICN architectures, especially Named Data Networking
    (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) is the notion of flow balance. This
    captures the idea that there is a one-to-one correspondence between requests for
    data, carried in Interest messages, and the responses with the requested data
    object, carried in Data messages. This has a number of highly beneficial properties
    for flow and congestion control in networks, as well as some desirable security
    properties. For example, neither legitimate users nor attackers are able to inject
    large amounts of un-requested data into the network. Existing congestion control
    approaches however cannot deal effectively with a widely varying MTU of ICN data
    messages, since the protocols allow a dynamic range of 1-64K bytes. Since Interest
    messages are used to allocate the reverse link bandwidth for returning Data, there
    is large uncertainty in how to allocate that bandwidth. Unfortunately, current
    congestion control schemes in CCNx and NDN only count Interest messages and have
    no idea how much data is involved that could congest the inverse link. This document
    proposes a method to maintain flow balance by accommodating the wide dynamic range
    in Data message MTU.</p>"
