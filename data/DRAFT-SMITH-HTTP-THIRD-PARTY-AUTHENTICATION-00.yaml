abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Existing HTTP authentication schemes require knowledge of the
    secret\nused to establish the client's identity be known in some manner by\nthe
    site requiring the authentication.  Some situations exist in\nwhich a site has
    a legitimate reason to authenticate a client but\ncannot be trusted with the information
    required to authenticate that\nclient.  The authentication scheme defined in this
    document allows a\nsite to authenticate a client via a trusted third-party.\n\t
