abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the virtual P2P tracker mechanism for ALTO
    clients that are embedded in P2P clients, not P2P tracker. An ALTO server does
    significant role that is collecting ISP's network information, and responding
    ALTO clients' queries of ALTO guidance. With this mechanism, ALTO server or P2P
    clients can reduce the load for selection of the list of optimized peers even
    if any P2P tracker isn't included in the P2P application.</p>"
