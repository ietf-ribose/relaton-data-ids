  content: "\n\t <p>   More and more service providers proposed VPN4DC requirements.
    That\n   is how to maintain and manage the host-to-host connectivity through\n
    \  Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPNs) between an enterprise\n   legacy
    VPN site and the virtual datacenter (VDC) in datacenter,\n   including automated
    provisioning, monitoring, and so on[VPN4DC].\n\n   This document provides an example
    solution by prototyping experiment\n   for VPN4DC auto-provision. This solution
    is focus on the network\n   side and the DC Edge, the DC inside is out of scope.\n\n\t
