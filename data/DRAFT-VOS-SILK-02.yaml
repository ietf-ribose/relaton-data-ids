abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes SILK, a speech codec for real-time, packet-\nbased
    voice communications.  Targeting a diverse range of operating\nenvironments, SILK
    provides scalability in several dimensions.  Four\ndifferent sampling frequencies
    are supported for encoding the audio\ninput signal.  Adaptation to network characteristics
    is provided\nthrough control of bitrate, packet rate, packet loss resilience and\nuse
    of discontinuous transmission (DTX).  And several different\ncomplexity levels
    let SILK take advantage of available processing\npower without relying on it.
    \ Each of these properties can be\nadjusted during operation of the codec on a
    frame-by-frame basis.\n\t </p>\n      "
