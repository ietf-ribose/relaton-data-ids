abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)
    is a  \n   protocol for authenticating clients to the access network using IP
    \ \n   based protocols.  The PANA protocol authenticates the client and also  \n
    \  establishes a PANA security association between the PANA client and  \n   PANA
    authentication agent at the end of a successful authentication.  \n   This document
    discusses the details for establishing an IPsec  \n   security association using
    the PANA security association for enabling  \n   IPsec based access control.\n\t
