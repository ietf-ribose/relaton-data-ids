abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification describes remote checksum offload, which
    is a\n   mechanism that provides checksum offload of transport checksums in\n
    \  encapsulated packets using rudimentary offload capabilities found in\n   most
    Network Interface Card (NIC) devices. The outer header checksum\n   (e.g. that
    in UDP or GRE) is enabled in packets and, with some\n   additional meta information,
    a receiver is able to deduce the\n   checksum to be set in an encapsulated packet.
    Effectively this\n   offloads the computation of the inner checksum. Enabling
    the outer\n   checksum in encapsulation has the additional advantage that it covers\n
    \  more of the packet than the inner checksum including the\n   encapsulation
    headers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
