abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies TRILL active/active edge which allows\n
    \  multiple RBridges concurrently forward data frames of the same VLAN\n   on
    links bundled by a Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group. With this\n   kind of
    connection, end nodes may increase the bandwidth and\n   reliability of the access
    at the edge of TRILL campuses. It's\n   required that no loop or duplication is
    caused by this new connection\n   type. Besides this basic requirement, this document
    outlines other\n   potential issues associated with TRILL active/active edge and\n
    \  investigates how these issues may be addressed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
