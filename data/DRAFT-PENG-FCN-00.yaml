abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This paper create a method using a simple implementation to inform
    \nthe traffic source at a very early stage that the network is becoming \noverload
    or congested and to ask the source to slow down its \ntransmission rate. For simplicity,
    the network only indicates \ncongesition to the node where data transmission rate
    will be reduced \nor increased adaptively. For the consideration of asymmetric
    routing \nand to shorten long control delay time, the congestion notification
    \nmessage generated for the incipient congestion in the network should \nimmediately
    routed back according to its source address. Upon \nreceiving this message, the
    source terminal discards this message and \nimmediately initiates its congestion
    control, then it sends message \nto tell the network node to stop adding it. To
    improve TCP  \nperformance in wireles and mobile networks, we assume only this
    \nmessage created in the network can initiate congestion window \nreduction to
    achieve separation of congestion control and loss \nrecovery mechanism. Then,
    I mention that this Fast Congestion \nNotification should be created once the
    buffer size exceeds the \nprefixed threshold and still generated though upon packet
    losses due \nto congestion until the messages inform the source redution of \ncongestion
    window reache it. However, in traditional fix networks, it \nis no need of the
    ability of packet losses to initiate congestion \ncontrol and the FCN will not
    required to be generated after packet \nlosses due to buffer overflow occurs for
    the packet losses are mainly \ndue to congestion in such environment. It is most
    noted that the \nsource address of following Fast Congestion Notification messages
    \nwill remain the same as the first one in a window to avoid reducing \nthe transmission
    rate of multiple  TCP connections simultaneously and \nimprove the fairness and
    performance either in wire or in wireless   \nenvironent. \n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
