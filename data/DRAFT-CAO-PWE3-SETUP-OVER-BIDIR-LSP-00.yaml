abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In MPLS and MPLS-TE environments pseudo wires use two unidirectional
    \nLSPs as PSN tunnels, the two PEs select LSP tunnels independently. In \ncontrast
    the MPLS-TP environment supports both bidirectional and \nunidirectional LSPs
    and PWE may, therefore, use bidirectional LSPs as \nPSN tunnels.\n\n\nIn order
    to use MPLS-TP bidirectional LSPs as a PSN tunnels for \npseudo wires some modification
    of the pseudowire signaling procedures \n\n \n \n is required. This draft specifies
    an extension to LDP that ensures \npseudo-wires are correctly constructed over
    bi-directional LSPs.  \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nThe key words
    \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.\n\t </p>\n      "
