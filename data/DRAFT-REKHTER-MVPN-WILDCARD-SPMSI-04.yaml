abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The current MVPN specifications do not define encoding and procedures\nfor
    advertising in a single route binding of multiple multicast\nstreams of a given
    MVPN customer to a single provider's tunnel.  This\ndocument defines such encoding
    and procedures. These procedures allow\nin certain situations to reduce MVPN control
    plane load (note though\nthat these procedures have no impact on the data plane
    load).  The\nprocedures specified in this document assume that BGP is used for\ntransmission
    of MVPN customers' routing information within the\nservice provider(s) infrastructure.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
