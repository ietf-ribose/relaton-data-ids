abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) over HTTPS
    transport binding and the corresponding 'ipps' URI scheme, which is used to designate
    the access to the network location of a secure IPP print service or a network
    resource managed by such a service. This document defines an alternate IPP transport
    binding to that defined in the original IPP URL Scheme (RFC 3510), but this document
    does not update or obsolete RFC 3510.</p>"
