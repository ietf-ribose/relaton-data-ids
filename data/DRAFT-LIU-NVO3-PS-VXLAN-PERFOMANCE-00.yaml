abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the number of data center tenant increased, 4K VLANs, mobility,\n
    \  broadcasting issues have become the network bottleneck. VxLAN has\n   being
    take into consideration in China Mobile IDC.\n\n   There are two implementation
    solutions for VXLAN. The first one is\n   that NVE resides in TOR (top of rack
    switch), another one is that\n   NVE resides in V-Switch established in hypervisor
    of physical server.\n   For virtualized network, it's much better to implement
    NVE in V-\n   switch because it's directly connect with Virtual Machines and\n
    \  easier for business to carry on. As we research in VxLAN solution,\n   some
    problems are take into our considerations. How much resources\n   will be consumed
    by VxLAN in a virtualized network environment. This\n   draft introduces the problem
    for VxLAN performance by test.\n\n   There is no methodology which can effectively
    evaluate VxLAN\n   forwarding performance. This draft also attempts to address
    this\n   issue, give a VXLAN performance evaluation method, especially when\n
    \  VxLAN resides in the virtual switch.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
