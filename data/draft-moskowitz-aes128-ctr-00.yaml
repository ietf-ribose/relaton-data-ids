abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the use of the AES Cipher Algorithm with
    128bit key in Counter (CTR) Mode, with an implicit counter, as aconfidentiality
    mechanism within the context of the IPsecEncapsulating Security Payload [ESP].CTR
    is a parallelizable block-cipher mode of operation. It uses theunderlying block
    cipher as a stream cipher. Accordingly, great caremust be exercised to utilize
    it appropriately within IPsec.</p>"
