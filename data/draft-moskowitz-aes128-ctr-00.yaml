abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of the AES Cipher Algorithm with 128
    bit key in Counter (CTR) Mode, with an implicit counter, as a confidentiality
    mechanism within the context of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload [ESP].
    CTR is a parallelizable block-cipher mode of operation. It uses the underlying
    block cipher as a stream cipher. Accordingly, great care must be exercised to
    utilize it appropriately within IPsec.</p>"
