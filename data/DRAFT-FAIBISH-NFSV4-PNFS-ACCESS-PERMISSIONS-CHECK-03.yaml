abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends the pNFS protocol to communicate errors
    caused \n   by inability to access data servers referenced by layouts, including
    \n   checks performed by both clients and the MDS. The extension provides \n   means
    for clients to communicate client-detected access denial errors \n   to the MDS,
    including the case in which a client requests direct NFS \n   access via the MDS
    that the MDS cannot perform.\n\t </p>\n      "
