abstract:
  content: "<p>Interface Identifiers in IPv6 unicast addresses are used to identifyinterfaces
    on a link. They are required to be unique within asubnet. Several RFCs have specified
    interface identifiers oridentifier ranges that have a special meaning attached
    to them. AnIPv6 node autoconfiguring an interface identifier in these rangeswill
    encounter unexpected consequences. Since there is nocentralized repository for
    such reserved identifiers, this documentaims to create one.</p>"
