abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for Service Assurance for Intent-based
    Networking (SAIN). This architecture aims at assuring that service instances are
    correctly running. As services rely on multiple sub-services by the underlying
    network devices, getting the assurance of a healthy service is only possible with
    a holistic view of network devices. This architecture not only helps to correlate
    the service degradation with the network root cause but also the impacted services
    when a network component fails or degrades.</p>"
