abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The International Standard Book Number, ISBN, is a widely used\n
    \  identifier for monographic publications.  Since 2001, the URN\n   (Uniform
    Resource Name) namespace \"ISBN\" has been reserved for ISBNs.\n   The namespace
    registration was performed in RFC 3187 and applied only\n   to the ISBN as specified
    in the ISO Standard 2108-1992, now known as\n   \"ISBN-10\".  To allow for further
    growth in use, the successor ISO\n   Standard, ISO 2108:2005, has defined an expanded
    format for the ISBN,\n   known as \"ISBN-13\".  This document defines how both
    of these ISBN\n   standard versions can be supported within the URN framework.\n
    \  Moreover, additional query and fragment usage related information\n   required
    by RFC 2141bis has been included.  An updated namespace\n   registration conformant
    to RFC 3406bis is provided.  It describes how\n   both the old and the new ISBN
    format can share the same namespace.\n\n   This document replaces RFC 3187; it
    also obsoletes and moves to\n   Historic status the predecessor thereof, RFC 2288.\n\n\t
