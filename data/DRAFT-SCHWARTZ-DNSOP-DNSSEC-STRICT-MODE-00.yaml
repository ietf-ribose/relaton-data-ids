abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, the DNSSEC security of a zone is limited by the
    strength\n   of its weakest signature algorithm.  DNSSEC Strict Mode makes zones\n
    \  as secure as their strongest algorithm instead.\n\nDiscussion Venues\n\n   This
    note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Discussion of this document
    takes place on the mailing list\n   (dnsop@ietf.org), which is archived at\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/dnsop/.\n\n
