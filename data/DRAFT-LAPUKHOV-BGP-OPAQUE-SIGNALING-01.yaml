abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Border Gateway Protocol with multi-protocol extensions (MP-BGP)\n
    \  enables the use of the protocol for dissemination of virtually any\n   information.
    \ This document proposes a new Address Family/Subsequent\n   Address Family along
    with new optional transitive attribute to be\n   used for distribution of opaque
    data.  This functionality is intended\n   to be used by applications other than
    BGP for exchange of their own\n   data on top of BGP mesh.  The structure of such
    data MAY to be\n   interpreted by the regular BGP speakers, rather the goal is
    to use\n   BGP purely as a convenient and scalable communication system.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
