abstract:
- content: "<p>Unmanaged large buffers in today's networks have given rise to a slew
    of performance issues. These performance issues can be addressed by some form
    of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism, optionally in combination with a packet
    scheduling scheme such as fair queuing. The IETF Active Queue Management and Packet
    Scheduling working group was formed to standardize AQM schemes that are robust,
    easily implementable, and successfully deployable in today's networks. This document
    describes various criteria for performing precautionary characterizations of AQM
    proposals. This document also helps in ascertaining whether any given AQM proposal
    should be taken up for standardization by the AQM WG.</p>"
