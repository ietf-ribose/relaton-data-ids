abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a detailed description of the QoS mechanisms\n
    \  of the 3GPP network and why encrypted IP traffic makes current QoS\n   management
    mechanisms almost useless.  Finally, we propose some ideas\n   to solve this conflict
    to allow QoS mechanisms to be applied to\n   encrypted IP traffic whilst maintaining
    the confidentiality of the IP\n   traffic.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
