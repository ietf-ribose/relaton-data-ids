abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a profile of TLS 1.2 for long-term support,
    one that incoporates as far as possible what's already deployed for TLS 1.2 but
    with the security holes and bugs fixed. This represents a stable, known-good profile
    that can be deployed to systems that can't roll out a new set of patches every
    month or two when the next attack on TLS is published.</p>"
