abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IPv6 hosts using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration are able toautomatically
    configure their IPv6 address and default routersettings. However, further settings
    are not available. If suchhosts wish to automatically configure their DNS, NTP
    or otherspecific settings the stateless variant of the Dynamic HostConfiguration
    Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) could be used. Thiscombination of Stateless Address
    Autoconfiguration and statelessDHCPv6 could be used quite commonly in IPv6 networks.
    However,hosts using such a combination currently have no means by which to beinformed
    of changes in stateless DHCPv6 option settings, e.g. theaddition of a new NTP
    server address, changes in DNS search paths, orfull site renumbering. This document
    is presented as a problemstatement from which a solution should be proposed in
    a subsequentdocument.</p>"
