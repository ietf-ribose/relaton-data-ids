abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Phase 1 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [HC98] has several
    modes\nwith different number of message passes. For those who want to save\ntheir
    bandwidth, three-pass Aggressive Mode is a good choice since\nit has minimal number
    of message passes in Phase 1.\nThe public-key primitive method in Aggressive Mode
    provides\nsignificant security advantages over the other alternatives and\nshould
    be the method of choice in many implementations. In this\nmethod, however, the
    responder must pay computational cost as\nexpensive as modular exponentiation
    BEFORE identifying the\ninitiator. This feature can be abused by malicious initiators
    for a\nDenial-of-Service (DoS) attack. The purpose of this document is to\nsolve
    this problem in digital-signature method by using falling-\ntogether (FT) mechanism
    [MI98], [MI99] in conjunction with\nstateless-connection technique [AN97] and
    an appropriate use of\nCookies [KS99].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
