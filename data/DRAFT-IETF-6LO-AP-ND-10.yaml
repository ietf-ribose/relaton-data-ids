abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an extension to 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery\n
    \  (ND) defined in RFC6775 and updated in RFC8505.  The new extension is\n   called
    Address Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND) and it protects\n   the owner of
    an address against address theft and impersonation\n   attacks in a low-power
    and lossy network (LLN).  Nodes supporting\n   this extension compute a cryptographic
    identifier (Crypto-ID) and use\n   it with one or more of their Registered Addresses.
    \ The Crypto-ID\n   identifies the owner of the Registered Address and can be
    used to\n   provide proof of ownership of the Registered Addresses.  Once an\n
    \  address is registered with the Crypto-ID and a proof-of-ownership is\n   provided,
    only the owner of that address can modify the registration\n   information, thereby
    enforcing Source Address Validation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
