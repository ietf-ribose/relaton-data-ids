abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Consider a BGP free core scenario with LDP running in the core.\n
    \  Suppose the edge BGP speakers PE1 and PE2 know about a prefix P/m\n   via the
    external routers CE1 and CE2.  If the edge LSR PE1 crashes\n   or becomes totally
    disconnected from the core, it is desirable for a\n   core LSR \"P\", that is
    carrying traffic to the failed edge LSR PE1,\n   to immediately restore traffic
    by re-routing packets destined to the\n   prefix P/m from the LSP terminating
    on PE1 to be forwarded over the\n   LSP terminating on PE2, until BGP reconverges.
    If the packets\n   originally flowing to the failed edge LSR PE1 are BGP labeled,
    then\n   the repairing core LSR P must swap the label (corresponding to\n   prefix
    P/m) advertised by the failed edge LSR PE1 with the label\n   advertised for the
    same prefix by the edge LSR PE2 before re-routing\n   the packets through an LSP
    terminating on PE2. To implement BGP edge\n   node protection in a BGP-free LDP
    core, this document proposes an\n   extension to LDP. This extension allows an
    LDP speaker running on a\n   Edge LSR Node (e.g. PE1) to inform the LDP speakers
    running on core\n   LSRs about the \"Repair\" edge LSR (e.g. PE2), as well as
    Repair LSR's\n   label for prefix P/m, if any.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
