abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 is an important enabler of the Internet of Things, since
    it\n   provides an addressing space large enough to encompass a vast and\n   ubiquitous
    set of sensors and devices, allowing them to interconnect\n   and interact seamlessly.
    \ To date, an important fraction of those\n   devices is based on networking technologies
    other than IP.  An\n   important problem to solve in order to include them into
    an\n   IPv6-based Internet of Things, is to define a mechanism for assigning\n
    \  an IPv6 address to each of them, in a way which avoids conflicts and\n   protocol
    aliasing.\n\n   The only existing proposal for such a mapping leaves many problems\n
    \  unsolved and it is nowadays inadequate to cope with the new scenarios\n   which
    the Internet of Things presents.  This document defines a\n   mechanism, 6TONon-IP,
    for assigning automatically an IPv6 address to\n   devices which do not support
    IPv6 or IPv4, in a way which minimizes\n   the chances of address conflicts, and
    of frequent configuration\n   changes due to instability of connection among devices.
    \ Such a\n   mapping mechanism enables stateless autoconfiguration for legacy\n
    \  technology devices, allowing them to interconnect through the\n   Internet
    and to fully integrate into a world wide scale, IPv6-based\n   IoT.\n\n\t </p>\n
