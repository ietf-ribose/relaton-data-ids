abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a retrieval method YANG Data model for connectionless
    OAM protocols. It provides technology-independent RPC operations for connectionless
    OAM protocols. The retrieval methods model presented here can be extended to include
    technology specific details. This is leading to uniformity between OAM protocols
    and support both nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different
    levels through a unified interface) and interacting OAM workflows ( i.e., performing
    OAM functions at same levels through a unified interface).</p>"
