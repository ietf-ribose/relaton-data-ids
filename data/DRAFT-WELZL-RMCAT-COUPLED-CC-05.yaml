abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When multiple congestion controlled RTP sessions traverse the
    same\n   network bottleneck, it can be beneficial to combine their controls\n
    \  such that the total on-the-wire behavior is improved.  This document\n   describes
    such a method for flows that have the same sender, in a way\n   that is as flexible
    and simple as possible while minimizing the\n   amount of changes needed to existing
    RTP applications.  It specifies\n   how to apply the method for the NADA congestion
    control algorithm.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
