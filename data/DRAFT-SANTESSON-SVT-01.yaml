abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Electronic signatures have a limited lifespan with respect
    to the\n   time period that they can be validated and determined to be\n   authentic.
    \ The Signature Validation Token (SVT) defined in this\n   specification provides
    evidence that asserts the validity of an\n   electronic signature.  The SVT is
    provided by a trusted authority,\n   which asserts that a particular signature
    was successfully validated\n   according to defined procedures at a certain time.
    \ Any future\n   validation of that electronic signature can be satisfied by\n
    \  validating the SVT without any need to also validate the original\n   electronic
    signature or the associated digital certificates.  SVT\n   supports electronic
    signatures in CMS, XML, and PDF documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
