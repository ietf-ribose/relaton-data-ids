abstract:
- content: "<p>WebRTC applications collect ICE candidates as part of the process of
    creating peer-to-peer connections. To maximize the probability of a direct peer-to-peer
    connection, client private IP addresses are included in this candidate collection.
    However, disclosure of these addresses has privacy implications. This document
    describes a way to share local IP addresses with other clients while preserving
    client privacy. This is achieved by concealing IP addresses with dynamically generated
    Multicast DNS (mDNS) names.</p>"
