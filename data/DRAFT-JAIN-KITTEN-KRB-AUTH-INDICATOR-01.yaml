abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an extension in the Kerberos protocol.
    \ It\n   defines a new Authorization Data Type AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR.  The\n
    \  purpose of introducing this data type is to include an indicator of\n   the
    client's authentication strength in the service tickets so that\n   the application
    services can use it as an input into policy\n   decisions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
