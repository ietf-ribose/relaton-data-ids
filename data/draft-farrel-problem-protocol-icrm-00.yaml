abstract:
  content: "<p>Procedures in place and currently being developed within the IETFencourage
    the development and agreement of clear requirements beforethe new protocols or
    protocol extensions are accepted as work items.This does not preclude nor prohibit
    individuals from engaging in suchprotocol work outside of the IETF, but it acknowledges
    thatacceptance of the work may be subject to proving the requirementsthrough a
    requirements document or through deployment and usageexperience. That work within
    the IETF on a requirements document maychange the underlying assumptions made
    by protocol developers andthereby render their work obsolete or risible is a risk
    taken by allwho spend their time enhancing the set of available protocols withoutfirst
    agreeing the requirements.At the same time, some problem statements or requirement
    documentsare very narrowly scoped to address a very specific need. There is arisk
    that the development of a solution to such a precise problem maybe non-extensible
    and may make the protocol unusable in a widercontext.This document examines the
    need to avoid tying new protocoldevelopments too tightly to the problem statement
    or requirementdocuments. It uses an example from the ITU ASON requirements forsignaling
    protocols within optical networks to illustrate howadhering to the requirements
    statement too zealously mayunnecessarily restrict the applicability of the protocol
    in a widercontext.</p>"
