abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an HTTP header that allows the partitioning of
    a single origin (as defined in RFC 6454) into multiple origins, so that the same
    origin policy applies among them. The header introduced in this document allows
    a portal to specify that resources that appear to be from the same origin should,
    in fact, be treated as though they are from different origins, by extending the
    3-tuple of the origin to a 4-tuple. A compliant user agent is expected to apply
    the same-origin policy according to the 4-tuple rather than the 3-tuple.</p>"
