abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to set up a Layer 2 tunnel over Ethernet-based
    networks. For this purpose, the ports of an Ethernet switch are configured to
    forward VLAN tag-labeled frames incoming from a certain port to another unambiguous
    port by using only the VLAN tag information. The Ethernet switches form the transport
    plane and are a part of Label Switching Routers (LSRs). In the control plane the
    VLAN tags are distribute using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) and Resource
    Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP- TE). To enable LDP and RSVP-TE
    to fulfil that function, this document proposes extensions in these protocols.
    The introduced method simplifies the control and management of wide area Ethernet
    networks and limits the distribution of broadcast/multicast frames.</p>"
