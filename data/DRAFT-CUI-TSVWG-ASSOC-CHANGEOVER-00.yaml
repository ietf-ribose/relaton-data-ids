abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Sigtran specifies association-level reliable transport for signaling
    \nusing SCTP, but in some scenarios a single association failure's \nreliability
    mechanism is not sufficient to achieve telco reliability. \nThis document specifies
    procedures for an SCTP association changeover \nsolution which will enable applications
    to meet a higher degree of \navailability. Two generic changeover solutions are
    presented in this \ndocument. One is implemented inside the SCTP protocol stack
    and the \nother requires SCTP and ULP to work in collaboration.\n\t </p>\n      "
