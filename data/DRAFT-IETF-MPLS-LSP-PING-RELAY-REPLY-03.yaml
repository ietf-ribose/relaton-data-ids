abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In some inter autonomous system (AS) and inter-area deployment\n
    \  scenarios for RFC 4379 \"Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping and\n   Traceroute\",
    a replying LSR may not have the available route to the\n   initiator, and the
    Echo Reply message sent to the initiator would be\n   discarded resulting in false
    negatives or complete failure of\n   operation of LSP Ping and Traceroute.  This
    document describes\n   extensions to LSP Ping mechanism to enable the replying
    Label\n   Switching Router (LSR) to have the capability to relay the Echo\n   Response
    by a set of routable intermediate nodes to the initiator.\n   This document updates
    RFC 4379.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
