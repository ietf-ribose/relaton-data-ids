abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes a RELOAD Usage for Distributed ConferencePlatform
    which can support a lot of meetings simultaneously. Itdesigns a new distributed
    conference architecture. In thisarchitecture the component called MCS is responsible
    for the processof media data including audio and video. Some conference UEs whichhave
    enough bandwidth or other conditions could also undertake partsof media data process.
    All the MCSs form the reload overlay. Thecapacity and state information of conference
    UEs is stored in theRELOAD overlay. One or several MCSs will be selected to provide
    mediaprocess for a meeting and these MCSs process all the transcodingand transmission
    of audio and video data, and decide which mediaprocess task could be assigned
    to Conference UEs.</p>"
