abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Roaming services allow users that have a contract with a voice\n
    \  service provider to use access resources owned by other providers\n   known
    as internet access providers.  This draft proposes a token-\n   based Authentication,
    Authorization, Accounting (AAA) and billing\n   model for roaming users supporting
    the Session Initiation Protocol\n   (SIP).  It also introduces a protocol solution
    for the proposed model\n   that is based on the Security Assertion Markup Language
    (SAML)\n   protocol and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
