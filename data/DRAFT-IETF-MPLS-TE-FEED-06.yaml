abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>One key component of traffic engineering is a concept known as
    \nconstraint based routing. In constraint based routing a topology \ndatabase
    is maintained on all participating nodes. This database \ncontains a complete
    list of all the links in the network that \nparticipate in traffic engineering
    and for each of these links a set \nof constraints, which those links can meet.
    Bandwidth, for example, \nis one essential constraint. Since the bandwidth available
    changes \nas new LSPs are established and terminated the topology database \nwill
    develop inconsistencies with respect to the real network. It is \nnot possible
    to increase the flooding rates arbitrarily to keep the \ndatabase discrepancies
    from growing. A new mechanism is proposed \nwhereby a source node can learn about
    the successes or failures of \nits path selections by receiving feedback from
    the paths it is \nattempting. This information is most valuable in failure scenarious
    \nbut is benificial during other path setup functions as well. This \nfed-back
    information can be incorporated into subsequent route \ncomputations, which greatly
    improves the accuracy of the overall \nrouting solution by significantly reducing
    the database \ndiscrepancies.\n\t </p>\n      "
