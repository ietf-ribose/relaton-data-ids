abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The ability of the system to deliver its normal service in the
    \npresence of any unexpected errors and able to recover from the\nerrors and restore
    to normal operation is called a fault tolerant\nsystem. Such systems whose behavior
    is predictable in nearly \nevery possible situation are often in redundant fault
    tolerant \nconfigurations. This document defines the various redundant fault \ntolerant
    configurations that make these systems dependable \nsystems or high availability
    systems.\n\t </p>\n      "
