abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is not currently any standardized method of dealing with\n
    \  distributed or other large scale threats other than individual\n   firewall
    and/or null routing instructions.  This Internet Draft\n   describes an optional
    BGP Capability (as defined by RFC 5492) that\n   allowed Autonomous Systems to
    self-censor utilizing the existing\n   Inter-Domain Routing system.  This capability
    does not add any\n   automatic actions and must be explicitly activated by an\n
    \  administrator.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
