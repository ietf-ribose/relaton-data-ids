abstract:
- content: "<p>It is often desirable for an application server to permit a flow across
    a firewall, as happens today when a firewall includes an Application Layer Gateway
    (ALG) function. However, an ALG has several weaknesses. This document describes
    a cryptographic technique for an application server to permit a flow across a
    firewall. This technique uses OAuth and a new PCP option.</p>"
