abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As multiple organizations interconnect their networks through
    peering\n   agreements, it is desirable to preserve the services enabled by a\n
    \  LISP overlay over such interconnection of independent networks.  This\n   specification
    documents the requirements imposed by the deployment\n   scenario in which multiple
    organizations federate their backbones\n   with the objective of running a LISP
    overlay to enable services such\n   as mobility or VPNs.  The requirements for
    policies, enforcement and\n   authoritative control of network assets are captured
    from the\n   perspective of the operator.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
