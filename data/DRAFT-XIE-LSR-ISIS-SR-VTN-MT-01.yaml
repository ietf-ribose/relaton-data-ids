abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) as defined in I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn
    aims to\n   provide enhanced VPN service to support some application's needs of\n
    \  enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.  VPN+\n   requires
    integration between the overlay VPN and the underlay\n   network.  A Virtual Transport
    Network (VTN) is a virtual network\n   which consists of a subset of the network
    topology and network\n   resources allocated from the underlay network.  A VTN
    could be used\n   as the underlay for one or a group of VPN+ services.\n\n   I-D.dong-lsr-sr-enhanced-vpn
    defines the IGP extensions to build a\n   set of Segment Routing (SR) based VTNs.
    \ This document describes a\n   simplified mechanism to build the SR based VTNs
    using IGP multi-\n   topology together with other well-defined IS-IS extensions.\n\n\n\t
