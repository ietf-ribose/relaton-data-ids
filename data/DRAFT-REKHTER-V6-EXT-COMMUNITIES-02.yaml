abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Current specifications of BGP Extended Communities [BGP-EXTCOMM]\n
    \  support IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, but do not support\n   IPv6
    Address Specific Extended Community. The lack of IPv6 Address\n   Specific Extended
    Community may be a problem when an application uses\n   IPv4 Address Specific
    Extended Community, and one wants to use this\n   application in a pure IPv6 environment.
    This document defines a new\n   BGP attribute, IPv6 Address Specific Extended
    Community that\n   addresses this problem. The IPv6 Address Specific Extended
    Community\n   is similar to the IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, except\n
    \  that it carries an IPv6 address rather than an IPv4 address.\n\t </p>\n      "
