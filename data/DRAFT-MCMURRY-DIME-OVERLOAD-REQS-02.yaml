abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs
    to be\n   able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to\n
    \  reduce sending traffic for some period of time.  Otherwise, it must\n   continue
    to expend resources parsing and responding to Diameter\n   messages, possibly
    resulting in congestion collapse.  The existing\n   mechanisms provided by Diameter
    are not sufficient for this purpose.\n   This document describes the limitations
    of the existing mechanisms,\n   and provides requirements for new overload management
    mechanisms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
