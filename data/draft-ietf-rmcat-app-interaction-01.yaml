abstract:
- content: "<p>Interactive real-time media applications that use the Real-time Transport
    Protocol (RTP) over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) must use congestion control
    techniques above the UDP layer since it provides none. This memo describes the
    interactions and conceptual interfaces necessary between the application components
    that relate to congestion control, including the RTP layer, the higher-level media
    codec control layer, and the lower-level transport interface, as well as components
    dedicated to congestion control functions.</p>"
