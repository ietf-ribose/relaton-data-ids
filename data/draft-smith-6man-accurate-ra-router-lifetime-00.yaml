abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) have a "Router Lifetime" field, which
    specifies how long the advertising router will act as a default router for the
    receiving hosts, unless refreshed with another advertisement. The field name "Router
    Lifetime" is quite general, and could easily be misunderstood to mean the bounded
    lifetime of all of the information contained in the RA. This memo more accurately
    renames this field "Default Router Lifetime".</p>
