abstract:
  content: "<p>Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC2960] provides transparentmulti-homing
    to its upper layer users. This multi-homing isaccomplished through the passing
    of address parameters in theinitial setup message used by SCTP. In an IPv4 network
    all addressesare passed with no consideration for their scope and routeablility.In
    a IPv6 network special considerations MUST be made to properlybring up associations
    between SCTP endpoints that have IPv6[RFC2460] addresses bound within their association.
    This documentdefines those considerations and enumerates general rulesthat an
    SCTP endpoint MUST use in formulating both the INIT andINIT-ACK chunks.</p>"
