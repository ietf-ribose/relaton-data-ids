abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this draft, MMP-SCTP (MMP: Mobile Multi-Path) is proposed
    to allow\n   a host to improve the transmission throughput in wireless mobile\n
    \  networks using simultaneous multi-path transmission of Stream Control\n   Transmission
    Protocol. Relevant mobility issues of MMP-SCTP included\n   are: (1) data transmission
    modes and path selection, (2) multi-path\n   handover, and (3) location management.
    Two transmission modes of MMP-\n   SCTP, i.e., the \"Data-duplicating Mode\" and
    \"Data-striping Mode\", and\n   the switching mechanism, are designed to enhance
    transmission\n   throughput for different wireless link status. Since the transmission\n
    \  paths used for MMP-SCTP may differ when an MMP-SCTP host moves, the\n   multi-path
    handover problem is defined, and a multi-path handover\n   mechanism for MMP-SCTP
    is proposed. Additionally, a location\n   management scheme is also designed in
    this draft to tackle the\n   locating of an MMP-SCTP host.\n\t </p>\n      "
