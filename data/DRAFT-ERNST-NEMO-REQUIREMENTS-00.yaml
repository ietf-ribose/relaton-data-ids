abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of traditional mobility support is to provide continuous\nInternet
    connectivity to mobile hosts only (host mobility support).\nIn contrast, network
    mobility support (NEMO support) deals with\nsituations where an entire network
    changes its point of attachment to\nthe Internet and thus its reachability in
    the topology. In this\nsituation, mobility support is to provide continuous Internet\nsessions
    not only to the router connecting the mobile network to the\nglobal Internet,
    but also to nodes behind the mobile router. This\ndocument tries to identify what
    constraints limit the implementation\nand the deployment of a potentially and
    ideally good solution, and\nwhat requirements solutions must comply with. Our
    main aim is to\nraise the discussion on the mailing list.\n\t </p>\n      "
