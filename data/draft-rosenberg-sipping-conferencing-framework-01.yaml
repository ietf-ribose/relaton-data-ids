abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the initiation,modification,
    and termination of media sessions between user agents.These sessions are managed
    by SIP dialogs, which represent a SIPrelationship between a pair of user agents.
    Because dialogs arebetween pairs of user agents, SIP's usage for two-partycommunications
    (such as a phone call), is obvious. Communicationssessions with multiple participants,
    generally known as conferencing,are more complicated. This document defines a
    framework for how suchconferencing can occur. This framework describes the overallarchitecture,
    terminology, and protocol components needed for multi-party conferencing.</p>"
