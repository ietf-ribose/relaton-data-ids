abstract:
  content: "<p>It has been recognised that the success of the MPLS depends on theability
    to better support the multiservice traffic integration withsome levels of service
    guarantees, which are not feasible to implementwith the current destination prefix
    only based packet forwardingparadigms. The efficient support for these services
    throughout the network isexpected to be possible using label based forwarding
    paradigm in thenetwork. However, the service categories and the enabling mechanisms
    to supportthose service categories are not well addressed in the currentproposals
    for the MPLS working group; the effort has mostlyconcentrated on the handling
    of the best effort traffic and associatedscalability and routing related issues.
    The goal of this document is to define a framework for trafficmanagement in MPLS
    networks. We discuss the set of mechanisms that havebeen proposed for enabling
    the implementation of the more advancedservices than pure best-effort packet forwarding,
    and the impact ofthose mechanisms with respect to MPLS network environments and
    MPLSprotocol implementation.The document describes the mechanisms and their application
    with theintent to approach the level of the traffic management capabilitiesthat
    are currently available in hybrid router/ATM or frame relaynetworks using the
    MPLS. The approach taken is that no modificationsare required in the end station
    protocol or application software in thefirst phase of deployment, while this might
    be allowed later, if deemednecessary. This document concentrates on the issues
    from the public networkoperators point of view, although most of the discussion
    applies aswell in the local network environments. Concepts and mechanisms described
    in this document are based on theprevious work done in the subject on various
    working groups of IETF andother standardisation bodies. It has been attempted
    to use applicableconcepts and terminology from previous work as</p>"
