abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft identifies the set of data that needs to be collected,
    and\n   analyzed to quantify router buffer sizes used in routers in the Wide\n
    \  Area Network (WAN).  The scope of this draft is limited to WAN links\n   that
    have link latencies of 40 to 150 milliseconds.\n\n   Reducing router buffer sizes
    has many advantages, the most important\n   being cost.  However, there is not
    much data available today to\n   effectively calculate this.  This draft details
    use cases for the\n   study, and lists data that needs to be taken into consideration
    to be\n   able to quantify the size of router buffers.  The details of the\n   individual
    measurement metrics are beyond the scope of this document.\n   Neither does the
    draft identify methods to gather the data.  What it\n   identifies is a need to
    be able to collect, and report this empirical\n   data in a readable fashion thus
    providing the ability to study and\n   compare data in a more standardized method.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
