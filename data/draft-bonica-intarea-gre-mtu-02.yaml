abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents a GRE fragmentation strategy that has been implemented
    by many vendors and deployed in many networks. It was written so that a) implementors
    will be aware of best common practice and b) those who rely on GRE will understand
    how implementations work. The scope of this memo is limited to point-to-point
    GRE tunnels. All other tunnel types are beyond the scope of this memo.</p>"
