abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS relies upon caching to scale; however, the cache lookup\n
    \  generally requires an exact match.  This document specifies the use\n   of
    NSEC/NSEC3 resource records to allow DNSSEC validating resolvers\n   to generate
    negative answers within a range, and positive answers\n   from wildcards.  This
    increases performance / decreases latency,\n   decreases resource utilization
    on both authoritative and recursive\n   servers, and also increases privacy.  It
    may also help increase\n   resilience to certain DoS attacks in some circumstances.\n\n
    \  This document updates RFC4035 by allowing validating resolvers to\n   generate
    negative answers based upon NSEC/NSEC3 records (and positive\n   answers in the
    presence of wildcards).\n\n   [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional
    background\n   information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings,\n
    \  etc.  They will be removed before publication.This document is being\n   collaborated
    on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-ietf-\n   dnsop-nsec-aggressiveuse.
    \ The most recent version of the document,\n   open issues, etc should all be
    available here.  The authors\n   (gratefully) accept pull requests.]\n\n\t </p>\n
