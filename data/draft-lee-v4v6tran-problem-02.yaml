abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has defined a number of technologies and techniques that targets
    the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. Documented techniques identify high level use
    cases and generalized options for networks. Operators may have difficulty attempting
    to apply the documented techniques to their networks since each network and system
    operates uniquely within the global Internet. Operators may require guidance on
    how to identify the appropriate technology, or technologies, and apply them to
    their specific environments. This memo describes the problem statements related
    to the transition of operator's networks to IPv6.</p>"
