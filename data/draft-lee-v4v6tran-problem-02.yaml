abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The IETF has defined a number of technologies and techniques thattargets
    the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. Documented techniquesidentify high level use
    cases and generalized options for networks.Operators may have difficulty attempting
    to apply the documentedtechniques to their networks since each network and system
    operatesuniquely within the global Internet. Operators may require guidanceon
    how to identify the appropriate technology, or technologies, andapply them to
    their specific environments. This memo describes theproblem statements related
    to the transition of operator's networksto IPv6.</p>"
