abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some operators deploy networks consisting of multiple BGP Autonomous-\n
    \  Systems (ASNs) under the same administrative control.  There are also\n   implementations
    which use only one routing protocol, namely BGP, as\n   in [I-D.lapukhov-bgp-routing-large-dc],
    for example.  In such\n   designs, inter-AS traffic engineering is commonly implemented
    using\n   BGP policies, by configuring multiple routers at the ASN boundaries.\n
    \  This distributed policy model is difficult to manage and scale due to\n   its
    dependency on complex routing policies and the need to develop\n   and maintain
    a model for per-prefix path preference signaling.  One\n   example of such models
    could be standard BGP community-based (see\n   [RFC1997]) signaling, which requires
    careful documentation and\n   consistent configuration.  Furthermore, automating
    such policy\n   configuration changes for the purpose of centralized management\n
    \  requires additional efforts and is dependent on a particular vendor's\n   configuration
    management (CLI extensions, NetConf [RFC6241] etc).\n\n   This document proposes
    a method for inter-AS traffic engineering for\n   use with the kind of deployment
    scenarios outlined above.  No\n   protocol changes or additional features are
    required to implement\n   this method.  The key to the proposed methodology is
    a new software\n   entity called \"BGP Controller\" - a special purpose application
    that\n   peers with all eBGP speakers in the managed network.  This controller\n
    \  constructs live state of the underlying BGP ASN graph and presents\n   multi-topology
    view of this graph via a simple API to third-party\n   applications interested
    in performing network traffic engineering.\n   An example application could be
    an operational tool used to drain\n   traffic from network devices.  In response
    to changes in the logical\n   network topology proposed by these applications,
    the controller\n   computes new routing tables, and pushes them down to the network\n
    \  devices via the established BGP sessions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
