abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The aim of Certificate Transparency is to have every public
    end-\n   entity and intermediate TLS certificate issued by a known Certificate\n
    \  Authority recorded in one or more certificate logs.  In order to\n   detect
    mis-issuance of certificates, all logs are publicly auditable.\n   In particular,
    domain owners or their agents will be able to monitor\n   logs for certificates
    issued on their own domain.\n\n   To protect clients from unlogged mis-issued
    certificates, logs sign\n   all recorded certificates, and clients can choose
    not to trust\n   certificates that are not accompanied by an appropriate log\n
    \  signature.  For privacy and performance reasons log signatures are\n   embedded
    in the TLS handshake via the TLS authorization extension\n   [RFC5878], or in
    the certificate itself via an X.509v3 certificate\n   extension [RFC5280].\n\n
    \  To ensure a globally consistent view of the log, logs also provide a\n   global
    signature over the entire log.  Any inconsistency of logs can\n   be detected
    through cross-checks on the global signature.\n   Consistency between any pair
    of global signatures, corresponding to\n   snapshots of the log at different times,
    can be efficiently shown.\n\n   Logs are only expected to certify that they have
    seen a certificate,\n   and thus we do not specify any revocation mechanism for
    log\n   signatures in this document.  Logs are append-only, and log\n   signatures
    will be valid indefinitely.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
