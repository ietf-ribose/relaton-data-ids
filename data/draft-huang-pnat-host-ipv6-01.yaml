abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IPv4 migrating to IPv6 is a network layer issue, it is not easy
    tomandate the application in the host to change in the first place, thenetwork
    layer may have to have a solution to support conventionalIPv4 appliations in the
    IPv6 only network, especially when there aremultiple applications need to be supported.
    This document describesa mechanism for providing a host-based IPv6 translation
    technologywhich could guarantee IPv4 application backward compatibility. A newwell
    known IPv6 prefix is used for the destination addresstranslation and network assigned
    prefix will be used for sourceaddress translation.</p>"
