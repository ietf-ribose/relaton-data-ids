abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the format of presence information. It makesdeliberately
    abstraction from issues associated with the transport ofthis information. The
    proposed format follows the W3C XMLrecommendation, such that presence information
    are valid XML documents according to a presence DTD.As several types of devices
    are envisioned to handle presenceinformation, including devices with low computing
    power andnetworking capabilities, the defined format has been kept as simpleas
    possible, with only five tags defined, two of which with nodefined attributes.</p>"
