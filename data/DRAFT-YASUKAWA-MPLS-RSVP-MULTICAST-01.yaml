abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multicast technology will become increasingly important with the\ndissemination
    of new applications such as contents delivery services\nand video conferences,
    which require much more bandwidth and stricter\nQoS than conventional applications.
    From the service providers'\nperspective, traffic engineering (TE) functions will
    be needed to\nhandle the large amount of multicast traffic.\nThis document defines
    some protocol extensions to the existing RSVP-\nTE[1] in order to establish a
    multicast label switched path (LSP).\nThe use of label switching routers (LSRs)
    with these protocol\nextensions defined in this document allows service providers
    to offer\nunicast and multicast multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) services\nin
    the same service network.\nThis protocol assumes a variable LSP topology, e.g.,
    point-to-\nmultipoint, multipoint-to-multipoint, topologies. This document\ndescribes
    how to establish point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-\nmultipoint LSPs as the
    most basic multicast topology. It defines two\nways of constructing a point-to-multipoint
    LSP: sender-initiated LSP\nsetup and leaf-initiated LSP setup. Each method has
    an LSP\nmodification function in order to adapt to dynamic changes in the LSP\ntree
    topology.\nThis MPLS architecture[10] is very flexible and can be expanded to\ncarry
    protocols other than IP multicasting, e.g., Ethernet, PPP, and\nSONET/SDH, but
    this document only defines IP multicasting (IPv4 and\nIPv6) as a forwarding equivalence
    class object (FEC).\n\t </p>\n      "
