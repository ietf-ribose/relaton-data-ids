abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document was prompted by a desire to allow deployments
    of\n   distributed SASL implementations, so that all authentication can be\n   performed
    in a one central place. It tries to fulfill the following\n   requirements:\n\n
    \  1) The SASL framework is client/server authentication, but it doesn't\n   preclude
    either the client or the server implementations from being\n   distributed.\n\n
    \  2) It might be also desirable to proxy an authentication exchange\n   whether
    it was initiated over LDAP or another SASL-supporting\n   protocol.\n\n   This
    document defines a Distributed Authentication LDAP extended\n   operation, that
    enables applications (including LDAP proxies and\n   gateways) that authenticate
    using SASL, to use LDAP for performing\n   authentication, by forwarding the SASL
    authentication requests to an\n   LDAP server.\n\t </p>\n      "
