abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The principle intention of this specification is to facilitate
    the \ndeployment of a completely internationalized domain name syntax \nand service
    which new protocols, applications and host systems can \nuse, but without disrupting
    the existing infrastructure. Towards \nthat end, this document describes a series
    of elective \nencapsulation services and protocol extensions which cumulatively
    \nallow internationalized domain names to be stored and transmitted \nin the existing
    DNS message and within application data streams, \naccording to the compliance
    level of the participating systems. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
