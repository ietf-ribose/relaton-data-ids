abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol
    (EAP) \nmechanism for a challenge-based authentication using MD5 in \nconjunction
    with the hash algorithm used to store the password \nwithin an identity store.
    \ \nThis document defines the EAP-LDAP method, which provides one-way \nauthentication
    and MD5 key generation. As a result, the EAP-LDAP \nmethod, when used by it self,
    is only appropriate for use on \nnetworks where physical security can be assumed.
    These methods \nSHOULD NOT be used on wireless networks, or over the Internet,
    \nunless the EAP conversation is protected. This can be accomplished \nusing technologies
    such as IPsec or TLS.  \n    \n\t </p>\n      "
