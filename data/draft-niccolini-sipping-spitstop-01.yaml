  content: "\t <t>This memo discusses the need for standards that support SPam overInternet
    Telephony (SPIT) prevention applications. After explainingthe general need for
    SPIT prevention applications the memo provides areference scenario for potential
    communication between entities thatmay be involved in SPIT prevention. Within
    this scenario the needfor standardizing communication is analyzed for each pair
    ofcommunicating entities. The analysis is intended to serve as astarting point
    for discussing the requirements for signalingstandards as well as for architectural
    considerations, that supportSPIT prevention applications.This memo is not intended
    to suggest any solution of SPIT signalingissues. Such work, if necessary at all,
    should be object of separatedocuments.</p>"
