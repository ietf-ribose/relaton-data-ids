abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes must complete Return Routability\n
    \  Procedure and binding process before route optimization for data\n   packet
    transmission is performed.  This requires signaling exchange\n   between the mobile
    and correspondent node.  For the current\n   specification, signaling is restricted
    to be routed to the mobile's\n   and correspondent node's home addresses.\n\n
    \  This document describes a mechanism to enable mobile and\n   correspondent
    nodes to send the signaling packets directly to their\n   care-of addresses.\n\t
