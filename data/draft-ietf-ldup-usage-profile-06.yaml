abstract:
- content: "<p>Support for replication in LDAP directory systems is often one of the
    key factors in the decision to deploy them. But replication brings design constraints
    along with its benefits. We discuss some of the factors that should be taken into
    consideration when designing a replicated directory system. Both programming and
    architectural/operational concerns are addressed and both single- and multi-master
    directories are considered.</p>"
