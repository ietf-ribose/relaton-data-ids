abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses an extension of the algorithmic translation\n
    \  between IPv4 and IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.  The extended\n   address
    format contains transport-layer port range information which\n   allows several
    IPv6 nodes to share a single IPv4 address with each\n   node managing a different
    range of ports.  This address format\n   extension can be used for IPv4/IPv6 translation,
    as well as IPv4 over\n   IPv6 tunneling.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
