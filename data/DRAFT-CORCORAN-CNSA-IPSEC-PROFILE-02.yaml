abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The United States Government has published the NSA Commercial\n
    \  National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite, which defines cryptographic\n   algorithm
    policy for national security applications.  This document\n   specifies the conventions
    for using the United States National\n   Security Agency's CNSA Suite algorithms
    in Internet Protocol\n   Security.  It applies to the capabilities, configuration,
    and\n   operation of all components of US National Security Systems that\n   employ
    IPSec.  US National Security Systems are described in NIST\n   Special Publication
    800-59.  It is also appropriate for all other US\n   Government systems that process
    high-value information.  It is made\n   publicly available for use by developers
    and operators of these and\n   any other system deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
