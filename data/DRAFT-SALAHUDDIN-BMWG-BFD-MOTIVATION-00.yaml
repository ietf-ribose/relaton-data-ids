abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        This  document  describes  the  motivation  for  benchmarking
    \ the \n        Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol. The BFD protocol
    \n        is a relatively new protocol intended to detect failures in the \n        bidirectional
    path between two network elements, with potentially \n        very  low  latency
    \ [BFD,  BFD-GEN].  The  BFD  protocol  is  being \n        implemented by several
    vendors and is being deployed extensively by \n        the  service  providers.
    \ Hence,  it  is  imperative  that  common \n        understanding  is  established
    \ for  performance  and  conformance \n        benchmarks as well as interoperability.
    \ This draft seeks to generate \n        interest on this topic in the working
    group. If there is sufficient \n        interest on this topic, drafts that address
    the Methodology and \n        Terminology for the BFD protocol could be proposed;
    before BMWG could \n        make this an official working group item. \n\n\t </p>\n
