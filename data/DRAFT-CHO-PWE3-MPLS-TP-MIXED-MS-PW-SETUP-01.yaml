abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) transport paths can be\n
    \  statically provisioned via a Network Management System (NMS) or\n   dynamically
    provisioned via a control plane. The transport paths\n   provided by MPLS-TP are
    used as a server layer for pseudowires\n   carrying client signals other than
    IP or MPLS. It may be necessary\n   to support MPLS-TP pseudowires, to extend
    across multiple domains.\n\n   This document outlines the requirements and solution
    for\n   coordinating MPLS-TP transport paths and a multi-segment PWs that\n   will
    traverse multiple domains, where some domains are statically\n   provisioned,
    and other domains that are dynamically provisioned.\n\n   This document is a product
    of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunication
    Union Telecommunication\n   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an
    MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge\n
    \  (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities\n   of
    a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
