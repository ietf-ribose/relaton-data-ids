abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has seen widespread deployment\n
    \  within individual domains, typically supporting voice and video\n   communications.
    \ Though it was designed from the outset to support\n   inter-domain federation
    over the public Internet, such federation has\n   not materialized.  The primary
    reasons for this are the complexities\n   of inter-domain phone number routing
    and concerns over security.\n   This document reviews this problem space, outlines
    requirements, and\n   then describes a model and technique for inter-domain federation
    with\n   SIP involving the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), called\n
    \  Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (VIPR).  VIPR addresses the\n   problems
    that have prevented inter-domain federation over the\n   Internet.  It provides
    fully distributed inter-domain routing for\n   phone numbers, authorized mappings
    from phone numbers to domains, a\n   new technique for automated SIP anti-spam,
    and privacy of number\n   ownership, all while preserving the trapezoidal model
    of SIP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
