abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Quantum Internet has the potential to improve application\n
    \  functionality by incorporating quantum information technology into\n   the
    infrastructure of the overall Internet.  This document provides\n   an overview
    of some applications expected to be used on the Quantum\n   Internet, and then
    categorizes them using various classification\n   schemes.  Some general requirements
    for the Quantum Internet are also\n   discussed.  The intent of this document
    is to describe a framework\n   for applications, and describe a few selected application
    scenarios\n   for the Quantum Internet.  This document is a product of the Quantum\n
    \  Internet Research Group (QIRG).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
