abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Documents published in 2013 revealed several classes of pervasive\n
    \  surveillance attack on Internet communications.  In this document we\n   develop
    a threat model that describes these pervasive attacks.  We\n   start by assuming
    a completely passive attacker with an interest in\n   undetected, indiscriminate
    eavesdropping, then expand the threat\n   model with a set of verified attacks
    that have been published.  Based\n   on this threat model, we discuss the techniques
    that can be employed\n   in Internet protocol design to increase the protocols
    robustness to\n   pervasive surveillance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
