abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses mechanisms for dynamic establishment
    of \n   bidirectional link layer connectivity of mobile nodes with \n   unidirectional
    links in Mobile Ipv6 (MIPv6) environment. \n   Requirements are derived from the
    need to support services in \n   mobile Ipv6 based on unidirectional technologies,
    for instance \n   Digital Video Broadcasting, using multicast protocols, such
    as\n   Protocol Independent Multicast Routing â€“ Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) and \n   Multicast
    Listener Discovery (MLDv2).\n\t </p>\n      "
