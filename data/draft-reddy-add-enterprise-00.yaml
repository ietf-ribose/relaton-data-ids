abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses DoH/DoT deployment considerations for Enterprise
    networks. It particularly sketches the required steps to use DNS-over-TLS (DoT)
    and/or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) server provided by the Enterprise network. One of
    the goals of the document is to assess to what extent existing tools can be used
    to provide such service.</p>"
