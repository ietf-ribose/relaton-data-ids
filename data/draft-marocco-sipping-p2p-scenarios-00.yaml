abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document provides a detailed description of some scenarios
    whereSIP Connectivity could be easily achieved only in a peer to peerfashion.
    Other than identifying use cases where a P2P SIP overlayNetwork is the only affordable
    solution, it describes how, under somecircumstances, signaling and media communications
    both to and frompublic domains can be achieved with P2P SIP. Furthermore, itidentifies
    some additional elements which can be shared by communitymembers or let out by
    access providers for extending SIP Connectivityto such limited environments.</p>"
