abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OSPF is one of the used underlay routing protocol for MSDC
    (Massively\n   Scalable Data Center) networks.  For a given OSPF router within
    the\n   CLOS topology, it would receive multiple copies of exactly the same\n
    \  LSA from multiple OSPF neighbors.  In addition, two OSPF neighbors\n   may
    send each other the same LSA simultaneously.  The unnecessary\n   link-state information
    flooding wastes the precious process resource\n   of OSPF routers greatly due
    to the presence of too many OSPF\n   neighbors for each OSPF router within the
    CLOS topology.  This\n   document proposes extensions to OSPF so as to reduce
    the OSPF\n   flooding within such MSDC networks.  The reduction of the OSPF\n
    \  flooding is much beneficial to improve the scalability of MSDC\n   networks.
    \ These modifications are applicable to both OSPFv2 and\n   OSPFv3.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
