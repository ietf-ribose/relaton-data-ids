abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of this document is to define a framework for a Layer
    2\nControl Protocol (L2CP) mechanism between a service-oriented layer 3\nedge
    device (e.g. a BRAS) and a layer 2 Access Node (e.g. a DSLAM) in\na multi-service
    architecture.  This mechanism allows to perform QoS-\nrelated, service-related
    and subscriber-related operations.  The\nLayer 2 Control mechanism ensures the
    transmission of the information\ndoes not need to go through distinct element
    managers but rather\nusing a direct device-device communication.  This document
    does not\nspecify design requirements for network elements.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
