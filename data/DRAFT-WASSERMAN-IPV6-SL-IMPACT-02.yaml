abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) introduces a scoped unicast\naddressing
    architecture, including the concept of site-local\naddressing.  Although site-local
    addresses were originally defined\nfor use in networks that were not yet connected
    to the Internet,\nthere has been work underway for several years to expand the
    use of\nsite-local addresses to globally connected IPv6 networks and nodes.\nThe
    use of site-local addresses on globally connected networks and\nnodes raises complex
    technical issues for many parts of the TCP/IP\nprotocol suite.  Many of these
    issues are caused by the fact that\nIPv6 sites are private address spaces, and
    site-local addresses are\nunreachable or ambiguous outside the borders of their
    originating\nsite.  Site-local addresses also add significant complexity at the\nIP
    layer and at other layers of the protocol stack.  In addition,\nmany of the benefits
    of site-local addressing can be achieved using\nmechanisms that are significantly
    less complex and that cause fewer\nproblems than IPv6 site-local addressing.\nThis
    document makes a recommendation to limit the use of site-local\naddresses to isolated,
    single-site networks, and offers suggestions\nfor less complicated mechanisms
    to achieve many of the benefits\ncurrently attributed to IPv6 site-local addressing.\n\t
