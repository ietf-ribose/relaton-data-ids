abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines three Notify Message Type Payloads for
    the\n   Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) indicating support\n
    \  for the negotiation of multiple identical Child SAs to optimize\n   performance.\n\n
    \  The CPU_QUEUES notification indicates support for multiple queues or\n   CPUs.
    \ The CPU_QUEUE_INFO notification is used to confirm and\n   optionally convey
    information about the specific queue.  The\n   TS_MAX_QUEUE notify conveys that
    the peer is unwilling to create more\n   additional Child SAs for this particular
    Traffic Selector set.\n\n   Using multiple identical Child SAs has the benefit
    that each stream\n   has its own Sequence Number Counter, ensuring that CPUs don't
    have to\n   synchronize their crypto state or disable their packet replay\n   protection.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
