abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IN Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), a multi-homed MN can connect to
    the \nPMIPv6 domain by using only one interface even though it has multiple \ninterfaces.
    It would be efficient when such a multi-homed MN connect \nto the PMIPv6 domain
    by using all of its interfaces. If such a \nmulti-homed MN utilizes all of its
    interfaces, flow mobility can \nbe provided that the MN handovers one or more
    flows from one \ninterface to another without re-establishing sessions. This document
    \nspecifies the layer-3 based flow mobility mechanism by considering \nthe intention
    of the MN. Here, a MN chooses the interface for sending \nthe service traffic
    and transmits the traffic by using the chosen \ninterface. The PMIPv6 domain can
    know the intention of the MN when a \nMAG receives a service flow via a specific
    network.\n\t </p>\n      "
