abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes the applicability of the Internet standardization\nefforts
    on secure electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions for\nHealth Level-7 (HL7),
    an EDI standard for healthcare used worldwide.\nThis memo heavily relies on the
    work in progress by the IETF EDIINT\nworking group. It is in most parts a restatement
    of the EDIINTs\nrequirements document and application statement 1 (AS#1) tailored
    to the\nneeds of the HL7 audience. We tried to make this document as self\nconsistent
    as possible. The goal is to give to the reader who is not a\nsecurity or Internet
    standards expert enough foundational and detail\ninformation to enable him to
    build communication software that complies\nto the Internet standards.\n \n   Even
    though we rely on and promote the respective Internet standards\nand drafts, we
    did not withstand from commenting on and criticising this\nwork where we see upcoming
    problems in use with HL7 or other EDI\nprotocols that have not been in the initial
    focus of the EDIINT working\ngroup. We make suggestions to add parameters to the
    specification of the\nMIME type for EDI messages [RFC 1767] in order to enhance
    functionality.\nWe give use cases for a larger subset of disposition types and
    modifiers\nof message disposition notifications.\n\n   One key issue where this
    memo goes beyond the current EDIINT drafts\nis the concept of non-repudiation
    of commitment to an EDI transaction.\nSecure EDI transactions should be regarded
    as ``distributed contracts,''\ni.e. not only the sending and receiving of single
    messages should be\nnon-refutable but also the connection between messages interchanges.
    In\nanticipation of this requirement HL7 usually requires a response message\nto
    be sent to acknowledge every transaction. We therefore have the\nrequirement to
    securely couple an EDI response message to its request\nmessage. Given the current
    shape of RFC 1767 this is generally possible\nonly if a response message is coupled
    with an MDN receipt and the\ncombi\n\t </p>\n      "
