abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
    profile\n   for a general purpose listing of checksums (a 'checklist'), for use\n
    \  with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  The objective is\n   to
    allow an attestation, in the form of a listing of one or more\n   checksums of
    arbitrary digital objects (files), to be signed \"with\n   resources\", and for
    validation to provide a means to confirm a\n   specific Internet Resource Holder
    produced the Signed Checklist.  The\n   profile is intended to provide for the
    signing of an arbitrary\n   checksum listing with a specific set of Internet Number
    Resources.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
