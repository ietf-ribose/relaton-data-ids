abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as "service mapping",
    to express association of overlay routes with underlay routes using BGP. The document
    describes a framework for classifying underlay routes into transport planes, and
    mapping service routes to specific transport plane. It specifies BGP protocol
    procedures that enable dissimination of such service mapping information that
    may span across administrative domains. It makes it possible to advertise multiple
    tunnels to the same destination. A new BGP transport address family is defined
    for this purpose that uses RFC-4364 technology and follows RFC-8277 NLRI encoding.
    This new address family is called "Classful Transport".</p>
