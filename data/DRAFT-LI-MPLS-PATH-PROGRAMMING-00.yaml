abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing has been proposed to cope with the use cases
    in\n   traffic engineering, fast re-reroute, service chain, etc.  It can\n   leverage
    existing MPLS dataplane without any modification.  In fact,\n   the label stack
    capability in MPLS would have been utilized well to\n   implement flexible path
    programming to satisfy all kinds of\n   requirements of service bearing.  But
    in the distributed environment,\n   the flexible programming capability is difficult
    to implement and\n   always confined to reachability.  As the introducing of central\n
    \  control in the network, the flexible MPLS programming capability\n   becomes
    possible owing to two factors: 1.  It becomes easier to\n   allocate label for
    more purposes than reachability; 2.  It is easy to\n   calculate the MPLS path
    in a global network view.  Moreover, the MPLS\n   path programming capability
    can be utilized to satisfy more\n   requirements of service bearing in the service
    layer which is defined\n   as service-oriented MPLS path programming.  This document
    defines the\n   concept of MPLS path programming, then proposes use cases,\n   architecture
    and protocol extension requirements in the service\n   layer.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
