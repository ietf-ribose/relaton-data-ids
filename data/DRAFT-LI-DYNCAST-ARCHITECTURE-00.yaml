abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a proposal for an architecture for
    the\n   Dynamic-Anycast (Dyncast).  It includes an architecture overview,\n   main
    components that shall exist, and the workflow.  An example of\n   workflow is
    provided, focusing on the load-balance multi-edge based\n   service use-case,
    where load is distributed in terms of both\n   computing and networking resources
    through the dynamic anycast\n   architecture.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
