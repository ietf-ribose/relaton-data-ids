abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Hosts may connect to the internet using more than one network
    API at\n   a time, or to a single network on which service is provided by more\n
    \  than one provider.  Existing APIs are inadequate to allow\n   applications
    to successfully use the network in this environment.\n   This document presents
    a new abstract API that provides the minimal\n   set of messages required to enable
    an application to communicate\n   successfully in this environment.\n\n\t </p>\n
