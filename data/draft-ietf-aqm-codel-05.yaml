abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a general framework called CoDel (Controlled
    Delay) that controls bufferbloat-generated excess delay in modern networking environments.
    CoDel consists of an estimator, a setpoint, and a control loop. It requires no
    configuration in normal Internet deployments. CoDel comprises some major technical
    innovations and has been made available as open source so that the framework can
    be applied by the community to a range of problems. It has been implemented in
    Linux (and available in the Linux distribution) and deployed in some networks
    at the consumer edge. In addition, the framework has been successfully applied
    in other ways. Note: Code Components extracted from this document must include
    the license as included with the code in Section 5.</p>"
