abstract:
  content: "<p>Multicast technology will become increasingly important with thedissemination
    of new applications such as contents delivery servicesand video conferences, which
    require much more bandwidth and stricterQoS than conventional applications. From
    the service providers'perspective, traffic engineering (TE) functions will be
    needed tohandle the large amount of multicast traffic.This document defines some
    protocol extensions to the existing RSVP-TE[1] in order to establish a multicast
    label switched path (LSP).The use of label switching routers (LSRs) with these
    protocolextensions defined in this document allows service providers to offerunicast
    and multicast multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) servicesin the same service
    network.This protocol assumes a variable LSP topology, e.g., point-to-multipoint,
    multipoint-to-multipoint, topologies. This documentdescribes how to establish
    point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-multipoint LSPs as the most basic multicast
    topology. It defines twoways of constructing a point-to-multipoint LSP: sender-initiated
    LSPsetup and leaf-initiated LSP setup. Each method has an LSPmodification function
    in order to adapt to dynamic changes in the LSPtree topology.This MPLS architecture[10]
    is very flexible and can be expanded tocarry protocols other than IP multicasting,
    e.g., Ethernet, PPP, andSONET/SDH, but this document only defines IP multicasting
    (IPv4 andIPv6) as a forwarding equivalence class object (FEC).</p>"
