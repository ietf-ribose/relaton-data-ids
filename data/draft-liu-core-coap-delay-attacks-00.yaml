abstract:
- content: "<p>Various attacks including delay attacks have become a topic in the
    security of Internet of Things (IoT) especially for the constrained nodes utilizing
    sensors and actuators which connect and interact with the physical world. [I-D.mattsson-core-coap-actuators]
    describes several serious delay attacks, discusses tougher requirements and then
    recommends mechanisms to mitigate the attacks. It also specifies some disadvantages
    with the mechanisms. This document proposes alternative mechanisms that address
    some of the disadvantages</p>"
