abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multiple virtual machines (VMs) created in a single physical
    platform\n   Or vServer greatly improve the efficiency of data centers by enabling\n
    \  more work from less hardware.  Multiple vServer and associated\n   virtual
    machines work together as one cluster make good use of\n   resources of each vServer
    that are scattered into different data\n   centers or vServers.  VMs have their
    lifecycles from VM creation, VM\n   Power on to VM Power off and VM deletion.
    \ The VMs may also move\n   across the participating virtualization hosts (e.g.,
    the\n   virtualization server, hypervisor).  This document discusses how VMs,\n
    \  vServers and overlay network are managed by leveraging control plane\n   function
    and management plane function and desired signaling\n   functionalities for Network
    Virtualization Overlay.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
