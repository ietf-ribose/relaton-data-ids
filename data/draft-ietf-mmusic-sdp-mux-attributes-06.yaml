abstract:
- content: <p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) provides mechanisms to describe
    attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media streams (e.g., Real-time
    Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within a multimedia session. [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation]
    provides SDP extensions to negotiate the usage of single 5-tuple for sending and
    receiving media associated with multiple media descriptions ("m=" lines). Such
    a mechanism has made it necessary to understand the semantic implications of the
    SDP attributes associated with the RTP Media Streams multiplexed over a single
    underlying transport layer flow. The purpose of this specification is to provide
    a framework for analyzing the multiplexing characteristics of SDP attributes.
    This specification also categorizes the existing SDP attributes based on the framework
    described herein.</p>
