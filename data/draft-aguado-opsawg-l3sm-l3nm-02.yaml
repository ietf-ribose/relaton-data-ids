abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC8299 defines a L3VPN Service YANG data Model (L3SM) that can be
    used for communication between customers and network operators. Such model is
    adequate for the customer to network operator conversation and plays the role
    of a Customer Service Model, according to the terminology defined in RFC8309.
    There is a need for a YANG model to be used in the communication between the entity
    that interacts directly with the customer, the service orchestrator, (either fully
    automated or a human operator) and the entity in charge of network orchestration
    and control (aka network controller / orchestrator). This document proposes a
    L3VPN Network Yang Model (L3NM) to facilitate communication between a service
    orchestrator and a network controller / orchestrator. The resulting model is called
    the L3VPN Network Model (L3NM) and provides a network-centric view of the L3VPN
    services.</p>"
