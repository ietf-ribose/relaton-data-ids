abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the fundamental and unique style conventions\n
    \  and editorial policies currently in use for the RFC Series.  It\n   captures
    the RFC Editor's basic requirements and offers guidance\n   regarding the style
    and structure of an RFC.  Additional guidance is\n   captured on a website that
    reflects the experimental nature of that\n   guidance and prepares it for future
    inclusion in the RFC Style Guide.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 7322, \"RFC
    Style Guide\".\n\n\t </p>\n      "
