abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support
    the\n   needs of new applications, particularly including the applications\n   that
    are associated with 5G services.  These applications require\n   enhanced isolation
    and have more stringent performance requirements\n   than that can be provided
    with traditional overlay VPNs.  An enhanced\n   VPN may be used for 5G transport
    network slicing, and will also be of\n   use in more generic scenarios.  To meet
    the requirement of enhanced\n   VPN services, a number of Virtual Transport Networks
    (VTN) need to be\n   created, each with a subset of the underlay network topology
    and a\n   set of network resources allocated to meet the requirement of a\n   specific
    VPN+ service, or a group of VPN+ services.\n\n   This document specifies the IGP
    mechanisms with necessary extensions\n   to build a set of Segment Routing (SR)
    based VTNs.  The VTNs could be\n   used as the underlay of enhanced VPN service.
    \ The proposed mechanism\n   is applicable to both Segment Routing with MPLS data
    plane (SR-MPLS)\n   and segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).\n\n\n\t </p>\n
