abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be used to set up Point-to-\n
    \  Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched\n   Paths.
    \ The existing specification for this functionality assumes\n   that a pair of
    LDP neighbors which support the P2MP/MP2MP capability\n   are directly connected.
    \ However, the real deployment may not have\n   all the nodes along the LSP path
    to be P2MP/MP2MP capable so that the\n   CapEx of the deployment can be reduced
    or the deployment of the LDP\n   P2MP/MP2MP can be in phases instead of updating
    the whole network.\n   This document provides a solution for finding the first
    upstream node\n   which supports the LDP P2MP/MP2MP along the path from the current\n
    \  node to the root node.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
