abstract:
- content: "<p>This document examines how policy conflicts happen, and how to address
    the conflicts. After making it clear what kind of address selection policy should
    be necessary, we proposed how to merge the possibily conflicting policies for
    each of the destination address selection policy and source address selection
    policy.</p>"
