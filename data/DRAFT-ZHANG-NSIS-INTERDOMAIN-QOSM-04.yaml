abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document has three goals. First of all, it presents our
    analysis\n   of how to use the NSIS signaling (inter-domain QOSM and intra-domain
    \n   QOSM) to fulfill the QoS control in accord with the ITU-T RACF \n   functional
    architecture. For this goal, we discuss how the ITU-T RACF\n   entities in the
    ITU-T RACF functional architecture can be mapped to \n   the NSIS entities and
    how the RACF reference points can be \n   implemented by using the NSIS protocol
    suites and QOSMs. Secondly, we\n   aim at specifying an NSIS Inter-domain QOSM
    for E2E QoS control \n   across heterogeneous IP networks and applying this Inter-domain
    QOSM\n   to the e2e QoS control in the ITU-T RACF functional architecture \n   based
    on the above ITU-T RACF analysis. The detailed description of\n   the NSIS Inter-domain
    QOSM are given and the e2e QoS control \n   scenarios in the ITU-T RACF architecture
    (including RACF Push and \n   Pull resource control modes), which will be covered
    by the NSIS \n   Inter-domain QOSM are described and implemented. Thirdly, we
    specify\n   and implement those QSPECs that will be used by the Inter-domain QOSM\n
    \  for the e2e QoS control in the ITU-T RACF architecture.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
