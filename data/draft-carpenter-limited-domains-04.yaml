abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a noticeable trend towards network requirements, behaviours
    and semantics that are specific to a limited region of the Internet and a particular
    set of requirements. Policies, default parameters, the options supported, the
    style of network management and security requirements may vary. This document
    reviews examples of such limited domains and emerging solutions, and develops
    a related taxonomy. It then briefly discusses the standardization of protocols
    for limited domains. Finally, it shows the needs for a precise definition of limited
    domain membership and for mechanisms to allow nodes to join a domain securely
    and to find other members, including boundary nodes.</p>"
