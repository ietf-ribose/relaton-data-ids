abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>If a host is located behind a NAT, then in certain situations
    it can be impossible \nfor that host to communicate directly with other hosts
    (peers) located behind \nother NATs.  In these situations, it is necessary for
    the host to use the services \nof an intermediate node on the Internet that acts
    as a communication relay.  \nLikewise, if a host of one IP address family wants
    to communicate with the host of \nanother address family, through one or more
    NATs, an intermediate node may be \nnecessary.  This specification defines a protocol,
    called TWIST (Traversal With \nInternet Server Transports), that allows the host
    to control the operation of a \nTWIST relay and to exchange packets with its peers
    using the relay, or directly \nbetween each other. \n \nThis is similar to TURN,
    but defines an alternative mechanism which is more \nscalable, cheaper to deploy,
    and is thus more likely to succeed in achieving wide-\nspread use.  TWIST is not
    meant to replace TURN, but rather to provide an \nalternative.  This document
    is a straw-man proposal, to stimulate discussion, not \na fully defined draft.\n\t
