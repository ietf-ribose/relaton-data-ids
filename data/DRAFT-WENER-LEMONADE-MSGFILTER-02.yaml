abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In a mobile environment it is often desirable to allow a user
    to\n   restrict or constrain the set of messages that will be sent to\n   the
    mobile device. There may be several reasons. The user may \n   not want to pay
    for the bandwidth consumed, they may not want to\n   to consume memory on the
    phone or they may just want to restrict\n   what they get \"bothered\" by while
    in a mobile environment. This\n   draft defines a way to allow the user to restrict
    message sets per\n   folder.\n\t </p>\n      "
