abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Digest authentication (as defined in RFC2617) is used in SIP\n(RFC3261)
    for user authentication, and less frequently for message\nintegrity of MIME bodies
    carried in SIP.  Various members of the IETF\nsecurity community have periodically
    suggested that Digest should be\ndeprecated in favor of the SIP use of S/MIME
    (RFC2633), support for\nwhich was recently introduced in RFC3261.  The author
    seeks clarity\nfrom the IETF security community on behalf of the SIP community
    about\nthe feasibility and possible benefits of using S/MIME instead of\nDigest
    in one or both of these applications.\n\t </p>\n      "
