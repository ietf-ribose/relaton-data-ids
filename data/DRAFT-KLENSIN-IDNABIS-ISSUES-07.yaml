    and the tables on which they depend.\nBased on intensive discussion by an informal
    design team, this\ndocument provides an overview some of the proposals that are
    being\nmade, provides explanatory material for them and then further\nexplains
    some of the issues that have been encountered.\n\t </p>\n      "
