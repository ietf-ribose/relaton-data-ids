abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The framework of supporting applications specific multicast
    traffic\n   in a network using Network Virtualization using Overlays over Layer
    3\n   (NVO3) has been discussed. The various mechanisms and considerations\n   that
    can be used for delivering those application specific multicast\n   traffic in
    networks that use NVO3 have been considered.\n\n   This draft discusses some additional
    considerations on how to support\n   applications specific multicast traffic in
    NVO3.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
