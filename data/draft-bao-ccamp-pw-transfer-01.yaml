abstract:
- content: "<p>As defined in [RFC5654] MPLS-TP transport path includes LSP and PW.
    And the possibility of transferring the ownership and control of an existing and
    in-use path between the management plane and the control plane, without actually
    affecting data plane traffic being carried over it, is a valuable option for carrier.
    [RFC5493] and [RFC5852] describe the LSP transfer. This memo gives the requirement
    and LDP extensions for PW transfer in an MPLS-TP network.</p>"
