abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to make a graceful IPv4 sunset, this memo described
    a method\n   helping traffic migration to IPv6.  With the growth of IPv6 traffic,\n
    \  operators could safely turn off IPv4 and evolve to IPv6-only network.\n   In
    order to achieve the goal, new traffic-migration options have been\n   proposed
    in DHCPv6 and PCP.  IPv6 traffic steering could be performed\n   using those configurations.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
