abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When communicating over the Internet using the HTTP protocol,
    it can\n   be desirable for a server or client to authenticate the sender of a\n
    \  particular message.  It can also be desirable to ensure that the\n   message
    was not tampered with during transit.  This document\n   describes a way for servers
    and clients to simultaneously add\n   authentication and message integrity to
    HTTP messages by using a\n   digital signature.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
