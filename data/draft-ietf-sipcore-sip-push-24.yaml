abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how a Push Notification Service (PNS) can be
    used to wake suspended Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UAs), using
    push notifications, for the UA to be able to send binding-refresh REGISTER requests
    and to receive receive incoming SIP requests. The document defines new SIP URI
    parameters and new feature-capability indicators that can be used in SIP messages
    to indicate support of the mechanism defined in this document, to exchange PNS
    information between the SIP User Agent (UA) and the SIP entity that will request
    that push notifications are sent to the UA, and to trigger such push notification
    requests.</p>"
