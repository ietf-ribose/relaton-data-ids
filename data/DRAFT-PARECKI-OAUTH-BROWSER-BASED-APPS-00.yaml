abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OAuth 2.0 authorization requests from apps running entirely
    in a\n   browser are unable to use a Client Secret during the process, since\n
    \  they have no way to keep a secret confidential.  This specification\n   details
    the security considerations that must be taken into account\n   when developing
    browser-based applications, as well as best practices\n   for how they can securely
    implement OAuth 2.0.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
