abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been identified as an\n
    \  appropriate technology for the determination of the paths of point-\n   to-multipoint
    (P2MP) TE LSPs.  This document provides extensions\n   required for Path Computation
    Element communication Protocol (PCEP)\n   so as to enable the usage of a stateful
    PCE capability in supporting\n   P2MP TE LSPs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
