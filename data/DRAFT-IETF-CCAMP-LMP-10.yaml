abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>For scalability purposes, multiple data links can be combined
    to form a single traffic engineering (TE) link.  Furthermore, the management of
    TE links is not restricted to in-band messaging, but instead can be done using
    out-of-band techniques.  This document specifies a link management protocol (LMP)
    that runs between a pair of nodes and is used to manage TE links.  Specifically,
    LMP will be used to maintain control channel connectivity, verify the physical
    connectivity of the data links, correlate the link property information, suppress
    downstream alarms, and localize link failures for protection/restoration purposes
    in multiple kinds of networks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t </p>\n      "
