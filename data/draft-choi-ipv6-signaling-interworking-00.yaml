abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we describe the features and requirements of QoS signaling
    in IPv6 network to explain the needs of end-to-end QoS signaling. We discuss the
    signaling interworking between IPv6 network and other network. The delivering
    methods of signaling messages in IPv6 network are also presented in Appendix.</p>"
