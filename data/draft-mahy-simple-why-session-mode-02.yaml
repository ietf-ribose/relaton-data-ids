abstract:
  content: <p>The SIMPLE working group describes one or more messages sentcompletely
    independently as "pager-mode" messages, whereas messagingassociated with as part
    of a "session" with a definite start and endis called session mode messaging.
    The SIMPLE community has receivednumerous comments and complaints from the larger
    IM community thatsession mode is more complex than pager mode messaging. However,session
    mode messaging has a number of benefits which are notavailable in pager mode,
    but these benefits have not been widelyarticulated and this value is not well
    understood outside the SIP/SIMPLE community. This document attempts to describe
    the benefits ofsession mode, such as explicit rendezvous, integration with othermedia,
    direct client-to-client operation, and brokered privacy andsecurity, in an accessible
    manner.</p>
