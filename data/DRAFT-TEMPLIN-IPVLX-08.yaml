abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF has embraced IPv6 as the next-generation Internet protocol,\n
    \  but global IPv4 deployment continues in private addressing domains\n   behind
    Network Address Translators (NATs).  This document envisions a\n   long-term IPv6/IPv4
    coexistence, with IPv6 addresses serving as\n   identifiers (and sometimes also
    locators) and IPv4 addresses serving\n   as locators (and sometimes also identifiers).
    \ This document proposes\n   an architectural framework for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence
    called: \"IPvLX\n   (IP with virtual Link Extension)\".\n\t </p>\n      "
