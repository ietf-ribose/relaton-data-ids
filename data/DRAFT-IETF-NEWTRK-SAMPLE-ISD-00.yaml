abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The proposal to define what is actually an IETF standard and
    to\n   create ways of explaining and qualifying its applicability and\n   relationship
    to other documents has been described in an\n   Internet-Draft, \"Internet Standards
    Documentation (ISDs)\"\n   (draft-ietf-newtrk-repurposing-isd-00).  This document
    provides some\n   examples of what such documents might look like.  It includes
    a very\n   complicated example (SMTP) and a fairly simple one (the IMAP/POP\n
    \  authorization specification of RFC 2195, which has not progressed\n   beyond
    Proposed Standard).\n\t </p>\n      "
