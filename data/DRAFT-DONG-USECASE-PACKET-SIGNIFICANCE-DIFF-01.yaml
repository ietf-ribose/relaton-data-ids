abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a use case of packets' significance\n
    \  difference embedded with media scalability.  With the dominance of\n   video
    traffic on the Internet, selectively dropping packets or parts\n   of packets
    from competing media streams becomes a complementary\n   mechanism when dealing
    with network congestion.\n\n   The document describes the characteristics of media
    scalability, some\n   limitations of existing end-to-end congestion control mechanisms\n
    \  through rate control and adaptation, explains why current ways of\n   entire
    packet dropping at the traffic class level using in-network\n   active queue management
    are not most appropriate to meet end users'\n   Quality of Service expectations.
    \ The document identifies that there\n   exists \"significance difference\" among
    packets or even among parts of\n   the packets within a flow, and brings out a
    new set of requirements\n   for application and network to support packet significance
    difference\n   to improve the Quality of Experience of end users.\n\n\t </p>\n
