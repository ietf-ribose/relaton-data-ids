abstract:
  content: "<p>In networks that use multiple techniques for address assignment, the
    spoofing of addresses assigned by each technique can be prevented using the appropriate
    Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) methods. This document reviews how
    multiple SAVI methods can coexist in a single SAVI device and how collisions are
    resolved when the same binding entry is discovered by two or more methods.</p>"
