abstract:
  content: "<p>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), in particular patents areimportant
    for standards development organizations (SDOs). A patentgrants a monopoly to the
    owner to control the usage of the coveredtechnology. If such a technology is becoming
    part of a standard thepatent owner can arbitrarily restrict the usage of the standard.Therefore
    all SDOs are concerned about patents in their standards.This memo focuses on practices
    the IETF may apply to cope with patentrights in its standards. The proposal is
    based on the idea of openstandards and is fully aligned to the current IPR rules
    of the IETF.The intention is to retain the mind of the IETF while enabling theconsideration
    of IPR covered proposals in a defined way.</p>"
