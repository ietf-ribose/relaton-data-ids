abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet Protocol security mechanisms, such as IP Security
    (IPsec)\n   [IPSEC], provides various security services for IP traffic.  However,\n
    \  the benefits offered by IPsec may come at the cost of increased\n   overhead.
    \ This document identifies a methodology for integrating\n   header compression
    (HC) over IPsec (HCoIPsec).  HCoIPsec proposes to\n   reduce the amount of packet
    overhead associated with the transmission\n   of traffic over tunnel mode security
    associations.\n\t </p>\n      "
