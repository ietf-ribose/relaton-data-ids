abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When using a hyperlink to fetch a resource from the Internet,
    it is\n   often useful to know if the resource has changed since the data was\n
    \  published.  Cryptographic hashes, such as SHA-256, are often used to\n   determine
    if published data has changed in unexpected ways.  Due to\n   the nature of most
    hyperlinks, the cryptographic hash is often\n   published separately from the
    link itself.  This specification\n   describes a data model and serialization
    formats for expressing\n   cryptographically protected hyperlinks.  The mechanisms
    described in\n   the document enables a system to publish a hyperlink in a way
    that\n   empowers a consuming application to determine if the resource\n   associated
    with the hyperlink has changed in unexpected ways.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
