abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Currently, it is thought that the maximum number of DNS servers
    for azone is 13. In fact, current root and some TLD zones have 13 DNSservers.
    But this is not enough for DNS stability and robustnessespecially root and/or
    TLD server, therefore, IP anycast [Hardie, 2002]is introduced on some root servers.This
    draft proposes an another approach for increasing of DNS serverhosts without changing
    DNS protocol by using 'multiple-addresses perhost' method.And this draft also
    considers what is the most suitable number of the IPaddresses for one DNS server
    name.</p>"
