abstract:
- content: "<p>Several technologies such as Traffic Engineering (TE), Service Function
    Chaining (SFC), and policy based routing are used to steer traffic through a specific,
    user-defined path. This document defines mechanisms to securely prove that traffic
    transited said defined path. These mechanisms allow to securely verify whether,
    within a given path, all packets traversed all the nodes that they are supposed
    to visit.</p>"
