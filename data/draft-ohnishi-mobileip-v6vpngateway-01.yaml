abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 [Mobile IPv6] provides mobility functions for IPv6. It
    can also be used for public mobility services. One of the most important services
    is the VPN service enabling users to access their Intranets from outside. Mobile
    IP does not work well with VPN, however, and this issue is being discussed in
    the Mobile IP WG [VPN problem]. This document proposes a simple mechanism that
    combines VPN and Mobile IP functions. This mechanism uses a hierarchical HA architecture
    and includes an HA with GW functions, called a Gateway Home Agent (GHA).</p>"
