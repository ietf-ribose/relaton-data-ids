abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In SIMPLE based presence and messaging applications, it is necessary
    \nfor  the user to be able to configure a number of pieces of information. \nOne
    of the most common types of information is a list of URIs. List \nmanagement is
    useful outside the scope of SIMPLE as well, for instance \nin conferencing. There
    are many reasons why it would be beneficial to \nmanage the lists in a similar
    fashion regardless of the application. \nBefore the selection of the actual protocol(s)
    to manage the lists there \nis a need to describe their semantics on an abstract
    level. This \ndocument proposes the semantics for SIMPLE list manipulation protocol.
