abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Trickle algorithm used in RPL routing protocol suffers from
    some\n   issues related to power, network convergence time and overhead and\n
    \  load-distribution. To optimize this algorithm for Low-power and Lossy\n   Networks
    (LLNs), a new algorithm called Drizzle is introduced.\n   Drizzle uses an adaptive
    suppression mechanism that permits the nodes\n   to have different transmission
    probabilities, which are consistent\n   with their transmission history. Compared
    to Trickle, Drizzle removes\n   the listen-only period from Drizzle's intervals,
    thus, leading to\n   faster convergence time. Furthermore, a new policy for setting
    the\n   redundancy coefficient has been used to mitigate the negative effect\n
    \  of the short-listen problem presented when removing the listen-only\n   period
    and to further boost the fairness in the network.\n\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
