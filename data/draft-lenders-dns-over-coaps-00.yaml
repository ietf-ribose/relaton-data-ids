abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a protocol for sending DNS messages over the
    DTLS-Secured Constrained Application Protocol (CoAPS). Using the REST architecture
    specified in CoAP and the security features of DTLS, DNS over CoAPS provides encrypted
    DNS messages for constrained devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) based on
    common interfaces. Discussion Venues This note is to be removed before publishing
    as an RFC. Discussion of this document takes place on TODO Source for this draft
    and an issue tracker can be found at https://github.com/anr-bmbf-pivot/draft-dns-over-coaps.</p>"
