abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a need to simplify network operations for multicast\n
    \  services.  Current solutions require a tree-building control plane to\n   build
    and maintain end-to-end tree state per flow, impacting router\n   state capacity
    and network convergence times.  Multi-point tree\n   building protocols are often
    considered complex to deploy and debug\n   and may include mechanics from legacy
    use-cases and/or assumptions\n   which no longer apply to the current use-cases.
    \ When multicast\n   services are transiting a provider network through an overlay,
    the\n   core network has a choice to either aggregate customer state into a\n
    \  minimum set of core states resulting in flooding traffic to unwanted\n   network
    end-points, or to map per-customer, per-flow tree state\n   directly into the
    provider core state amplifying the network-wide\n   state problem.\n\n\t </p>\n
