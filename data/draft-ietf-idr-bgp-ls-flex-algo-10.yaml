abstract:
- content: "<p>Flexible Algorithm is a solution that allows routing protocols (viz.
    OSPF and IS-IS) to compute paths over a network based on user-defined (and hence,
    flexible) constraints and metrics. The computation is performed by routers participating
    in the specific network in a distributed manner using a Flexible Algorithm Definition.
    This Definition is provisioned on one or more routers and propagated through the
    network by OSPF and IS-IS flooding. BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) enables the collection
    of various topology information from the network. This document defines extensions
    to the BGP-LS address family to advertise the Flexible Algorithm Definition as
    a part of the topology information from the network.</p>"
