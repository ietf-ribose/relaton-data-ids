abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IKEv2 supports mutual authentication of the peers but does notsupport
    platform integrity validation of the peers nor does itsupport the exchange of
    data related to the platform integrityvalidation. This extension allows platform
    integrity validationdata to be exchanged from one peer (initiator) to another(respondent),
    allowing the other peer to either use the data forstatistical analysis, pass it
    along to a validation entity forvalidation or pass it along to a Fraud Information
    Gathering Systemfor fraud detection or analysis.</p>"
