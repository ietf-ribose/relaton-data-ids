abstract:
  content: "<p>This document is a proposal to add new event/signal packages and termi-nation
    classes to the Megaco protocol [3], to support an IP telephoneMG. The proposal
    covers the requirements (section 3), design approach(section 4) and resource/termination
    model (section 5) to be used for IPtelephones. The new event/signal packages and
    termination classes aredefined in sections 6 and 7 respectively. Megaco protocol
    issuesaffecting effective implementation of IP telephones, includingcomplexity,
    reliable transport, message encoding, security and othersare presented in section
    8. The proposal represents a current view fromthe TIA working group on IP telephone
    specification, TIA TR-41.3.4, withthe intent of using this as part of its 'whole
    device' specification asa method of device control.</p>"
