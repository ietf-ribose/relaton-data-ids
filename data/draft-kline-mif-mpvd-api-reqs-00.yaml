abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 7556 [RFC7556] provides the essential conceptual guidance an API
    designer would need to support use of PvDs. This document aims to capture the
    requirements for an API that can be used by applications that would be considered
    "advanced", according to section 6.3 [1] of RFC 7556 [RFC7556]. The "basic" [2]
    and "intermediate" [3] API support levels can in principle be implemented by means
    of layers wrapping the advanced API.</p>
