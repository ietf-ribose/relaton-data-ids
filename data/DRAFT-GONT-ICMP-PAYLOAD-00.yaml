abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The original ICMP specification states that when a packet elicits
    an\n   ICMP error message, the IP header plus the next 64 bits of the\n   original
    datagram must be returned in the payload of the ICMP error\n   message.  This
    imposes a constraint on the design of transport-layer\n   protocols, which are
    forced to include all the relevant information\n   needed to identify an instance
    of communication in the first 64 bits\n   of their protocol header.  It also limits
    the amount of data from the\n   original packet available to the transport-layer
    when acting on the\n   ICMP error message.  Including only the first 64 bits of
    the original\n   datagram's payload may also not be enough to demultiplex ICMP
    error\n   messages if IP is being used to tunnel some other network-layer\n   protocol.
    \ This document proposes to increase the amount of data of\n   the original datagram
    to be included in the payload of ICMP error\n   messages.\n\t </p>\n      "
