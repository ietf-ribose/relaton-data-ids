abstract:
- content: "<p>The Softwire working group standardized both encapsulation and translation
    based stateless IPv4/IPv6 solutions in order to be able to provide IPv4 connectivity
    to customers in an IPv6-Only environment. The purpose of this document is to describe
    some operational use cases that would benefit from a translation based approach
    and highlights the operational benefits that a translation based solution would
    allow.</p>"
