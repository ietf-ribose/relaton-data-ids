    printers and printer services, for use with directories that support Lightweight

    attributes listed in Appendix E of Internet Printing Protocol/1.1 (IPP) (RFC 2911).
    A few additional printer attributes are based on definitions in the Printer MIB
    (RFC 1759). This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
