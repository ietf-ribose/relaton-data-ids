abstract:
- content: "<p>Despite the variety of ways to realize mobility support in IP, there
    is a common set of threats that each IP mobility protocol must address. Awareness
    of these threats is paramount for protocol engineers so that they can build appropriate
    security mechanisms into their protocols. This document defines a threat model
    that can serve as a guidance for protocol engineers.</p>"
