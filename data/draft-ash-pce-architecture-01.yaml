abstract:
  content: "<p>Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block fortraffic
    engineering systems such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)and Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. Pathcomputation in large, multi-domain,
    multi-region or multi-layersnetworks is highly complex and may require special
    computationalcomponents and cooperation between the different network domains.This
    document specifies the architecture for a Path Computation Element(PCE)-based
    model to address this problem space.</p>"
