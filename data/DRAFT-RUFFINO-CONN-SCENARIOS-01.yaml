abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet Draft aims at describing a wide spread set of
    possible\n   connectivity scenarios involving mobile ad-hoc networks, in order
    to\n   provide reference for standardization effort in this field.  The\n   aspects
    considered for definition and classification of the scenarios\n   are number and
    characteristics of the gateways that connect MANET\n   nodes to external networks.
    \ Analysis will range from a scenario\n   where no connectivity is provided, i.e.
    an isolated MANET, to more\n   complex scenario where a MANET has multiple mobile
    Gateways.\n\t </p>\n      "
