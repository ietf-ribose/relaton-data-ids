abstract:
- content: "<p>Within a Segment Routing domain, segment routed measurement packets
    can be sent along pre-determined paths. This enables new kinds of measurements.
    Connectivity monitoring allows to supervise the state and performance of a connection
    or a (sub)path from one or a few central monitoring systems. This document specifies
    a suitable type-P connectivity monitoring metric.</p>"
