abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an authentication service that uses
    the\n   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) transported employing\n   Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP) messages.  As such, it\n   defines an EAP lower layer
    based on CoAP called CoAP-EAP.  One of the\n   main goals is to authenticate a
    CoAP-enabled IoT device (EAP peer)\n   that intends to join a security domain
    managed by a Controller (EAP\n   authenticator).  Secondly, it allows deriving
    key material to protect\n   CoAP messages exchanged between them based on Object
    Security for\n   Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), enabling the establishment\n
    \  of a security association between them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
