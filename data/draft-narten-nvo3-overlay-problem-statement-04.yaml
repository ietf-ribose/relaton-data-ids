abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes issues associated with providing multi- tenancy
    in large data center networks that require an overlay-based network virtualization
    approach to addressing them. A key multi- tenancy requirement is traffic isolation,
    so that a tenant's traffic is not visible to any other tenant. This isolation
    can be achieved by assigning one or more virtual networks to each tenant such
    that traffic within a virtual network is isolated from traffic in other virtual
    networks. The primary functionality required is provisioning virtual networks,
    associating a virtual machine's virtual network interface(s) with the appropriate
    virtual network, and maintaining that association as the virtual machine is activated,
    migrated and/or deactivated. Use of an overlay-based approach enables scalable
    deployment on large network infrastructures.</p>"
