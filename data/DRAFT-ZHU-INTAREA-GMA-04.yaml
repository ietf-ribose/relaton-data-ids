abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Today, a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple\n
    \  networks, e.g. Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, and DSL. It is desirable to combine\n   them
    seamlessly to improve quality of experience. Such\n   optimization requires additional
    control information, e.g.\n   Sequence Number, in each (IP) data packet. This
    document presents\n   a new light-weight and flexible encapsulation protocol for
    this\n   need. The solution has been developed by the authors based on\n   their
    experiences in multiple standards bodies including the IETF\n   and 3GPP, but
    is not an Internet Standard and does not represent\n   the consensus opinion of
    the IETF. This document will enable other\n   developers to build interoperable
    implementations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
