abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document first discusses the use of locators and identifiers
    in\n   mobility management architectures, and their implication on various\n   anchorless
    properties.  A new architecture is then proposed that is\n   purely based on identifiers,
    and more specifically names as defined\n   in Hybrid-ICN (hICN).  The document
    then focuses on two main cases:\n   the end-point sends data (data producer) or
    the end-point receives\n   data (data consumer).  These two cases are taken into
    account\n   entirely to provide anchorless mobility management in hICN.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
