abstract:
- content: "<p>An Entity Attestation Token (EAT) provides a signed (attested) set
    of claims that describe state and characteristics of an entity, typically a device
    like a phone or an IoT device. These claims are used by a relying party to determine
    how much it wishes to trust the entity. An EAT is either a CWT or JWT with some
    attestation-oriented claims. To a large degree, all this document does is extend
    CWT and JWT. Contributing TBD</p>"
