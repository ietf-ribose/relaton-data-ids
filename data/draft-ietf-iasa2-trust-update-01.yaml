abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo updates the process for selection of trustees for the IETF
    Trust. Previously, the Internet Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) members
    also acted as trustees, but the IAOC has been eliminated as part of an update
    of the structure of the Internet Administrative Support Activity (IASA). This
    memo specifies that the trustees shall be selected separately. This memo updates
    RFCs 4071 and 4371 with regards to the selection of trustees. All other aspects
    of the IETF Trust remain as they are today.</p>"
