abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a family of deterministically generated
    Nothing\n   Up My Sleeve (NUMS) elliptic curves over prime fields offering high\n
    \  practical security in cryptographic applications, including Transport\n   Layer
    Security (TLS) and X.509 certificates.  The domain parameters\n   are defined
    for both classical Weierstrass curves, for compatibility\n   with existing applications,
    and modern twisted Edwards curves,\n   allowing further efficiency improvements
    for a given security level.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
