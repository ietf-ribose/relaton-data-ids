abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Although access control for home servers is very important,\n
    \  managements and setups of access controls are difficult for most of\n   users.
    \ \"Connecting a new node to the same link\" is easiest way of\n   access control.
    \ One of solutions is to use link-local addresses for\n   communications of clients
    and servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
