abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To support IP-based group mobile communication, such as mobile
    IPTV,\nIP multicasting is required. Two major constraints in mobile\nmulticasting
    are the tunnel convergence problem and high handover\nlatency. To reduce the constraints,
    several mobile multicasting\nschemes based on Mobile IP have been proposed. To
    meet requirements,\nwe present a multicasting architecture and fast handover scheme
    for\nProxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).\n\t </p>\n      "
