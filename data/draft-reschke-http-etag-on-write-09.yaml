abstract:
  content: <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) specifies a state identifier,called
    "Entity Tag", to be returned in the "ETag" response header.However, the description
    of this header for write operations such asPUT is incomplete, and has caused confusion
    among developers andprotocol designers, and potentially interoperability problems.This
    document explains the problem in detail and suggests both aclarification for a
    revision to the HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC2616)and a new header for use in responses,
    making HTTP entity tags moreuseful for user agents that want to avoid round-trips
    to the serverafter modifying a resource.</p>
