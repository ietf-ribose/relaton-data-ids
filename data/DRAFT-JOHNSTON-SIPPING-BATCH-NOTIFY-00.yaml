abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo specifies the requirements and mechanism for a SIP events\nextension
    where bulk SIP event information can be shared between two\npeers both with the
    ability and authority to act as notifiers for\nthis information.  An example application
    use case is the transition\nof event state information during a backup/recovery
    sequence between\nevent state servers.  This document is targeted at addressing
    server\noverflow conditions that include the possibilities of the size of\nindividual
    notification messages getting excessive and the processing\nof state information
    by both the subscriber and notifier also\nbecoming excessive.\n\t </p>\n      "
