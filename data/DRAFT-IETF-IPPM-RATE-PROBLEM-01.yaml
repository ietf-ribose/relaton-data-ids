abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a rate measurement scenario which has wide-spread
    attention\n   of Internet access subscribers and seemingly all industry players,\n
    \  including regulators.  This memo presents an access rate-measurement\n   problem
    statement for IP Performance Metrics.  Key test protocol\n   aspects require the
    ability to control packet size on the tested path\n   and enable asymmetrical
    packet size testing in a controller-responder\n   architecture.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
