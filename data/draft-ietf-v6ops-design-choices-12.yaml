abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents advice on certain routing-related design choices
    that arise when designing IPv6 networks (both dual-stack and IPv6-only). The intended
    audience is someone designing an IPv6 network who is knowledgeable about best
    current practices around IPv4 network design, and wishes to learn the corresponding
    practices for IPv6.</p>"
