abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing(SR) Policies can be advertised using BGP. An SR Policy
    may has lots of constraints, and as the application and features evolve, the SR
    Policy may need have more and more attribute constraints. To avoid modifying BGP
    when constraints are added to an SR Policy, we can define a template. The identifier
    and content of the template are defined by the receiver of the SR Policy. The
    advertiser of an SR policy only needs to know the ID of the template. When advertising
    SR policy, the advertiser carries the template ID in the tunnel encapsulation
    information of the SR policy. After receiving the SR Policy information, the receiver
    obtains the corresponding template and content according to the template ID, thereby
    obtaining abundant constraint configuration information.</p>"
