abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC5070-bis provides XML-based data representation on incident\n
    \  information, but the use of the IODEF data model is not limited to\n   XML.
    \ JSON representation is sometimes preferred since it is easy to\n   handle from
    certain programming environments.  This draft represents\n   the IODEF data model
    in JSON.  Note that this 00 version draft is\n   prepared for the purpose of encouraging
    discussion on the need for\n   JSON representation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
