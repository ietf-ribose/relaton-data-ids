abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   While MPLS is deployed further and further to the access network,
    a\n   converging network edge point which provides both MPLS and PON access\n
    \  capability appears. To provide resiliency for its services, multi-\n   homing
    is needed to support PON access in MPLS. This document\n   describes the multi-chassis
    PON protection architecture in MPLS and\n   also proposes the ICCP extension to
    support it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
