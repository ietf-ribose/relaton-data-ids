abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a way to synchronise existing trust anchors
    automatically between a child zone and its parent. The protocol can be used for
    other Resource Records that are required to delegate from a parent to a child
    such as NS and glue records. The synchronization allows for a third party to be
    involved, thus the protocol is suitable for both cases, whether you have to communicate
    to the registry or to the registrar.</p>"
