abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a protocol for conveying binary MIME content
    in\nnear-real time, peer-to-peer or through one or more relays, with the\nopportunity
    for store and forward. SIMS (SIMPLE Instant Messaging\nSessions) can be used as
    a standalone protocol, or in conjunction with\na rendezvous or session setup protocol
    such as SIP.\n\nWhile SIMS was originally envisioned as an alternative to the
    Media\nSession Relay Protocol (MSRP), one section of this document describes\nhow
    these ideas could be applied as MSRP extensions for features such\nas chunking,
    relay connection multiplexing, and prevention of\nhead-of-line blocking.\n\t </p>\n
