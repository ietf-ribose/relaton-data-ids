abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF's Inter-Domain Multicast Routing (IDMR) working group
    has\n   produced several multicast routing protocols, including Core Based\n   Trees
    [CBT] and Protocol Independent Multicasting [PIMARCH]. In\n   addition, the IDMR
    WG has formalized the specification of the\n   Distance Vector Multicast Routing
    Protocol [DVMRP]. Various\n   specifications for protocol inter-operation have
    also been produced\n   (see, for example, [THALER96] and [PIMMBR]). However, none
    of these\n   protocols seems ideally suited to the inter-domain routing case;
    that\n   is, while these protocols are appropriate for the intra-domain\n   routing
    environment, they break down in various ways when applied in\n   to the multi-provider
    inter-domain case.\n \n   This document considers some of the scaling, stability
    and policy\n   issues that are of primary importance in a inter-domain, multi-\n
    \  provider multicast environment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
