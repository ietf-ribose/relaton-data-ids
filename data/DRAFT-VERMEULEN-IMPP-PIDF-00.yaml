abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the format of presence information. It
    makes\ndeliberately abstraction from issues associated with the transport of\nthis
    information. The proposed format follows the W3C XML\nrecommendation, such that
    presence information are valid XML \ndocuments according to a presence DTD.\nAs
    several types of devices are envisioned to handle presence\ninformation, including
    devices with low computing power and\nnetworking capabilities, the defined format
    has been kept as simple\nas possible, with only five tags defined, two of which
    with no\ndefined attributes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
