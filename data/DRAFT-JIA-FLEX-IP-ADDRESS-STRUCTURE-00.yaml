abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Along as the popularization and adoption of IP in emerging
    scenarios,\n   challenges emerge as well due to the ossified address structure.
    \ To\n   enable TCP/IP in networks that previously using exclusive protocol, a\n
    \  flexible address structure would be far more preferred for their\n   particular
    properties\n   [draft-jia-scenarios-flexible-address-structure].\n\n   This document
    describes a flexible address structure -- Flexible IP\n   (FlexIP) acting on limited
    domains [RFC8799].  FlexIP is expected to\n   proactively adapt scenarios under
    flexible address structure.\n   Meanwhile, FlexIP still benefit from global reachability
    based on the\n   IPv6 interoperability.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
