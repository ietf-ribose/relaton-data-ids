abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A host that is an initiator or responder of NSIS signaling
    messages\n   can be not only mobile but also multihomed.  Multihomed hosts and\n
    \  scenarios may be common in the future IPv6-based Internet.  Benefits\n   of
    multihoming include increased bandwidth, load balancing, load\n   sharing, ubiquitous
    access, bi-casting, resilience, and etc.  NSIS\n   signaling should be able to
    support various multihoming scenarios.\n   This draft describes NSIS operations
    and applicability in multihomed\n   environments.\n\t </p>\n      "
