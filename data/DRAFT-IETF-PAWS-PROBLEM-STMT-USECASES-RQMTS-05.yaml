abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Portions of the radio spectrum that are assigned to a particular
    use\n   but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are\n   defined
    as \"white space\".  The concept of allowing additional\n   transmissions (which
    may or may not be licensed) in white space is a\n   technique to \"unlock\" existing
    spectrum for new use.  An obvious\n   requirement is that these additional transmissions
    do not interfere\n   with the assigned use of the spectrum.  One approach to using
    the\n   white space spectrum at a given time and location is to verify with a\n
    \  database for available channels.\n\n   This document describes a number of
    possible use cases of white space\n   spectrum and technology as well as a set
    of requirements for the\n   database query protocol.  The concept of TV white
    spaces is described\n   including the problems that need to be addressed to enable
    white\n   space spectrum for additional uses without causing interference to\n
    \  currently assigned use.  Use of white space is enabled by querying a\n   database
    which stores information about the channel availability at\n   any given location
    and time.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
