abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document standardizes the means of requesting a sampled
    capture\n   stream from a router, receiving details about the resulting data\n
    \  flow, and the structure of the data flow itself.  This is\n   specifically
    tailored to having various hardware ASICs be able to\n   perform this operation
    as quickly as possible, by allowing\n   communication of the specific bit formats
    of headers applied to the\n   packet flow, in a way that enhances interoperability
    between sources\n   and sinks.  Historically, NetFlow and its ilk have been used
    for\n   these use cases, however the growth in hardware forward speeds is far\n
    \  outpacing the growth in CPU speeds, and the CPU-heavy parts of\n   NetFlow
    is resulting in a reduction of sampling rates that include\n   all of the fields
    provided by NetFlow that require CPU lookups.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
