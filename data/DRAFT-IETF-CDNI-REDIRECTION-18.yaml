abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Request Routing Interface comprises (1) the asynchronous\n
    \  advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a downstream Content\n   Delivery
    Network (CDN) that allows an upstream CDN to decide whether\n   to redirect particular
    user requests to that downstream CDN; and (2)\n   the synchronous operation of
    an upstream CDN requesting whether a\n   downstream CDN is prepared to accept
    a user request and of a\n   downstream CDN responding with how to actually redirect
    the user\n   request.  This document describes an interface for the latter part,\n
    \  i.e., the CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
