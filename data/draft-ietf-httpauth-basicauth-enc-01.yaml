abstract:
- content: <p>The "Basic" authentication scheme defined in RFC 2617 does not properly
    define how to treat non-ASCII characters. This has led to a situation where user
    agent implementations disagree, and servers make different assumptions based on
    the locales they are running in. There is little interoperability for the non-ASCII
    characters in the ISO-8859-1 character repertoire, and even less interoperability
    for any characters beyond that. This document defines a backwards-compatible extension
    to "Basic", specifying the server's character encoding scheme expectation, using
    a new authentication scheme parameter.</p>
