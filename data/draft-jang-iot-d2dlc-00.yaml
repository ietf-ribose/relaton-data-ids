abstract:
  content: "<p>Recently, D2D communication is drawing attention as a technologycapable
    of reducing an excessive load on a network infrastructure andincreasing network
    coverage. When using heterogeneous wirelesscommunication technologies such as
    WiFi and Bluetooth, which arebasically provided to user terminals such as smartphones,
    theconnectivity of D2D communication can be further strengthened.In this paper,
    we propose a multi-hop communication technique usingheterogeneous wireless communication
    technologies.</p>"
