abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a product of the work of the MIF Architecture Design
    team. It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues experienced by nodes
    that can be attached to multiple networks simultaneously. The framework defines
    the concept of a Provisioning Domain (PvD) which is a a consistent set of network
    configuration information. PvD aware nodes learn PvD specific information from
    the networks they are attached to and / or other sources. PvDs are used to enable
    separation and configuration consistency in presence of multiple concurrent connections.</p>"
