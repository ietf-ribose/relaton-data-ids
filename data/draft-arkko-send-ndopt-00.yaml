abstract:
  content: "<p>IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol to discover othernodes
    on the link, to determine each other's link-layer addresses, tofind routers and
    to maintain reachability information about the pathsto active neighbors. If not
    secured, ND protocol is vulnerable tovarious attacks. This document specifies
    security mechanisms for ND.Contrary to the original ND specifications, these mechanisms
    do notmake use of IPsec. The purpose of this draft is to present an alternative
    to the current approach in the Working Group.</p>"
