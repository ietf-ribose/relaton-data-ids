abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes new challenges for IoT services originated\n
    \  from the changes in the IoT environment.  In order to address those\n   new
    challenges, the integration of Edge computing and IoT has been\n   emerged as
    a promising solution.  This document discribes the concept\n   of IoT integrated
    with Edge computing as well as its use cases.  It\n   discusses benefits and challenges
    of Edge computing, focusing mainly\n   on IoT data.  The direction of Edge computing
    for IoT should be\n   discussed in IETF/IRTF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
