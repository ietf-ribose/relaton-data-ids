abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>TCP treats packet losses as an indication of congestion in the
    \nnetwork, and it reduces transmission rates drastically until an \noptimal rate
    is found for data transmission. The problems that \nsatellite and other wireless
    links pose to TCP have been addressed \nelsewhere (please see Section 2).\n\t
