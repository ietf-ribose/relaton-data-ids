abstract:
- content: <p>OSPFv3 requires functional extension beyond what can readily be done
    with the fixed-format Link State Advertisement (LSA) as described in RFC 5340.
    Without LSA extension, attributes associated with OSPFv3 links and advertised
    IPv6 prefixes must be advertised in separate LSAs and correlated to the fixed-format
    LSAs. This document extends the LSA format by encoding the existing OSPFv3 LSA
    information in Type-Length-Value (TLV) tuples and allowing advertisement of additional
    information with additional TLVs. Backward-compatibility mechanisms are also described.
    This document updates RFC 5340, "OSPF for IPv6", and RFC 5838, "Support of Address
    Families in OSPFv3", by providing TLV-based encodings for the base OSPFv3 unicast
    support and OSPFv3 address family support.</p>
