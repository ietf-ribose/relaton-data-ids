abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an implementation of overlay plugin
    algorithm\n   which is called one hop lookups to provide examples and references\n
    \  for the research of one hop based RELOAD.  With the development of\n   the
    real time communications, there are high demands for the\n   improvement of routing
    efficiency.  In the one hop algorithm, each\n   peer maintains complete membership
    information which can guarantee\n   one hop lookups to improve the routing efficiency.
    \ For the RELOAD,\n   using the one hop lookups algorithm to construct Topology
    Plugin with\n   the same RELOAD core can have a better support for VoIP applications,\n
    \  and the implementation of one hop lookups algorithm plugin is based\n   on
    the methods provided by RELAOD.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
