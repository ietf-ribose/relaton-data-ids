abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a survey of commonly used or notable
    network\n   security protocols, with a focus on how they interact and integrate\n
    \  with applications and transport protocols.  Its goal is to supplement\n   efforts
    to define and catalog transport services [RFC8095] by\n   describing the interfaces
    required to add security protocols.  It\n   examines Transport Layer Security
    (TLS), Datagram Transport Layer\n   Security (DTLS), Quick UDP Internet Connections
    with TLS (QUIC +\n   TLS), MinimalT, CurveCP, tcpcrypt, Internet Key Exchange
    with\n   Encapsulating Security Protocol (IKEv2 + ESP), SRTP (with DTLS), and\n
    \  WireGuard.  This survey is not limited to protocols developed within\n   the
    scope or context of the IETF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
