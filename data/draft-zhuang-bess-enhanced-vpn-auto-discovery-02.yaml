abstract:
- content: "<p>A variety of VPN technologies have been widely deployed to bear different
    services. As new applications develop, a requirement has been proposed for auto-discovery
    of Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPN) and enhanced auto-discovery requirements
    for other VPN technologies that already have basic auto-discovery mechanisms.
    This document identifies some possible applications of these auto- discovery requirements
    and defines a new BGP NLRI, called the BGP- VPN-INSTANCE NLRI, to satisfy the
    requirement for auto-discovery of BGP VPN instances. It also defines a new type
    of extended community, called the Import Route Target, which can be applied to
    auto- discovery mechanisms of multiple VPN technologies.</p>"
