abstract:
- content: "<p>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides end-to-end absolute delay
    and loss guarantee to serve real-time applications. DetNet is focused on a general
    approach that use techniques such as 1) data plane resources reservation for DetNet
    flows; 2) providing fixed path for DetNet flows; 3)sequentializng, replicating,
    and eliminating duplicate packets transmission [I-D.finn-detnet- architecture]
    to guarantee the worst case delay of DetNet flow while allow sharing among best
    effort traffic. Data flow information model is important to the DetNet work that
    it defines information be used by flow establishment and control protocols. This
    document describes and DetNet flow information model that represents the flow
    identifier, traffic description information so that can make resource reservation
    and provide differentiate service.</p>"
