abstract:
  content: "<p>The IETF NSIS WG is standardizing IP signaling protocols with QoSsignaling
    as the first use case. It is desirable to consider QoSsignaling procedures for
    resource reservations in an IP-based RANwhere mobide nodes undergo frequent handoffs.
    In this draft, wedescribe general QoS signaling procedures for an IP-based RAN,
    whichare based on the analysis of the existing QoS signaling solutions inmobile
    wireless networks. We also present a specific QoS signalingscheme based on the
    proposed general signaling procedures.</p>"
