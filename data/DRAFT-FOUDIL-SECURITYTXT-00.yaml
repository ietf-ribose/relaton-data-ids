abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When security risks in web services are discovered by independent\n
    \  security researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they\n   often
    lack the channels to properly disclose them.  As a result,\n   security issues
    may be left unreported.  Security.txt defines a\n   standard to help organizations
    define the process for security\n   researchers to securely disclose security
    vulnerabilities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
