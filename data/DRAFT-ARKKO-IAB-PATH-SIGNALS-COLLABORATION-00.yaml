abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Encryption and other security mechanisms are on the rise on
    all\n   layers of the stack, protecting user data and making network\n   operations
    more secured.  Further, encryption is also a tool to\n   address ossification
    that has been observed on various layers of the\n   stack over time.  Separation
    of functions into layers and enforcement\n   of layer boundaries based on encryption
    supports selected exposure to\n   those entities that are addressed by a function
    on a certain layer.\n   A clear separation supports innovation and also enables
    new\n   opportunities for collaborative functions.  RFC 8558 describes path\n
    \  signals as messages to or from on-path elements.  This document\n   states
    principles for designing mechanisms that use or provide path\n   signals and calls
    for actions on specific valuable cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
