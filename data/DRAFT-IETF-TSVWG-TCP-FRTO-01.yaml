abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Spurious retransmission timeouts (RTOs) cause suboptimal TCP\n
    \  performance, because they often result in unnecessary retransmission\n   of
    the last window of data. This document describes the 'Forward RTO\n   Recovery'
    (F-RTO) algorithm for detecting spurious TCP RTOs. F-RTO is\n   a TCP sender only
    algorithm that does not require any TCP options to\n   operate. After retransmitting
    the first unacknowledged segment\n   triggered by an RTO, the F-RTO algorithm
    at a TCP sender monitors the\n   incoming acknowledgements to determine whether
    the timeout was\n   spurious and to decide whether to send new segments or retransmit\n
    \  unacknowledged segments. The algorithm effectively helps to avoid\n   additional
    unnecessary retransmissions and thereby improves TCP\n   performance in case of
    a spurious timeout. The F-RTO algorithm can\nalso be applied with the SCTP protocol.\n\t
