abstract:
- content: "<p>This document captures the design rationale of the initial draft version
    of what became RFC 8205 (the BGPsec protocol specification). The designers needed
    to balance many competing factors, and this document lists the decisions that
    were made in favor of or against each design choice. This document also presents
    brief summaries of the arguments that aided the decision process. Where appropriate,
    this document also provides brief notes on design decisions that changed as the
    specification was reviewed and updated by the IETF SIDR Working Group and that
    resulted in RFC 8205. These notes highlight the differences and provide pointers
    to details and rationale regarding those design changes.</p>"
