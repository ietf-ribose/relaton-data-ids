abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is a submission for the creation of an new IANA Time Zones\n
    \  registration process.  This is intended to be a central repository\n   for
    time zone names.  The registry does not presume to be the\n   authority for time
    zone information or rules.  This register is\n   simply a place where time zone
    names may be registered for public\n   access.  This registery only registers
    time zone names.  The\n   description of the time zone is not included in this
    memo.  Vendors\n   and services companies can elect to provide time zone servers
    that\n   publish time zone information details.\n\t </p>\n      "
