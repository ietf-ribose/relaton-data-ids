abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is expected that a future version of the RPC-over-RDMA transport\n
    \  will allow protocol extensions to be defined.  This would provide for\n   the
    specification of OPTIONAL features allowing participants who\n   implement such
    features to cooperate as specified by that extension,\n   while still interoperating
    with participants who do not support that\n   extension.\n\n   A particular extension
    is described herein, whose motivation is to\n   reduce the latency due to inter-node
    round-trips needed to effect\n   operations which involve direct data placement
    or which transfer RPC\n   messages longer than the fixed inline buffer size limit.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
