abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There is a pragmatic need for a packet-level translation mechanismbetween
    IPv4 and IPv6, for scenarios where no other mode of IPv4 toIPv6 interworking is
    possible. The mechanism defined here uses ashim in both the translator and the
    IPv6 host to mitigate theproblems introduced by stateless translation.</p>"
