abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   National Bibliography Numbers, NBNs, are widely used by the
    national\n   libraries and other organizations in order to identify various\n
    \  resources such as digitized monographs.  Generally, NBNs may be\n   applied
    to all kinds of resources that do not have an established\n   (standard) identifier
    system of their own.\n\n   A URN (Uniform Resource Names) namespace for NBNs was
    established in\n   2001 in RFC 3188.  Since then, several European national libraries\n
    \  have implemented URN:NBN-based systems.\n\n   This document replaces RFC 3188
    and defines how NBNs can be supported\n   within the updated URN framework.  A
    revised namespace registration\n   (version 4) is included.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
