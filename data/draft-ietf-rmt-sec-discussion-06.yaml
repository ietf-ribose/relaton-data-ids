abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes general security considerations for theReliable
    Multicast Transport (RMT) Working Group set of buildingblocks and protocols. An
    emphasis is placed on risks that might beresolved in the scope of transport protocol
    design. However,relevant security issues related to IP Multicast control-plane
    andother concerns not strictly within the scope of reliable transportprotocol
    design are also discussed. The document also begins anexploration of approaches
    that could be embraced to mitigate theserisks. The purpose of this document is
    to provide a consolidatedsecurity discussion and provide a basis for further discussions
    andpotential resolution of any significant security issues that mayexist in the
    current set of RMT standards.</p>"
