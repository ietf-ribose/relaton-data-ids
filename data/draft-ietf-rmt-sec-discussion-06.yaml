abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes general security considerations for the Reliable
    Multicast Transport (RMT) Working Group set of building blocks and protocols.
    An emphasis is placed on risks that might be resolved in the scope of transport
    protocol design. However, relevant security issues related to IP Multicast control-plane
    and other concerns not strictly within the scope of reliable transport protocol
    design are also discussed. The document also begins an exploration of approaches
    that could be embraced to mitigate these risks. The purpose of this document is
    to provide a consolidated security discussion and provide a basis for further
    discussions and potential resolution of any significant security issues that may
    exist in the current set of RMT standards.</p>"
