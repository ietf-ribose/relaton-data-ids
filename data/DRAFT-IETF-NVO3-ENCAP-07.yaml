abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As communicated by the WG Chairs, the IETF NVO3 chairs and
    Routing\n   Area director have chartered a design team to take forward the\n   encapsulation
    discussion and see if there is potential to design a\n   common encapsulation
    that addresses the various technical concerns.\n\n   There are implications of
    different encapsulations in real\n   environments consisting of both software
    and hardware implementations\n   and spanning multiple data centers.  For example,
    OAM functions such\n   as path MTU discovery become challenging with multiple
    encapsulations\n   along the data path.\n\n   The design team recommends Geneve
    with a few modifications as the\n   common encapsulation. This document provides
    more details,\n   particularly in Section 7.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
