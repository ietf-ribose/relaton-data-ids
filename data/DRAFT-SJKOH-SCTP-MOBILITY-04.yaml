abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses the architecture of mobile SCTP (mSCTP)
    for \n    IP mobility support. The SCTP is the third transport layer protocol
    \n    next to TCP/UDP. It can also be used for IP mobility from the multi-\n    homing
    features. The SCTP with the ADDIP extension (or mSCTP) would \n    provide seamless
    or soft handover for the mobile host without support \n    of routers or agents
    in the networks. For location management, the \n    mSCTP could be used along
    with Mobile IP, Session Initiation Protocol \n    or Reliable Server Pooling.\n\t
