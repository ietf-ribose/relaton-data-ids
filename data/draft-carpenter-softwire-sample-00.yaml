abstract:
  content: "<p>IPv6 deployment is delayed by the existence of millions of subscribernetwork
    address translators (NATs) that cannot be upgraded to supportIPv6. This document
    specifies a mechanism for traversal of suchNATs. It is based on an address mapping
    and on a mechanism wherebysuitably upgraded hosts behind a NAT may obtain IPv6
    connectivity viaa stateless server, known as a SAMPLE server, operated by theirInternet
    Service Provider. SAMPLE is an alternative to the Teredoprotocol.</p>"
