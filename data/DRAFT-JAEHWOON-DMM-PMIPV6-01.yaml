abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is the network-based mobility management\n
    \  protocol where access network supports the mobility of a mobile node\n   on
    behalf of the MN. In PMIPv6, the location information of the MN\n   should be
    registered to Localized Mobility Anchor and communication\n   must be established
    via the LMA. Therefore, the performance can be\n   degraded due to traffic concentration
    and congestion possibility.\n   One method to overcome the above problems is to
    exploit the\n   distributed mobility management (DMM) mechanism to distribute
    the\n   LMA function to all access routers within the PMIPv6 domain. This\n   letter
    proposes the fully distributed mobility management mechanism\n   in PMIPv6-based
    network. In this mechanism, there is no need for\n   the location management function
    to register the location of the MN.\n   Therefore, the performance is not degraded
    due to the overhead to\n   query the location of the MN.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
