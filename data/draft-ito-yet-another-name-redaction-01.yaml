abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes mechanisms to allow CT log submitters not to
    submit plain certificates. While public Certificate Transparency (CT) logs allow
    anyone to observe server certificates and make confident to trust Certificate
    Authorities (CAs), there are some problems scaling to mass devices. This document
    describes and presents some use cases for a mechanism that retains most of the
    security benefits gained from using Certificate Transparency.</p>"
