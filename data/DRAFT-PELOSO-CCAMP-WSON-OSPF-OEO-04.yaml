abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The original content of this internet draft was to propose
    some\n   extentions to OSPF encoding in the context of Wavelength Switched\n   Optical
    Networks, especially for internal constraints of optical\n   network elements.
    \ General description can be found in the framework\n   document.\n\n   This update
    of the document still aims at specifying the detailled\n   structure of OSPF LSAs
    for WSONs.  Nevertheless, the proposed LSA\n   layout slightly differs from the
    current content of the information\n   model and encodings drafts.  As a result,
    the following sections\n   highlight the differences between both approaches and
    summarize why\n   the authors think these CCAMP's drafts would benefit from an
    update\n   according to the proposed description.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
