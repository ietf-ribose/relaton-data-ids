abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n
    \  In particular, it describes managed objects for information related\n   to
    the Fibre Channel network's Name Server function.  At present,\n   this memo is
    a work item of T11.5 (http://www.t11.org).  The plan is\n   that it will later
    become a work item of IETF's IMSS working group.\n\t </p>\n      "
