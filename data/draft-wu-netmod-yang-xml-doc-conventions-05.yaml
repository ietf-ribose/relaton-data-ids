abstract:
- content: "<p>Many documents that define YANG modules or YANG fragments also include
    protocol message instance data examples. IETF documentation has specific limits
    on line length (73 characters) and some YANG fragment example or protocol message
    instance data examples such as XML encoded YANG data node instance examples have
    to include line wraps that would not normally be allowed according to the XML
    representation rules of RFC7950 and RFC7952. This document lays out documentation
    conventions that allow authored work to be presented in IETF documentation when
    authored work such as YANG fragment or protocol message instance data example
    would otherwise exceed the maximum line length and provide consistent representation
    of authored work within an Internet-Draft or RFC. There are no implications in
    this document for YANG tools: this document does not change the rules for presenting
    authored work in data files or in the wire.</p>"
