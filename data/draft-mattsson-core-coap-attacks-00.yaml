abstract:
- content: "<p>Being able to trust information from sensors and to securely control
    actuators are essential in a world of connected and networking things interacting
    with the physical world. This document summarizes known attacks, and show that
    just using CoAP with a security protocol like DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE is not enough
    for secure operation. The goal with this document is motivating generic and protocol-specific
    recommendations on the usage of CoAP. Several of the discussed attacks can be
    mitigated with the solutions in [I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag].</p>"
