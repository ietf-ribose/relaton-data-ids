abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a new, XML-based canonical format for
    RFCs\n   that explicitly allows external art as a normative part of the RFC.\n
    \  If the RFC Editor chooses this format, they will also publish non-\n   canonical
    versions of RFCs in order to accomodate the largest target\n   audience of readers.
    \ Having a simple, stable canonical format and a\n   varying number of non-canonical
    formats that can change over time\n   allows the RFC Editor to add useful formats,
    particularly in HTML,\n   that can keep up with the needs of all RFC readers.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
