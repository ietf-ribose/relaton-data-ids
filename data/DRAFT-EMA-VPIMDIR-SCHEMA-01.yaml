abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>One use of a directory service is the retrieval of information,\nsuch
    as email address and spoken name, to support voice messaging.\nThis document defines
    the directory schema required for an\nX.500/LDAP-based directory service for use
    by applications\nsupporting Voice Profile for Internet Mail [VPIM2].  The directory\nservice
    is intended to assist the exchange of voice messages\nbetween voice messaging
    systems.  Interaction with desktop\napplications is outside the scope of this
    draft.\nSome schema elements defined herein may be of more general use than\njust
    for voice messaging.  They are included here because they are\nnot defined elsewhere.
    \ It is anticipated that the next version of\nthis schema will only reference
    such definitions if they get\ndefined in more appropriate areas.\n\t </p>\n      "
