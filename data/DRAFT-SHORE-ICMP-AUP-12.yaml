abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this document we provide a basic description of ICMP's role
    in the IP stack and some guidelines for future use.\n\n This document is motivated
    by concerns about lack of clarity concerning when to add new Internet Control
    Message Protocol (ICMP) types and/or codes. These concerns have highlighted a
    need to describe policies for when adding new features to ICMP is desirable and
    when it is not.\n\t </p>\n      "
