abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This paper provides a framework for a protection scheme in the
    context \nof optical channel concatenation (OCC). The need and requirements for
    \noptical channel concatenation is addressed in a separate IETF draft, \ndraft-damle-optical-channel-concatenation-00.txt,which
    has been \nsubmitted concurrently.  This paper bascially provides mechanisms for\nfaster
    failure detection and propagation of failure for concatenated\noptical channels.
    \ Standard-based MPLS protection schemes can be\nemployed for the actual rerouting
    of traffic utilizing the detection \nand propagation mechanisms demonstrated in
    this paper.\n\t </p>\n      "
