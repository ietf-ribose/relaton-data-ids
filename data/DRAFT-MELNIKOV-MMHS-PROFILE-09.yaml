abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Military Message Handling System (MMHS) processes formal
    messages\n   ensuring release, distribution, security, and timely delivery across\n
    \  national and international strategic and tactical networks.  The MMHS\n   Elements
    of Service have been defined as a set of extensions to the\n   ITU-T X.400 (1992)
    international standards and are specified in\n   STANAG 4406 Edition 2 or ACP
    123.\n\n   This document specifies how a messaging service that meets these\n
    \  service definitions can be provided using the SMTP family of\n   protocols.
    \ It defines a profile that can be used by those wishing to\n   ensure that these
    services are provided.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
