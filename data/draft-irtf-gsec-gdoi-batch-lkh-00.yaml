abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document presents a new algorithm method for rekeying multicastgroups.
    It takes advantage of the mathematical properties of modularreduction in order
    to reduce the number of messages needed for rekeying.Moreover the technique is
    very suitable for batch processing. Itachieves greater bandwidth reduction than
    other existing batch techniques. Batch processing techniques are specially suitable
    for benchmarks scenarios where a great amount of users can join or leave the group
    at once (typically single source broadcast). One of the mostimportant items to
    take into account when performing batch rekeying isthat key trees must be kept
    balanced all the time. Current methods forbatch rekeying assure tree balancing
    by adding an additional method tousual rekeying. We propose a batch rekeying method
    that allows membersto change their position in the key tree. This change has to
    be notifiedto single members with the updated keys. An adaptation of the GDOIprotocol
    in order to contain this information is finally proposed.</p>"
