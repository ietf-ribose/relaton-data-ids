abstract:
- content: "<p>Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way to represent links between Web
    resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes of such a
    link. In constrained networks, a collection of Web links can be exchanged in the
    CoRE link format (RFC6690). This specification defines a common format for representing
    Web links in CBOR format (RFC7049). Note Discussion and suggestions for improvement
    are requested, and should be sent to core@ietf.org.</p>"
