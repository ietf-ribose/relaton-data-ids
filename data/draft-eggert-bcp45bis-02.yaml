abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing list
    furthers the development and specification of Internet technology through the
    general discussion of topics for which no dedicated mailing lists exists. As this
    is the most general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude is allowed, but there
    are posts that are unsuitable for this mailing list. This document obsoletes RFC3005.</p>"
