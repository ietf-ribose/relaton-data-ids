abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describe the scenarios where multiples early dialogs
    can be created. The main use case is based on forking. But also forwarding of
    SIP Invites and other applications may create early dialogs. The scenarios shown
    describe how a correlation/multiplexing of multiple early dialogs caused by forked
    or forwarded INVITEs in Back to Back User Agents can apply. Existing RFC's are
    analyzed how forking is described and points to facts which may be taken in to
    consideration.</p>"
