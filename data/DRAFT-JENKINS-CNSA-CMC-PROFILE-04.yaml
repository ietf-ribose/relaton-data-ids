abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a profile of the Certificate Management
    over\n   CMS (CMC) protocol for managing X.509 public key certificates in\n   applications
    that use the Commercial National Security Algorithm\n   (CNSA) Suite published
    by the United States Government.\n\n   The profile applies to the capabilities,
    configuration, and operation\n   of all components of US National Security Systems
    that manage X.509\n   public key certificates over CMS.  It is also appropriate
    for all\n   other US Government systems that process high-value information.\n\n
    \  The profile is made publicly available here for use by developers and\n   operators
    of these and any other system deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
