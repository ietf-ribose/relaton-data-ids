abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC8281] specifies procedures that can be used for creation and deletion
    of PCE-initiated LSPs in the active stateful PCE model. However, this specification
    focuses on MPLS networks, and does not cover remote instantiation of paths in
    GMPLS-controlled networks. This document complements [RFC8281] by addressing the
    requirements for remote-initiated GMPLS LSPs.</p>"
