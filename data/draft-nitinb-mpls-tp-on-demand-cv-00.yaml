abstract:
- content: "<p>LSP-Ping is an existing and widely deployed OAM mechanism for MPLS
    LSPs. This document describes extensions to LSP-Ping so that LSP- Ping can be
    used to perform OAM on MPLS-TP LSPs. It also clarifies the procedures to be used
    for processing the OAM packets. Further, it describes how LSP-Ping can be used
    to perform Connectivity Verification, Route Tracing and Adjacency functions in
    MPLS-TP networks.</p>"
