    operation\n   over an MPLS Packet Switched Networks.\n\n   This document is a
    derivative work from draft-ietf-detnet-dp-sol-01.\n\n   Whether this is published
    as a stand-alone text, or serves as a focal\n   point to refine the MPLS design
    and the key point are subsequently\n   re-merged with draft-ietf-detnet-dp-sol-01
