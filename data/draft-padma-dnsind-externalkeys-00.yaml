abstract:
  content: "<p>There are several mechanisms for distributing public keys andcertificates
    today. These distribution services publish certificateswhich contain cryptographic
    public keys. Clients that use any ofthese distribution services to retrieve certificates,
    requireadditional software for the retrieval, parsing and verificationof these
    certificates. In this draft, we propose an alternatescheme that takes advantage
    of the Secure DNS infrastructure todistribute verified public keys obtained from
    other distributionservices.</p>"
