abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery) normally discloses information
    about\n   both the devices offering services and the devices requesting\n   services.
    \ This information includes host names, network parameters,\n   and possibly a
    further description of the corresponding service\n   instance.  Especially when
    mobile devices engage in DNS Service\n   Discovery over Multicast DNS at a public
    hotspot, a serious privacy\n   problem arises.\n\n   We propose to solve this
    problem by developing a private discovery\n   profile for UDP based transports
    using TLS, such as DTLS and QUIC.\n   The profile is based on using the Encrypted
    SNI extension.  We also\n   define a standalone private discovery service, that
    can be combined\n   with arbitrary applications in the same way as DNS-SD.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
