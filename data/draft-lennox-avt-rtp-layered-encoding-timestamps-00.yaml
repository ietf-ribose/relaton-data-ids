abstract:
  content: "<p>The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) specification defines howlayered
    encodings can be sent over a layered transmission system. Asource can stripe the
    progressive layers of a hierarchicallyrepresented signal across multiple RTP sessions,
    each carried on, forexample, its own multicast group. These layered encodings
    are givenspecial treatment in RTP, notably in that the same synchronizationsource
    (SSRC) identifier space is used across the sessions of alllayers.The RTP protocol
    specification does not, however, explicitly statehow RTP timestamps are to be
    used with layered encodings. Thisdocument updates the RTP specification to require
    that RTP timestampsfor layered encodings be synchronized, i.e. that every layer
    choosesthe same random initial value for the timestamp.</p>"
