abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module
    which\n   contains Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Multiprotocol\n
    \  Label Switching (MPLS) management information.  The intent is that\n   these
    TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in MPLS\n   related MIB modules
    that would otherwise define their own\n   representations.\n\n   This document
    obsoletes RFC3811 as it addresses the need to support\n   IPv6 extended TunnelID's
    by defining a new TC-\n   MplsNewExtendedTunnelID which suggests using an IPv4(for
    dual stack\n   network) / IPv6 (for IPv6-only network) address of the ingress
    or\n   egress LSR for the tunnel for dual stack network or an IPv6-only\n   network.
    \ This document also fixed the confusing part of MplsLSPID.\n   Changes from RFC3811
    and the effect of the new TC to other related\n   documents are summarized in
    Section 4 and 5, respectively.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
