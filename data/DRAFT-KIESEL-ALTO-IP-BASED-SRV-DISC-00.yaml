abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is
    to\n   provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several\n   hosts
    from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired\n   resource.  ALTO is
    realized by a client-server protocol.\n\n   This document establishes a well-known
    IP address for the ALTO\n   service and specifies how ALTO clients embedded in
    the resource\n   consumer can use it to access the ALTO service.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
