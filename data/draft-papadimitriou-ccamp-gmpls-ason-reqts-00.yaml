abstract:
  content: "<p>The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocol has been defined tocontrol
    different switching technologies as well as differentapplications. These include
    support for requesting TDM connectionsincluding SONET/SDH and Optical Transport
    Networks (OTNs).This document concentrates on the signaling aspects of the GMPLSsuite
    of protocols. It identifies the features to be covered by thesignalling protocol
    to support the capabilities of an AutomaticallySwitched Optical Network (ASON).
    This document provides a problemstatement and additional requirements on the GMPLS
    signalingprotocol to support the ASON functionality.</p>"
