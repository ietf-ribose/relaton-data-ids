abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies\n
    \  covering different Internet of Things (IoT) applications.  The common\n   characteristics
    for LPWANs are large coverage, low bandwidth, small\n   packet and application
    layer data sizes and long battery life\n   operation.  One of these technologies
    is LoRaWAN developed by the\n   LoRa Alliance.  LoRaWAN targets key requirements
    of the Internet of\n   things such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility
    and\n   localization services.  This memo is an informational overview of\n   LoRaWAN
    and gives the principal characteristics of this technology in\n   order to help
    with the IETF work for providing IPv6 connectivity over\n   LoRaWAN along with
    other LPWANs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
