abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes web-based real-time communication use cases.
    Requirements on the browser functionality are derived from the use cases. This
    document was developed in an initial phase of the work with rather minor updates
    at later stages. It has not really served as a tool in deciding features or scope
    for the WG's efforts so far. It is being published to record the early conclusions
    of the WG. It will not be used as a set of rigid guidelines that specifications
    and implementations will be held to in the future.</p>"
