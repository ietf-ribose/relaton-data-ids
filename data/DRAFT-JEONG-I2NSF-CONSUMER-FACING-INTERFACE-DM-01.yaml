abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a YANG data model for security management\n
    \  that is based on Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) by\n   using
    Network Functions Virtualization (NFV).  This document proposes\n   a security
    management architecture based on I2NSF framework.  Note\n   that the I2NSF framework
    consists of I2NSF User, Security Management\n   System (i.e., Security Controller
    and Developer's Management System),\n   and the instances of Network Security
    Functions (NSFs) in the lowest\n   layer of the framework.  I2NSF User consists
    of Application Logic,\n   Policy Updater, and Event Collector.  Security Controller
    consists of\n   Security Policy Manager and NSF Capability Manager.  This document\n
    \  explains a data model to perform the missions for a security service\n   (i.e.,
    VoIP-VoLTE) in I2NSF security management system.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
