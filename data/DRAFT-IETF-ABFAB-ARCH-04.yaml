abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Over the last decade a substantial amount of work has occurred
    in the\n   space of federated access management.  Most of this effort has\n   focused
    on two use-cases: network and web-based access.  However, the\n   solutions to
    these use-cases that have been proposed and deployed\n   tend to have few common
    building blocks in common.\n\n   This memo describes an architecture that makes
    use of extensions to\n   the commonly used security mechanisms for both federated
    and non-\n   federated access management, including the Remote Authentication
    Dial\n   In User Service (RADIUS) and the Diameter protocol, the Generic\n   Security
    Service (GSS), the GS2 family, the Extensible Authentication\n   Protocol (EAP)
    and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).\n   The architecture addresses
    the problem of federated access management\n   to primarily non-web-based services,
    in a manner that will scale to\n   large numbers of identity providers, relying
    parties, and\n   federations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
