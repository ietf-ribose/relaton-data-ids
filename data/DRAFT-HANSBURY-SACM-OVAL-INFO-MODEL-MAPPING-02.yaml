abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The OVAL community has spent more than ten years developing
    and\n   employing the OVAL Language.  During this time, the community has\n   made
    a number of design decisions and learned a number of lessons\n   that should be
    leveraged as the next-generation endpoint posture\n   assessment standards are
    formulated.  There are also a number of\n   places where portions of the OVAL
    Language align with the SACM\n   Information Model and could serve as a starting
    point for related\n   work.  Another output of the work executed under the OVAL
    project is\n   a number of lessons that are applicable to the SACM work.  These\n
    \  lessons include a clear separation of data collection and evaluation;\n   a
    call to focus on ensuring both primary source vendors and third\n   party security
    experts feel invited to the discussion and are\n   empowered to leverage their
    unique domain knowledge; and to strive\n   for simplicity and flexibility, where
    possible.  In addition, the\n   OVAL community has a set of clear recommendations
    with respect to\n   which parts of OVAL should be used by SACM as a means to make
    best\n   use of the efforts of those that have worked on and supported OVAL\n
    \  over the past ten years.  Those recommendations are:\n\n   o  Use the OVAL
    System Characteristics Model to inform the\n      development of a data model
    for representing endpoint posture\n      attributes.\n\n   o  Use the OVAL Definitions
    Model to inform the development of data\n      models for representing evaluation
    and collection guidance.\n\n   o  Do not use the OVAL Results Model to inform
    the development of a\n      data model for representing evaluation results.\n\n
    \  Lastly, this document will discuss the OVAL submission, how it is\n   expected
    to be used, and how it aligns with the SACM Vulnerability\n   Assessment Scenario.\n\n\t
