abstract:
  content: "<p>The Martini Working Group is defining a mechanism for SIP IP-PBX typedevices
    to REGISTER and obtain SIP service for E.164-based Address ofRecords. In doing
    so it has selected a solution that is notcompatible with the solution that was
    specified in ETSI TISPAN and3GPP for subscription based business trunking. The
    latter solutionnot only covers E.164 numbers but also handles non-E.164 numbers
    andalphanumeric AOR's.This document defines a extension of the martini mechanism
    thatallows it to be used also with ETSI TISPAN and 3GPP standardsubscription based
    business trunking arrangements.</p>"
