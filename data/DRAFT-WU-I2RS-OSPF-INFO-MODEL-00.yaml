abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As one of well-known link-state protocols, OSPF has been widely
    used\n   in the routing of intra domain networks.  During the past decades, it\n
    \  has been deployed with the help of typical interfaces such as CLI,\n   SNMP
    and NETCONF.  As modern networks grow in scale and complexity,\n   the necessity
    for rapid and dynamic control has been increased.  The\n   I2RS is a standard-based
    interface which provides a programmatic way\n   to achieve this goal.\n\n   This
    document specifies an information model for the OSPF protocol to\n   facilitate
    the definition of a standardized data model, which can be\n   used to define interfaces
    to the OSPF from an entity that may even be\n   external to the routing system.
    \ Based on standardized data model and\n   interfaces, use cases of IGP protocols
    defined by I2RS-WG can be\n   supported.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
