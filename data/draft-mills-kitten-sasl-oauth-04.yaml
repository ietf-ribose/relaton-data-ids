abstract:
- content: "<p>OAuth enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to
    a protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an
    approval interaction, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access
    on its own behalf. This document defines how an application client uses OAuth
    over the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) or the Generic Security
    Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) to access a protected resource
    at a resource serve, and additionally defines authorization and token issuing
    endpoint discovery. Thereby, it enables schemes defined within the OAuth framework
    for non-HTTP-based application protocols. Clients typically store the user's long
    term credential. This does, however, lead to significant security vulnerabilities,
    for example, when such a credential leaks. A significant benefit of OAuth for
    usage in those clients is that the password is replaced by a token. Tokens typically
    provided limited access rights and can be managed and revoked separately from
    the user's long-term credential (password).</p>"
