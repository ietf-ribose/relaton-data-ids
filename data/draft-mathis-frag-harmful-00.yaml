abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv4 fragmentation is not sufficiently robust for general use in today's
    Internet. The 16-bit IP identification field is not large enough to prevent frequent
    missassociated IP fragments and the TCP and UDP checksums are insufficient to
    prevent the resulting corrupted data from being delivered to higher protocol layers.
    In this note we describe some easily reproduced experiments demonstrating the
    problem and estimate the scale the data corruption in the presence of ever growing
    data rates.</p>"
