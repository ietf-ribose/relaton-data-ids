abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a CBOR encoding and profiling of X.509 public
    key certificate suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. The full X.509
    public key certificate format and commonly used ASN.1 DER encoding is overly verbose
    for constrained IoT environments. Profiling together with CBOR encoding reduces
    the certificate size significantly with associated known performance benefits.
    The CBOR certificates are compatible with the existing X.509 standard, enabling
    the use of profiled and compressed X.509 certificates without modifications in
    the existing X.509 standard.</p>"
