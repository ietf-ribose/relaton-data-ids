abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides the problem statement on a extra class
    LSP ser-\nvice and addresses the issues.  The extra class LSP uses the resource\nreserved
    but not allocated for the protecting LSPs in the pre-planned\nLSP re-routing without
    extra-traffic (including shared mesh) recovery\nmethod.  Network utilization is
    improved because the resource reserved\nfor the protecting LSPs are used for the
    extra class LSPs.  The extra\nclass LSP is preempted less frequently than the
    conventional priority\nmechanism using setup and holding priorities because the
    resource\nreserved for the protecting LSPs is allocated only if the working LSP\nfails,
    which is usually expected to rarely occur.  This document pro-\nposes the extra
    class LSP service using the resource reserved but not\nallocated for the protecting
    LSP at the provisioning phase.  This docu-\nment addresses the issues on the extra
    class LSP: (1) advertisement of\navailable resource, (2) extra class LSP indication
    in signaling message\n(3) extra class LSP preemption signaling, and (4) preventing
    unintended\nconnections.\n\t </p>\n      "
