abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is written in the context of the Delay Tolerant\n
    \  Networking Research Group and will be presented for reviewing by that\n   group.
    This document defines dLife, an opportunistic routing protocol\n   that takes
    advantage of time-evolving social structures. dLife\n   belongs to the family
    of social-aware opportunistic routing protocols\n   for intermittently connected
    networks. dLife operates based on a\n   representation of the dynamics of social
    structures as a weighted\n   contact graph, where the weights (i.e., social strengths)
    express how\n   long a pair of nodes is in contact over different period of times.
    It\n   considers two complementary utility functions: Time-Evolving Contact\n
    \  Duration (TECD) that captures the evolution of social interaction\n   among
    pairs of users in the same daily period of time, over\n   consecutive days; and
    TECD Importance (TECDi) that captures the\n   evolution of user's importance,
    based on its node degree and the\n   social strength towards its neighbors, in
    different periods of time.\n   It is intended for use in wireless networks where
    there is no\n   guarantee that a fully connected path between any source -\n   destination
    pair exists at any time, a scenario where traditional\n   routing protocols are
    unable to deliver bundles. Such networks can be\n   sparse mesh, in which case
    intermittent connectivity is due to lack\n   of physical connections, or dense
    mesh, in which case intermittent\n   connectivity may be due to high interference
    or shadowing. In any\n   case, intermittent connectivity can also be due to the
    availability\n   of devices (e.g., unavailable due to power saving rules). The\n
    \  document presents an architectural overview followed by the protocol\n   specification.\n\n\t
