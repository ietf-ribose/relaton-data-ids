abstract:
- content: "<p>The base Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) specification (RFC 3435)
    allows endpoints to be redirected one endpoint at a time. This document provides
    extensions in the form of a new MGCP package that provides mechanisms for redirecting
    and resetting a group of endpoints. It also includes the ability to more accurately
    redirect endpoints by allowing a list of Call Agents to be specified in a preferred
    order. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
