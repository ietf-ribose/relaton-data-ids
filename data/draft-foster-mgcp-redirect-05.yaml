abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The base Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) specification (RFC
    3435) allows endpoints to be redirected one endpoint at a time. This document
    provides extensions in the form of a new MGCP package that provides mechanisms
    for redirecting and resetting a group of endpoints. It also includes the ability
    to more accurately redirect endpoints by allowing a list of Call Agents to be
    specified in a preferred order. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
