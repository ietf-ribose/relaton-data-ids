abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the set of transport services required
    by\n   low-latency, real-time applications.  These services are derived from\n
    \  the needs of the applications, rather than from the current\n   capabilities
    of the transport layer.  An example API, based on the\n   Berkeley Sockets API,
    is also provided, alongside examples of how the\n   target applications would
    use the API to access the transport\n   services described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
