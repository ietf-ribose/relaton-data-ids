abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is data format
    designed\n   for small code size and small message size.  There is a need for
    the\n   ability to have the basic security services defined for this data\n   format.
    \ This document specifies how to do signatures, message\n   authentication codes
    and encryption using this data format.  The work\n   in this document is derived
    in part from the JSON web security\n   documents using the same parameters and
    algorithm identifiers as they\n   do.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
