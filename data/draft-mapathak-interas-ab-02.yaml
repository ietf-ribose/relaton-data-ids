abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new option known as an Inter-AS option D
    to the 'Multi-AS Backbones' section of [RFC4364]. This option combines VPN VRFs
    at the Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) as described in 'Option A' with
    the distribution of labeled VPN-IP routes as described in 'Option B'. In addition,
    this option allows for a data plane consisting of two methods of traffic forwarding
    between attached ASBR pairs.</p>"
