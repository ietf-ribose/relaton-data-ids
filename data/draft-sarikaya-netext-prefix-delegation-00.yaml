abstract:
  content: "<p>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, prefixes can only be assigned to one interfaceof
    a mobile node by the local mobility anchor (LMA) and differentmobile nodes can
    not share these home network prefixes. Managingper-MN's interface home network
    prefixes is likely to increase theprocessing load at the LMA. Based on the idea
    that Dynamic HostConfiguration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) servers can manage prefixes,we
    propose a new technique in which LMA offloads delegation andrelease tasks of the
    prefixes to the DHCPv6 server. LMA requestsprefixes for an incoming mobile node
    to the DHCPv6 server. Based onthese prefixes, the mobile node can create home
    addresses for itsinterface. When the mobile node leaves the network, the prefixes
    arereturned to the DHCPv6 server. Authentication, Authorization andAccounting
    (AAA) servers can also play a role in prefixauthorization.</p>"
