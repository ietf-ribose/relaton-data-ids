abstract:
- content: "<p>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, prefixes can only be assigned to one interface
    of a mobile node by the local mobility anchor (LMA) and different mobile nodes
    can not share these home network prefixes. Managing per-MN's interface home network
    prefixes is likely to increase the processing load at the LMA. Based on the idea
    that Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) servers can manage
    prefixes, we propose a new technique in which LMA offloads delegation and release
    tasks of the prefixes to the DHCPv6 server. LMA requests prefixes for an incoming
    mobile node to the DHCPv6 server. Based on these prefixes, the mobile node can
    create home addresses for its interface. When the mobile node leaves the network,
    the prefixes are returned to the DHCPv6 server. Authentication, Authorization
    and Accounting (AAA) servers can also play a role in prefix authorization.</p>"
