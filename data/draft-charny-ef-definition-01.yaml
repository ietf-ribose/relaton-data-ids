abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes text aiming at providing clarification to
    RFC2598. The primary motivation for this draft is that the definitionof EF PHB
    given in RFC 2598 does not match the intuition of the EFPHB, and has been determined
    to be unimplementable in a mannercompliant with the definition. In particular,
    no work-conservingscheduler, including all of the schedulers listed in theImplementation
    Examples section of RFC 2598, can comply with thedefinition given in that RFC.This
    draft gives a rigorous definition of EF PHB which in ouropinion preserves the
    spirit of the EF PHB as intended by RFC 2598while allowing a number of reasonable
    compliant implementations. Thedocument also provides implementation guidance and
    lists severalpossible implementation examples which conform to the definitiongiven
    in this draft.</p>"
