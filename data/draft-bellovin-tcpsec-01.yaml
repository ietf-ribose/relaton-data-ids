abstract:
- content: "<p>The TCP-MD5 option is commonly used to secure BGP sessions between
    routers, although it is known to have many serious deficiencies. This memo presents
    requirements for a TCP segment authentication mechanism that is intended to replace
    TCP-MD5. While TCP-MD5 was designed to protect TCP sessions whose payload is BGP,
    the applicability of the mechanism described herein is broader. This mechanism
    can be applied to any TCP connection, regardless of payload.</p>"
