abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a description of a GSS-API mechanism usable
    through the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (as specified
    in Internet-Drafts [GSSV2] and [GSSV2-C]) that is easy to deploy since it does
    not rely on the existence of a security infrastructure nor the existence of a
    security server. The GSS-API-Easy mechanism enables unilateral and mutual authentication
    of peers as well as per-message protections. It is based on the use of an identifier
    and a SharedSecret shared between the client and the server and uses a protocol
    where the passphrase (i.e. a long phrase used like a password) is never sent in
    the clear. In addition, this document describes a protocol to change the SharedSecret.</p>"
