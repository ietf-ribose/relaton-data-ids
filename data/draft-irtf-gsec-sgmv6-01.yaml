abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Currently, group membership management in IP Multicast andAnycast
    can be abused in order to launch denial-of-service (DoS)attacks. The root of the
    problem is that routers cannotdetermine if a given host is authorized to join
    a group(sometimes referred to as the 'Proof-of-Membership Problem'[ECUMN00]).
    We propose a solution for IPv6 based on GroupCryptographically Generated Addresses
    (G-CGA).These addresses have characteristics of statistical uniquenessand cryptographic
    verifiability that lend themselves to severelylimiting certain classes of DoS
    attacks. Our scheme is fullydistributed and does not require any trusted third
    party orpre-established security association between the routers and thehosts.
    This is not only a huge gain in terms of scalability,reliability and overhead,
    but also in terms of privacy.</p>"
