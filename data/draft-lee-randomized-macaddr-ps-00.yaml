abstract:
- content: "<p>MAC address is the Link Layer address used in the Ethrenet protocol.
    It is usually assigned by the Network Interface Card manufacturer and being used
    for forwording and receiving frame. Due to the static nature of the MAC address,
    it raises some privacy concerns and MAC address randomization is being implemented.
    This draft documents the impacts of MAC address randomization to existing use
    cases and proposes few next steps IETF may consider to work on.</p>"
