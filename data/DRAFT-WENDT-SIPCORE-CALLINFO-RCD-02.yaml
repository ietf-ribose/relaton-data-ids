abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a SIP Call-Info header field usage
    defined to\n   include rich data associated with the identity of the calling party\n
    \  that can be rendered to called party for providing more useful\n   information
    about the caller or the specific reason for the call.\n   This includes extended
    comprehensive information about the caller\n   such as what a jCard object can
    represent for describing the calling\n   party or other call specific information
    such as describing the\n   reason or intent of the call.  The elements defined
    for this purpose\n   are intended to be extensible to accommodate related information\n
    \  about calls that helps people decide whether to pick up the phone and\n   additionally,
    with the use of jCard and other elements, to be\n   compatible with the STIR/PASSporT
    Rich Call Data framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
