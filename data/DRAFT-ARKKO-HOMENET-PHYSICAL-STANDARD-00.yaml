abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Support for network technology in buildings varies greatly
    depending\n   on the age of the building, but the ease of building a home network\n
    \  is also highly dependent on the chosen wiring, power, and equipment\n   space
    designs.  As networking technology evolves at a fast pace, it\n   is important
    to choose designs that are expected to be useful for a\n   long time.  While there
    are many cabling, equipment, and protocol\n   standards, only limited standards
    exist for the physical network\n   layout for new buildings.  This memo sets a
    baseline requirements\n   that new, single-family dwellings must at least satisfy
    in order to\n   benefit from advances in networking technology.\n\n   Standardizing
    network technology for buildings is a challenging task,\n   however.  This memo
    has been submitted for the home networking\n   working group at the IETF as one
    forum that the authors were able to\n   find that cares about the home network
    as a system.  However, in\n   general the IETF has expertise only on protocols,
    not on the physical\n   medium.  Advice is sought on what existing standards already
    address\n   this problem, what standardization efforts may be under way in the\n
    \  world, and if work remains, what the right forum to discuss these\n   matters
    might be.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
