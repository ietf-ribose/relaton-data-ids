abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the transition requirements for an IPv6 Customer
    Edge (CE) router. Specifically, this document extends the "Minimum Requirements
    for IPv6-only Customer Edge Routers" (draft- palet-v6ops-rfc7084-bis2) in order
    to allow the provisioning of IPv6 transition services for the hosts attached to
    it and the support of HNCP ([RFC7788]) for automated provisioning of downstream
    routers. The document covers several transition technologies, either for delivering
    IPv6 in IPv4-only access networks and specially for delivering IPv4 "as a service"
    as required in a world where IPv4 addresses are no longer available, so hosts
    in the customer LANs with IPv4-only or IPv6-only applications or devices, requiring
    to communicate with IPv4-only services at the Internet, are able to do so.</p>
