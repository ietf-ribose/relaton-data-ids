abstract:
  content: "<p>While an IPv6 site is being renumbered, both DHCPv6 and ND may beused
    to reconfigure the host addresses. This may cause potentialaddress configuration
    conflicts during renumbering procedure. Theissue mainly include two situations:
    a) Address configuration methodconflict, which means a host receives a new prefix
    comes from anotheraddress configuration protocol. b) Address prefix conflict,
    a hostreceives both DHCPv6 and ND address configuration messages whichassign different
    address prefixes. This documents analyzes theconflict issues and proposes a conflict
    report mechanism for hosts toreport the conflicts to DHCPv6 servers.</p>"
