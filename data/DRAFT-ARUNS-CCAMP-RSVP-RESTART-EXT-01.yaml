abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes extensions to the RSVP Graceful Restart\n
    \  mechanisms defined in [RFC3473].  The extensions enable the recovery\n   of
    RSVP signaling state based on the Path message last sent by the\n   node being
    restarted.  Previously defined Graceful Restart\n   mechanisms, also called recovery
    from nodal faults, permit recovery\n   of signaling state from adjacent nodes
    when the data plane has\n   retained the associated forwarding state across a
    restart.  These\n   mechanisms do not fully support signaling state recovery on
    ingress\n   nodes or recovery of all RSVP objects.  The presented extensions use\n
    \  the RSVP Hello extensions defined in [RFC3209], and extensions for\n   state
    recovery on nodal faults defined in [RFC3473].  With the\n   presented extensions
    the restarting node can recover all previously\n   transmitted Path state including
    the ERO and the downstream\n   (outgoing) interface identifiers.  The extensions
    can also be used to\n   recover signaling state after the restart of an ingress
    node.  The\n   extensions optionally support the use of Summary Refresh, defined
    in\n   [RFC2961], to reduce the number of messages exchanged during the\n   Recovery
    Phase when the restarting node has recovered signaling state\n   locally for one
    or more LSP's.\n\t </p>\n      "
