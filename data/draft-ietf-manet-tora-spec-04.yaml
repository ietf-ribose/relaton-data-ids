abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document provides both a functional description and a detailedspecification
    of the Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA)--adistributed routing protocol
    for multihop networks. A key concept inthe protocol's design is an attempt to
    de-couple the generation offar-reaching control message propagation from the dynamics
    of thenetwork topology. The basic, underlying algorithm is neitherdistance-vector
    nor link-state; it is a member of a class referred toas link-reversal algorithms.
    The protocol builds a loop-free,multipath routing structure that is used as the
    basis for forwardingtraffic to a given destination. The protocol can simultaneouslysupport
    both source-initiated, on-demand routing for somedestinations and destination-initiated,
    proactive routing for otherdestinations.</p>"
