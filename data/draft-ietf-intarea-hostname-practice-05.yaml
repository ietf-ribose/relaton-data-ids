abstract:
- content: "<p>Giving a hostname to your computer and publishing it as you roam from
    one network to another is the Internet's equivalent of walking around with a name
    tag affixed to your lapel. This current practice can significantly compromise
    your privacy, and something should change in order to mitigate these privacy threats.
    There are several possible remedies, such as fixing a variety of protocols or
    avoiding disclosing a hostname at all. This document describes some of the protocols
    that reveal hostnames today and sketches another possible remedy, which is to
    replace static hostnames by frequently changing randomized values.</p>"
