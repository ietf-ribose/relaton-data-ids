abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to deliver real-timecontent
    and, along with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), forms thecontrol channel between
    the sender and receiver. However, RTP andRTCP assume a single delivery path between
    the sender and receiverand make decisions based on the measured characteristics
    of thissingle path. Increasingly, endpoints are becoming multi-homed, whichmeans
    that they are connected via multiple Internet paths. Networkutilization can be
    improved when endpoints use multiple parallelpaths for communication. The resulting
    increase in reliability andthroughput can also enhance the user experience. This
    documentextends the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) so that a singlesession
    can take advantage of the availability of multiple pathsbetween two endpoints.</p>"
