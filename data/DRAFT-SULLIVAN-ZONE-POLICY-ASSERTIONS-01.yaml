abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some security policies on the Internet depend on the idea of
    the\n   \"domain policy\" or \"zone policy\".  It is difficult to discover such\n
    \  policies, and it is harder to do so in a way that does not subject\n   operators
    of domains to others' assertions.  This memo describes the\n   problem, and proposes
    a mechanism for solving it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
