abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Lightweight 4over6 is a mechanism which moves the translation\n
    \  function from tunnel lwAFTR (AFTR) to lwB4s (B4s), and hence reduces\n   the
    mapping scale on the lwAFTR to per-customer level.  This document\n   discusses
    various deployment models of Lightweight 4over6.  It also\n   describes the deployment
    considerations and applicability of the\n   Lightweight 4over6 architecture.\n\n\t
