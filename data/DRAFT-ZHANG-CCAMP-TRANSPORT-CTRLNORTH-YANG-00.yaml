abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A transport network is a server-layer network designed to provide\n
    \  connectivity services for a client-layer network to carry the client\n   traffic
    opaquely across the server-layer network resources.  A\n   transport network may
    be constructed from equipment utilizing any of\n   a number of different transport
    technologies such as the evolving\n   optical transport infrastructure (Synchronous
    Optical Networking\n   (SONET) / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical
    Transport\n   Network (OTN)) or packet transport as epitomized by the MPLS\n   Transport
    Profile (MPLS-TP).\n\n   All transport networks have high benchmarks for reliability
    and\n   operational simplicity.  This suggests a common, technology-\n   independent
    management/control paradigm that can be extended to\n   represent and configure
    specific technology attributes.\n\n   This document describes the requirements
    facing transport networks\n   in order to provide open interfaces for resource
    programmability and\n   control/management automation. A list of existing and
    additional\n   YANG models is provided to fulfill the functional requirements.\n\n\t
