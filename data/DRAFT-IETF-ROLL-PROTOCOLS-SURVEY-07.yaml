abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Low-power wireless devices, such as sensors, actuators and
    smart    objects, present difficult constraints: very limited memory, little\n
    \  processing power, and long sleep periods.  As most of these devices\n   are
    battery-powered, energy efficiency is critically important.\n   Wireless link
    qualities can vary significantly over time, requiring\n   protocols to make agile
    decisions yet minimize topology change energy\n   costs.  Routing over such low
    power and lossy networks introduces\n   requirements that existing routing protocols
    may not fully address.\n   Using existing application requirements documents,
    this document\n   derives a minimal and not exhaustive set of criteria for routing
    in\n   low-power and lossy networks.  It provides a brief survey of the\n   strengths
    and weaknesses of existing protocols with respect to these\n   criteria.  From
    this survey it examines whether existing and mature\n   IETF protocols can be
    used without modification in these networks, or\n   whether further work is necessary.
    \ It concludes that no existing\n   IETF protocol meets the requirements of this
    domain.\n\t </p>\n      "
