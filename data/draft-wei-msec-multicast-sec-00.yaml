abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Multicast security algorithm based on agent node can select the
    groupnode corresponding to the smallest path cost to be the agent node,and multicast
    in accordance with the optimal multicast routing. Inaddition, the multicast source
    node uses the key different from thegroup key to encrypt multicast data to meet
    the requirements ofmulticast security. The agent nodes can be different for differentmulticast
    sources, which can spread the burden of the agent node andavoid the excessive
    burden problem when the same node as the agentnode of different sources.</p>"
