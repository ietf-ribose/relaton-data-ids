abstract:
- content: "<p>The HTTP URL Mapping Protocol (THUMP) is a set of URL-based conventions
    for retrieving information and conducting searches. THUMP can be used for focused
    retrievals or for broad database queries. A THUMP request is a URL containing
    a query string that starts with a `?', and can contain one or more THUMP commands.
    Returned records are formatted with kernel metadata as Electronic Resource Citations,
    which are similar to blocks of email headers.</p>"
