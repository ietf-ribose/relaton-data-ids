abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the scale of MPLS RSVP-TE networks has grown, so the number
    of\n   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) supported by individual network elements\n
    \  has increased.  Various implementation recommendations have been\n   proposed
    to manage the resulting increase in control plane state.\n\n   However, those
    changes have had no effect on the number of labels\n   that a transit Label Switching
    Router (LSR) has to support in the\n   forwarding plane.  That number is governed
    by the number of LSPs\n   transiting or terminated at the LSR and is directly
    related to the\n   total LSP state in the control plane.\n\n   This document defines
    a mechanism to prevent the maximum size of the\n   label space limit on an LSR
    from being a constraint to control plane\n   scaling on that node.  That is, it
    allows many more LSPs to be\n   supported than there are forwarding plane labels
    available.\n\n   This work introduces the notion of pre-installed 'per Traffic\n
    \  Engineering (TE) link labels' that can be shared by MPLS RSVP-TE LSPs\n   that
    traverse these TE links.  This approach significantly reduces\n   the forwarding
    plane state required to support a large number of\n   LSPs.  This couples the
    feature benefits of the RSVP-TE control plane\n   with the simplicity of the Segment
    Routing MPLS forwarding plane.\n\n   This document also introduces the ability
    to mix different types of\n   label operations along the path of an LSP, thereby
    allowing the\n   ingress router or an external controller to influence how to\n
    \  optimally place a LSP in the network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
