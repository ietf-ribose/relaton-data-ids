abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC connection IDs allow continuation of connections across address/
    port 4-tuple changes, and can store routing information for stateless or low-state
    load balancers. They also can prevent linkability of connections across deliberate
    address migration through the use of protected communications between client and
    server. This creates issues for load-balancing intermediaries. This specification
    standardizes methods for encoding routing information and proposes an optional
    protocol called QUIC-LB to exchange the parameters of that encoding. This framework
    also enables offload of other QUIC functions to trusted intermediaries, given
    the explicit cooperation of the QUIC server.</p>"
