abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>With the definition of standardized media types in MIME it has
    become\nnecessary to keep mapping tables which translate between the standard\nmedia
    type names, commonly used file name extensions, any platform\nspecific typing
    mechanism, and helper applications to view, compose,\nedit or print media types.
    \ Supplying a set of site defaults is\nuseful so that users won't have to configure
    well-known types.  The\nmailcap mechanism provides some of this functionality
    in a\nhomogeneous environment with a shared file system, and both the\nMacintosh
    program 'Internet Config' and the Windows Registry have had\nsome success in consolidating
    these tables for multiple applications\non a single machine.  But neither of these
    addresses the problems of\nmulti-platform users or a heterogeneous environment.\nApplication
    Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) provides appropriate\nfacilities for this
    need.  ACAP's dataset structure is extensible and\nACAP's inheritance feature
    provides for enterprise default settings\nwith per-user customization.  This memo
    defines an ACAP dataset class\nfor media type mapping tables.\n\t </p>\n      "
