abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Several IPv6 transition mechanisms require the usage of stateless
    or\n   stateful translators (commonly named as NAT64) able to allow IP/ICMP\n
    \  communication between IPv4 and IPv6 networks.\n\n   Those translators are using
    either a default well-known prefix, and/\n   or one or several additional network
    specific prefixes, which need to\n   be configured into the nodes willing to use
    the translator.\n   Different translators will likely have different IPv6 prefixes,
    to\n   attract traffic to the correct translator.  Thus, an automatic\n   translator
    prefix discovery method is necessary.\n\n   This document defines a DHCPv6-based
    method to inform DHCPv6 clients\n   the set of IPv6 and IPv4 prefixes it serves.
    \ This DHCPv6 option can\n   be used by several transition mechanisms such as
    SIIT, 464XLAT, EAM.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
