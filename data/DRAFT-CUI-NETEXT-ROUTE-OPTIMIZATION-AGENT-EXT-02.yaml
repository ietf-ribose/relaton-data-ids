abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Route Optimization is a very useful feature in Mobile IPv6. Mobile
    \nnode can communicate with correspondent node without the involvement \nof the
    home agent in Route Optimization mode. But there are some \nlimitations to this
    feature. One problem is that the mobile node and \nthe correspondent node must
    be capable for Route Optimization. This \ndocument introduces a Route Optimization
    Agent function used for \nRoute Optimization and this extension mechanism can
    enable Route \nOptimization mode to be used between mobile node and simple IP
    node. \nIn the extension solution, the Route Optimization Agent function may \nbe
    implemented in LMA or MAG and the Agent entity can reflect the  \nRO-related signal
    messages and accomplish the Route Optimization \nprocedure on behalf of the simple
    IP node. \n\n \n\n \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",
    \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted
    as described in [RFC2119].\n\t </p>\n      "
