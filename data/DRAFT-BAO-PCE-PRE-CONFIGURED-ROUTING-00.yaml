abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Pre-configured routing is a routing scheme that except primary
    route\noperator configures one or multiple routes which will be used as\nrecovery
    route when the primary route fails for a service previously.\nThis document improves
    this traditional routing shceme, and PCE (Paht\nComputation Element) is applied
    for pre-configured routing.\nFurthermore, this document also presents a detailed
    set of PCC-PCE\n(Path Computation Client) communication protocol requirements
    and\ndefines PCEP (Path Computation Element Communication Protocol)\nextensions
    for PCEP.\n\t </p>\n      "
