abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft proposes a TTL-number space ''partition'' mechanism
    to \n   shield the access control/management plane of a service provider's \n
    \  (SP) core network from customer traffic. Provider edge routers limit \n   the
    TTL to a preset maximum value on_user_data packet that enters \n   core network,
    and the core network router drops packet with a TTL as \n   small as or smaller
    than preset value when the packet destination \n   address is the router itself.
    Since attack packets from a customer \n   site cannot reach the control plane
    or application of routers in the \n   SP core network, the control plane of the
    core network is secured \n   against the class of attacks originating outside
    the core network.  \n\t </p>\n      "
