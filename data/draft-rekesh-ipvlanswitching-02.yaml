abstract:
  content: "<p>The objective of this document is to define and formalize the use ofIP-based
    VLAN switching in the context of virtualization of networkservices. Networking
    infrastructure appliances may host multiplevirtual instances of network services.
    IP address inspection on apacket coming from an external network such as the Internet
    can beused to switch the packet into a VLAN, through use of VLAN tags onEthernet
    frames. The tagged frame is subsequently fed to a VLAN-awarenetworking infrastructure
    appliance where the packet is directed to avirtualized service instance. This
    method of IP-based VLAN switchingon a packet assists in hosting multiple virtual
    instances of networkservices on servers and other appliances.</p>"
