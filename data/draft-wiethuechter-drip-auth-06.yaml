abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to include trust into the ASTM Remote ID
    specification defined in ASTM F3411-19 under a Broadcast Remote ID (RID) scenario.
    It defines a few different message schemes (based on the Authentication Message)
    that can be used to assure past messages sent by a UA and also act as an assurance
    for UA trustworthiness in the absence of Internet connectivity at the receiving
    node.</p>"
