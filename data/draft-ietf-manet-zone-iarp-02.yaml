abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Intrazone Routing Protocol (IARP), a limited
    scope proactive routing protocol used to improve the performance of existing globally
    reactive routing protocols. With each node monitoring changes in its surrounding
    R-hop neighborhood (routing zone), global route discoveries to local destinations
    can be avoided. When a global route search is needed, the IARP's routing zones
    can be used to efficiently guide route queries outwards (via bordercasting) rather
    than blindly relaying queries from neighbor to neighbor. The proactive maintenance
    of routing zones also helps improve the quality of discovered routes, by making
    them more robust to changes in network topology. Once routes have been discovered,
    IARP's routing zone offers enhanced, real-time, route maintenance. Link failures
    can be bypassed by multiple hop paths within the routing zone. Similarly, suboptimal
    route segments can be identified and traffic re-routed along shorter paths.</p>"
