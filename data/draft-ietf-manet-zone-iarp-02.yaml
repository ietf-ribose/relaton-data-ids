abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the Intrazone Routing Protocol (IARP), alimited
    scope proactive routing protocol used to improve theperformance of existing globally
    reactive routing protocols. Witheach node monitoring changes in its surrounding
    R-hop neighborhood(routing zone), global route discoveries to local destinations
    can beavoided. When a global route search is needed, the IARP's routingzones can
    be used to efficiently guide route queries outwards (viabordercasting) rather
    than blindly relaying queries from neighborto neighbor. The proactive maintenance
    of routing zones also helpsimprove the quality of discovered routes, by making
    them more robustto changes in network topology. Once routes have been discovered,IARP's
    routing zone offers enhanced, real-time, route maintenance.Link failures can be
    bypassed by multiple hop paths within therouting zone. Similarly, suboptimal route
    segments can be identifiedand traffic re-routed along shorter paths.</p>"
