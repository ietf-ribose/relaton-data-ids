abstract:
- content: "<p>ACKs are used by transport protocols to confirm delivery of packets.
    The transmission of ACKs consumes resources at the receiver, in the network and
    at the sender. On network paths where there is significant path asymmetry, acknowledgments
    of data receipt can reduce the efficient use of network capacity. This effect
    occurs when the return capacity is significantly more constrained than the forward
    capacity, or the cost of transmission per packet is a significant component of
    the total transmission cost. In these cases, reducing the ratio of acknowledgements
    to data can improve link utilization and reduce link transmission costs. It can
    also reduce processing overhead at the sender and receiver. This document proposes
    a change to the default acknowledgement policy of the QUIC transport protocol
    to improve performance over paths with appreciable asymmetry.</p>"
