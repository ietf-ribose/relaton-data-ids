abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Address Mapping System that is
    a generic,\n   extensible, and scalable system for mapping network addresses to\n
    \  other network addresses. The Address Mapping System is intended to be\n   used
    in conjunction with overlay techniques which facilitate\n   transmission of packets
    across overlay networks. Information returned\n   by the Address Mapping System
    can include the particular network\n   overlay method and instructions related
    to the method.  The Address\n   Mapping System has a number of potential use cases
    networking\n   including identifier-locator protocols, network virtualization,
    and\n   promotion of privacy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
