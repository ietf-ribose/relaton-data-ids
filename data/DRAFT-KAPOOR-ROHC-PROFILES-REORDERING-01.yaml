abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes ROHC (Robust Header Compression) profiles\n
    \  for compression of RTP/UDP/IP (Real-Time Transport Protocol, User \n   Datagram
    Protocol, Internet Protocol), UDP/IP and ESP/IP\n   (Encapsulating Security Payload)
    headers. These profiles inherit\n   most of their functionality from the RFC 3095
    profiles, with the \n   exception that efficient support for out-of-order delivery
    of \n   packets is added to these new profiles. The profiles defined in \n   this
    document do not provide mechanisms to alleviate the issues \n   with reordering
    in the R mode, and these profiles SHOULD be used\n   only in the U/O modes.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
