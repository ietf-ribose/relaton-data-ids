abstract:
  content: "<p>The Domain Name System is a global distributed lookup system withdelegation.
    In the original specification of the DNS [RFC 1035],CLASSes were described as
    parallel data structures within a singlenamespace but with potentially different
    delegations of authority.[BCP 42] defines a different vision, in which different
    CLASSesrepresent fundamentally different namespaces. Though [BCP 42]includes procedures
    for assignment of CLASSes, there has beenlittle use of this axis of extensibility;
    in practice, CLASS IN isthe only widely deployed CLASS in the DNS. The ubiquity
    of CLASSIN for name to IP address mapping has caused a vicious cycle inwhich extensions
    are placed within that CLASS to take advantage ofits global deployment, with each
    addition further increasing itsgravitational attraction. This document describes
    a ResourceRecord for use within CLASS IN that contains a pointer to a CLASSoutside
    of IN. This mechanism is intended to allow administratorsto indicate that a named
    resource identified within CLASS IN isalso present in a different namespace, potentially
    under a differentname. This cross-class pointer will allow the DNS to handlenew
    namespaces with mechanisms appropriate to those namespaceswhile providing a connection
    to the globally deployed CLASS INnamespace.</p>"
