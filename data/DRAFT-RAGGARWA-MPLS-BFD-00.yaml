abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>One desirable application of BFD is to detect a MPLS LSP data
    plane\nfailure.  LSP-Ping [LSP-Ping] is an existing mechanism for detecting\nMPLS
    data plane failures and for verifying the MPLS LSP data plane\nagainst the control
    plane.  BFD can be used for the former, but not\nfor the latter. However a combination
    of LSP-Ping and BFD can be used\nto provide faster data plane failure detection
    and/or make it\npossible to provide such detection on a greater number of LSPs.
    \ This\ndocument describes the applicability of BFD in relation to LSP-Ping\nfor
    this application. It also describes procedures for using BFD in\nthis environment.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
