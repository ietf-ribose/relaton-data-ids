abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an algorithm for the generation of TCP Initial
    Sequence Numbers (ISNs), such that the chances of an off-path attacker guessing
    the sequence numbers in use by a target connection are reduced. This document
    revises (and formally obsoletes) RFC 1948, and takes the ISN generation algorithm
    originally proposed in that document to Standards Track, formally updating RFC
    793. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
