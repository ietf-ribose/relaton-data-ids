abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Rotating public identifiers is encouraged as best practice
    as a means\n   of protecting endpoint privacy.  For example, regular MAC address\n
    \  randomization helps mitigate device tracking across time and space.\n   Other
    protocols beyond those in the link layer also have public\n   identifiers or parameters
    that should rotate over time, in unison\n   with coupled protocol identifiers,
    and perhaps with application level\n   identifiers.  This document surveys such
    privacy-related identifiers\n   exposed by common Internet protocols at various
    layers in a network\n   stack.  It provides advice for rotating linked identifiers
    such that\n   privacy violations do not occur from rotating one identifier while\n
    \  neglecting to rotate coupled identifiers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
