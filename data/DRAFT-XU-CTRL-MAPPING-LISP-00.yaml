abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EID-to-RLOC (Endpoint Identifier to Routing Locators) mapping
    system\n   is one of the cornerstones for LISP (Location/Identifier Separation\n
    \  Protocol) networks.  This document suggests that one control unit\n   could
    be included into mapping infrastructure to provide additional\n   functions such
    as traffic engineering.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
