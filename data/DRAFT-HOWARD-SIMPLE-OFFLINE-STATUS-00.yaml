    mean\n   that the presence application will expect his watcher thinks\n   he is
    not online, though he may actually be online. According\n   current specifications

    identify the truth. Such\n   leak of specifications will make confusion in implementation.\n
    \  Here try to state a clarification for thus issue.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
