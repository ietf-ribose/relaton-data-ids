abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SMTP STARTTLS option, used in negotiating transport-level\n
    \  encryption of SMTP connections, is not as useful from a security\n   standpoint
    as it might be because of its opportunistic nature;\n   message delivery is, by
    default, prioritized over security.  This\n   document describes an SMTP service
    extension, REQUIRETLS, and message\n   header field, TLS-Required.  If the REQUIRETLS
    option or TLS-Required\n   message header field is used when sending a message,
    it asserts a\n   request on the part of the message sender to override the default\n
    \  negotiation of TLS, either by requiring that TLS be negotiated when\n   the
    message is relayed, or by requesting that recipient-side policy\n   mechanisms
    such as MTA-STS and DANE be ignored when relaying a\n   message for which security
    is unimportant.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
