abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes technology that enables for Inter-Domain signaling
    of existence of E2E path that satisfy high-level traffic treatment behavior intent.
    The inter-domain path is built by the BGP protocol, as a concatenation of per
    TE-domain internal paths (segments), provisioned by one of existing intra-domain
    techniques. The traffic treatment behavior is encoded as an integer value called
    as "COLOR". The domain internal paths/tunnels are marked as satisfying given traffic
    treatment behavior. Then the tunnel destination and its COLOR are exchanged between
    TE-Domains using a new BGP LABELED-COLORED-UNICAST NLRI (BGP-LCU) defined in this
    document.</p>
