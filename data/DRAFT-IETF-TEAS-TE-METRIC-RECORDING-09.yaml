abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     There are many scenarios in which Traffic Engineering (TE)
    metrics\n     such as cost, delay and delay variation associated with the TE link\n
    \    formed by Label Switched Path (LSP) are not available to the\n     ingress
    and egress nodes. This draft provides extensions for the\n     Resource ReserVation
    Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to\n     support automatic collection
    of cost, delay and delay variation\n     information for the TE link formed by
    a LSP.\n\n     \n\t </p>\n      "
