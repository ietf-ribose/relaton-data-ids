abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document outlines steps TCP and SCTP senders can take after
    the\ndetermine that a spurious retransmission has been sent to revert a\nneedless
    change of the congestion control state.  In addition, we\npresent several methods
    to prevent or mitigate unnecessary TCP and\nSCTP fast retransmits in the face
    of segment reordering.\n\t </p>\n      "
