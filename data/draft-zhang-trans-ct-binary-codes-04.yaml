abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes a solution extending the Certificate Transparency
    protocol [I-D.ietf-trans-rfc6962-bis] for transparently logging the software binary
    codes (BC)or its digest with their signature, to enable anyone to monitor and
    audit the software provider activity and notice the distribution of suspect software
    as well as to audit the BC logs themselves. The solution is called "Binary Transparency"
    in this document.</p>
