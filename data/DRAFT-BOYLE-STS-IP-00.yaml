abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A proposal is made to carry Synchronous Transport Signal\n(STS-N)
    services over packetized networks, in particular over IP\nnetworks. This has the
    potential to dramatically lower the price,\nease the provisioning and grooming,
    and improve managability of\ndelivering these types of circuits.  Two proposals
    are put forth for\ndiscussion on how STS services could be transported over an
    IP\nnetwork.  The first proposal, referred to as SPE1/IP, is to break OC-N\nsignals
    down into their STS-1 blocks, identify the SPE components and\npacketize these
    for transmission across a packet network.  The second\nproposal, referred to as
    STSc/IP breaks down the STS signal into the\nunderlying concatenated services
    and transports configurable length\nsegments of the signal to the far end of the
    data network.  With\neither of these approaches, different STS-N services on a
    given port\ncan be connected to different ports across the network and the\nnetwork
    will groom them onto the most optimal path available.\n\t </p>\n      "
