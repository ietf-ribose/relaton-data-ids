abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In EVPN, the Broadcast, Unknown Unicast and Multicast (BUM)
    traffic\n   is sent to all the routers participating in the EVPN instance.  In
    a\n   multi-homing scenario, when more than one PEs share the same Ethernet\n
    \  Segment, i.e. there are more than one PEs in a redundancy group, only\n   the
    PE that is the Designated-Forwarder (DF) for the ES will forward\n   that packet
    on the access interface whereas all non-DF PEs will drop\n   the packet.  From
    the perspective of the network, this is quite\n   wasteful.  This is especially
    true if there are significantly more\n   PEs on the Ethernet Segment.  This draft
    explores this problem and\n   provides a solution for the same.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
