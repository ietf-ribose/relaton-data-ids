abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>MPLS systems will be used in core networks where system downtime
    \nmust be kept to an absolute minimum.  Many MPLS LSRs may, therefore, \nexploit
    fault tolerant (FT) hardware or software to provide \nhigh availability of the
    core networks.  \nThe details of how FT is achieved for the various components
    of an FT \nLSR, including LDP, CR-LDP, the switching hardware and TCP, are \nimplementation
    specific.  This document identifies issues in the \nCR-LDP specification [2] and
    the LDP specification [4] that make it \ndifficult to implement an FT LSR using
    the current LDP and CR-LDP \nprotocols, and proposes enhancements to the LDP specification
    to ease \nsuch FT LSR implementations.  \nThe extensions described here are equally
    applicable to CR-LDP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
