abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The EST (Enrollment over Secure Transport) protocol defined
    a Well-\n   Known URI (Uniform Resource Identifier): /.well-known/est along with\n
    \  a number of other path components that clients use for PKI (Public\n   Key
    Infrastructure) services, namely certificate enrollment (e.g.,\n   /simpleenroll).
    \ This document defines a number of other PKI services\n   as additional path
    components, specifically firmware and trust\n   anchors as well as symmetric,
    asymmetric, and encrypted keys.  This\n   document also specifies the PAL (Package
    Availability List), which is\n   an XML (Extensible Markup Language) file or JSON
    (JavaScript Object\n   Notation) object that clients use to retrieve packages
    available and\n   authorized for them.  This document extends the EST server path\n
    \  components to provide these additional services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
