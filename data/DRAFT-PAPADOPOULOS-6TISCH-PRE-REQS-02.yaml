abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   6TiSCH Packet Replication and Elimination mechanism consists
    in\n   duplicating data packets into several paths in the network to\n   increase
    reliability and provide low jitter.  Over a wireless medium,\n   this technique
    can take advantage of communication overhearing, when\n   parallel transmissions
    over two adjacent paths are scheduled.  This\n   document presents the concept
    and details the required changes to the\n   current specifications that will be
    necessary to enable this.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
