abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of the SPARTACUS DNS gateway system, building a full DNS parser
    was necessary. Parsing DNS packets is the only way to avoid propogating packets
    which are not correctly formatted DNS packets. In order to facilitate building
    a new parser from scratch, the author chose to build a parser-builder which takes
    as input, a description of the DNS wire format. This document describes the language
    created to facilitate this description, and includes the resulting DNS wire format
    description in this language.</p>"
