abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing EVPN multi-homing load-balancing modes defined are Single-Active
    and All-Active. Neither of these multi-homing mechanisms adequately ethernet-segments
    facing access networks with Layer-2 Gateway protocols such as G.8032, (M)STP,
    REP, MPLS-TP, etc. These loop-preventing Layer-2 protocols require a new multi-homing
    mechanism defined in this draft.</p>"
