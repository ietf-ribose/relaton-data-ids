abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The transition from a pure IPv4 network to a network where IPv4
    and\n   IPv6 co-exist brings a number of extra security considerations that\n
    \  need to be taken into account when deploying IPv6 and operating the\n   dual-protocol
    network and the associated transition mechanisms.  This\n   document attempts
    to give an overview of the various issues grouped\n   into three categories: Issues
    due to the IPv6 protocol itself, due to\n   transition mechanisms, and due to
    the way in which IPv6 is being\n   deployed.\n\t </p>\n      "
