abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines two new link types that indicate relationships between
    resources in terms of cache invalidation, along with a HTTP cache-control extension
    that takes advantage of those relationships to use them to extend response freshness.
    Collectively, this is referred to as Linked Cache Invalidation (LCI).</p>"
