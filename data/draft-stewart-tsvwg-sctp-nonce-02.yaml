abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the addition of the ECN-nonce RFC 3540[RFC3540]
    to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) RFC 2960[RFC2960]. The ECN-nonce
    reduces the vulnerability of ECN senders tomisbehaving receivers that conceal
    congestion signals like ECN marksand packet losses. The ECN-nonce approach is
    different in SCTPbecause SCTP uses chunks for extensible protocol features and
    isselective acknowlegement (SACK)-based; this document describes thosedifferences.
    In particular this document describes (1) protocolextensions in the form of a
    single new parameter for the INIT/INIT-ACK chunks, and a single bit flag in the
    SACK chunk, and (2)rules governing the sender and receiver side implementation.This
    document outlines a minimum response that an SCTP sender shouldapply after detecting
    a misbehaving receiver.</p>"
