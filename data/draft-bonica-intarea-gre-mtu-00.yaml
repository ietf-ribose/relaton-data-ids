abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents a GRE fragmentation strategy upon which many vendors
    have converged. Specifically, it defines procedures to be executed by GRE ingress
    routers. It is published so that those building new implementations will be aware
    of best common practice. It is also published so that those building applications
    over GRE will understand how GRE works.</p>"
