abstract:
- content: <p>Virtual Aggregation as specified in [I-D.ietf-grow-va] requires configuration
    of a static "VP-List" on all routers. The VP-List allows routers to know which
    prefixes may or may not be FIB- installed. This draft specified an optional method
    of determining this that requires far less configuration. Specifically, it requires
    the configuration of a "VP-Range" in ASBRs connected to transit and peer ISPs.
    A Non-transitive Extended Communities Attribute is used to convey to other routers
    that a given route can be FIB-suppressed.</p>
