abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       This draft proposes a Hierarchical Mapping System (HMS)
    for\n       Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP). HMS uses a hierarchical\n       architecture
    as well as one-hop DHT (Distributed Hash Tables). HMS\n       composes two levels
    with the bottom level maintaining EID-to-RLOC\n       mappings in an Autonomous
    System (AS) and the upper level storing the\n       global EID-prefix-to-AS mappings.
    The bottom level is organized in\n       one-hop DHT and the upper level propagates
    EID-prefix-to-AS mappings\n       using a protocol like BGP. HMS builds an efficient
    and scalable\n       mapping system to provide RLOCs for a given EID.\n\n    \n\t
    </p>\n      "
