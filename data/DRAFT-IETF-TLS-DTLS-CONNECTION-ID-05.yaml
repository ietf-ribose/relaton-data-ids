abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Connection ID (CID) construct for
    the\n   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol version 1.2.\n\n   A
    CID is an identifier carried in the record layer header that gives\n   the recipient
    additional information for selecting the appropriate\n   security association.
    \ In \"classical\" DTLS, selecting a security\n   association of an incoming DTLS
    record is accomplished with the help\n   of the 5-tuple.  If the source IP address
    and/or source port changes\n   during the lifetime of an ongoing DTLS session
    then the receiver will\n   be unable to locate the correct security context.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
