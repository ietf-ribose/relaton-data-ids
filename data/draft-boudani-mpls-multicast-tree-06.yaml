abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A multicast router should keep forwarding state for every multicasttree
    passing through it. The number of forwarding states grows withthe number of groups.
    In this paper, we present a new approach, the MPLS multicast Tree (MMT), which
    utilizes MPLS LSPs between multicast tree branching node routers in order to reduce
    forwarding states and enhance scalability. In our approach only routers that are
    acting as multicast tree branching node routers for a group need to keep forwarding
    state for that group. All other non-branching node routers simply forward data
    packets by traffic engineered unicast routing using MPLS LSPs. We can deduce that
    our approach can be largely deployed because it uses for multicast traffic the
    same unicast MPLS forwarding scheme. We will briefly discuss the multicast scalability
    problem, related works and different techniques for forwarding state reduction.
    We discuss alsothe advantages of our approach, and conclude that it is feasible
    andpromising. Finally, we analytically evaluate our approach.</p>"
