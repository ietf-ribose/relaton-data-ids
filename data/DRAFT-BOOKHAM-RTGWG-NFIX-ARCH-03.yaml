abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The emergence of technologies such as 5G, the Internet of Things\n
    \  (IoT), and Industry 4.0, coupled with the move towards network\n   function
    virtualization, means that the service requirements demanded\n   from networks
    are changing.  This document describes an architecture\n   for a Network Function
    Interconnect (NFIX) that allows for\n   interworking of physical and virtual network
    functions in a unified\n   and scalable manner across wide-area network and data
    center domains\n   while maintaining the ability to deliver against SLAs.\n\n\n\t
