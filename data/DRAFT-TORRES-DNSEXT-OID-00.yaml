abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This file justifies and explains a DNS-like system for storing
    the\n   correspondence between OID names and numbers, as well as some\n   additional
    data that might be deemed useful. It is aimed to be\n   implemented as an extension
    to current DNS mechanisms by the addition of\n   some Resource Record and Query
    types.\n\t </p>\n      "
