abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In transport networks, there are requirements where reverse\n
    \  unidirectional LSP of a bidirectional LSP needs to follow the same\n   path
    as its forward unidirectional LSP.  This document describes how\n   RSVP Extended
    ASSOCIATION Object can be used to bind two co-routed\n   point-to-point unidirectional
    LSPs into an associated co-routed\n   bidirectional LSP in single-sided provisioning
    case.  The RSVP\n   REVERSE_LSP Object is used to enable an endpoint to trigger
    creation\n   of the reverse LSP along the same path as the forward LSP.\n   Fast-reroute
    procedures to ensure that the traffic flows on the co-\n   routed path after a
    failure event are also described.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
