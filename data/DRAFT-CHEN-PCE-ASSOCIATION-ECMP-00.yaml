abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group]introduces and explains a generic\n
    \  mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs.  The grouping can then be\n   used
    to define associations between a set of LSPs and/or a set of\n   attributes (such
    as configuration parameters or behaviours) and is\n   equally applicable to the
    active and passive modes of a stateful PCE\n   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] as
    well as a stateless PCE [RFC5440].\n\n   This document specifies a PCEP extension
    to bind one or more LSPs\n   into an ECMP Associated Group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
