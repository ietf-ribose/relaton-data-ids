abstract:
  content: "<p>The single path transport provided by the Transmission ControlProtocol
    (TCP) can be extended to a multipath transport session formulti-homed end hosts
    by coupling several TCP connections overmultiple interfaces of the end hosts.
    Payload Multi-connectionTransport (PLMT) is a multipath protocol variant that
    encodes allthe control/signaling information in the payload of TCP connectionsand
    therefore requires no additional TCP options. PLMT allows forthe simultaneous
    use of the multiple connections over potentiallydisjoint paths while being mostly
    backward compatible to single pathtransport of TCP. PLMT operates as an additional
    protocol layerbetween the network stack and the application layer. This documentdescribes
    PLMT as an example for a multipath mechanism that couldpossibly be realized entirely
    in the user-space of an operatingsystem.</p>"
