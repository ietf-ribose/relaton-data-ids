abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The security extensions to the Domain Name System (DNSSEC)
    allow for\n   integrity protection, whereby it is possible to make a determination\n
    \  of the verity of data returned from the Domain Name System in\n   response
    to a query.  Current operation of the Domain Name System\n   also allows for the
    creation of multiple views of data, where the\n   answer returned in response
    to a query is dependent on the origin of\n   the query.  Data integrity and the
    ability to return possibly\n   conflicting values as in split-views may be construed
    to be mutually\n   conflicting goals; but this apparent dichotomy is resolvable
    in\n   practice through careful configuration.  This document provides\n   recommendations
    for configuring a manageable split-view DNSSEC\n   environment in a representative
    enterprise network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
