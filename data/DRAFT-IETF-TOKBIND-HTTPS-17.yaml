abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a collection of mechanisms that allow
    HTTP\n   servers to cryptographically bind security tokens (such as cookies\n
    \  and OAuth tokens) to TLS connections.\n\n   We describe both first-party and
    federated scenarios.  In a first-\n   party scenario, an HTTP server is able to
    cryptographically bind the\n   security tokens it issues to a client, and which
    the client\n   subsequently returns to the server, to the TLS connection between
    the\n   client and server.  Such bound security tokens are protected from\n   misuse
    since the server can generally detect if they are replayed\n   inappropriately,
    e.g., over other TLS connections.\n\n   Federated token bindings, on the other
    hand, allow servers to\n   cryptographically bind security tokens to a TLS connection
    that the\n   client has with a different server than the one issuing the token.\n\n
    \  This document is a companion document to The Token Binding Protocol.\n\n\t
