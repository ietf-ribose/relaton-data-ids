abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes transporting NETCONF over WebSocket protocol[I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol].
    The use of HTTP and Web-based applications are increasing with the emergence of
    advanced drawing technologies and cloud computing. IT management systems supporting
    browser-based interface are getting common. It's natural for network management
    systems to support Web-based interface. Currently, however, few network management
    protocols support the transportation over HTTP. Although NETCONF[RFC6241] was
    defined to be sent over SOAP/HTTPS[RFC4743], it was excluded from the options
    of realizing notification mechanism[RFC5277] since HTTP lacks bi- directional
    capabilty. At present, WebSocket protocol, the update of HTTP with bi-directional
    capability, is available. This memo describes the way NETCONF is sent over WebSocket
    protocol.</p>"
