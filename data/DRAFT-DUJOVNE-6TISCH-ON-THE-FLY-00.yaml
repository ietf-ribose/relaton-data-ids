abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the environment, problem statement,
    and goals\n   of the On-The-Fly (OTF) scheduling for the IEEE802.15.4e TSCH MAC\n
    \  protocol in the context of LLNs.  The purpose of OTF is to\n   dynamically
    adapt the number of reserved cells between neighbor nodes\n   to satisfy different
    type of constraints, based on the specific\n   application.  The cell reservation
    with OTF is distributed: neighbor\n   nodes negotiate the cell(s) to be (re)allocated/deleted
    among them,\n   without the intervention of a centralized entity.  This document
    aims\n   to define a module which uses the functionalities provided by the\n   6top
    sublayer to extract statistics and to reserve/delete cells in\n   the schedule,
    leaving the reservation/deletion algorithm, and the\n   number and type of statistics
    to be used in the algorithm itself,\n   open.  OTF allows to reserve/delete either
    a single cell between a\n   couple of nodes, or a set of them (i.e., a bundle)
    in the TSCH\n   schedule.  Also, OTF allows to negotiate the aggregate bandwidth
    of a\n   link without explicitly dealing with a reservation of a specific\n   subset
    of cells.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
