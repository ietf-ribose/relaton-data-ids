abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Reputation services offer quality assessments about likely
    future\n   behavior, based on past behaviors.  The use of these services has\n
    \  become a common tool in many applications that seek to apply\n   collected
    intelligence about traffic sources.  Often this is done\n   because it is common
    or even expected operator practice.  It is\n   therefore important to be aware
    of a number of considerations for\n   both operators and consumers of the data.
    \ This document includes a\n   collection of the best advice available regarding
    providers and\n   consumers of reputation data, based on experience to date.  Much
    of\n   this is based on experience with email reputation systems, but the\n   concepts
    are generally applicable.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
