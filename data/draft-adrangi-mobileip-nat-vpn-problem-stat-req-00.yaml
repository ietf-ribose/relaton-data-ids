abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the problem statement and specifies the solution
    requirements for MIPv4 traversal across VPN or 'NAT and VPN' gateways. The 'NAT
    and VPN' case refers to a network topology in which the MIPv4 traffic has to traverse
    one or more NAT gateway(s) followed by a VPN gateway in the path to its final
    destination. Requirements and problems associated with MIPv4 traversal through
    NAT gateways NOT involving VPNs is outside the scope of this draft.</p>"
