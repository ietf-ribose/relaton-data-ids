abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The current flat-structured Host Identity Tag architecture has
    \nvarious problems and limitation. Hence, a hierarchical HIT \narchitecture that
    is compatible with the flat-structured HIT \narchitecture is introduced in the
    document. This architecture and the \nprocess of HIT generation ensure the global
    uniqueness of HITs. This \narchitecture also enables the multiple Host Identity
    Protocol \nadministrative domains, solves the deployment problem of current \nflat-structured
    HIT architecture. It also enhances the scalability \nand resolution efficiency
    of the mapping system from HIT to IP or \nFQDN.\n\t </p>\n      "
