abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the CDN-Loop request header field for HTTP. CDN-Loop
    addresses an operational need that occurs when an HTTP request is intentionally
    forwarded between Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), but is then accidentally or
    maliciously re-routed back into the original CDN causing a non-terminating loop.
    The new header field can be used to identify the error and terminate the loop.</p>"
