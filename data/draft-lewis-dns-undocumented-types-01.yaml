abstract:
- content: "<p>In the IANA registry of Resource Record (RR) TYPEs, as of October 1,
    2011, there are 10 type code values allocated with references that are individual
    email boxes and not stable documents. Some of the registrations represent works
    in progress and such a reference is viable. Some registrations are dormant or
    dead efforts. In all cases it would be helpful to have some reference to material
    describing the type.</p>"
