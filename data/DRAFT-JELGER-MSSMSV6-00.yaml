abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IPv6 describes how a Mobile Node can change its point of
    \nattachment to the Internet. While MIPv6 focuses on unicast \ncommunications,
    it also proposes two basic mechanisms, known as \nbidirectionnal tunneling and
    remote subscription, to handle \nmulticast communications with mobile members.
    In the mean time, the \ndeployment of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) is of great
    \nconsideration, using the PIM-SM and MLDv2 protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
