abstract:
  content: "<p>This document presents a method for using [SPKM] with exclusivelyshared
    secret key technologies. The messages and tokens of [SPKM] areunchanged; the only
    modifications required are to replace the defaultpublic-key cipher suite with
    ciphers and algorithms suitable for usewith shared secret keys.All messages and
    tokens defined in [SPKM] are preserved; no changesare required to the various
    authentication modes of [SPKM]. Integrityalgorithms and key establishment algorithms
    suitable for use withsecret keys are added to those specified in [SPKM], which
    are wellknown and specified for use in other existing IETF standards. We ineffect
    implement the implicit authenticated key exchange protocolproposed in [BR94] using
    the messages and tokens defined in [SPKM].An overview and brief discussion of
    the protocol appears in section1. The specific algorithms and object identifiers
    are listed insection 2. Discussion of how [SPKM] messages are used with sharedsecret
    keys appears in section 3. Security concerns are addressed insection 4. Patent
    issues are covered in section 5.</p>"
