abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a framework for analyzing mobility\n
    \  management protocols in terms of their key abstracted logical\n   functions.
    \ The framework is capable of presenting a unified view,\n   reducing the clutter
    that obscures a casual reader from understanding\n   the commonalities between
    different approaches in mobility\n   management.  More importantly, a first order
    application of this\n   framework allows us to examine previously standardized
    mobility\n   management protocols, such as MIPv6 and PMIPv6 (as well as several
    of\n   their extensions), and describe their core functionality in terms of\n
    \  different configurations of the logical functions defined by the\n   framework.
    \ As a result, we can use the framework to analyze the gaps\n   between the protocols
    needed in a distributed mobility management\n   environment and the functionality
    provided by the current generation\n   of mobility management protocols.  Our
    analysis points to the need\n   for a re-configuration of logical functions identified
    in the\n   framework as well as the need for new extensions which can make\n   distributed
    mobility management possible in the future.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
