abstract:
- content: "<p>When multiple congestion controlled RTP sessions traverse the same
    network bottleneck, it can be beneficial to combine their controls such that the
    total on-the-wire behavior is improved. This document describes such a method
    for flows that have the same sender, in a way that is as flexible and simple as
    possible while minimizing the amount of changes needed to existing RTP applications.
    It specifies how to apply the method for both the NADA and Google congestion control
    algorithms.</p>"
