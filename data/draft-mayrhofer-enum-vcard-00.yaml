abstract:
- content: <p>This memo registers the Enumservice "vCard" using the URI schemes "http"
    and "https" according to the IANA Enumservice registration process described in
    RFC3671. This Enumservice is to be used to refer from an ENUM domain name to the
    vCard of the entity using the corresponding E.164 number. Clients may use information
    gathered from those vCards before, during or after inbound or outbound communication
    takes place. For example, a callee might be presented with the name and association
    of the caller before he picks up the call.</p>
