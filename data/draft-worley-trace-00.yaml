abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a SIP option tag, "trace", to be used within SIP
    messages to request that SIP elements (both proxies and UASs) that receive the
    message reflect to the UAC the request they received and the response they gave
    by encapsulating the request and response in a provisional response. A new provisional
    response code "170" is defined to carry the request and response. This option
    tag is expected to be used solely for diagnostic purposes.</p>
