abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When setting up a label switched path (LSP) in Generalized
    MPLS and\n   MPLS/TE networks, the completion of the signaling process does not\n
    \  necessarily mean that the cross connection along the LSP have been\n   programmed
    accordingly and in a timely manner.  Meanwhile, the\n   completion of signaling
    process may be used by applications as\n   indication that data path has become
    usable.  The existence of this\n   delay and the possible failure of cross connection
    programming, if\n   not properly treated, will result in data loss or even application\n
    \  failure.  Characterization of this performance can thus help\n   designers
    to improve the application model and to build more robust\n   applications.  This
    document defines a series of performance metrics\n   to evaluate the connectivity
    of data path in the signaling process.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
