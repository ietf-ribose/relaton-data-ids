abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a first attempt at evaluating the recently\n
    \  published RFC.  We analyze a set of randomly chosen RFC approved in\n   2018,
    looking for history and delays.  The average RFC was produced\n   in 3 years and
    4 months, of which 2 years and 10 months were spent in\n   the working group,
    3 to 4 months for IETF consensus and IESG review,\n   and 3 to 4 months in RFC
    production.  The main variation in RFC\n   production delays comes from the AUTH48
    phase.\n\n   We also measure the number of citations of the chosen RFC using\n
    \  Semantic Scholar, and compare citation counts with what we know about\n   deployment.
    \ We show that citation counts indicate academic interest,\n   but correlate only
    loosely with deployment or usage of the\n   specifications.\n\n   The measurement
    of delays could be automated by processing dates and\n   events recorded in the
    data tracker.  The measurement of published\n   RFC could be complemented by statistics
    on abandoned drafts, which\n   would measure the efficiency of the IETF triaging
    process.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
