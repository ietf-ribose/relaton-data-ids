abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains a risk assessment of IP paging. The described
    risks are probably independent of any underlying functional architecture and mobility
    protocol. Accordingly, several security requirements are defined. These requirements
    are to be supported by an IP paging protocol in order to completely defeat or
    not to encourage the relevant attacks.</p>"
