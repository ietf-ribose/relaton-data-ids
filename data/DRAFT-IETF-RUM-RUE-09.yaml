abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method
    by\n   which a hearing person can communicate with a deaf, hard of hearing\n   or
    hearing impaired user using an interpreter (\"Communications\n   Assistant\")
    connected via a videophone to the deaf/HoH user and an\n   audio telephone call
    to the hearing user.  The CA interprets using\n   sign language on the videophone
    link and voice on the telephone link.\n   Often the interpreters may be employed
    by a company or agency termed\n   a \"provider\" in this document.  The provider
    also provides a video\n   service that allows users to connect video devices to
    their service,\n   and subsequently to CAs and other deaf/HoH users.  It is desirable\n
    \  that the videophones used by the deaf, hard of hearing or hearing\n   impaired
    user conform to a standard so that any device may be used\n   with any provider
    and that direct video calls between deaf, hard of\n   hearing or hearing impaired
    users work.  This document describes the\n   interface between a videophone and
    a provider.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
