abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes some performance issues that have been\n
    \  observed when multicast packet transmission is attempted over IEEE\n   802
    wireless media.  Multicast features specified for IEEE 802\n   wireless media
    related to multicast are also described, along with\n   explanations about how
    these features can help ameliorate the\n   observed performance issues.  IETF
    protocols that are likely to be\n   affected by the observed performance issues
    are identified, and\n   workarounds are proposed in some cases.  The performance
    of multicast\n   over wireless media often can be quite different than the performance\n
    \  of unicast.  This draft describes the nature of the differences and\n   the
    effects on representative IETF protocols.  We also describe some\n   efforts that
    have been made by IEEE 802 Wireless groups to ameliorate\n   the performance differences.\n\n\t
