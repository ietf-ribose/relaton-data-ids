abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There has been significant recent work in increasing the capabilities\nof
    Ethernet switches. As a consequence, the role of Ethernet is\nrapidly expanding
    into \"transport networks\" that previously were the\ndomain of other technologies
    such as SONET/SDH TDM and ATM. This\ndocument defines an architecture and framework
    for a GMPLS based\ncontrol plane for Ethernet in this \"transport network\" capacity.\nGMPLS
    has already been specified for similar technologies. Some\nadditional extensions
    to the GMPLS control plane are needed and this\ndocument provides a framework
    for these extensions.Contents\n\t </p>\n      "
