abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes two algorithms, one for source address\n
    \  selection and one for destination address selection.  The algorithms\n   specify
    default behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)\n   implementations.
    \ They do not override choices made by applications\n   or upper-layer protocols,
    nor do they preclude the development of\n   more advanced mechanisms for address
    selection.  The two algorithms\n   share a common context, including an optional
    mechanism for allowing\n   administrators to provide policy that can override
    the default\n   behavior.  In dual stack implementations, the destination address\n
    \  selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses -\n   depending
    on the available source addresses, the algorithm might\n   prefer IPv6 addresses
    over IPv4 addresses, or vice-versa.\n\n   Default address selection as defined
    in this specification applies to\n   all IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and
    routers.  This document\n   obsoletes RFC 3484.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
