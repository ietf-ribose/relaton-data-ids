abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft outlines how a dual stack mobile node can be reached
    and\ncommunicate by means of both IPv4 and IPv6, even in situations where\nthe
    mobile node is in reach of only either IPv4 or IPv6 networks. A\nDual Stack Mobility
    Agent accommodates mobility and translates\nbetween IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. It
    may operate as a mobility agent in\nits own right or as a module that relays traffic
    between existing\nsingle stack Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 home agents.\n\t </p>\n
