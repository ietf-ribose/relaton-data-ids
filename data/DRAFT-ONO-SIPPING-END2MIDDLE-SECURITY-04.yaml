abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some services provided by intermediaries depend on the ability
    to\n   inspect the message bodies in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\n
    \  When sensitive information is included in these bodies, a SIP User\n   Agent
    (UA) needs to protect it from intermediaries except those that\n   the UA agreed
    to disclose it to.  This document proposes a mechanism\n   for securing information
    passed between an end user and\n   intermediaries using S/MIME.  It also proposes
    mechanisms for an\n   intermediary to notify the UA about its need to inspect
    an\n   S/MIME-secured message body, and to notify the need for the message\n   body
    to be transmitted securely.\n\t </p>\n      "
