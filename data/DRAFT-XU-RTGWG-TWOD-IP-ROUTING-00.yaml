abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes Two Dimensional IP (TwoD-IP) routing,
    a new\n   Internet routing architecture which makes forwarding decisions based\n
    \  on both source address and destination address.  This presents a\n   fundamental
    extension from the current Internet, which makes\n   forwarding decisions based
    on the destination address, and provides\n   shortest single-path routing towards
    destination.  Such extension\n   provides rooms to solve fundamental problems
    of the past and foster\n   great innovations in the future.\n\n   We present the
    TwoD-IP routing framework and its two underpinning\n   schemes.  The first is
    a new hardware-based forwarding table\n   structure for TwoD-IP, FIST, which achieves
    line-speed lookup with\n   acceptable storage space.  The second is a policy routing
    protocol\n   that flexibly diverts traffic.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
