abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies extensions to PCEP protocol when a
    PCE-based\n   controller is also responsible for configuring the forwarding actions\n
    \  on the routers, in addition to computing the paths for packet flows\n   in
    a BIER-TE network and telling the edge routers what instructions\n   to attach
    to packets as they enter the network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
