abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Tunnel Buffering (TB) is an interoperable enhancement to Mobile
    IPv6\n   to reduce packet loss during movement, and to avoid retransmission\n
    \  when movement is complete.\n\n   TB does this by 'pausing' the packets which
    are to be send over a\n   MobileIPv6 or HMIPv6 tunnel until movement is complete.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
