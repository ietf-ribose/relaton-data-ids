abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   From time to time, networking protocols need to be able to
    name\n   things used within the protocol, and resolve the names created or\n   referenced.
    \ It's common for protocol designers in this predicament\n   to attempt to use
    domain names as the starting point for their\n   systems of names, and the DNS
    as the starting point for name\n   resolution.\n\n   There is existing guidance
    on how to think about application-specific\n   extensions to DNS if the protocol
    or software designer is re-using\n   both domain name abstractions and DNS protocol
    assumptions (see RFC\n   6950).  However, recently there's also a tendency to
    re-use a domain-\n   name-based namespace without necessarily re-using DNS protocol
    for\n   name resolution.  This document acknowledges that class of extensions\n
    \  to the shared domain namespace and considers a framework for the\n   properties
    a naming and resolution convention should have in the\n   internet protocol environment,
    including the avoidance of collision\n   with other uses of the namespace.  Depending
    to the answers to the\n   suggested questions, the answer may be that domain names
    will not\n   meet the constraints at hand.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
