abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is a proposal of the distributed autonomous depth-first
    \n\n  routing (DADR) protocol which is quite different from conventional \n\n
    \ algorithms such as AODV and OLSR. It proposes a traversable algorithm \n\n  which
    can determine a direct path between the global source and the \n\n  global destination
    in a low power and lossy network (LLN). We propose \n\n  the DADR algorithm whose
    characteristics work well in LLNs with more \n\n  than 10^4 nodes. This algorithm
    selects a direct path between the \n\n  global source and the global destination
    based on a routing-cost-\n\n  function which identifies path-candidates with good
    communication \n\n  quality between each pair of nodes on the path. This protocol
    does \n\n  not need to configure the equipment such as setting IP addresses, and
    \n\n  thisresults in saving cost and time in deploying, establishing and \n\n
    \ operating a large scale network. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
