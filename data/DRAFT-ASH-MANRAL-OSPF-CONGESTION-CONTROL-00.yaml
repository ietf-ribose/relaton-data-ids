abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Based on overload and failure experience with link-state protocols,
    this \ndraft identifies means to enable link-state protocols to:\no avoid getting
    into congestion states wherever possible\no respond gracefully to network overloads
    and failures\no gracefully recover from massive loss of topology database \ninformation\nThe
    proposed mechanisms include the following:\no throttle setups of link adjacencies\no
    reduce the rate of flooding of link-state-advertisements(LSAs)\no prioritized
    treatment of Hello &amp; LSA ack packets\no database backup &amp; resynchronization
    for graceful recovery from loss \nof topology database information.\n\t </p>\n
