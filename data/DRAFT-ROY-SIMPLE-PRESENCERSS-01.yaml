abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Web feeds (hereby referred to as 'feed') have always played
    an \n   important role in providing users content related updates of Websites
    \n   without having to visit those websites manually. Typical examples of \n   feed
    usage include users 'subscribing' to the feed of a website \n   (example, CNN.com)
    and thereby automatically receiving 'news \n   headlines' when the content changes.
    Recently, there have been \n   significant innovations (example [13][12]) where
    feeds from different \n   sources have been combined to produce new services in
    a 'Web Based \n   Service Creation Environment' model allowing users to create
    \n   interesting services building on top of 'primitives' that can be \n   represented
    on the Web.   \n\n   This document describes the motivation for a feed for Presence
    \n   information, which the authors believe would be useful to create new \n   services
    using a similar environment described above. \n\n   NOTE 1:  Architecturally,
    it is also possible that the reverse \n   situation, i.e. feed converted to a
    Presence state is also useful, \n   typically for services that could be triggered
    at the Presentity \n   based on certain conditions. However, this document focuses
    on the \n   former, i.e. Presence state to feed.  \n\n   NOTE 2: It is not necessary
    that each PUA support the capability of \n   generating feeds. It is possible
    that a central aggregation server \n   generates the required feed on behalf of
    the PUAs.  \n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
