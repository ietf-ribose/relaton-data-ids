abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently, in-network aggregation to scale distributed machine learning
    (ML) has been presented. A network switch implementation uses IPv4 broadcast messages
    from switch to the hosts to send updates to all workers. IPv6 does not support
    broadcast addresses. This document proposes, IPv6 implementations use the IPv6
    link-local all- nodes multicast address to receive messages from a switch, until
    a new link-local multicast address is assigned by IANA for switch to hosts multicast
    communications for switch machine learning algorithms.</p>"
