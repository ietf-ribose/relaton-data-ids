abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo registers a trace field clause for use in indicating\n
    \  transitions between handling queues or processing states, including\n   enacting
    inter- and intra-host message transitions.  This might\n   include message quarantining,
    mailing list moderation, timed\n   delivery, queueing for further analysis, content
    conversion, or other\n   similar causes, as well as optionally identifying normal
    handling\n   queues.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
