abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed.\n
    \  The Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous sites, each being\n   a
    collection of nodes.  Each site is named by a site address drawn\n   from a global
    number space while each node is named by a node address\n   drawn from a number
    space local to each site.  Routing among sites\n   depends solely on site addresses
    while that within each site on node\n   addresses.  Flat routing to render inherent
    mobility as well as\n   mapped routing to additionally cope with table size are
    proposed.\n   The model can recursively repeat itself both outwards and inwards
    in\n   the network, enabling its applicability, for example, to inter-\n   planetary
    as well as body area networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
