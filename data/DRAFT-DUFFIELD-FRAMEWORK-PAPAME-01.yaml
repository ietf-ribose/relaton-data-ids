abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A wide range of traffic engineering and troubleshooting tasks
    rely on\nreliable, timely, and detailed traffic measurements. We describe a\npassive
    packet measurement framework that is (a) general enough to\nserve as the basis
    for a wide range of operational tasks, and (b)\nrelies on a small set of primitives
    that facilitate uniform\ndeployment in router interfaces or dedicated measurement
    devices,\neven at very high speeds. This document describes the motivation for\nsuch
    a framework through several operational examples, defines the\nmeasurement primitives
    (filtering, sampling, and hashing), and\nillustrates their use.\n\t </p>\n      "
