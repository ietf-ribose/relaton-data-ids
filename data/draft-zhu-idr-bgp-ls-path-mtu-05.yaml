abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP Link State (BGP-LS) describes a mechanism by which link-state and
    TE information can be collected from networks and shared with external components
    using the BGP routing protocol. The centralized controller (PCE/SDN) completes
    the service path calculation based on the information transmitted by the BGP-LS
    and delivers the result to the Path Computation Client (PCC) through the PCEP
    or BGP protocol. Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm, which
    can be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with no change on the forwarding
    plane and applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of routing header,
    called SRH. The SR uses the IGP protocol as the control protocol. Compared to
    the MPLS tunneling technology, the SR does not require additional signaling. Therefore,
    the SR does not support the negotiation of the Path MTU. Since multiple labels
    or SRv6 SIDs are pushed in the packets, it is more likely that the packet size
    exceeds the path mtu of SR tunnel. This document specifies the extensions to BGP
    Link State (BGP-LS) to carry maximum transmission unit (MTU) messages of link.
    The PCE/SDN calculates the Path MTU while completing the service path calculation
    based on the information transmitted by the BGP-LS.</p>"
