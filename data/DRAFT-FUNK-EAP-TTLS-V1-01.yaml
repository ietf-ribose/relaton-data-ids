abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>EAP-TTLS is an EAP type that utilizes TLS to establish a secure
    \nconnection between a client and server, through which additional \ninformation
    may be exchanged. The initial TLS handshake may mutually \nauthenticate client
    and server; or it may perform a one-way \nauthentication, in which only the server
    is authenticated to the \nclient. The secure connection established by the initial
    handshake \nmay then be used to allow the server to authenticate the client \nusing
    existing, widely-deployed authentication infrastructures such \nas RADIUS. The
    authentication of the client may itself be EAP, or it \nmay be another authentication
    protocol such as PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP or \nMS-CHAP-V2. \n\nThus, EAP-TTLS allows
    legacy password-based authentication protocols \nto be used against existing authentication
    databases, while \nprotecting the security of these legacy protocols against \neavesdropping,
    man-in-the-middle and other cryptographic attacks. \n\nEAP-TTLS also allows client
    and server to exchange other information \nin addition to authentication-related
    information. \n\nThis document describes EAP-TTLSv1; that is, version 1 of the
    EAP-\nTTLS protocol. It represents a significant enhancement to the \noriginal
    version 0 of the protocol. EAP-TTLSv1 utilizes an extended \nversion of TLS, called
    TLS/IA (TLS/InnerApplication) as its \nunderlying protocol [TLS/IA]. \n\t </p>\n
