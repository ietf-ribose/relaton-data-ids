abstract:
  content: "<p>This document provides a framework that describes a solution spacefor
    the control and management of optical interfaces according to theBlack Link approach
    as specified by ITU-T [ITU.G698.2] and beyond(friendly wavelength). In particular,
    it examines topologicalelements and related network management measures.Optical
    Routing and Wavelength assignment based on WSON is out ofscope. This document
    concentrates on the management of opticalinterfaces. The application of a dynamic
    control plane, e.g. forauto-discovery or for the distribtion of interface parameters,
    iscomplementary. Anyway, this work is not in conflict with WSON butleverages and
    supports related work already done for management planeand control plane.Furthermore,
    support for Fast Fault Detection, to e.g. triggerProtection Switching is provided
    by the WDM interface capability ofthe client interface (e.g. ITU-T G.709) is out
    of scope for thiswork. Additionally the wavelength ordering process and the processhow
    to determine the demand for a new wavelength from A to Z is outof scope.</p>"
