abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This paper presents an approach for solving the inherent problem
    withmulticast routing scalability - by co-operation between end-systems andthe
    network. We introduce an extremely efficient, elegant way to namearbitrary sized
    inter-meshed aggregations of multicast addresses. Thisis done in such a way that
    it is easy to calculate how to change thename to encompass many more related names.
    We describe how theseaggregate names could be used anywhere in place of the set
    of addressesto which they refer, not by resolving them into multiple operations,
    butby a single bulk action throughout the routing tree, and in sessiondescriptions
    potentially including those for reservations. Initialaggregation in end-systems
    might only reduce the problem by an order ofmagnitude, but it is believed that
    this will provide sufficientstructure for routers to be able to recognise further
    aggregationpotential. To improve the chances of router aggregation, address setallocation
    schemes must fulfil certain criteria that are laid down inthis paper.</p>"
