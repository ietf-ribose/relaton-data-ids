abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In RFC 2826, the IAB set out the benefits of a globally unique
    public\n   name space.  As alternative contexts of resolution emerge, such as\n
    \  those implied by RFC 7686, maintaining a single namespace for the\n   Internet
    requires a method to indicate the context of resolution for\n   a name.  This
    document proposes a registry for such alternative\n   resolution contexts as well
    as a set of pointer resource record types\n   useful for allowing conformant resolvers
    which query for the name in\n   the DNS to be redirected to the appropriate alternative
    resolution\n   context.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
