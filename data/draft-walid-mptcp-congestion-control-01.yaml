abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the mechanism of Balia, the "Balanced linked
    adaptation", which is a congestion control algorithm for Multipath TCP (MPTCP).
    The recent proposals, LIA and OLIA, suffer from either unfriendliness to Single
    Path TCP (SPTCP) or unresponsiveness to network changes under certain conditions.
    The tradeoff between friendliness and responsiveness is inevitable, but Balia
    judiciously balances this tradeoff based on a new design framework that allows
    one to systematically explore the design space. Balia has been implemented in
    the Linux kernel and there are plans to make it available for experimentation.</p>
