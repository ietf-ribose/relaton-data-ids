abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IETF-standardized unicast transport protocols have been \ndesigned
    to allow two end points to maintain communications by \nindividually reacting
    to loss or degraded packet arrival times. \nHistorically, those protocols have
    assumed loss is congestive \nand have reacted by decreasing the packet transmission
    rate to \nease congestion. There are a number of cases, however, where \nthese
    assumptions are incorrect, and one or more path segments \npresent losses due
    to intermittent connectivity, a high \nuncorrected error rate, or the need for
    access path changes \n('hand-off's). Previous work [PILC] has addressed these
    \nconditions using end-to-end mechanisms. This draft examines the \nuse of an
    on-path signaling mechanisms capable of providing \nadvisory notifications for
    use in modifying the behavior of the \ntransport in order to better respond to
    actual network \nconditions.  This draft serves to create discussion in this area\nas
    there are many ways to skin the cat. We are interested in \nhearing about them
    through open discussion.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
