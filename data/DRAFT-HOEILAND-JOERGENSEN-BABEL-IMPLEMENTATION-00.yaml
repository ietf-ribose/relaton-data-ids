abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the experiences creating independent\n
    \  implementations of the Babel routing protocol [RFC6126], based on the\n   two
    independent implementations currently available.\n\n   The Babel routing protocol
    is easy to implement, and it is quite\n   feasible for someone with no prior experience
    with routing protocols\n   to create a working implementation.  The few issues
    that needed\n   clarification during the independent implementation work are\n
    \  documented, with the hope of aiding others seeking to implement\n   Babel.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
