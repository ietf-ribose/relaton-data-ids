abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes TCP fairness performance enhancement scheme
    by use of two parameters congestion degree and link idle rate. It uses IP header
    flag reserved field and ECN 2 bits field to form a new IP congestion and Spare
    Flag (ICSF) and uses 3bits of reserved bits in the TCP header to compose the TCP
    Congestion and Spare Flag (TCSF) field. This method identifies the congestion
    and link idle status to make sure that every TCP flow can receive the same degree
    of fairness and can improve TCP send window adjustment speed and transmission
    efficiency.</p>"
