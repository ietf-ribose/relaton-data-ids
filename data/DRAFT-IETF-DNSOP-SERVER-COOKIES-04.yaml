abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS Cookies, as specified in [RFC7873], are a lightweight DNS\n
    \  transaction security mechanism that provide limited protection to DNS\n   servers
    and clients against a variety of denial-of-service and\n   amplification, forgery,
    or cache poisoning attacks by off-path\n   attackers.\n\n   This document provides
    precise directions for creating Server Cookies\n   so that an anycast server set
    including diverse implementations will\n   interoperate with standard clients.\n\n
    \  This document updates [RFC7873] with\n\n   *  suggestions for constructing
    Client Cookies in a privacy\n      preserving fashion,\n\n   *  precise instructions
    for constructing Server Cookies deprecating\n      the methods described in [RFC7873],
    and\n\n   *  suggestions on how to update a server secret.\n\n   An IANA registry
    listing the methods and associated pseudo random\n   function suitable for creating
    DNS Server cookies is created, with\n   the method described in this document
    as the first and as of yet only\n   entry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
