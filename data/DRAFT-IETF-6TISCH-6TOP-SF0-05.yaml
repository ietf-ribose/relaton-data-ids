abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a Scheduling Function called \"Scheduling\n
    \  Function Zero\" (SF0).  SF0 dynamically adapts the number of scheduled\n   cells
    between neighbor nodes, based on the amount of currently\n   allocated cells and
    the neighbor nodes' cell requirements.  Neighbor\n   nodes negotiate in a distributed
    neighbor-to-neighbor basis the\n   number of cell(s) to be added/deleted.  SF0
    uses the 6P signaling\n   messages to add/delete cells in the schedule.  This
    function selects\n   the candidate cells from the schedule, defines which cells
    will be\n   added/deleted and triggers the allocation/deallocation process.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
