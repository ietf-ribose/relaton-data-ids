abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In highly dynamic, heterogeneous radio MANET environments where
    links\n   are constantly changing, standardizing information exchange between\n
    \  the radio and router such that routers can make informed  routing\n   decision
    based on link layer information over heterogeneous link\n   types becomes a key
    area to address. This document defines the basic\n   framework for radio-to-router
    interface communications as well as\n   requirements and considerations for evaluating
    radio-to-router\n   interface technologies for use in MANETs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
