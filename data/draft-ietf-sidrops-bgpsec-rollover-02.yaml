abstract:
- content: "<p>Certificate Authorities (CAs) managing CA certificates and End-Entity
    (EE) certificates within the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) will also
    manage BGPsec router certificates. But the rollover of CA and EE certificates
    BGPsec router certificates have additional considerations for Normal and emergency
    rollover processes. The rollover must be carefully managed in order to synchronize
    distribution of router public keys and BGPsec routers creating BGPsec Update messages
    verified with those router public keys. This document provides general recommendations
    for the rollover process, as well as describing reasons why the rollover of BGPsec
    router certificates might be necessary. When this rollover process is followed
    the rollover should be accomplished without routing information being lost.</p>"
