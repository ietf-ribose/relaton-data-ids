abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Typically applications developers have requested static IANA\n
    \  assignments for the applications, even if the applications would\n   typically
    be only used within a site, between consenting sites, or\n   would not eventually
    even use multicast at all.  This memo describes\n   this problem space, and summarizes
    a number of proposed approaches to\n   mitigating these problems.\n\t </p>\n      "
