abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A number of protocols have been defined at the IETF to handle IPmobility
    and multi-homing - each of the defined protocols satisfies adifferent set of requirements
    - however, there is an overlap on someof the requirements and features among many
    of these protocols. Inpractice, a combination of the protocols are likely to be
    deployed ina system. There are various such combinations plausible, but somecombinations
    are more realistic than others. This document analyzesthe overall mobility and
    multi-homing architecture and highlightssome key points to consider while deploying
    an architectureconsisting of one or more of these protocols. The protocolsconsidered
    in scope for this document include Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4),Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), Hierarchical
    Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), Fast MobileIPv6 (FMIPv6), Network-based Local Mobility Management
    (NetLMM),MOBIKE, Host Identity Protocol (HIP), and Shim6.</p>"
