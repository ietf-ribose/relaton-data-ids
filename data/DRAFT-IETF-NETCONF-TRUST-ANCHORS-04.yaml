abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a YANG 1.1 data model for configuring
    global\n   sets of X.509 certificates and SSH host-keys that can be referenced\n
    \  by other data models for trust.  While the SSH host-keys are uniquely\n   for
    the SSH protocol, the X.509 certificates may have multiple uses,\n   including
    authenticating protocol peers and verifying signatures.\n\nEditorial Note (To
    be removed by RFC Editor)\n\n   This draft contains many placeholder values that
    need to be replaced\n   with finalized values at the time of publication.  This
