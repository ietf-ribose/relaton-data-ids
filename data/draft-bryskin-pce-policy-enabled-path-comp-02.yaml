abstract:
- content: "<p>The PCE architecture [PCE-ARCH] introduces the concept of policy in
    the context of path computation. This document provides additional details on
    policy within the PCE Architecture and also provides context for the support of
    PCE Policy. This document introduces the use of the Policy Core Information Model
    (PCIM) as a framework for supporting path computation policy. This document also
    provides representative scenarios for the support of PCE Policy.</p>"
