abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The more and more complicated IP networks require a new interaction\n
    \  mechanism between their customers and their networks.  A service\n   description
    language is needed to enable customers to easily describe\n   their diverse service
    requirements.  SDN controller would compile\n   these service requirements into
    device configurations.  This document\n   analyzes requirements for such service
    description language and gives\n   considerations for designing such service description
    language.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
