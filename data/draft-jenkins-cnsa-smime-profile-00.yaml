abstract:
- content: "<p>The United States government has published the NSA Commercial National
    Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite, which defines cryptographic algorithm policy
    for national security applications. This document specifies the conventions for
    using the United States National Security Agency's CNSA Suite algorithms in Secure/Multipurpose
    Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) as specified in RFC 8551. It applies to the
    capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of US National Security
    Systems that employ S/MIME messaging. US National Security Systems are described
    in NIST Special Publication 800-59. It is also appropriate for all other US Government
    systems that process high-value information. It is made publicly available for
    use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.</p>"
