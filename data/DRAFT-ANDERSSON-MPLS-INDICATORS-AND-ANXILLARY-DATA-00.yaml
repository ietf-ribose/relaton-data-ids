abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is a living document, meaning that during the
    life\n   timme of the MPLS Open Design Team we will to survey the relationship\n
    \  between indicators and anxillary dat.\n\n   Ideally when the Design Team is
    closed this document will be empty,\n   or maybe we just add a pointer to where
    the answer to quesstion is\n   documented.  Thus this document will never go on
    to become an RFCc.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
