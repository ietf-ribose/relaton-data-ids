abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In 2006 the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising\n
    \  SPF and Sender-ID, two proposed email authentication protocols.\n   Because
    of interoperability concerns created by simultaneous use of\n   the two protocols
    by a receiver, and some concerns with Sender-ID and\n   compatibility with existing
    standards, the IESG required them to have\n   Experimental status and invited
    the community to observe their\n   deployments for a period of time, hoping convergence
    would be\n   possible later.\n\n   After six years, sufficient experience and
    evidence have been\n   collected that the experiment thus created can be considered\n
    \  concluded, and a common path forward can be selected.  This memo\n   presents
    those findings.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
