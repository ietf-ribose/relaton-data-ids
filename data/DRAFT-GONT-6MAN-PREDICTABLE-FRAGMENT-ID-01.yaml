abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 specifies the Fragment Header, which is employed for the\n
    \  fragmentation and reassembly mechanisms.  The Fragment Header\n   contains
    an \"Identification\" field which, together with the IPv6\n   Source Address and
    the IPv6 Destination Address of the packet,\n   identifies fragments that correspond
    to the same original datagram,\n   such that they can be reassembled together
    at the receiving host.\n   The only requirement for setting the \"Identification\"
    value is that\n   it must be different than that of any other fragmented packet
    sent\n   recently with the same Source Address and Destination Address.  Some\n
    \  implementations simply use a global counter for setting the Fragment\n   Identification
    field, thus leading to predictable values.  This\n   document analyzes the security
    implications of predictable\n   Identification values, and updates RFC 2460 specifying
    additional\n   requirements for setting the Fragment Identification, such that
    the\n   aforementioned security implications are mitigated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
