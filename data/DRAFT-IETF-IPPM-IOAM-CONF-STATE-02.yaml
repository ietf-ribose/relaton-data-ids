abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an extension to the echo request/reply\n
    \  mechanisms used in IPv6 (including SRv6), MPLS (including SR-MPLS),\n   SFC
    and BIER environments, which can be used within the IOAM domain,\n   allowing
    the IOAM encapsulating node to discover the enabled IOAM\n   capabilities of each
    IOAM transit and IOAM decapsulating node.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
