abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a DDoS Mitigation Request parameter
    used in\n   the Signal Channel request, as an expansion of the signal channel
    for\n   mitigating DDoS attack accurately with target-bandwidth.  The\n   proposed
    parameter will help to choose the appropriate mitigator or\n   mitigators for
    mitigation, When An attack occurs that is greater than\n   the maximum clean capability,
    this paramter can decide to be\n   blackhole directly or to be drainaged for clean.\n\n\t
