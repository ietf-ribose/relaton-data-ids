abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MVPN is a widely deployed multicast service with mLDP or RSVP-TE
    P2MP\n   as the P-tunnel.  Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an\n   architecture
    that provides optimal multicast forwarding without\n   requiring intermediate
    routers to maintain any per-flow state by\n   using a multicast-specific BIER
    header.  This document introduces a\n   seamless transition mechanism from legacy
    MVPN using mLDP/RSVP-TE\n   P2MP to MVPN using BIER by combining P2MP and BIER
    to form a P2MP\n   based BIER as the P-tunnel.  This will leverage the widely
    supported\n   P2MP capability in both data-plane and control-plane, and will help\n
    \  introducing BIER in existing multicast networks to shift multicast\n   delivery
    from MVPN using mLDP/RSVP-TE P2MP by two means: It is easier\n   and more efficient
    for legacy routers to support BIER forwarding on\n   the basis of widely supported
    P2MP forwarding, and it is more\n   seamless for existing multicast networks to
    deploy BIER when some\n   routers do not support BIER forwarding.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
