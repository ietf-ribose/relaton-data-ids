abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current VPLS multicast proposals based on multicast tree
    has  \n   several issues that are outlined in [BRIDGE-INTEROP]. These issues \n
    \  stems from the divergence of the multicast and unicast paths for a \n   given
    VPLS instance in the MPLS/IP network. This draft describes a \n   mechanism for
    building multicast and unicast paths that are congruent \n   in order to address
    these issues.   \n\t </p>\n      "
