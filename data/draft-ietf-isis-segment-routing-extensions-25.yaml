abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
    paths within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths,
    called "segments". These segments are advertised by the link-state routing protocols
    (IS-IS and OSPF). This document describes the IS-IS extensions that need to be
    introduced for Segment Routing operating on an MPLS data plane.</p>
