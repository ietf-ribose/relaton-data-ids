abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo defines a simple mechanism, termed gateway responseprotocol
    (GRP), which permits hosts using Zero Configuration IPv4Addresses [1] to find
    and use a default gateway, thereby gainingaccess to outside networks, including
    the Internet. GRP is fullycompliant with rules limiting Zero Configuration addresses
    to localnetworks and does not negate source/destination address assumptions.</p>"
