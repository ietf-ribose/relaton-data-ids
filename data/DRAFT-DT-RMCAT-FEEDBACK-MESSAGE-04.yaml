abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a feedback message intended to enable\n
    \  congestion control for interactive real-time traffic.  The RTP Media\n   Congestion
    Avoidance Techniques (RMCAT) Working Group formed a design\n   team to analyze
    feedback requirements from various congestion control\n   algorithms and to design
    a generic feedback message to help ensure\n   interoperability across those algorithms.
    \ The feedback message is\n   designed for a sender-based congestion control,
    which means the\n   receiver of the media will send necessary feedback to the
    sender of\n   the media to perform the congestion control at the sender.\n\n\t
