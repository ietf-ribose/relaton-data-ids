abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to secure TCP-based pairwise Routing
    Protocol (RP) associations using the IKEv2 Key Management Protocol (KMP) integrated
    with TCP-AO. A Gatekeeper (GK) mechanism is introduced to allow TCP-AO to coordinate
    with IKEv2 without fundamental modification to either. This document also introduces
    extensions to IKEv2 and its Security Associations to enable its key negotiation
    to support TCP-AO. The document also includes a summary of IKEv2 authentication
    methods available for peer authentication for use in protecting routing protocols.</p>"
