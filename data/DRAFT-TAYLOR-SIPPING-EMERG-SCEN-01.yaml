abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document examines the scenarios within which SIP phones may
    be \nused to contact emergency call centres.  Beginning with an overview \nof
    the high level system requirements for contacting emergency call \ncentres in
    the PSTN, the scenarios involving stationary or nomadic \nSIP phones are described
    and then alternative strategies for \nsupporting the information flows for the
    scenarios needed to meet \nthese requirements are examined.  The major finding
    from the point \nof view of SIP standardization is it would be helpful in a number
    of \nscenarios if a location header field could be added either by the \nSIP phone
    or by a proxy to indicate the location of the phone in a \nmachine-readable way.\n\t
