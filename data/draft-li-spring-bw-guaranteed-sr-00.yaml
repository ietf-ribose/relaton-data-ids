abstract:
- content: "<p>The document proposes the bandwidth-guaranteed segment for the segment
    routing which can be used to provide the bandwidth-guaranteed segment routing
    path to satisfy the QoS requirement of the service. Accordingly the forwarding
    mechanisms and the procedures of the control plane are explained for the bandwidth-guaranteed
    segment.</p>"
