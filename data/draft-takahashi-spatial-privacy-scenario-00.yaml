abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose a user scenario framework of location-based services to
    analyze security and privacy issues associated with the services. The framework
    is intended to cover the most of the location-based services available today and
    in near future. There are many kinds of existing and possible location-based services.
    Though, what is meant by location- based service varies widely. The framework
    gives people a common ground from where discussion on the security and privacy
    issues can start.</p>"
