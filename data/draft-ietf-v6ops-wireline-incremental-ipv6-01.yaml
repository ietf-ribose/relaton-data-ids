abstract:
- content: "<p>Operators worldwide are in various stages of preparing for, or deploying
    IPv6 into their networks. The operators often face difficult challenges related
    to both IPv6 introduction along with those related to IPv4 run out. Operators
    will need to meet the simultaneous needs of IPv6 connectivity and continue support
    for IPv4 connectivity for legacy devices with a depleting supply of IPv4 addresses.
    The IPv6 transition will take most networks from an IPv4- only environment to
    an IPv6 focused environment with long period of dual stack operation varying by
    operator. This document helps provide a framework for Wireline providers who are
    faced with the challenges of introducing IPv6 along meeting the legacy needs of
    IPv4 connectivity utilizing well defined and commercially available IPv6 transition
    technologies.</p>"
