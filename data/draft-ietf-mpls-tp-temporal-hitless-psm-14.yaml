abstract:
- content: <p>One of the most important Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM) capabilities for transport-network operation is fault localization. An in-service,
    on-demand path segment monitoring function of a transport path is indispensable,
    particularly when the service monitoring function is activated only between endpoints.
    However, the current segment monitoring approach defined for MPLS (including the
    MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)) in RFC 6371 "Operations, Administration, and
    Maintenance Framework for MPLS-Based Transport Networks" has drawbacks. This document
    provides an analysis of the existing MPLS-TP OAM mechanisms for the path segment
    monitoring and provides requirements to guide the development of new OAM tools
    to support Hitless Path Segment Monitoring (HPSM).</p>
