abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Today, in transparent optical networks, the increasing bit-rate
    (10\nGbit/s and up to 40 Gbit/s in the future), combined with the\nincreasing
    number of wavelengths (16 and higher up to 320) and a\nnarrowing of the channels
    spacing, enhance the impact of non-linear\neffects on optical signal quality.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
