abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized
    to enable\n   carrier-grade packet transport and complement converged packet\n
    \  network deployments.  Among the most attractive features of MPLS-TP\n   are
    OAM functions, which enable network operators or service\n   providers to provide
    various maintenance characteristics, such as\n   fault location, survivability,
    performance monitoring, and\n   preliminary or in-service measurements.\n\n   One
    of the most important mechanisms which is common for transport\n   network operation
    is fault location.  A segment monitoring function\n   of a transport path is effective
    in terms of extension of the\n   maintenance work and indispensable particularly
    when the OAM function\n   is effective only between end points.  However, the
    current approach\n   defined for MPLS-TP for the segment monitoring (SPME) has
    some fatal\n   drawbacks.  This document elaborates on the problem statement for
    the\n   Sub-path Maintenance Elements (SPMEs) which provides monitoring of a\n
    \  portion of a set of transport paths (LSPs or MS-PWs).  Based on the\n   problems,
    this document specifies new requirements to consider a new\n   improved mechanism
    of hitless transport path segment monitoring.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
