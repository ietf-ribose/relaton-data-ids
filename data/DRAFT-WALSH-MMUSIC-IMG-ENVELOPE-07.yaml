abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the metadata transfer envelope for Internet\n
    \  Media Guides (IMGs).  IMG metadata describes files, resources and\n   multimedia
    programs available for streaming or downloading via\n   multicast or unicast.
    \ IMG metadata is encapsulated into, or\n   associated with, an IMG envelope before
    actual transport.  The IMG\n   envelope is a structure providing independence
    between IMG transport\n   protocols and different metadata formats.  This specification\n
    \  provides the IMG envelope instantiation using structured Extensible\n   Markup
    Language (XML) syntax, both as a wrapper in which to embed an\n   IMG metadata
    object and as a distinct object to associate with a\n   distinct IMG metadata
    object.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
