abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document documents some issues with the current definition
    of\n   the backup subflows in [RFC6824].  The solution proposed in [RFC6824]\n
    \  works well when a subflow completely fails.  However, if a subflow\n   suffers
    from huge packet losses, but still remains up, then the delay\n   to switch to
    the backup subflow may be very long.  We propose to\n   measure the evolution
    of the retransmission timer (RTO) to detect the\n   bad performance of subflows.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
