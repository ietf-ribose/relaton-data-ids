abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RFC4447]describes a set of procedures for Pseudowire set-up
    and\n   maintenance using LDP as signaling protocol.\n   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw]
    extends the mechanisms described in\n   [RFC4447] for dynamic placement of multi-
    segment pseudowires.\n\n   This document describes an extension to [RFC4447]procedures
    which may\n   be used to pass additional information to S-PE/T-PEs when SS-PWs
    or\n   MS-PWs are set-up.\n\n   The intention of the proposed technique is to
    aid in policy\n   administration, specifically during MS-PW set-up across various\n
    \  S-PEs.  The proposed method is very generic so that it can support\n   the
    management of various parameters or rules while setting up\n   pseudowires with
    minimal overhead.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
