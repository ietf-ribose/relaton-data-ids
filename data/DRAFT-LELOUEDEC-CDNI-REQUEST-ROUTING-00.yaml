abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The present document proposes to clarify the CDNI Request Routing\n
    \  interface introduced in [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework] and [I-D.ietf-cdni-\n   problem-statement],
    as well as related terminology.\n\n   In particular the present document proposes
    to split the CDNI Request\n   Routing interface into two separate interfaces with
    clearer roles,\n   named respectively CDNI Routing interface and CDNI Downstream\n
    \  Resource Identifier Signaling interface (CDNI DRIS interface).\n\n   This part
    of the CDN interconnection framework the IETF has been\n   referring to so far
    with the term \"CDNI Request Routing\" is just\n   another routing, signaling
    and forwarding problem in a long series of\n   the telecommunication history.
    \ For example, one can draw a direct\n   analogy between the IP/MPLS-TE framework
    and the CDN interconnection\n   framework.\n\n   In addition, this document recommends
    that the specification of ALL\n   CDN interconnection interfaces in the scope
    of the CDNI IETF WG\n   relies on the equivalent concept to IP prefix for CDN\n
    \  interconnection, named 'contentRequestScope'.  This highly useful and\n   powerful
    concept SHALL be used to simplify the specification of ALL\n   CDN interconnection
    interfaces, as well as to ensure performance and\n   scalability in CDN interconnection.\n\n
    \  All these proposals can be smoothly integrated in the WG drafts,\n   especially
    [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework] and\n   [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements], as they essentially
    propose (useful)\n   clarifications of the existing framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
