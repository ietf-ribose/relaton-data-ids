abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document focuses on Class of Service Interconnection at
    inter-\n   domain interconnection points.  It specifies two new transitive\n   attributes,
    which enable adjacent peers to signal Class of Service\n   Capabilities and certain
    Class of Service admission control\n   Parameters.  The new \"CoS Capability\"
    is deliberately kept simple and\n   denotes the general EF, AF Group BE and LE
    forwarding support across\n   the advertising AS.  The second \"CoS Parameter
    Attribute\" is of\n   variable length and contains a more detailed description
    of available\n   forwarding behaviours using the PHB id Code encoding.  Each PHB
    id\n   Code is associated with rate and size based traffic parameters, which\n
    \  will be applied in the ingress AS Border Router for admission control\n   purposes
    to a given forwarding behaviour.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
