abstract:
- content: "<p>Urban Air Mobility concerns the introduction of manned and unmanned
    aircraft within urban environments, while Intelligent Transportation Systems have
    traditionally considered only terrestrial vehicles operating on city streets and
    highways. This document considers the implications for introduction of low-altitude
    aircraft within urban environments operating in harmony with ground transportation.</p>"
