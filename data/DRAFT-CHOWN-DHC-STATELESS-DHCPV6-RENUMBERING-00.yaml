abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPv6 hosts using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration are able
    to\nautomatically configure their IPv6 address and default router\nsettings. However,
    further settings are not available.   If such\nhosts wish to automatically configure
    their DNS, NTP or other\nspecific settings the stateless variant of the Dynamic
    Host\nConfiguration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) could be used.   This\ncombination
    of Stateless Address Autoconfiguration and stateless\nDHCPv6 could be used quite
    commonly in IPv6 networks.   However,\nhosts using such a combination currently
    have no means by which to be\ninformed of changes in stateless DHCPv6 option settings,
    e.g. the\naddition of a new NTP server address, changes in DNS search paths, or\nfull
    site renumbering. This document is presented as a problem\nstatement from which
    a solution should be proposed in a subsequent\ndocument.\n\t </p>\n      "
