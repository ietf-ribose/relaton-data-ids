abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Networking applications today already have access to a great
    amount\n   of Inter-Provider network topology information.  For example, views\n
    \  of the Internet routing table are easily available at looking glass\n   servers
    and entirely practical to be downloaded by clients.  What is\n   missing is knowledge
    of the underlying network topology from the ISP\n   or Content Provider (henceforth
    referred as Provider) point of view.\n   In other words, what a Provider prefers
    in terms of traffic\n   optimization -- and a way to distribute it.\n\n   The
    ALTO Service provides network information (e.g., basic network\n   location structure,
    preferences of network paths) with the goal of\n   modifying network resource
    consumption patterns while maintaining or\n   improving application performance.
    \ The basic information of ALTO is\n   based on abstract maps of a network.  These
    maps provide a simplified\n   view, yet enough information about a network for
    applications to\n   effectively utilize them.  Additional services are built on
    top the\n   maps.\n\n   This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO
    Service.\n   Although the ALTO service would primarily be provided by the network\n
    \  operator (e.g., an ISP), content providers and third parties could\n   also
    operate this service.  Applications that could use this service\n   are those
    that have a choice in connection endpoints.  Examples of\n   such applications
    are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery\n   networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
