abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the extensions to OSPF that enables a router
    and its neighbor to signal their intention to use Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
    (BFD) for their adjacency using link-local advertisement between them. The signaling
    of this BFD enablement, allows the router to block and not allow the establishment
    of adjacency with its neighbor router until a BFD session is successfully established
    between them. The document describes this "strict-mode" of BFD establishment as
    a prerequisite to OSPF adjacency formation.</p>
