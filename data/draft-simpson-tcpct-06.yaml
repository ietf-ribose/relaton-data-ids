abstract:
  content: "<p>TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT) deter spoofing of connections and prevent
    resource exhaustion, eliminating Responder (server) state during the initial handshake.
    The Initiator (client) has sole responsibility for ensuring required delays between
    connections. The cookie exchange may carry data, limited to inhibit amplification
    and reflection denial of service attacks. This document defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
