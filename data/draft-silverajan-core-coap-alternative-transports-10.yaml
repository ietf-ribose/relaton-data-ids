abstract:
- content: "<p>The aim of this document is to provide a way forward to best decide
    upon how alternative transport information can be expressed in a CoAP URI. This
    draft examines the requirements for a new URI format for representing CoAP resources
    over alternative transports. Various potential URI formats are presented. Benefits
    and drawbacks of embedding alternative transport information in various ways within
    the URI components are also discussed. From all listed formats, the document finds
    scheme-based model to be the most technically feasible.</p>"
