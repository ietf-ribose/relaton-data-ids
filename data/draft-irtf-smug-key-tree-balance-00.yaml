abstract:
- content: "<p>Several multicast key management schemes such as those proposed by
    Wallner et al, Wong et al and Balenson et al are based on a multilevel, logical
    hierarchy (or tree) of key-encrypting keys. When used in conjunction with a reliable
    multicast infrastructure, this approach results in a highly efficient key update
    mechanism in which the number of multicast messages transmitted upon a membership
    update is proportional to the depth of the tree, which is logarithmic in the size
    of the secure multicast group, provided the tree is maintained in a balanced manner.
    Therefore the issue of maintaining such trees in a balanced manner is quite relevant
    in practice. This draft which is based on the design principles followed in an
    implementation of secure multicast using the Wallner key-management scheme, describes
    efficient techniques to maintain a balanced key tree in the presence of arbitrary
    group membership updates. This draft also describes other optimizations which
    were found to be useful in practice.</p>"
