abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Recently, IETF has started to examine policy as a tool for managing
    \nand controlling the provision of QoS guaranteed services. In a \nmulti-domain
    environment, each domain will define its own policies and \nmanage the services
    according to its own policies. So it is natural \nthat the policy in one domain
    is different from the policy in another \ndomain. \nTherefore, this document focuses
    on the policy setup required for \nsupporting inter-domain QoS provisioning and
    accounting and describes \nthe policy exchange required between the domains. For
    supporting the \npolicy exchanges, this document describes two protocols, namely
    'Policy \nAdvertisement Protocol (PAP)' and 'Policy Negotiation and Notification
    \nProtocol (PNP)'. PAP is used by a domain to advertise its service \npolicies
    to other domains. PNP is used by a domain to request another \ndomain to provide
    a QoS guaranteed service and for the requested domain \nto notify the requesting
    domain of the policies governing the charges \nfor the services. This allows dynamic
    negotiation for the service \ncharges based on the offered QoS.\n\t </p>\n      "
