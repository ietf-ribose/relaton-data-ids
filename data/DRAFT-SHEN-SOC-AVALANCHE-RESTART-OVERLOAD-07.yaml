abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When a large number of clients register with a SIP registrar
    server\n   at approximately the same time, the server may become overloaded.\n
    \  Near-simultaneous floods of SIP SUBSCRIBE and PUBLISH requests may\n   have
    similar effects.  Such request avalanches can occur, for\n   example, after a
    power failure and recovery in a metropolitan area.\n   This document describes
    how to avoid such overload situations.  Under\n   this mechanism, a server estimates
    an avalanche restart backoff\n   interval during its normal operation and conveys
    this interval to its\n   clients through a new Restart-Timer header in normal
    response\n   messages.  Once an avalanche restart actually occurs, the clients\n
    \  perform backoff based on the previously received Restart-Timer header\n   value
    before sending out the first request attempt.  Thus, the\n   mechanism spreads
    all the initial client requests and prevents them\n   from overloading the server.\n\n\t
