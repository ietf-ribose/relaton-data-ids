abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an EDNS0 extension that can be used by a DNSSEC
    enabled Recursive Nameserver configured as a forwarder to send a single query
    over TCP requesting to receive a complete validation path along with the regular
    query answer. Additionally, use of this option is considered a request to keep
    the TCP connection open to serve additional DNS requests. Use of this option significantly
    reduces DNS latency for hosts deploying DNSSEC.</p>"
