abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new Packetization Layer MTU probing algorithm
    which is not subject to the problems associated with the current path MTU discovery
    algorithms [RFC1191, RFC1981, RFC2923]. The general strategy of the new algorithm
    is to start with a small MTU and probe upward, testing successively larger MTUs
    by probing with single packets. If the probe is successfully delivered, then the
    MTU is raised. If the probe is lost, it is treated as an MTU limitation and not
    as a congestion signal.</p>"
