abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses how to support fast handover in regional MIPv4
    networks (Regional Hanover). The proposed regional handover scheme is designed
    based on the existing MIPv4 Post-Registration scheme in a more effective way that
    the regional MIPv4 features are exploited. In the proposed regional handover scheme,
    the GFA acts as an anchor FA and thus the bi-directional handover tunnels are
    established between GFA and nFA, not between oFA and nFA.</p>"
