abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With more and more enterprises using cloud based services,
    the\n   distances between the user and the applications are growing.  A lot\n
    \  of the current applications are designed to work across LAN's and\n   have
    various inherent assumptions.  For multiple applications such as\n   High Performance
    Computing and Electronic Financial markets, the\n   response times are critical
    as is packet loss, while other\n   applications require more throughput.\n\n   [RFC3031]
    describes the architecture of MPLS based networks.  This\n   draft extends the
    MPLS architecture to allow for latency, loss and\n   jitter as properties.  It
    describes requirements and control plane\n   implication for latency and packet
    loss as a traffic engineering\n   performance metric in today's network which
    is consisting of\n   potentially multiple layers of packet transport network and
    optical\n   transport network in order to make a accurate end-to-end latency and\n
    \  loss prediction before a path is established.\n\n   Note MPLS architecture
    for Multicast will be taken up in a future\n   version of the draft.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
