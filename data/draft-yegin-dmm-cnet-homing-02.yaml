abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP protocols provide IP session continuity to Mobile Nodes at
    the expense of creating triangular routes via a centralized Home Agent. Increased
    latency and network resource use, introduction of a single point of failure and
    a network choke point are among the undesirable side effects of the current protocols.
    This document describes an alternative approach where the Mobile Node makes use
    of dynamically-assigned Home Agent that is located close to the Corresponding
    Node.</p>"
