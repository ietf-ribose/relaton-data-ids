    in neighbour\nsolicitation and neighbour advertisement messages to help DAD proxy\nto
    perform the function.Requirements Language\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described
