abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates [RFC1123].  This document strongly encourages\n
    \  the operational practice of permitting DNS messages to be carried\n   over
    TCP on the Internet as a best current practice.  Such\n   encouragment is aligned
    with the implementation requirements in RFC\n   7766.  The use of TCP includes
    both DNS over unencrypted TCP, as well\n   as over an encrypted TLS session.  The
    document also considers the\n   consequences with this form of DNS communication
    and the potential\n   operational issues that can arise when this best current
    practice is\n   not upheld.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
