abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>During the last year, participants in the Real-time Applications
    and\nInfrastructure (RAI) area have been quite active in discussing\nproposals
    that could improve their way of working.  This document is\na contribution to
    that discussion and focuses on the reduction of\ndelays experienced in producing
    specifications.  We believe that this\nis one of the main problems in the RAI
    area (and quite likely in\nother areas of the IETF as well) and it requires attention.
    \ A number\nof side effects, caused by the long specification work, are\nillustrated
    in this document.\n\t </p>\n      "
