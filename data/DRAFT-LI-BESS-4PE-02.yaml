abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document explains how to interconnect IPv4 islands over
    a\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)-enabled IPv6-only core.  This\n   approach
    relies on IPv4 Provider Edge routers (4PE), which are Dual\n   Stacks in order
    to connect to IPv4 islands and to the MPLS core.  The\n   4PE routers exchange
    the IPv4 reachability information transparently\n   over the core using the Multiprotocol
    Border Gateway Protocol (MP-\n   BGP).  MP-BGP is extended to do this.  A new
    Subsequence Address\n   Family Identifier (SAFI) with corresponding new format
    Network Layer\n   Reachability Information (NLRI), is introduced.  The BGP Next
    Hop\n   field is used to convey the IPv4 address of the 4PE router, a field\n
    \  is added in Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) to convey\n   the
    IPv6 address of the 4PE router, so that dynamically established\n   IPv6-signaled
    MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be used without\n   explicit tunnel configuration.\n\n\n\t
