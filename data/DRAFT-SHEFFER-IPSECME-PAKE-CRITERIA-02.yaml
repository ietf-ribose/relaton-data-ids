abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IPsecME working group has been chartered with specifying a
    new\npassword-based authentication method for IKEv2.  This document\npresents
    a few solution alternatives, and lists potential criteria\nfor choosing among
    them.  It is not the author's intention to publish\nthis document as an RFC.  Moreover,
    it is more subjective than most\nIETF documents.\n\t </p>\n      "
