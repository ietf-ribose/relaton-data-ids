abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     Thanks to the extensions defined in [I-D. draft-ietf-pce-pce-\n
    \    initiated-lsp] and [I-D.draft-ietf-pce-remote-initiated-gmpls-lsp],\n     it
    is possible to initiate LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model for\n     MPLS and GMPLS
    scenarios. This document complements previous\n     documents by providing an
    explanation of the use cases to use such\n     PCEP extensions.\n\n     This document
    presents single layer and multi-layer use cases,\n     where not only the PCE
    is involved, but also other modules defined\n     in IETF, such as Virtual Network
    Topology Manager and Provisioning\n     Manager.\n\n\n     \n\t </p>\n      "
