abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Persistent
    Web IDentifiers to web material in web archives using the 'pwid' namespace identifier.
    The purpose of the standard is to support general exact referencing method which
    includes support for references to archives with restricted access, for exact
    references to existing web material, and for exact specification of elements in
    a web corpus (possibly spanning over several web archives). The PWID URN therefore
    offers a scheme to make references that are not currently supported. The PWID
    is designed for researchers and therefore it is designed as general, global, sustainable,
    humanly readable, technology agnostic, persistent and precise web references for
    web materials in web archives, and in a way that can make them potentially resolvable.</p>"
