abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The configuration of control channels with a higher reliability
    would \n   be an important factor for the more stable provision of communication
    \n   environment in non-(G)MPLS and (G)MPLS networks. This document \n   specifies
    an automatic control channel protection (ACCP) protocol \n   that runs between
    a pair of nodes and is used to support the \n   resilience capability of control
    channels. The ACCP protocol is based \n   on the concept of common channel signaling
    in ITU-T and the current \n   control channel management function of LMP in IETF.
    This ACCP \n   protocol provides functions such as identification of direct and
    \n   indirect control channels, automatic and forced switchover of those \n   channels,
    and so on for the resilience of control channels. \n\t </p>\n      "
