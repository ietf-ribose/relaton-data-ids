abstract:
- content: "<p>The proposed 3GPP's 5G core nextgen architecture (5GC) offers flexibility
    to introduce new user and control plane function, considering the support for
    network slicing functions, that allows greater flexibility to handle heterogeneous
    devices and applications. In this draft, we provide a short description of the
    proposed 5GC architecture, including recent efforts to provide cellular Local
    Area Network (LAN) connectivity, followed by extensions to 5GC's control and user
    plane to support Packet Data Unit (PDU) sessions from Information-Centric Networks
    (ICN). In addition, ICN over 5GLAN is also described.</p>"
