abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        The objective of Energy Management (EMAN) is to provide
    an\n        energy management framework for networked devices.  This\n        document
    presents the applicability of the EMAN information\n        model in a variety
    of scenarios with cases and target devices.\n        These use cases are useful
    for identifying requirements for the\n        framework and MIBs.  Further, we
    describe the relationship of\n        the EMAN framework to relevant other energy
    monitoring standards\n        and architectures.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
