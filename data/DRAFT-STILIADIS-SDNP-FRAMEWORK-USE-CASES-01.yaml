abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents an application framework and associated
    use\ncases to help define the scope of the SDNP working group. The use cases\nstart
    with an abstract representation of a multi-tier application and\nillustrate the
    composition of a network service that can meet the\nrequirements of the particular
    application. The service composition\nprocess is split into several steps, including
    application requirement\nspecification, network mapping, service binding, and
    policy control. We\nalso provide examples of interactions between an SDNP controller
    and L2\nand L3 control layer protocols in order to deliver the end-to-end\nservice.
    Finally, as a derivate of that, an architecture framework for\nSDNP that meets
    these requirements is proposed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
