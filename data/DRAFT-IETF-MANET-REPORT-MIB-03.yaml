abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n
    \  In particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous report\n   generation
    on any device that supports MIBs containing counter and\n   gauge objects for
    performance monitoring.  This allows a management\n   station to instruct a device
    to build off-line reports to be\n   collected asynchronously by the management
    station.  Further, this\n   REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB can be configured in a proxy configuration
    where\n   the report generation is performed on a device in close network\n   proximity
    to the device containing the referenced counter objects.\n   Hence, this capability
    allows network operators to reduce the SNMP\n   polling traffic burden on Mobile
    Ad-Hoc and Disruption Tolerant\n   Networks which is typical of SNMP performance
    management\n   applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
