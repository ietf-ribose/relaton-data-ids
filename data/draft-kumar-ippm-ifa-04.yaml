abstract:
- content: "<p>Inband Flow Analyzer (IFA) records flow specific information from an
    end station and/or switches across a network. This document discusses the method
    to collect data on a per hop basis across a network and perform localized or end
    to end analytics operations on the data. This document also describes a transport-agnostic
    header definition that may be used for tunneled and non-tunneled flows alike.</p>"
