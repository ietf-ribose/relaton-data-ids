abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC7432 defines Ethernet VPN as a BGP address family that makes
    use\n   of Typed NLRIs. IANA has a registry called \"EVPN Route Types\" that\n
    \  allocates values to Route Types. The purpose of this document is to\n   solicit
    IANA the registration of a route type value for a vendor\n   specific usage, as
    well as the definition of the EVPN NLRI for that\n   route.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
