abstract:
- content: "<p>Autonomic systems were first described in 2001. The fundamental goal
    is self-management, including self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing,
    and self-protection. This is achieved by an autonomic function having minimal
    dependencies on human administrators or centralized management systems. It usually
    implies distribution across network elements. This document defines common language
    and outlines design goals (and what are not design goals) for autonomic functions.
    A high-level reference model illustrates how functional elements in an Autonomic
    Network interact. This document is a product of the IRTF's Network Management
    Research Group.</p>"
