abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the Extensible Authentication Protocol
    over\nUDP (EAPoUDP) to be used for network access authentication. An\naccess domain
    is represented by one or many PANA Authentication\nAgents (PAAs). Before a PANA
    Client (PaC) is granted access to the\ndomain, a PAA and a PaC MAY use EAPoUDP
    to authenticate each other.\nEAPoUDP is a variation of the Extensible Authentication
    Protocol\n(PPP EAP) [2], but runs instead over IP - either IPv4 or IPv6.\nUnlike
    PPP EAP, EAPoUDP allows authentication over any link layer\ntechnology. Furthermore,
    the PAA and the PaC need not be on the same\nlink. EAPoUDP uses UDP as its transport
    protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
