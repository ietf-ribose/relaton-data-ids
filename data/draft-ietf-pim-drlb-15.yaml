abstract:
- content: "<p>On a multi-access network, one of the PIM-SM (PIM Sparse Mode) routers
    is elected as a Designated Router. One of the responsibilities of the Designated
    Router is to track local multicast listeners and forward data to these listeners
    if the group is operating in PIM-SM. This document specifies a modification to
    the PIM-SM protocol that allows more than one of the PIM-SM routers to take on
    this responsibility so that the forwarding load can be distributed among multiple
    routers.</p>"
