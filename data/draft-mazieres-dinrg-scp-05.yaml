abstract:
- content: "<p>SCP is an open Byzantine agreement protocol resistant to Sybil attacks.
    It allows Internet infrastructure stakeholders to reach agreement on a series
    of values without unanimous agreement on what constitutes the set of important
    stakeholders. A big differentiator from other Byzantine agreement protocols is
    that, in SCP, nodes determine the composition of quorums in a decentralized way:
    each node selects sets of nodes it considers large or important enough to speak
    for the whole network, and a quorum must contain such a set for each of its members.</p>"
