abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traffic statistics form an important part of operations and\n
    \  maintenance data that are used to create demand matrices and for\n   capacity
    planning in networks.  Segment Routing (SR) is a source\n   routing paradigm that
    uses stack of labels to represent a path.  The\n   SR path specific state is not
    stored in any other node in the network\n   except the head-end node of the SR
    path.  Traffic statistics specific\n   to each SR path are an important component
    of the data which helps\n   the controllers to lay out the SR paths in a way that
    optimizes the\n   use of network resources.  SR paths are inherently ECMP aware.\n\n
    \  As SR paths do not have state in the core of the network, it is not\n   possible
    to collect the SR path traffic statistics accurately on each\n   interface.  This
    document describes an MPLS forwarding plane\n   mechanism to identify the SR path
    to which a packet belongs and so\n   facilitate accounting of traffic for MPLS
    SR paths.\n\n   The mechanisms described in this document may also be applied
    to\n   other MPLS paths (i.e., Label Switched Paths) and can be used to\n   track
    traffic statistics in multipoint-to-point environments such as\n   those where
    LDP is in use.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
