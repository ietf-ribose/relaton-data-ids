abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces SARP, an architecture that uses proxy\n
    \  gateways to scale large data center networks. SARP is based on\n   fast proxies
    that significantly reduce switches' FDB table\n   (MAC table) sizes and ARP/ND
    impact on network elements in an\n   environment where hosts within one subnet
    (or VLAN) can spread\n   over various locations. SARP is targeted for massive
    data\n   centers with a significant number of VMs that can move across\n   various
    physical locations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
