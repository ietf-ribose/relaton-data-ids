abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the problem statement of Common Operation
    and\n   Management of Network Slicing (COMS).  The purpose of this document\n
    \  is to identify the problem space of COMS and discuss the approach\n   COMS
    is using to match the top-down network slice management concern\n   with the underlay
    technologies.  Furthermore, the role of a common\n   information model is introduced
    and corresponding design principles\n   are also discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
