abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a YANG data model to map customer service models
    (e.g., the L3VPN Service Model (L3SM)) to Traffic Engineering (TE) models (e.g.,
    the TE Tunnel or the Virtual Network (VN) model). This model is referred to as
    TE Service Mapping Model and is applicable generically to the operator's need
    for seamless control and management of their VPN services with TE tunnel support.
    The model is principally used to allow monitoring and diagnostics of the management
    systems to show how the service requests are mapped onto underlying network resource
    and TE models.</p>"
