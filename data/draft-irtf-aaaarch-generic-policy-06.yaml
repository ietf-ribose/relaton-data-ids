abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In this document the concept of a so-called Driving Policy is pre-sented.
    A Driving Policy determines the behavior of an AAA server(Authentication, Authorization,
    Accounting) when it is confrontedwith a specific message type of the AAA protocol.
    The first partof this document defines the role of a Driving Policy and how itfits
    into the AAA concept. According to the model presented, themain task of a Driving
    Policy is to describe which pre-conditionshave to be checked before the corresponding
    actions, needed tofulfill an incoming AAA request, can be called, and how to dealwith
    the post-conditions of these actions. In the second part agrammar is proposed
    for these Driving Policies accompanied by thenecessary comments about the semantics.</p>"
