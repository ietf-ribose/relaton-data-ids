abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mesh Confirmation Protocol (Mesh/Confirm) is a three-party
    Web\n   Service that supports a transactional second factor confirmation\n   mechanism
    that provides a superset of the capabilities of traditional\n   second factor
    authentication schemes.  The three parties in the\n   protocol are Enquirer who
    posts a confirmation request, a Responder\n   who may or may not respond to the
    request and the Broker which\n   provides a repository to which requests and responses
    are posted.\n\n   This document is also available online at\n   http://prismproof.org/Documents/draft-hallambaker-mesh-confirm.html
