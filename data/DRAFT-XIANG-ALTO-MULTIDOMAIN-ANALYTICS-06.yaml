abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the data volume increases exponentially over time, data
    analytics\n   is transiting from a single-domain network to a multi-domain, geo-\n
    \  distributed network, where different member networks contribute\n   various
    resources, e.g., computation, storage and networking\n   resources, to collaboratively
    collect, share and analyze extremely\n   large amounts of data.  Such a network
    calls for a resource\n   orchestration framework that emphasizes the performance\n
    \  predictability of data analytics jobs, the high utilization of\n   resources,
    and the autonomy and privacy of member networks.\n\n   This document presents
    the design of Unicorn, a unified resource\n   orchestration framework for multi-domain,
    geo-distributed data\n   analytics, which uses the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization\n
    \  (ALTO) protocol as the key component for (1) allows member networks\n   to
    provide accurate information on different types of resources; (2)\n   keeps the
    private information of member networks; and (3) allows data\n   analytics jobs
    to accurately describe their requirements of different\n   types of resources.
    \ As a part of Unicorn, an ALTO extension for\n   privacy-preserving interdomain
    information aggregation is also\n   presented.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
