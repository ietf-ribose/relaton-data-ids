abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When BGP route servers are used, the data plane is not congruent
    with\n   the control plane.  Therefore, peers at an Internet exchange can lose\n
    \  data connectivity without the control plane being aware of it, and\n   packets
    are lost.  This document proposes the use of a newly defined\n   BGP Subsequent
    Address Family Identifier (SAFI) both to allow the\n   route server to request
    its clients use BFD to track data plane\n   connectivity to their peers' addresses,
    and for the clients to signal\n   that connectivity state back to the route server.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
