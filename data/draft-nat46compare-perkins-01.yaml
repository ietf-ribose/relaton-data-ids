abstract:
  content: "<p>IVI, IVI + DHCPv6, 1:N IVI, Bidirectional NAT, and SIPNAT have beenproposed
    to global Internet access to IPv6-only domains. Thesemethods are not all mutually
    exclusive, and we propose that IVI(along with its variants) along with SIPNAT
    may be consideredtogether as a more complete solution for enabling access from
    today'sIPv4 global Internet into IPv6-only domains. This would likely havethe
    effect of accelerating the adoption of IPv6, since with suchaccess enablements
    there would be much reduced incentive for newdeployments to require IPv4 addressability.
    As part of thediscussion, we also include a comparison of the various techniques
    sothe relative trade-offs may be more easily understood.</p>"
