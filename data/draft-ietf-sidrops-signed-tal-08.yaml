abstract:
- content: "<p>A Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) is used by Relying Parties (RPs) in the
    Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to locate and validate a Trust Anchor
    (TA) Certification Authority (CA) certificate used in RPKI validation. This document
    defines an RPKI signed object for a Trust Anchor Key (TAK), that can be used by
    a TA to signal the location(s) of the accompanying CA certificate for the current
    key to RPs, as well as the successor key and the location(s) of its CA certificate.
    This object helps to support both planned and unplanned key rolls without impacting
    RPKI validation.</p>"
