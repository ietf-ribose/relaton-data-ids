abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Vendors of consumer electronics and network gear have produced andsold
    hundreds of thousands of Internet hosts with globally routableInternet Protocol
    addresses embedded within their products' firmware.These products are now in operation
    world-wide and primarily include,but are not necessarily limited to, low-cost
    routers and middleboxesfor personal or residential use.This 'hard-coding' of globally
    routable IP addresses within thehost's firmware presents significant problems
    to the operation of theInternet and to the management of its address space.This
    document means to clarify best current practices in the Internetcommunity. It
    denouces the practice of embedding references tounique, globally routable IP addresses
    in Internet hosts, describessome of the resulting problems, and considers selected
    alternatives.It is also intended to remind the Internet community of the ephemeralnature
    of unique, globally routable IP addresses and that theassignment and use of such
    addresses is temporary and thereforeshould not be used in fixed configurations.</p>"
