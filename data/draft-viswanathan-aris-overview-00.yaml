abstract:
- content: "<p>IP based networks use a number of routing protocols, including RIP,
    OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP, to determine how packets ought to be routed. Among these
    protocols, OSPF and BGP are IETF-recommended standards that have been extensively
    deployed and exercised in many networks. In this memo, we describe a mechanism
    which uses these protocols as the basis for switching IP datagrams, by the addition
    of a simple protocol ('ARIS') that establishes switched paths through a network.
    The ARIS protocol allows us to leverage the advantages of switching technologies
    in an internet network.</p>"
