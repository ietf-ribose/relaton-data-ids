abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many end user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly\n
    \  IPv4 internal infrastructures.  These sites range in size from small\n   home/office
    networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but\n   share the commonality
    that IPv4 continues to provide satisfactory\n   internal routing and addressing
    services for most applications.  As\n   more and more IPv6-only services are deployed
    in the Internet,\n   however, end user devices within such sites will increasingly
    require\n   at least basic IPv6 functionality for external access.  It is also\n
    \  expected that more and more IPv6-only devices will be deployed within\n   the
    site over time.  This document therefore discusses updates to the\n   Intra-Site
    Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) to better\n   accommodate these
    needs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
