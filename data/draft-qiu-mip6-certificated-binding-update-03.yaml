abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a comprehensive security solution for mobile
    IPv6 networks including secure binding update, secure fast handover, user authentication
    and session key management for data security. In our proposal, one of the home
    agent's functions is to act as security proxy for its mobile nodes. The authentication
    is based on the home agent's certificate and the secret session keys are generated
    by strong cryptosystems. Our proposal avoids many security obstacles in the Return
    Routability protocol and provides a simple, integrated and efficient security
    solution for mobile communication.</p>"
