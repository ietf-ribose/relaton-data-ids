abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a new techniquefor
    inter-domain federation of SIP calls. ViPR makes use of the PSTNas an introduction
    mechanism to verify the correctness of mappingsfrom phone numbers to domains.
    The PSTN introduction mechanism canalso be used as a technique for blocking spam
    - a SIP caller is onlyauthorized when its calling domain has previously called
    that samenumber over the PSTN. This document describes an extension to SIPwhich
    enables authorization of SIP calls based on a prior PSTNintroduction.LegalThis
