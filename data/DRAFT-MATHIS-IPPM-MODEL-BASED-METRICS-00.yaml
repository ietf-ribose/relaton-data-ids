abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We introduce a new class of model based Internet metrics designed
    to\n   determine if a long path can be expected to meet a predefined end-to-\n
    \  end application performance target by applying a suite of single\n   property
    tests to successive sections of the long path.  In many\n   cases these single
    property tests are based on existing IPPM metrics,\n   with the addition of success
    and validity criteria.  The sub-path at\n   a time tests are designed to eliminate
    all known conditions that\n   might prevent the full path from meeting the target
    performance.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
