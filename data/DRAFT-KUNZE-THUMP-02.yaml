abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The HTTP URL Mapping Protocol (THUMP) is a set of URL-based\n
    \  conventions for retrieving information and conducting searches.\n   THUMP can
    be used for focused retrievals or for broad database\n   queries.  A THUMP request
    is a URL containing a query string that\n   starts with a `?', and can contain
    one or more THUMP commands.\n   Returned records are formatted with kernel metadata
    as Electronic\n   Resource Citations, which are similar to blocks of email headers.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
