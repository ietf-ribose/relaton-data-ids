abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The scale and scope of the worldwide web has been in part driven
    by\n   the availability of HTML as a common serialization, data model, and\n   interaction
    model for structured resources on the web.  By contrast,\n   the general use of
    appropriate hypermedia techniques for machine\n   interfaces has been limited
    by the lack of a common markup format for\n   serialization and exchange of structured
    machine resources and\n   sensor/actuator data which includes or embeds standardized
    hypermedia\n   controls.  The IRTF Thing to Thing Research Group [T2TRG] has a\n
    \  charter to investigate the use of REST design style [REST]for machine\n   interactions.
    \ The W3C Web of Things Interest Group [W3C-WoT] are\n   investigating abstract
    hypermedia controls and interaction models for\n   machines.  Machine optimized
    content formats exist for web links\n   [RFC5988] [RFC6690] and for data items
    [I-D.ietf-core-senml].\n\n   Structured data which contains both links and items
    is known as the\n   collection pattern.  This draft describes media types for\n
    \  representation of machine resources structured as collections.  A\n   simple,
    reusable data model is described with a representation\n   format, using a well
    known set of keywords to expose hypermedia\n   controls, which inform clients
    how to perform state transfer\n   operations on resources.  The underlying assumptions
    regarding\n   transfer layer processing are specified in this document.  The HSML\n
    \  media type described in this document is compatible with SenML and\n   CoRE
    Link-format by reusing the keyword identifiers and element\n   structures from
    these content formats.  Representations of HSML\n   document content may be obtained
    in CoRE Link-Format and SenML\n   content formats.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
