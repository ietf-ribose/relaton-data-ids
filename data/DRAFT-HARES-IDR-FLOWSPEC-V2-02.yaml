abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP flow specification version 1 (RFC8955, RFC8956) describes
    the\n   distribution of traffic filter policy (traffic filters and actions)\n
    \  which are distributed via BGP to BGP peers.  Multiple applications\n   utilize
    the BGP distributed traffic filter policy.  These\n   applications include: (1)
    mitigation of Denial of Service (DoS), (2)\n   enabling of traffic filtering in
    BGP/MPLS VPNS, and(3)centralized\n   traffic control for networks utilizing either
    SDN control of router\n   firewall functions.  During the deployment of BGP flow
    specification\n   v1, the following issues were detected: 1) problems due to the
    lack\n   of clear TLV encoding for rules for flow specifications, 2) desire to\n
    \  order filters rules, and 3) ordering of actions to provide\n   deterministic
    actions.  Version 2 of the BGP flow specification\n   protocol addresses these
    features.\n\n   BGP Flow Specification v2 is encapsulated in a different NLRI
    which\n   encapsulates previous flow specification information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
