abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the March of 2006 the IAB held a workshop on the topic of\n\"Unwanted
    Internet Traffic\".  The report from that workshop is\ndocumented in RFC 4948
    [RFC4948].  Section 8.2 of RFC 4948 calls for\n\"[t]ightening the security of
    the core routing infrastructure.\"  Four\nmain steps were identified for improving
    the security of the routing\ninfrastructure.  One of those steps was \"securing
    the routing\nprotocols' packets on the wire.\"  One mechanism for securing routing\nprotocol
    packets on the wire is the use of per-packet cryptographic\nmessage authentication,
    providing both peer authentication and\nmessage integrity.  Many different routing
    protocols exist and they\nemploy a range of different transport subsystems.  Therefore
    there\nmust necessarily be various methods defined for applying\ncryptographic
    authentication to these varying protocols.  Many\nrouting protocols already have
    some method for accomplishing\ncryptographic message authentication.  However,
    in many cases the\nexisting methods are dated, vulnerable to attack, and/or employ\ncryptographic
    algorithms that have been deprecated.  This document\ncreates a roadmap of protocol
    specification work for the use of\nmodern cryptogrpahic mechanisms and algorithms
    for message\nauthentication in routing protocols.  It also defines the framework\nfor
    a key management protocol that may be used to create and manage\nsession keys
    for message authentication and integrity.  This roadmap\nreflects the input of
    both the security area and routing area in\norder to form a jointly agreed upon
    and prioritized work list for the\neffort.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft
    is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the\nprovisions of BCP 78 and BCP
