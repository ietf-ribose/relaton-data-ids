abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this draft context, things are powered by micro controllers
    units\n   (MCU) comprising a set of memories such as static RAM (SRAM), FLASH\n
    \  and EEPROM. The total memory size, ranges from 10KB to a few\n   megabytes.\n
    \  In this context code and data integrity is a major security issue,\n   for
    the deployment of Internet of Things infrastructure. The goal of\n   the bijective
    MAC (bMAC) is to compute an integrity value, which\n   cannot be guessed by malicious
    software.\n   In classical keyed MAC, MAC is computing according to a fix order.\n
    \  In the bijective MAC, the content of N addresses is hashed according\n   to
    a permutation P (i.e. bijective application).\n   The bijective MAC key is the
    permutation P.\n   The number of permutations for N addresses is N!. So the computation\n
    \  of the bMAC requires the knowledge of the whole space memory; this\n   is trivial
    for genuine software, but could very difficult for\n   corrupted software.\n\n\n\t
