abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for
    obtaining\n   BGP path information.  BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP\n
    \  Route Monitoring (RM) messages.  This document proposes an extension\n   to
    BMP to convey additional path information that is not already\n   encapsulated
    in the BGP Update PDU, e.g., BPG path status.  This\n   extension makes use of
    the TLV mechanims described in draft-grow-bmp-\n   tlv [I-D.grow-bmp-tlv].\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
