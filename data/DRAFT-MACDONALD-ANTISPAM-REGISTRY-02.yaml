abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document establishes a set of extended SMTP policy codes
    for\nanti-spam.  It seeks to provide additional codes for error texts that\ncurrently
    use the extended SMTP error code 5.7.1.  The anti-spam\ncodes were determined
    by looking at error texts produced by major\nISPs and finding commonalities.  The
    result is a new set of error\ntexts with associated extended SMTP error codes.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
