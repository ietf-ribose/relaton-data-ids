abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes CPace which is a protocol for two parties that
    share a low-entropy secret (password) to derive a strong shared key without disclosing
    the secret to offline dictionary attacks. This method was tailored for constrained
    devices, is compatible with any group of both prime- and non-prime order, and
    comes with a security proof providing composability guarantees.</p>"
