abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) works well for conserving\nglobal
    addresses and addressing multihoming requirements, because an\nIPv4 NAPT router
    implements three functions: source address\nselection, next-hop resolution and
    optionally DNS resolution.  For\nIPv6 hosts one approach could be the use of IPv6
    NAT.  However, NAT\nshould be avoided, if at all possible, to permit transparent
    host-to-\nhost connectivity.  In this document, we analyze the use cases of\nmultihoming.
    \ We also describe functional requirements for\nmultihoming without the use of
    NAT in IPv6 for hosts and small IPv6\nnetworks that would otherwise be unable
    to meet minimum IPv6\nallocation criteria.\n\t </p>\n      "
