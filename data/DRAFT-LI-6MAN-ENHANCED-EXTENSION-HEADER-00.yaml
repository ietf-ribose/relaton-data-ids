abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As SRv6 and the new services such as SFC and IOAM are progressing,\n
    \  more and more new requirements are imposed upon the IPv6 extension\n   headers,
    i.e.. Hop-by-hop Options Header, Destination Options Header\n   and Routing Header.\n\n
    \  This document defines new IPv6 extension headers and corresponding\n   processing
    procedures considering the interactions among the existing\n   IPv6 extension
    headers, SRH and the newly introduced IPv6 extension\n   headers.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
