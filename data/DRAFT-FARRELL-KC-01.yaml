abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some asymmetric key generation implementations do not use sufficient\n
    \  randomness giving rise to a number of bad public keys, for example\n   with
    known factors, being used on the Internet.  This memo specifies\n   [[for now:
    just outlines]] an experimental protocol that could be\n   used by a private key
    holder to talk to a responder that knows the\n   values of (some of) those bad
    keys that have been seen in the wild.\n   The protocol only allows a holder of
    the relevant private key to\n   request information, as doing otherwise could
    weaken the overall\n   security of the Internet and also considers confidentiality
    and\n   privacy as important requirements, as information that a given bad\n   public
    key is associated with a particular identifier could also\n   weaken the security
    of the Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
