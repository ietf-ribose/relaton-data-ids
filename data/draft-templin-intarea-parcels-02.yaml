abstract:
- content: <p>IP packets (both IPv4 and IPv6) are understood to contain a unit of
    data which becomes the retransmission unit in case of loss. Upper layer protocols
    such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) prepare data units known as "segments",
    with traditional arrangements including a single segment per packet. This document
    presents a new construct known as the "IP Parcel" which permits a single packet
    to carry multiple segments, essentially creating a "packet-of-packets". The parcel
    can be opened at middleboxes on the path with the included segments broken out
    into individual packets, then rejoined into one or more repackaged parcels to
    be forwarded further toward the final destination. Reordering of segments within
    parcels is unimportant; what matters is that the number of parcels delivered to
    the final destination should be kept to a minimum, and that loss or receipt of
    individual segments (and not parcel size) determines the retransmission unit.</p>
