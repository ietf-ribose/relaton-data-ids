abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Multicast Dissemination Protocol (MDP) is a protocol frameworkdesigned
    to provide reliable multicast data and file delivery ser-vices on top of the generic
    UDP/IP multicast transport [1]. MDP iswell suited for reliable multicast bulk
    transfer of data across aheterogeneous internetwork. Further enhancements made
    to the pro-tocol are suitable for a range of network environments, includingwireless
    internetwork environments. At its core, MDP is an effi-cient negative acknowledgement
    (NACK) based reliable multicast pro-tocol that leverages erasure-based coding
    in ways to improve pro-tocol efficiency and robustness. MDP also includes an optionaladaptive
    end-to-end rate-based congestion control mode that is tooperate with competing
    flows (e.g., TCP sessions or other conges-tion aware flows). This document describes
    the protocol messages,building blocks, general operation, and optional modes of
    the pre-sent MDP instantiation and implementation.</p>"
