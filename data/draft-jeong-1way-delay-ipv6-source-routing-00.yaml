abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a methodology for measurement of the IETF IPPM
    WG's one-way IP performance metrics such as one-way delay and jitter of subpaths
    consisting of a specific end-to-end path in IPv6 network as well as end-to-end
    one-way IP performance metrics. The methodology measures one-way IP performance
    metrics in use of IPv6 source routing through IPv6 extension headers. Because
    the methodology can contribute to the finding of congested link or underutilized
    link, it can provide important information to configure and manage IPv6 network.</p>"
