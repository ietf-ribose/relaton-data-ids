abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies a methodology for measurement of the IETFIPPM
    WG's one-way IP performance metrics such as one-way delay andjitter of subpaths
    consisting of a specific end-to-end path in IPv6network as well as end-to-end
    one-way IP performance metrics. Themethodology measures one-way IP performance
    metrics in use of IPv6source routing through IPv6 extension headers. Because themethodology
    can contribute to the finding of congested link orunderutilized link, it can provide
    important information toconfigure and manage IPv6 network.</p>"
