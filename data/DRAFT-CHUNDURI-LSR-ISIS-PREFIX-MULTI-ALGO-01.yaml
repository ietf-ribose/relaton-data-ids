abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an extension to Intermediate System
    to\n   Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol by adding an Algorithm support\n   for
    prefixes advertised.  This allows multiple independent algorithm\n   usage for
    computing the reachability of nodes and prefixes as opposed\n   to only one algorithm.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
