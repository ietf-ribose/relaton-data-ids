abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level\n
    \  protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information\n   systems.
    HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global\n   information initiative since
    1990. This document updates RFC 7233,\n   Part 5 of the eight-part specification
    that defines the protocol\n   referred to as \"HTTP/1.1\". Part 5 defines range-specific
    requests and\n   the rules for constructing and combining responses to those requests.\n
    \  This document improves support for responding to range requests for\n   resources
    of indeterminate size.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
