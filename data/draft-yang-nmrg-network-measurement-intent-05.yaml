abstract:
- content: "<p>As an important technical means to detect network state, network measurement
    has attracted more and more attention in the development of network. However,
    the current network measurement technology has the problem that the measurement
    method and the measurement purpose cannot match well. To solve this problem, this
    memo introduces network measurement intent, presents a process of scheduling the
    network resource and measurement task to meet the user or network operator's needs.
    And it can be seen as a specific use case of intent based network.</p>"
