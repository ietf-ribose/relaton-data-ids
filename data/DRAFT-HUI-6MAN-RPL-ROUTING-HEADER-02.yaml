abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), memory constraints on
    routers\nmay limit them to maintaining at most a few routes.  In some\nconfigurations,
    it is necessary to use these memory constrained\nrouters to deliver datagrams
    to nodes within the LLN.  The Routing\nfor Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)
    protocol can be used in some\ndeployments to store most, if not all, routes on
    one (e.g. the\nDirected Acyclic Graph (DAG) root) or few routers and forward the\nIPv6
    datagram using a source routing technique to avoid large routing\ntables on memory
    constrained routers.  This document specifies a new\nIPv6 Routing header type
    for delivering datagrams within a RPL\ndomain.\n\t </p>\n      "
