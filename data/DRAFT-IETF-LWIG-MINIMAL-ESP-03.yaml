abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a minimal implementation of the IP\n
    \  Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) defined in RFC 4303.  Its\n   purpose
    is to enable implementation of ESP with a minimal set of\n   options to remain
    compatible with ESP as described in RFC 4303.  A\n   minimal version of ESP is
    not intended to become a replacement of the\n   RFC 4303 ESP.  Instead, a minimal
    implementation is expected to be\n   optimized for constrained environment while
    remaining interoperable\n   with implementations of RFC 4303 ESP.  Constrains
    include among other\n   limiting the number of flash writes, handling frequent
    wakeup / sleep\n   states, limiting wakeup time, or reducing the use of random\n
    \  generation.\n\n   This document describes what is required from RFC 4303 ESP
    as well as\n   various ways to optimize compliance with RFC 4303 ESP.\n\n   This
    document does not update or modify RFC 4303, but provides a\n   compact description
    of how to implement the minimal version of the\n   protocol.  If this document
    and RFC 4303 conflicts, then RFC 4303 is\n   the authoritative description.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
