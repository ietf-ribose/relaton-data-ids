abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a mechanism by which two entities can make
    use\nof SDP arrive at a common view of a multimedia session between them.\nIn
    the model, one participant offers the other a description of the\ndesired session
    from their perspective, and the other participant\nanswers with the desired session
    from their perspective. This\noffer/answer model is most useful in unicast sessions
    where\ninformation from both participants is needed for the complete view of\nthe
    session. The offer/answer model is used by protocols like SIP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
