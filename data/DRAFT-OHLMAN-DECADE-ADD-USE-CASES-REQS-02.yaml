abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) working group
    is\nspecifying standardized interfaces for accessing in-network storage\nfrom
    applications to store, retrieve and manage data.  The main\nobjective is to provide
    a framework that is useful to P2P\napplications, without excluding other, possibly
    related applications\nthat can benefit from accessing in-network storage.  This
    memo\npresents Internet TV as a specific application scenario where access\nto
    in-netork storage would be required and lists a set of concrete\nrequirements
    that should be considered for the DECADE architecture\nand protocol specifications.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
