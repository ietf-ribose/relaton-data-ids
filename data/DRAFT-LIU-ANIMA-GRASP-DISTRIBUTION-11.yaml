abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the requirement to autonomic nodes
    supporting\n   information distribution based over GRASP in autonomic networks.
    In\n   general, information distribution can be categorized into two\n   different
    modes: 1) one autonomic node instantly sends information to\n   other nodes in
    the domain; 2) one autonomic node publishes some\n   information and asynchronously
    some other interested nodes request\n   the published information. In the former
    case, information data will\n   be generated and consumed instantly. In the latter
    case, information\n   data live longer in the network.\n\n   These capabilities
    are basic and fundamental to an autonomous network\n   system (i.e. ANI [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model]).
    This document\n   clarifies possible use cases of information distribution in
    ANI and\n   requirements to ANI so that rich information distribution can be\n
    \  natively supported. Extensions to autonomic nodes are proposed and\n   detailed
    embodiments based on GRASP are discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
