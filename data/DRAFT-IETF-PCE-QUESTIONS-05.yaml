abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture is set out
    in RFC\n   4655. The architecture is extended for multi-layer networking with\n
    \  the introduction of the Virtual Network Topology Manager in RFC\n   5623, and
    generalized to Hierarchical PCE in RFC 6805.\n\n   These three architectural views
    of PCE deliberately leave some key\n   questions unanswered especially with respect
    to the interactions\n   between architectural components.  This document draws
    out those\n   questions and discusses them in an architectural context with\n
    \  reference to other architectural components, existing protocols, and\n   recent
    IETF work efforts.\n\n   This document does not update the architecture documents
    and does not\n   define how protocols or components must be used.  It does, however,\n
    \  suggest how the architectural components might be combined to provide\n   advanced
    PCE function.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
