abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies the mapping of defect states betweenEthernet
    Attachment Circuits (ACs) and associated EthernetPseudowires (PWs) connected in
    accordance to the PWE3 architecture[RFC3985] to realize an end-to-end emulated
    Ethernet service. This document augments the mapping of defect states between
    a PW andassociated AC of the end-to-end emulated service in [PW-OAM-MSG-MAP].
    In [PW-OAM-MSG-MAP], Ethernet OAM was not covered due to lackof Ethernet OAM maturity.
    However, since then, [Y.1731] and[802.1ag] have been completed, and this document
    specifies themapping of defect states between Ethernet ACs and correspondingEthernet
    PWs.</p>"
