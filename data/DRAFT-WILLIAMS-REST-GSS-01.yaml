abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method for application-layer authentication\n
    \  in Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) applications using Generic\n   Security
    Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-API)\n   mechanisms via, for simplicity,
    the Simple Authentication and\n   Security Layers (SASL) mechanism bridge known
    as \"GS2\".  This\n   approach to authentication allows for pluggability, mutual\n
    \  authentication, and channel binding, all with no changes to HTTP nor\n   the
    Transport Layer Security (TLS).\n\n   We hope that the use of mutual authentication
    and channel binding at\n   the application layer will make phishing more difficult.
    \ We hope\n   that the use of authentication at the application layer will make\n
    \  REST-GSS deployable.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
