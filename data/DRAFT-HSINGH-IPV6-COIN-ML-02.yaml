abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recently, in-network aggregation to scale distributed machine\n
    \  learning (ML) has been presented.  A network switch implementation\n   uses
    IPv4 broadcast messages from switch to the hosts to send updates\n   to all workers.
    \ IPv6 does not support broadcast addresses.  This\n   document proposes, IPv6
    implementations use the IPv6 link-local all-\n   nodes multicast address, until
    a new IPv6 link-local multicast\n   address is assigned by IANA for switch to
    hosts multicast\n   communications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
