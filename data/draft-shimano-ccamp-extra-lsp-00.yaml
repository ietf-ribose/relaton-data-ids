abstract:
  content: "<p>This document provides the problem statement on a extra class LSP ser-vice
    and addresses the issues. The extra class LSP uses the resourcereserved but not
    allocated for the protecting LSPs in the pre-plannedLSP re-routing without extra-traffic
    (including shared mesh) recoverymethod. Network utilization is improved because
    the resource reservedfor the protecting LSPs are used for the extra class LSPs.
    The extraclass LSP is preempted less frequently than the conventional prioritymechanism
    using setup and holding priorities because the resourcereserved for the protecting
    LSPs is allocated only if the working LSPfails, which is usually expected to rarely
    occur. This document pro-poses the extra class LSP service using the resource
    reserved but notallocated for the protecting LSP at the provisioning phase. This
    docu-ment addresses the issues on the extra class LSP: (1) advertisement ofavailable
    resource, (2) extra class LSP indication in signaling message(3) extra class LSP
    preemption signaling, and (4) preventing unintendedconnections.</p>"
