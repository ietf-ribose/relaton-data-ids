abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   At the first meeting of the Path Aware Networking Research
    Group,\n   Oliver Bonaventure led a discussion of mostly-unsuccessful attempts\n
    \  to exploit Path Awareness to achieve a variety of goals, for a\n   variety
    of reasons, over the past decade.  At the end of that\n   discussion, the research
    group agreed to catalog and analyze these\n   ideas, in order to extract insights
    and lessons for path-aware\n   networking researchers.\n\n   This document contains
    that catalog and analysis.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
