abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Where the source and/or destination node of an IPv6 communication
    ismulti-addressed, a mechanism is required for the initiating node toselect the
    most appropriate address pair for the communication. RFC3484 (IPv6 Default Address
    Selection) [RFC3484] defines such amechanism for nodes to perform source and destination
    addressselection. While RFC3484 recognised the need for implementations tobe able
    to change the policy table, it did not define how this couldbe achieved. Requirements
    have now emerged for administrators to beable to dynamically change the RFC 3484
    policy tables from a centralcontrol point, and for nomadic hosts to be able to
    obtain the policyfor the network that they are currently attached to without manualuser
    intervention. This text discusses considerations for suchpolicy changes, including
    examples of cases where a change of policyis required, and the likely frequency
    of such policy changes. Thistext also includes some discussion on the need to
    also update RFC3484, where default policies are currently defined.</p>"
