abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes general security considerations for the\nReliable
    Multicast Transport (RMT) Working Group set of building\nblocks and protocols.
    \ An emphasis is placed on risks that might be\nresolved in the scope of transport
    protocol design.  However,\nrelevant security issues related to IP Multicast control-plane
    and\nother concerns not strictly within the scope of reliable transport\nprotocol
    design are also discussed.  The document also begins an\nexploration of approaches
    that could be embraced to mitigate these\nrisks.  The purpose of this document
    is to provide a consolidated\nsecurity discussion and provide a basis for further
    discussions and\npotential resolution of any significant security issues that
    may\nexist in the current set of RMT standards.\n\t </p>\n      "
