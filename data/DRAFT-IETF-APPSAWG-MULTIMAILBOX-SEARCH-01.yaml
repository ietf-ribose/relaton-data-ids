abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IMAP4 specification allows the searching of only the selected\n
    \  mailbox.  A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a\n   client
    that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and\n   SEARCH commands,
    waiting for each to complete before moving on to the\n   next.  This extension
    allows a client to search multiple mailboxes\n   with one command, limiting round
    trips delay, and not requiring\n   disruption of the currently selected mailbox.
    \ This extension also\n   uses MAILBOX and TAG fields in ESEARCH responses, allowing
    a client\n   to pipeline the searches if it chooses.  This document updates RFC\n
    \  4466 and obsoletes RFC 6237.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
