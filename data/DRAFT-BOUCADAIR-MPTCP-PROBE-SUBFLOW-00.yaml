abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an extension to Multipath TCP (MPTCP)
    that is\n   meant to assess whether a path used to establish a given subflow is\n
    \  MPTCP-friendly, i.e., intermediate nodes involved in that path do not\n   alter
    nor strip MPTCP options, which would prevent the establishment\n   of MPTCP communications
    along that path.  A new flag bit, called\n   Probe Flag (P-flag) is defined for
    this purpose.\n\n   This document updates RFC6824.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
