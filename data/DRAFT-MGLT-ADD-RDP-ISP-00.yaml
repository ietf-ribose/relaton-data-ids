abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS Resolving service Discovery Protocol (DRDP) enables
    to\n   discover resolving services available and eventually upgrade to an\n   encrypted
    resolving service.\n\n   DRDP requires a resolving domain or a pointer to a list
    of resolving\n   domains.  Currently ISP or CPEs do not advertise resolving domain
    or\n   pointers to resolving domains which does not make possible for a DNS\n
    \  client to discover potential resolving services - such as encrypted\n   DNS
    for example - made available by the ISP.\n\n   Instead, ISPs or CPE advertise
    via DHCP the IP address of the host\n   with a IA Address Option [RFC3315] and
    the IP addresses of the\n   resolver provided by the ISP with Recursive Name Server
    option\n   [RFC3646].\n\n   This document describes a procedure for a DNS client
    to derive\n   resolving domains from the legacy configuration of the host.\n\n
    \  This is expected to ease the deployment of encrypted DNS from ISP as\n   it
    will enable OS, applications to discover resolving service put in\n   place by
    the ISP even though the CPE has not been upgraded.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
