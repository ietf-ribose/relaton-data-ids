abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a fast reroute framework for protecting
    MPLS\n   tunnels and IP/MPLS services against egress router failures.  The\n   framework
    relies on local detection and local repair to be performed\n   by the router upstream
    adjacent to a failure.  The router can restore\n   traffic in the order of tens
    of milliseconds, by rerouting it to a\n   protector through a pre-established
    bypass tunnel.  Therefore, the\n   mechanism can be used to reduce traffic loss
    before global repair\n   reacts to the failure and control plane protocols converge
    on the\n   topology changes due to the failure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
