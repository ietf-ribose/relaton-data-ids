abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The work so far on Privacy Enhanced RTP Conferencing, which
    allows\n   end-to-end security also in centralized switched RTP based\n   conferences,
    has not considered WebRTC in detail.  This document\n   looks at the use case
    of WebRTC based endpoints, it also considers\n   implications of using external
    providers for both conference\n   applications and centralized media distribution
    devices.  From this a\n   number of challenges have been determined, and requirements
    are\n   derived from these.  Finally the draft presents some straw man for\n   possible
    solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
