abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)
    flow within a router with emphasis on the Forwarding Information Base(s)--FIB(s)--and
    the effects of currently-implemented aggregation schemes on FIB size. The conditions
    for reduction of FIB information before insertion into the kernel are considered,
    with preservation of routing a primary criteria (essentially deriving in a more
    structured manner the result that one wishes to remove extraneous routing information
    extant in the FIB(s)). Finally, aggregation algorithms consistent with these conditions
    are presented.</p>"
