abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way to represent links between
    Web\n   resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes\n
    \  of such a link.  In constrained networks, a collection of Web links\n   can
    be exchanged in the CoRE link format (RFC6690).  Outside of\n   constrained environments,
    it may be useful to represent these\n   collections of Web links in JSON format
    (RFC4627).\n\n   This specification defines a common format for representing Web
    links\n   in JSON format.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
