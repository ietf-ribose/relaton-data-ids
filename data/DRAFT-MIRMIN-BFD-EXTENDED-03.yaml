abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism to extend the capabilities
    of\n   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD).  These extensions enable\n   BFD
    to measure performance metrics like packet loss and packet delay.\n   Also, a
    method to perform lightweight on-demand authentication is\n   defined in this
    specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
