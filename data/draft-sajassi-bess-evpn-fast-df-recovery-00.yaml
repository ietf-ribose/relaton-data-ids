abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution [RFC 7432] describes
    DF election procedures for multi-homing Ethernet Segments. These procedures are
    enhanced further in [EVPN-DF-Election] by applying Highest Random Weight Algorithm
    for DF election in order to avoid DF status unnecessarily upon a failure. This
    draft makes further improvement to DF election procedures in [EVPN-DF-Election]
    by providing two options for fast DF election upon recovery of the failed link
    or node associated with the multi-homing Ethernet Segment. This fast DF election
    is achieved independent of number of EVIs associated with that Ethernet Segment
    and it is performed via a simple signaling between the recovered PE and each PE
    in the multi- homing group.</p>"
