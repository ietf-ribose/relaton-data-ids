abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of Hierarchical Host Identity
    Tags\n   (HHITs), updating both [RFC7401] and [RFC7343], as self-asserting\n   IPv6
    addresses and thereby a trustable identifier for use as the\n   Unmanned Aircraft
    System Remote Identification and tracking (UAS\n   RID).  Within the context of
    RID, HHITs will be called DRIP Entity\n   Tags (DET).  HHITs self-attest to the
    included explicit hierarchy\n   that provides Registrar discovery for 3rd-party
    identifier\n   attestation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
