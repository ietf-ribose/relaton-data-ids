abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Industry control networks host a diverse set of non-internet\n
    \  protocols supporting Industrial-IoT and legacy device connections.\n   The
    integration between traditional information technology (IT) and\n   operational
    technology (OT) so far has centered around collection of\n   real-time data from
    devices in OT environment for consumption within\n   the enterprise IT networks.
    \ However, improvements in process control\n   and automation require a far better
    interworking between the OT and\n   IT applications.  This document provides a
    reference framework for\n   integrated industry networks (IIN).  It highlights
    interfaces and\n   their characteristics required for interconnecting components
    of OT\n   and IT that maybe moved to the cloud or edges.  It suggests the use\n
    \  of IIN to bridge the differences between OT and IETF technologies.\n\n\t </p>\n
