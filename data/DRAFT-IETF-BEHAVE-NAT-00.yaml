abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines basic terminology for describing different\n
    \  types of behavior for NATs when handling unicast UDP.  It also\n   defines
    a set of requirements for NATs that would allow many\n   applications, such as
    multimedia communications or online gaming, to\n   work consistently.  Developing
    NATs that meet this set of\n   requirements will greatly increase the likelihood
    that applications\n   will function properly.\n\t </p>\n      "
