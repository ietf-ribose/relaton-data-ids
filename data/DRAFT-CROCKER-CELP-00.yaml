abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Classic Internet transport protocols use a single source IP
    Address\n   and a single destination IP Address, as part of the identification\n
    \  for an individual transport data flow. This is problematic for\n   multihomed
    hosts and for mobile hosts, collectively needing\n   'multiaddressing' support.
    The basic goal, then, is to find a method\n   for multiaddressing that makes the
    smallest possible change to the\n   architecture and to current systems, while
    maintaining flexibility\n   for different emerging solutions.  This draft proposes
    a framework\n   for methods for creating Common Endpoint Locator Pools that can
    be\n   used by and among the proposed solutions.\n\t </p>\n      "
