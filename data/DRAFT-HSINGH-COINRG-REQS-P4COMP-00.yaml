abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The P4 research community has published a paper to show how
    to split\n   a P4 program into sub-programs which run on heterogeneous network\n
    \  nodes in a network.  Examples for nodes are a network switch, a\n   smartNIC,
    or a host machine.  The paper has developed artifacts to\n   split program based
    on latency, data rate, cost, etc.  However, the\n   paper does not mention any
    requirements.  To provide guidance, this\n   document covers requirements for
    splitting P4 programs for\n   heterogeneous network nodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
