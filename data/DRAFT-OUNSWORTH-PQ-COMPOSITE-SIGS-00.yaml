abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will
    come\n   the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different\n
    \  cryptographic algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual\n   post-quantum
    algorithms is at question, a multi-key cryptographic\n   operation will need to
    be performed in such a way that breaking it\n   requires breaking each of the
    component algorithms individually.\n   This requires defining new structures for
    holding composite public\n   keys and composite signature data.\n\n   This document
    defines the structures CompositePublicKey,\n   CompositeSignatureAlgorithmParams,
    and CompositeSignatureValue which\n   are sequences of the respective structure
    for each component\n   algorithm.  This document also defines algorithms for generating
    and\n   verifying composite signatures.  This document makes no assumptions\n
    \  about what the component algorithms are, provided that their\n   algorithm
    identifiers and signature generation and verification\n   algorithms are defined.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
