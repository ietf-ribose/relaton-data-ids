abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the approach to validate the content of the
    RPKI certificate tree, as used by the RIPE NCC RPKI Validator. This approach is
    independent of a particular object retrieval mechanism. This allows it to be used
    with repositories available over the rsync protocol, the RPKI Repository Delta
    Protocol, and repositories that use a mix of both. This algorithm does not rely
    on content of repository directories, but uses the Authority Key Identifier (AKI)
    field of a manifest and a certificate revocation list (CRL) objects to discover
    manifest and CRL objects issued by a particular Certificate Authority (CA). It
    further uses the hashes of manifest entries to discover other objects issued by
    the CA.</p>"
