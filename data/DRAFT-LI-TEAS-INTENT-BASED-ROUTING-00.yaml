abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the intent-based routing mechanism through\n
    \  which the packet can carry the intent information and the network\n   node
    can enforce the policy according to the intent information\n   (typically steering
    the packet into the SR policy or the underlay\n   slice which can meet the intent).
    \ The intent-based routing mechanism\n   provides a simple and scalable solution
    to meet the different service\n   requirements for the inter-domain routing.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
