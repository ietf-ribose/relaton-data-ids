abstract:
  content: "<p>This document motivates the need for the Multicast Routing Monitor(MRM)
    [MRM] protocol by describing the niche that exists for arouter-based multicast
    management protocol. Using the 'sufficientand necessary' argument, we suggest
    that existing protocols andtechniques lack important management functionality.
    This documentbriefly describes the methodology used by MRM, justifies theexistence
    of MRM, and describes some of the scenarios in which MRMwill be of value.</p>"
