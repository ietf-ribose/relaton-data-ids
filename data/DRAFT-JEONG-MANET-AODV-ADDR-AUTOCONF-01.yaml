abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the steps a node running AODV in ad hoc
    \n   network takes in deciding how to autoconfigure its IPv4 or IPv6 \n   address
    in network interface.  Because the ad hoc IP address \n   autoconfiguration in
    this document considers ad hoc network's \n   partition and mergence, the address
    duplication caused by ad hoc \n   network's mergence can be resolved through address
    resolution \n   protocol.  Also, this document specifies how to resolve the address
    \n   duplication in order to guarantee the maintenance of upper-layer \n   sessions,
    such as TCP session.\n\t </p>\n      "
