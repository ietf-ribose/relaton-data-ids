abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPSec IKEv2, RFC 5996 [RFC5996], has been adopted by many\n
    \  standardized network solutions to provide the secure transport\n   between
    network elements over third party's infrastructure.  For\n   example, the emerging
    Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC) network solution\n   that involves Femtocell deployment
    requires the mobile operator's\n   Femtocell AP to leverage the IPSec IKEv2 to
    support mutual\n   authentication and remote IP address configuration as well
    as other\n   auto configuration support over the broadband fixed network (BBF)
    of\n   which the mobile and fixed networks may be operated by two different\n
    \  operators.\n\n   Most of today broadband fixed networks are still relying on
    the IPv4\n   private addressing plan to support its attached devices including
    the\n   mobile operator's Femtocell AP.  Hence, the private IPv4 addressing\n
    \  and Network Address and Port Translation (NA(P)T) support mostly\n   likely
    stays for many years to come.\n\n   In FMC interworking scenario, there is a need
    for the mobile network\n   to pass on it mobile subscribers' policies to the broadband
    fixed\n   network (BBF) to maintain the service level agreement (SLA) and to\n
    \  support remote network management. In addition, a broadband fixed\n   network
    (BBF) may partnership with more than one mobile operator.\n   Therefore it is
    important for the BBF and the mobile network to be\n   able to overcome the limitation
    of the private IPv4 addressing and to\n   be able to identify the user's subscription
    as well as to determine\n   the location of the Femtocell AP that serves its mobile
    user over the\n   BBF network.\n\n   This document presents the problems for the
    IPSec tunneling support\n   with private IPv4 addressing for FMC interworking
    and proposes a\n   simple extension to the IKEv2 to resolve the issues.\n\n\t
