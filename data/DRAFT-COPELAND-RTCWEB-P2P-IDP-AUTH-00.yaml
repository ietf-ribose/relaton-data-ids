abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document studies the relationships of WebRTC communication
    users\n   with their web Calling Services (CS) and their Identity Providers\n
    \  (IdPs), in order to identify requirements for IdP based peer-to-peer\n   authentication.
    \ This study focuses in particular on issues of\n   privacy, security and trust
    that are raised by the introduction of\n   the IdP into the WebRTC call model,
    and by a different browser-based\n   calling paradigm, compared with Mobile networks
    or traditional VoIP\n   systems.  The document lists privacy and trust scenarios
    for WebRTC\n   authentication for individuals as well as organizations.  This\n
    \  contribution is proposed to the RTCWEB working group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
