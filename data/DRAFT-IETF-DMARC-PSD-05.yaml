abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and\n
    \  Conformance) is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating\n   organization
    can express domain-level policies and preferences for\n   message validation,
    disposition, and reporting, that a mail-receiving\n   organization can use to
    improve mail handling.  DMARC policies can be\n   applied to individual domains
    or to all domains within an\n   organization.  The design of DMARC precludes grouping
    policies for\n   domains based on policy published above the organizational level,\n
    \  such as TLDs (Top Level Domains).  Domains at this higher level of\n   the
    DNS tree (but not necessarily at the top of the DNS tree) can be\n   collectively
    referred to as Public Suffix Domains (PSDs).  This\n   document describes an extension
    to DMARC to enable DMARC\n   functionality PSDs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
