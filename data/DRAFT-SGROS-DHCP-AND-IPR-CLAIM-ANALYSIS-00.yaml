abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of this draft is to analyze different options on
    how DHCP\n   can be used to configure PvD aware client.  This is done in light
    of\n   IPR claim made by Huawei and the necessity to find an option for\n   implementation.
    \ In order for an option to be selected it obviously\n   must not interfere with
    IPR, or, IPR has to be somehow invalidated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
