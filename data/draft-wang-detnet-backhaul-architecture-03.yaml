abstract:
- content: "<p>The joint scheduling between industrial field network and backhaul
    network is important to satisfy the requirements of deterministic delay for data
    flows in factories. This document describes a joint scheduling architecture for
    deterministic industrial field/backhaul networks. Taking WIA-PA, an international
    standard about industrial wireless field network, and IPv6-based backhaul network
    as an example, this document depicts how the joint scheduling architecture works
    in detail.</p>"
