abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.
    \ SR is\n   applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6\n
    \  (SRv6) data planes.  This document specifies procedure for sending\n   and
    processing probe query and response messages for Performance\n   Measurement (PM)
    in Segment Routing networks.  The procedure uses the\n   mechanisms defined in
    RFC 8762 (Simple Two-Way Active Measurement\n   Protocol (STAMP)) and its TLV
    extensions for Performance Measurement.\n   The procedure specified is applicable
    to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes\n   and is used for both Links and end-to-end
    SR Paths including SR\n   Policies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
