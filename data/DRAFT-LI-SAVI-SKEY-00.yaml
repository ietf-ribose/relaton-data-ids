abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism to provide source address\nvalidation
    for IPv6 networks using a shared key (Skey) signature\napproach.  The basic idea
    is that a device generates a signature\nusing a shared key and its IP address
    and then the signature is sent\nto a validating device for source address validation.
    \ The proposed\nmechanism is intended to complement ingress filtering techniques
    with\na finer granularity on the control of the source addresses used.\n\t </p>\n
