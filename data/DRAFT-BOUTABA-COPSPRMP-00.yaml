abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In COPS-PR, the (clients of the) PEPs use special structures,
    called\nPolicy Information Bases (PIBs) that store the policies that are\nsent
    by the PDPs. PIBs are well-defined structures that are not\nmeant to be modified
    to adapt to the needs of each network. This\nmakes COPS-PR PEPs rigid and inflexible.
    This document describes an\nextension of the COPS-PR protocol that allows the
    PEPs to store\nmeta-policies that control the content of their PIBs. The set of\nmeta-policies
    that the PEPs can store is not predefined and\ncustomized policies can be supported.
    The use of meta-policies\npushes intelligence towards the PEPs and makes them
    more self-\ndependent. In this way, the model becomes more distributed, scalable\nand
    fault-tolerant, while the bandwidth consumption and the (real-\ntime) processing
    load of the PDP are reduced.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
