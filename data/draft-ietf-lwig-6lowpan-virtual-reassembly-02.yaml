abstract:
- content: "<p>When employing adaptation layer fragmentation in 6LoWPAN, it may be
    beneficial for a forwarder not to have to reassemble each packet in its entirety
    before forwarding it. This has been always possible with the original fragmentation
    design of RFC 4944. Apart from a brief mention of the way to do this in Section
    2.5.2 of the 6LoWPAN book, this has not been extensively described in the literature.
    The present document attempts to fill that gap.</p>"
