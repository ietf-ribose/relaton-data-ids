abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a new SIP header field, Feature-Caps.
    \ The\n   Feature-Caps header field conveys feature capability indicators that\n
    \  are used to indicate support of features and capabilities for SIP\n   entities
    that are not represented by the Uniform Resource Identifier\n   (URI) of the Contact
    header field.\n\n   SIP entities that are represented by the URI of the SIP Contact\n
    \  header field can convey media feature tags in the Contact header\n   field
    to indicate support of features and capabilities.\n\n   This specification also
    defines feature capability indicators, and\n   creates a new IANA registry, \"Proxy-Feature
    Feature Capability\n   Indicator Trees\", for registering feature capability indicators.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
