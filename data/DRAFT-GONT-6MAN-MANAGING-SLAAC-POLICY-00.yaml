abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an operational problem that arises
    due to the\n   impossibility of managing the address generation policy employed
    by\n   hosts participating in IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\n   (SLAAC).
    \ Additionally, it specifies a new field in the Prefix\n   Information option
    of Router Advertisement messages, such that\n   routers can advertise, for each
    network prefix included in a Router\n   Advertisement message, the desired address
    generation policy to be\n   used for SLAAC.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
