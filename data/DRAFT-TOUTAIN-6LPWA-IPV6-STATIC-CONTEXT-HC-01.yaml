abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a header compression scheme for IPv6,
    IPv6/\n   UDP based on static contexts.  This technique is especially tailored\n
    \  for LPWA networks and could be extended to other protocol stacks.\n\n   During
    the IETF history several compression mechanisms have been\n   proposed.  First
    mechanisms, such as RoHC, are using a context to\n   store header field values
    and send smaller incremental differences on\n   the link.  Values in the context
    evolve dynamically with information\n   contained in the compressed header.  The
    challenge is to maintain\n   sender's and receiver's contexts synchronized even
    with packet\n   losses.  Based on the fact that IPv6 contains only static fields,\n
    \  6LoWPAN developed an efficient context-free compression mechanisms,\n   allowing
    better flexibility and performance.\n\n   The Static Context Header Compression
    (SCHC) combines the advantages\n   of RoHC context which offers a great level
    of flexibility in the\n   processing of fields, and 6LoWPAN behavior to elide
    fields that are\n   known from the other side.  Static context means that values
    in the\n   context field do not change during the transmission, avoiding complex\n
    \  resynchronization mechanisms, incompatible with LPWA characteristics.\n   In
    most of the cases, IPv6/UDP headers are reduced to a small\n   identifier.\n\n
    \  This document focuses on IPv6/UDP headers compression, but the\n   mechanism
    can be applied to other protocols such as CoAP.  It will be\n   described in a
    separate document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
