abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the Border Router Discovery Protocol (BRDP)\nframework.
    \ This framework enables multi-homing for small to medium\nsites, using Provider
    Aggregatable IPv6 addresses.  It describes a\nmechanism for automated IP address
    configuration and renumbering, a\nmechanism for optimized source address selection
    and a new paradigm\nfor packet forwarding.  The BRDP framework prevents ingress
    filtering\nproblems with multi-homed sites and supports load-balancing for\nmulti-path
    transport protocols.  This work also prevents routing\nscalability problems in
    the provider network and Internet Default\nFree Zone because small to medium multi-homed
    size sites would not\nneed to request Provider Independent address blocks.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
