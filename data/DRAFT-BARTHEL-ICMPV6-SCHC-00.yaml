abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ICMPv6 is a companion protocol to IPv6.  It defines messages
    that\n   inform the source of IPv6 packets of errors during packet delivery.\n
    \  It also defines the Echo Request/Reply messages that are used for\n   basic
    network troubleshooting (ping command).  ICMPv6 messages are\n   transported on
    IPv6.\n\n   This document describes how to adapt ICMPv6 to Low Power Wide Area\n
    \  Networks (LPWANs) by compressing ICMPv6/IPv6 headers and by\n   protecting
    the LPWAN network and the Device from undesirable ICMPv6\n   traffic.\n\n\t </p>\n
