abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The common thinking for the last 10+ years has been to say that
    dualstack was the answer to IPv6 transition and that most things would beconverted
    to dual stack way before we ran out of IPv4. Well, it hasnot happened. We are
    going to run out of IPv4 addresses soon, waybefore any significant IPv6 deployment
    will have occured. However,the quasi totality of the Internet and most of the
    computers in thehome are still IPv4-only. Several distributed NAT architectures,based
    on different possible flavors of a carrier-grade NAT, arepresented as solutions
    to maintain some form of connectivity betweenthose home environments and the legacy
    Internet.</p>"
