abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). PMIPv6enables
    mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam acrossgateways without changing
    the IP address. PMIPv6 also provideslimited multi-homing support to multi-mode
    mobile devices.While the basic scenario addressed by PMIPv6 considers MNs with
    justone interface, PMIPv6 also allows an MN to connect to the same PMIPv6domain
    through different interfaces. This limited support of multi-interfaced MNs is
    not fully specified, since the MAG needs to obtain/guess additional information
    from the MN, in order to decide whetherto treat an MN's interface attachment as
    a handover or as newinterface attachment (i.e. meaning the creation of a new mobilitysession
    and, therefore, the allocation of new home network prefixesto the MN). The use
    of the Media Independent Handover (MIH) Servicesas defined in the IEEE 802.21-2008
    specification [IEEE80221] may helpin obtaining this additional information. This
    I-D describes howPMIPv6 would work in an 802.21-enabled scenario, and in particular,analyzes
    how MIH primitives can be used to help the MAG deal withmulti-technology scenarios.
    The main objective of the IEEE 802.21-2008 standard is to provide link layer intelligence
    to upper layers.Hence, a more intelligent decision making capability leading to
    morereliable and efficient handovers between heterogeneous networks canbe enabled.</p>"
