abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification takes a new approach to extensibility that is both
    principled and a hack. It builds on recent moves to formalise the increasingly
    common practice where fragmentation in IPv4 more closely matches that of IPv6.
    The large majority of IPv4 packets are now 'atomic', meaning indivisible. In such
    packets, the 16 bits of the IPv4 Identification (IPv4 ID) field are redundant
    and could be freed up for the Internet community to put to other uses, at least
    within the constraints imposed by their original use for reassembly. This specification
    defines the process for redefining the semantics of these bits. It uses the previously
    reserved control flag in the IPv4 header to indicate that these 16 bits have new
    semantics. Great care is taken throughout to ease incremental deployment, even
    in the presence of middleboxes that incorrectly discard or normalise packets that
    have the reserved control flag set.</p>"
