abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In PIM-SM networks PIM Null-Register messages are sent by the\n
    \  Designated Router (DR) to the Rendezvous Point (RP) to signal the\n   presence
    of Multicast sources in the network.  There are periodic PIM\n   Null-Registers
    sent from the DR to the RP to keep the state alive at\n   the RP as long as the
    source is active.  The PIM Null-Register\n   message carries information about
    a single Multicast source and\n   group.\n\n   This document defines a standard
    to send multiple multicast source\n   and group information in a single PIM Null-Register
    message, in a\n   packed format.  We will refer to this packed format as the PIM
    Packed\n   Null-Register format throughout the document.  This document also\n
    \  discusses the interoperability between the PIM routers which do not\n   understand
    the packed message format with multiple multicast source\n   and group details.\n\n\t
