abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Currently, IPv6 Internet is, globally considered, inseparable
    from\nthe 6bone network.  The 6bone has been built as a tighly meshed\ntunneled
    topology.  As the number of participants has grown, it has\nbecome an untangible
    mess, hindering the real deployment of IPv6 due\nto low quality of connections.
    \ This memo discusses the nature and\nthe state of 6bone/IPv6 Internet, points
    out problems and outlines a\nfew ways to start fixing them; also, some rough operational\nguidelines
    for different-sized organizations are presented.  The most\nimportant issues are:
    not offering transit to everyone and real\ntransit operators being needed to take
    a more active role.\n\t </p>\n      "
