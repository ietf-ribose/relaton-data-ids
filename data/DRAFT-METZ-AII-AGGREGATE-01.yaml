abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>[PWE3 Control] defines the signaling mechanisms for establishing
    \npoint-to-point pseudowires between two provider edge (PE) nodes. The \nGeneralized
    ID FEC element contained in PWE3 signaling protocols \ninclude TLV fields that
    identify pseudowire endpoints called \nattachment individual identifiers (AII).
    This document defines an AII \nstructure in the form of new AII type-length-value
    fields that \nsupports AII aggregation for improved scalability. It is envisioned
    \nthat this would be useful in large inter-domain virtual private wire \nservice
    networks where pseudowires are established between selected \nlocal and remote
    PE nodes based on customer need. \n\t </p>\n      "
