abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Since the inclusion of the Network Access Identifier (NAIs) intothe
    mobile ip fabric, home agents have had a way to identify mobilenodes which do
    not have home IP addresses. After authenticating theregistration request from
    such a mobile node, the home agent is thenexpected to assign a home addresses
    to the mobile node in theregistration reply to be used on a semi-permanent basis.Unfortunately,
    no specific mechanism has yet been proposed. Ideally,as DHCP centralizes address
    management, a home agent should contact aDHCP server to allocate an address for
    the mobile node, therebypreserving DHCP as the central address maintainer. The
    technologydoes exist for a Home Agent to use DHCP controlled addresses, namelyfor
    the Home Agent to behave as a DHCP proxy agent.</p>"
