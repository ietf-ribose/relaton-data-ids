abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Information Services are services whereby information is provided
    in\n   response to user requests, and may include involvement of a human or\n
    \  automated agent. A popular existing Information Service is Directory\n   Assistance
    (DA). Moving ahead, Information Services providers\n   envision exciting multimedia
    services that support simultaneous\n   voice and data interactions with full operator
    backup at any time\n   during the call. Information Services providers are planning
    to\n   migrate to SIP based platforms, which will enable such advanced\n   services,
    while continuing to support traditional DA services.\n\n   Operator Services are
    traditional PSTN services which often involve\n   providing human or automated
    assistance to a caller, and often\n   require the specialized capabilities traditionally
    provided by an\n   operator services switch. Market and/or regulatory factors
    in some\n   jurisdictions dictate that some subset of Operator Services continue\n
    \  to be provided going forward.\n\n   This document aims to identify how Operator
    and Information Services\n   can be implemented using existing or currently proposed
    SIP\n   mechanisms, to identity existing protocol gaps, and to provide a set\n
    \  of Best Current Practices to facilitate interoperability. For\n   Operator
    Services, the intention is to describe how current operator\n   services can continue
    to be provided to PSTN based subscribers via a\n   SIP based operator services
    architecture. It also looks at how\n   current operator services might be provided
    to SIP based subscribers\n   via such an architecture, but does not consider the
    larger question\n   of the need for or usefulness or suitability of each of these\n
    \  services for SIP based subscribers.\n\n   This document addresses the needs
    of current Operator and\n   Information Services providers; as such, the intended
    audience\n   includes vendors of equipment and services to such providers.\n\n\n\n\t
