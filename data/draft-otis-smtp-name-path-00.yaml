abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a safe means to register delivery paths
    usedby a domain's messages. Message handling might be negativelyaffected without
    an apparent relationship between the sending systemand the various email related
    source domains contain within eitherthe message envelope or the message itself.
    Name based associationscan be achieved within a single DNS transaction. The alternative
    hasbeen to assemble a list of IP addresses for all systems employed tosend messages
    for a domain. The IP address list approach may requirehundreds of DNS transactions
    that endanger the network. The safername based method accommodates an unlimited
    number of sendingsystems, without the overhead and size issues created by a list
    of IPaddresses.</p>"
