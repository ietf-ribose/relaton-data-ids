abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>         This document describes the RTP payload format of the
    Secure\n         Communication Interoperability Protocol (SCIP) as audio and\n
    \        video media subtypes.  It provides RFC 6838 compliant media\n         subtype
    definitions.  SCIP-214.2 and SCIP-210 describe the\n         protocols that comprise
    the SCIP RTP packet payload.  This\n         document follows the registration
    for related media types\n         called \"audio/scip\" and \"video/scip\" with
    IANA and formatted\n         according to RFC 4855.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
