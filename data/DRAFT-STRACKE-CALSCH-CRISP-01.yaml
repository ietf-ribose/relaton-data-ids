abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document sets forth a restricted profile of [CAP], one which\nsupports
    no operations beyond the scheduling functionality of [iTIP].\nThe motivation is
    to permit use of CAP's real-time iTIP functionality\nwithout exposing the calendar
    access functionality (which may require\nstricter security controls than iTIP).\n\t
    </p>\n      "
