abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism for fast detection of MPLS
    LSP\nfailure when a link fails and scales to all LSPs affected by the\nfailure.
    \ Fast detection enables ingress LERs to quickly recover\nonto backup LSPs.  A
    performance improvement in the reliability of\nLSPs is expected.  The mechanism
    described relies on a node and\nnetwork architecture that integrates L1/L2/L3
    technology.\n\t </p>\n      "
