abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   Resource allocation and accountability have been major unresolved\n
    \  problems with the Internet ever since its inception.  The reason we\n   never
    resolve these issues is a broken idea of what the problem is.\n   The applied
    research and standards communities are using completely\n   unrealistic and impractical
    fairness criteria.  The resulting\n   mechanisms don't even allocate the right
    thing and they don't\n   allocate it between the right entities.  We explain as
    bluntly as we\n   can that thinking about fairness mechanisms like TCP in terms
    of\n   sharing out flow rates has no intellectual heritage from any concept\n
    \  of fairness in philosophy or social science, or indeed real life.\n   Comparing
    flow rates should never again be used for claims of\n   fairness in production
    networks.  Instead, we should judge fairness\n   mechanisms on how they share
    out the `cost' of each user's actions on\n   others.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
