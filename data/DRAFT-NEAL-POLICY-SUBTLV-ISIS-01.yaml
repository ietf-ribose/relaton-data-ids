abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes an extension to Integrated IS-IS, which can
    be \nused to pass additional information among routers within an IS-IS \ndomain
    that can aid in policy administration.  This extension is \nroughly similar in
    operation to the BGP communities attribute; in that \nit provides a mechanism
    to associate a routed prefix with some \nadministrative group, such that an administrator
    may define a routing \npolicy for that group.\n\t </p>\n      "
