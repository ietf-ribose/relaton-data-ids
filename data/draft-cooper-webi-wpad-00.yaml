abstract:
  content: "<p>A mechanism is needed to permit web clients to locate nearby(caching)
    web proxy. Current best practice is for end users to handconfigure their web client
    (i.e., browser) with the URL of an 'autoconfiguration file'. In large environments
    this presents aformidable support problem. It would be much more manageable forthe
    web client software to automatically learn the configurationinformation for its
    web proxy settings. This is typically referredto as a resource discovery problem.</p>"
