abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a framework for Content Distribution Network
    Interconnection (CDNI). The purpose of the framework is to provide an overall
    picture of the problem space of CDNI and to describe the relationships among the
    various components necessary to interconnect CDNs. CDN Interconnection requires
    the specification of interfaces and mechanisms to address issues such as request
    routing, distribution metadata exchange, and logging information exchange across
    CDNs. The intent of this document is to outline what each interface needs to accomplish,
    and to describe how these interfaces and mechanisms fit together, while leaving
    their detailed specification to other documents. It obsoletes RFC 3466.</p>"
