abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The syslog protocol describes a number of service options related
    to\n   propagating event messages.  This memo describes a mapping of the\n   syslog
    protocol to TCP connections, useful for reliable delivery of\n   event messages
    through the use of a BEEP profile.  The earlier RAW\n   and COOKED BEEP syslog
    profiles are deprecated.  The use of syslog\n   over BEEP provides robustness
    and security in message delivery that\n   is unavailable to the usual UDP-based
    syslog protocol, by providing\n   encryption and authentication over a connection-oriented
    protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
