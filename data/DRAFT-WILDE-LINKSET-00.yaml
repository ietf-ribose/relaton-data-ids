abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a link relation type and media types
    for\n   working with sets of links.  Using this link relation type and/or the\n
    \  media types is useful when it becomes necessary to represent links\n   outside
    the context of a resource they are linking.  One typical\n   example are scenarios
    in which the number of links to put in an HTTP\n   Link header field is too big,
    and thus these links should become a\n   resource of their own.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
