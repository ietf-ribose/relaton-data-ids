abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When a Service Provider offers BGP/MPLS IP VPN service to its\n
    \  customers, RFCs 6513 and 6514 describe protocols and procedures that\n   the
    Service Provider can use in order to carry the customer's IP\n   multicast traffic
    from one customer site to others.  BGP can be used\n   to carry customer multicast
    routing information from one Provider\n   Edge (PE) router to another, but it
    is assumed that PIM is running on\n   the interface between a Customer Edge (CE)
    router and a PE router.\n   This document specifies protocols and procedures that,
    under certain\n   conditions, allow customer multicast routing information to
    carried\n   between PE and CE via BGP.  This can eliminate the need to run PIM
    on\n   the PE-CE interfaces, potentially eliminating the need to run PIM on\n
    \  the PE routers at all.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
