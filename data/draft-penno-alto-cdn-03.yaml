abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Networking applications can request through the ALTO protocolinformation
    about the underlying network topology from the ISP orContent Provider (henceforth
    referred as Provider) point of view. Inother words, information about what a Provider
    prefers in terms oftraffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it. The ALTO
    Serviceprovides information such as preferences of network resources withthe goal
    of modifying network resource consumption patterns whilemaintaining or improving
    application performance.One of the main use cases of the ALTO Service is its integration
    withContent Delivery Networks (CDN). The purpose of this draft istwofold: first,
    to describe how ALTO can be used in existing and newCDNs, both within an ISP and
    in separate organizational entities fromthe ISP; second, to collect requirements
    for ALTO usage in CDNs andto provide recommendations into the development of the
    ALTO protocolfor better support of CDNs.</p>"
