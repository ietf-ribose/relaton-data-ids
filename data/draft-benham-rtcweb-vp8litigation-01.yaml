abstract:
- content: "<p>There remains a great deal of confusion in the industry about the state
    of patent litigation and IPR disclosures around VP8. To facilitate greater understanding,
    Duane Morris LLP drafted a paper that summarizes the current state of disclosures
    and patent litigation based on publically available materials, and has posted
    a comprehensive report on the Internet. This Internet Draft provides a high level
    summary of that report. Cisco Systems requested and funded Duane Morris to prepare
    this report.</p>"
