abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies Early Compression Enabler for ROHC-TCP toincrease
    compression gain. The enabler provides a generic platform toimplement an early
    compression mechanism. An early compressionmechanism is an out-of-band mechanism
    that populates the ROHC-TCPdecompression context with some of the header fields
    before the ROHC-TCP initialization step. ROHC-TCP does not need to carry thosefields,
    thus early compression provides compression from the veryfirst TCP packet and
    increases the compression gain. It is especiallyuseful for short-lived TCP connections.
    The document describes theworking of Early Compression Enabler as part of ROHC-TCP.
    It alsospecifies protocol changes for the ROHC-TCP protocol. It does notspecify
    any particular early compression mechanism.</p>"
