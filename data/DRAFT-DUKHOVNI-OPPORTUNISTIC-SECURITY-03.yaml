abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo introduces the \"Opportunistic Security\" (OS) protocol\n
    \  design pattern.  Protocol designs based on OS depart from the\n   established
    practice of employing cryptographic protection against\n   both passive and active
    attacks, or no protection at all.  As a\n   result, with OS at least some cryptographic
    protection should be\n   provided most of the time.  For example, the majority
    of Internet\n   SMTP traffic is now opportunistically encrypted.  OS designs remove\n
    \  barriers to the widespread use of encryption on the Internet.  The\n   actual
    protection provided by opportunistic security depends on the\n   advertised security
    capabilities of the communicating peers.\n\n   This document promotes designs
    in which cryptographic protection\n   against both passive and active attacks
    can be rolled out\n   incrementally as new systems are deployed, without creating
    barriers\n   to communication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
