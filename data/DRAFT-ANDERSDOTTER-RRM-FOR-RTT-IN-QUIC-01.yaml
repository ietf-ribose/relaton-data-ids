abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The latency spin bit is an optional feature included in the
    QUIC\n   transport protocol, as standardized by the Internet Engineering Task\n
    \  Force (IETF).  It enables passive, on-path observations for\n   estimation
    of latency.  This document presents the results of an\n   inquiry into the potential
    of using randomized response mechanisms\n   (RRM) to reduce privacy loss in latency
    measurements.  It concludes\n   that RRM could be used to introduce choice for
    clients in preserving\n   privacy in latency measurements.  But the trade-offs,
    especially\n   since the latency spin bit is already optional, do not favour RRM.\n\n\t
