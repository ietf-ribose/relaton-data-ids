abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes methods to provision resources for multicastgroups.
    It proposes mechanisms that allow multicast delivery pathsto be constructed along
    paths that have been statically provisionedfor multicast traffic. In addition
    to static provisioning, it allowsresources to be provisioned dynamically to overcome
    the difficultiesin predicting and provisioning a priori, the amount of resourcesrequired
    for dynamic multicast groups.To prevent the problem of data being multicasted
    on a path which hasnot been provisioned for the service level that data is beingtransmitted
    : i) when resources are dynamically provisioned they areprovisioned at the same
    time as the distribution path is setup,otherwise ii) multicast delivery paths
    are only constructed on pathsalready provisioned statically.</p>"
