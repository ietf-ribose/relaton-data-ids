abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL fault management [RFC7455] specifies the messages and\n
    \  operations for OAM in TRILL network. The sender collects the replies\n   for
    the OAM-relevant request it sent and uses the replies as the\n   indication of
    the network faults. In certain circumstances the sender\n   needs to collect multiple
    replies to isolate the fault, e.g.\n   repetitively sending Path Trace Messages
    (PTM) with increasing value\n   of hop count and collecting the replies on them
    to figure out the\n   fault point of certain path.\n\n   With the increasing deployment
    of Software Defined Network (SDN), a\n   centralized management server can be
    used to help with fault\n   management. The server then is responsible to collect
    OAM messages\n   and analyze them to either isolate the network fault or compile\n
    \  overall OAM information. It naturally uses SDN structure to alleviate\n   the
    effort of the requester node and provide a centralized solution\n   to produce
    the operation and management feedback of the network.\n\n   This document specifies
    the extensions of TRILL OAM message and the\n   operations about the network nodes
    and the centralized management\n   server to trace and collect OAM relevant messages
    for further\n   analysis.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
