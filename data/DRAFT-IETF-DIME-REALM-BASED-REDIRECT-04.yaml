abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 3588 allows a Diameter redirect agent to specify one or
    more\n   individual hosts to which a Diameter message may be redirected by an\n
    \  upstream Diameter node.  However, in some circumstances an operator\n   may
    wish to redirect messages to an alternate domain without\n   specifying individual
    hosts.  This document specifies a mechanism by\n   which this can be achieved.
    \ New applications may incorporate this\n   capability by reference to the present
    document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
