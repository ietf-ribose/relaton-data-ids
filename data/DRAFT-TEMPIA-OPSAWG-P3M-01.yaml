abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to accomplish performance
    monitoring\n   measurements on real traffic, applicable to any packet-based stream,\n
    \  including L2, L3, MPLS traffic, unicast and multicast.  The method\n   can
    be easily implemented using tools and features already available\n   on existing
    routing platforms without any protocol extension and, for\n   this reason, it
    does not raise any interoperability issue.  However,\n   the method could be further
    improved by means of some extension to\n   existing protocols, but this aspect
    is left for further study and it\n   is out of the scope of the document.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
