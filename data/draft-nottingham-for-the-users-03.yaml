abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet standards serve and are used by a variety of communities.
    This document makes suggestions for explicitly identifying them, serving them,
    and determining how to resolve conflicts between their interests, when necessary.
    It also requires that Internet Standards consider end users as their highest priority
    concern.</p>"
