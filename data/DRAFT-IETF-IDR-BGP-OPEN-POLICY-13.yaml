abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes which violate\n
    \  assumptions of BGP topology relationships; e.g. passing a route\n   learned
    from one lateral peer to another lateral peer or a transit\n   provider, passing
    a route learned from one transit provider to\n   another transit provider or a
    lateral peer.  Existing approaches to\n   leak prevention rely on marking routes
    by operator configuration,\n   with no check that the configuration corresponds
    to that of the eBGP\n   neighbor, or enforcement that the two eBGP speakers agree
    on the\n   relationship.  This document enhances BGP OPEN to establish agreement\n
    \  of the (peer, customer, provider, Route Server, Route Server client)\n   relationship
    of two neighboring eBGP speakers to enforce appropriate\n   configuration on both
    sides.  Propagated routes are then marked with\n   an Only to Customer (OTC) attribute
    according to the agreed\n   relationship, allowing both prevention and detection
    of route leaks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
