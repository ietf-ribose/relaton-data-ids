abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this paper, a swarm intelligence based self-organizing network\n
    \  model was introduced to network providers.  The problems of the\n   existing
    network as well as the characteristics of the NGI (Next\n   Generation Internet)
    were described to illustrate the motivation of\n   the proposed self-organizing
    network model.  A network architecture\n   model based on swarm intelligence was
    introduced, the used technical\n   terms was defined.  The network parameters,
    network behaviors and\n   node stability under the proposed model were described.
    \ Especially,\n   some important QoS routing elements under the proposed model,
    such as\n   the user QoS routing requirements, link satisfaction degree, utility\n
    \  computation, unicast path and multicast tree evaluation, mathematical\n   model
    of QoS route optimization and small-world behaviors, were\n   introduced.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
