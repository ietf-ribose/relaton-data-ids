abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In certain scenarios, there may be a need to combine together twodifferent
    Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) LabelSwitched Paths (LSPs)
    such that in the data plane, a single end-to-end(e2e) LSP is achieved and all
    traffic from one LSP is switched onto theother LSP. We will refer to this as \"LSP
    stitching\". This documentcovers cases where: a) the node performing the stitching
    does notrequire configuration of every LSP pair to be stitched together b) thenode
    performing the stitching is not the egress of any of the LSPs c)LSP stitching
    not only results in an end-to-end LSP in the data plane,but there is also a corresponding
    end-to-end LSP (RSVP session) in thecontrol plane. It might be possible to configure
    a GMPLS node to switchthe traffic from an LSP for which it is the egress, to another
    LSP forwhich it is the ingress, without requiring any signaling or routingextensions
    whatsoever, completely transparent to other nodes. This willalso result in LSP
    stitching in the data plane. However, this documentdoes not cover this scenario
    of LSP stitching.</p>"
