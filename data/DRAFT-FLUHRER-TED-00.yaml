abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The ISAKMP, IKE and IPSec DOI RFCs [RFC2408, RFC2409, RFC2407]\nspecify
    how an IPSec tunnel is negotiated with an encrypting security\ngateway (peer),
    however, they do not specify how the initiator knows\nwho the encrypting peer
    is. This document specifies a method where\nthe initiator can find the appropriate
    peer, and also negotiate a\nmutually acceptable set of proxies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
