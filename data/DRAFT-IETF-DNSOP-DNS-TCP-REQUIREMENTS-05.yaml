abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document encourages the practice of permitting DNS messages
    to\n   be carried over TCP on the Internet.  This includes both DNS over\n   unencrypted
    TCP, as well as over an encrypted TLS session.  The\n   document also considers
    the consequences with this form of DNS\n   communication and the potential operational
    issues that can arise\n   when this best common practice is not upheld.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
