abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how a multi-tenant data centre operator can
    isolate tenants from network performance degradation due to each other's usage,
    but without losing the multiplexing benefits of a LAN- style network where anyone
    can use any amount of any resource. Zero per-tenant configuration and no implementation
    change is required on network equipment. Instead the solution is implemented with
    a simple change to the hypervisor (or container) on each physical server, beneath
    the tenant's virtual machines. These collectively enforce a very simple distributed
    contract - a single network allowance that each tenant can allocate among their
    virtual machines. The solution is simplest and most efficient using layer-3 switches
    that support explicit congestion notification (ECN) and if the sending operating
    system supports congestion exposure (ConEx). Nonetheless, an arrangement is described
    so that the operator can unilaterally deploy a complete solution while operating
    systems are being incrementally upgraded to support ConEx.</p>"
