abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When the Public-Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Working
    Group was chartered, an object identifier arc was allocated by IANA for use by
    that working group.  This document describes the object identifiers that were
    assigned in that arc, returns control of that arc to IANA, and establishes IANA
    allocation policies for any future assignments within that arc.\n\t </p>\n      "
