abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   AS Path Prepending provides a tool to manipulate the BGP AS_Path\n
    \  attribute through prepending multiple entries of an AS.  AS Path\n   Prepending
    is used to deprioritize a route or alternate path.  By\n   prepending the local
    ASN multiple times, ASs can make advertised AS\n   paths appear artificially longer.
    \ Excessive AS Path Prepending has\n   caused routing issues in the internet.
    \ This document provides\n   guidance with the use of AS Path Prepending, including
    alternative\n   solutions, in order to avoid negatively affecting the internet.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
