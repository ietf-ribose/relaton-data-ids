abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a framework for Pseudo Wire EmulationEdge-to-Edge
    (PWE3). It discusses the emulation of circuits (such asT1, E1, T3, E3 and SONET/SDH)
    and services (such as ATM and FrameRelay) over packet switched networks (PSNs)
    using IP or MPLS. Itpresents an architectural framework for pseudo wires (PWs),
    definesterminology, specifies the various protocol elements and theirfunctions,
    overviews some of the services that will be supported anddiscusses how PWs fit
    into the broader context of protocols.</p>"
