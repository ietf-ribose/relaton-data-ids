abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For C-ACC, Platooning and other typical use cases in ITS, how
    to\n   establish direct IP communication paths between neighbor vehicles\n   poses
    two issues : how to discover the neighbor vehicle and the\n   nearby service (from
    the upper layer); how to discover the link-layer\n   address of the selected vehicle
    (from the lower layer).  This draft\n   aims to solve these problems based on
    mDNS.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
