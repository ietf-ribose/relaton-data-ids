abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an extended SMTP response for mail servers
    to\n   assist clients in adjusting the rate at which they send mail.  Use of\n
    \  this mechanism can reduce wasteful SMTP connections and reduce mail\n   delivery
    delays; at scale the aggregate benefit to clients and\n   servers can be significant.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
