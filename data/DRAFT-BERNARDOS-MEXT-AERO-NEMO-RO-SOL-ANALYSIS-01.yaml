abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to
    roam\nand attach to different access networks without disrupting the\nongoing
    sessions that nodes of the mobile network may have.  By\nextending the Mobile
    IPv6 support to Mobile Routers, nodes of the\nmobile network are not required
    to support any kind of mobility,\nsince packets go through the Mobile Router-Home
    Agent (MRHA) bi-\ndirectional tunnel.  Data packets belonging to communications
    of\nnodes of the mobile network have to traverse the Home Agent, and\ntherefore
    resulting paths are likely to be suboptimal.  Additionally,\nthe solution adds
    packet overhead, due to the use of encapsulation\nbetween the Mobile Router and
    the Home Agent.\nThere are currently a set of well defined NEMO Route Optimization\nrequirements
    for Operational Use in Aeronautics and Space\nExploration, which potential solutions
    should meet.  This document\nanalyses how the problem of NEMO RO for Aeronautics
    Mobile Networks\nmight be tackled, in a way as generic as possible, trying to
    identify\nthose open questions and deployment considerations that need to be\naddressed.\n\nThe
    main goal of this document is to foster the discussion about\naeronautics NEMO
    RO solution space within the MEXT WG.\n\t </p>\n      "
