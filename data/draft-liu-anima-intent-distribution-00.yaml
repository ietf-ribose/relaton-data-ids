abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the requirements of distributing intent information
    in an autonomic network. Ideally, the intent may be generated/injected at an arbitrary
    autonomic node and be distributed among the whole autonomic domain. Then this
    document resolves the distribution requirements into protocol design requirements.
    Specifically, this document introduces a solution which is some extension based
    on the Anima signalling protocol (GDNP, Generic Discovery and Negotiation Protocol).</p>"
