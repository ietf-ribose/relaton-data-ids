abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The centralized traffic engineering technology adopts centralized\n
    \  calculation, PCE/SDN performs centralized calculation based on the\n   collected
    link-status and TE information collected by BGP-LS/IGP, so\n   that the traffic
    in the network is optimized to the optimization\n   goal.\n\n   The distributed
    traffic engineering technology uses IGP to calculate\n   the shortest path.  Each
    node in the network calculates the next hop\n   to a destination address based
    on the same algorithm and network\n   topology.  Each algorithm can calculate
    a shortest path tree in the\n   entire network, which can reduce the amount of
    calculation, so that\n   the hard convergence time of TE can be close to the convergence
    time\n   of IGP.\n\n   The distributed computing and management methods can not
    co-ordinate\n   management of network bandwidth resources.  As a result, network\n
    \  bandwidth resources can not be planned in an integrated manner,\n   bandwidth
    resources are wasted, and even tunnels cannot be\n   established.  This document
    attempts to discuss a automatic network\n   optimization function of the distributed
    traffic engineering\n   technology by the method of dynamically adjusting the
    link Metric.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
