abstract:
  content: "<p>Today, a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple communication
    networks based on different technology implementations and network architectures
    like WiFi, LTE, and DSL. In such multi- connectivity scenario, it is desirable
    to combine multiple access networks or select the best one to improve quality
    of experience for a user and improve overall network utilization and efficiency.
    This document presents the u-plane protocols for a multi access management services
    (MAMS) framework that can be used to flexibly select the combination of uplink
    and downlink access and core network paths having the optimal performance, and
    user plane treatment for improving network utilization and efficiency and enhanced
    quality of experience for user applications.</p>"
