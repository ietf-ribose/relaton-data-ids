abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 7970 [RFC7970] provides XML-based data representation on incident
    information, but the use of the IODEF data model is not limited to XML. JSON representation
    is sometimes preferred since it is easy to handle from certain programming environments.
    This draft represents the IODEF data model in JSON. Note that this 00 version
    draft is prepared for the purpose of encouraging discussion on the need for JSON
    representation.</p>"
