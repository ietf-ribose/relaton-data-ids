abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of network firewalls, systems that effectively isolate an organizations
    internal network structure from an exterior network, such as the INTERNET is becoming
    increasingly popular. These firewall systems typically act as application-layer
    gateways between networks, typically offering controlled TELNET, FTP, and SMTP
    access. With the emergence of more sophisticated and ever-changing application
    layer protocols designed to facilitate information discovery from a variety of
    network sources, there exists a need to provide a general frame-work for these
    protocols to traverse a firewall in as transparent a manner as possible.</p>"
