abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Most Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandate\nthe
    use of the Control Word (CW) in order to better emulate the\nservices for which
    the encapsulations have been defined.  However,\nsome encapulations treat the
    Control Word as optional.  As a result,\nimplementations of the CW, for encapsulations
    for which it is\noptional, vary by equipment manufacturer, equipment model and
    service\nprovider network.  Similarly, Virtual Circuit Connectivity\nVerification
    (VCCV) supports three Control Channel (CC) types and\nmultiple Connectivity Verification
    (CV) Types.  This flexibility has\nled to reports of interoperability issues within
    deployed networks\nand associated drafts to attempt to remedy the situation.  This\nsurvey
    of the PW/VCCV user community was conducted to determine\nimplementation trends.
    \ The survey and results is presented herein.\n\t </p>\n      "
