abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The RFC3264 Offer/Answer model specifies rule for the bilateral\n
    \  exchange of Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] messages for\n   setting
    up, updating and tearing down of multimedia streams.  Rarely,\n   there might
    be situations wherein either of the communicating\n   parties, might end up being
    the offerer for updating an on-going\n   session.  This scenario is commonly known
    as \"glare\" condition and it\n   needs to be handled nevertheless.  This specification
    describes\n   procedures for parties involved in an ongoing RTCWeb session to
    add\n   new media in a glareless fashion.\n\n   There are various ways this problem
    might be solved - this draft\n   sketches out one possible solution to the problem.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
