abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS uses glue records to allow iterative clients to find
    the\n   addresses of nameservers that are contained within a delegated zone.\n
    \  Authoritative Servers are expected to return all available glue\n   records
    in referrals.  If message size constraints prevent the\n   inclusion of all glue
    records in a UDP response, the server MUST set\n   the TC flag to inform the client
    that the response is incomplete, and\n   that the client SHOULD use TCP to retrieve
    the full response.  This\n   document updates RFC 1034 to clarify correct server
    behavior.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
