abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a common misconception that the IPv6 Addressing Architecture\n
    \  requires the use of only /64 subnet prefixes for subnet routing and\n   on-link
    determination.  This document clarifies the characterization\n   of the relationship
    between IPv6 routing and the 64-bit boundary in\n   the IPv6 Addressing Architecture,
    which is that of a recommendation\n   for the use of /64 subnet prefixes for subnet
    routing and on-link\n   determination in most circumstances, not a requirement
    for such.  To\n   further clarify the relationship, the document also provides\n
    \  operational guidance for the configuration of subnet prefixes and\n   updates
    RFC 4291 accordingly.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
