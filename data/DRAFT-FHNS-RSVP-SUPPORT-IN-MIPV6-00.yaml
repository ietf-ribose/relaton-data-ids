abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes a specific problem encountered when  using
    \ RSVP\n   (Resource  Reservation  Protocol)  over  optimised  routes  in  MIPv6\n
    \  (Mobile IP Version 6). The address translation in the  MIP's  binding\n   cache
    creates a mismatch between the flow-id of the packets sent from\n   correspondent
    node to mobile node and the flow-id signalled by RSVP.\n\n   We discuss several
    solutions to this problem: (1) By  modifying  RSVP\n   at  mobile  and correspondent
    nodes to become aware of MIPv6 address-\n   ing, we provide a simple repair that
    allows RSVP flows  to  be  esta-\n   blished  between  the  fixed  network  and
    \ mobiles;  (2a)  By adding\n   optional objects to RSVP messages, a performance
    enhancement is  pro-\n   posed  to  make handovers smooth and seamless; (2b) A
    different tech-\n   nique with the same goal is called flow  extension  and  it
    \ provides\n   flows  with fixed flow-ids from the correspondent node into the
    wire-\n   less access network at the expense of forwarding traffic  inside  the\n
    \  access network, whenever the mobile node moves.\n \n   We conclude that the
    minimal solution (1) is a requirement  in  order\n   to  make  MIPv6 and RSVP
    interoperable; our favored approach requires\n   only minor changes to the correspondent
    and mobile  node's  RSVP  and\n   MIP  specification.   However,  for well performing
    and uninterrupted\n   operation we strongly recommend one of the solutions (2a
    or 2b)  that\n   support  fast  re-establishment  or preservation of resource
    reserva-\n   tions when mobile nodes move.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
