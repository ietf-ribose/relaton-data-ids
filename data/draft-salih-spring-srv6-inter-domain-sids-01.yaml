abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes three new SRv6 end point behaviors, named END.REPLACE,
    END.REPLACEB6 and END.DB6. These SIDs are used in distributed inter-domain solutions
    for connecting SRv6 domains. This behavior is normally executed on border routers
    between different domains. These SIDs can also be used to provide multiple intent
    based paths across these domains.</p>"
