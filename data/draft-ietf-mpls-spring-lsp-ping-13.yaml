abstract:
- content: <p>A Segment Routing (SR) architecture leverages source routing and tunneling
    paradigms and can be directly applied to the use of a Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) data plane. A node steers a packet through a controlled set of instructions
    called "segments" by prepending the packet with an SR header. The segment assignment
    and forwarding semantic nature of SR raises additional considerations for connectivity
    verification and fault isolation for a Label Switched Path (LSP) within an SR
    architecture. This document illustrates the problem and defines extensions to
    perform LSP Ping and Traceroute for Segment Routing IGP-Prefix and IGP-Adjacency
    Segment Identifiers (SIDs) with an MPLS data plane.</p>
