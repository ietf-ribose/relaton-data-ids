abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This  document  is  intended  to  provide  input  to the IETF
    SPIRITS\nWorking Group(SPIRITS WG) and to the IETF PINT  Working  Group  (PINT\nWG)
    \ from  the  viewpoint  of  European  network  operators  that are\ninvolved in
    EURESCOM  P909  Project  'Enabling  Technologies  for  IN\nEvolution and IN-Internet
    Integration'. The input is based on current \nresults that were achieved in the
    project.  As the project title says \nP909 project  deals with IN-Internet integration
    issues.  The project\nhas defined an architecture for IN-Internet inte gration
    and  it  has\nselected  and  described  some  IN-Internet  services  which  can
    \ be\ninteresting from the business perspective and  challenging  from  the\ntechnical
    perspective.  \nSome  of  these  services  are 'officially' chartered in IETF:
    ICW in\nSPIRITS,  Click-to-Dial  (Request  to  Call)  as  well  as   proposed\nConference
    Service in PINT. However, there are additional IN-Internet \nconvergence  services
    that P909 studies and that are included in this\ndocument only as examples.\n\t
