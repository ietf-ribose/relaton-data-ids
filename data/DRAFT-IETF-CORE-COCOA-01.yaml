abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CoAP protocol needs to be implemented in such a way that
    it does\n   not cause persistent congestion on the network it uses.  The CoRE\n
    \  CoAP specification defines basic behavior that exhibits low risk of\n   congestion
    with minimal implementation requirements.  It also leaves\n   room for combining
    the base specification with advanced congestion\n   control mechanisms with higher
    performance.\n\n   This specification defines some simple advanced CoRE Congestion\n
    \  Control mechanisms, Simple CoCoA.  It is making use of input from\n   simulations
    and experiments in real networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
