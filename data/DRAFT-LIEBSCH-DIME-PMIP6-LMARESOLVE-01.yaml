abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF is specifying Diameter extensions to support mobility\nservice
    authorization and home network prefix allocation for Proxy\nMobile IPv6.  The
    protocol operates between a Local Mobility Anchor\nand a AAA server.  Furthermore,
    the associated specification extends\nthe existing protocol for network access
    service to support dynamic\nassignment and discovery of a Local Mobility Anchor
    during the\nauthentication procedure.  The AAA server maintains mobile nodes'\nprofile
    in a policy store, which includes information about the\nassigned Local Mobility
    Anchor as well as the home network prefix.\nThis document proposes a further extension
    to allow Local Mobility\nAnchors benefit from the AAA server's policy store and
    resolve an\nunknown mobile node's IP address into a routable address of its\nassigned
    Local Mobility Anchor.\n\t </p>\n      "
