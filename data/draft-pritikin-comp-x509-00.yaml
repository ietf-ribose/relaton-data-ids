abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This note defines the Compressed X.509 Format (CXF), a compact formatfor
    X.509 certificates and CRLs, and a way to translate between thecompact format
    and standard X.509 encoding. The translation consistsof the lossless compression
    algorithm DEFLATE with a particularpredefined dictionary. Protocol bindings for
    TLS and IKE aredesignated.This format is useful in a constrained environment,
    where bandwidthand/or storage is low, and it preserves interoperability withstandards-compliant
    X.509 certificates and the systems forcertificate processing, issuance, and management.</p>"
