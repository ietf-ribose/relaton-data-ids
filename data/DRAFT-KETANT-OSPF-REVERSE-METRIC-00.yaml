abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the extensions to OSPF that enables
    a router\n   to signal to its neighbor the metric that the neighbor should use\n
    \  towards itself using link-local advertisement between them.  The\n   signalling
    of this reverse metric, to be used on link(s) towards\n   itself, allows a router
    to influence the amount of traffic flowing\n   towards itself and in certain use-cases
    enables routers to maintain\n   symmetric metric on both sides of a link between
    them.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
