abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels between
    SMTP Mail Transfer Agents, including STARTTLS, DANE TLSA, and MTA-STS. These protocols
    can fail due to misconfiguration or active attack, leading to undelivered messages
    or delivery over unencrypted or unauthenticated channels. This document describes
    a reporting mechanism and format by which sending systems can share statistics
    and specific information about potential failures with recipient domains. Recipient
    domains can then use this information to both detect potential attacks and diagnose
    unintentional misconfigurations.</p>"
