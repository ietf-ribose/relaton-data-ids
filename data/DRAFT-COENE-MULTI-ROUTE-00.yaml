abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a way to loadshare the different paths
    of a\nmultihomed SCTP association at the same moment while keeping\ncongestion
    control per path.  The document also describes a possible\nsolution to multihoming
    which would require no routing tables on the\nhost and which would try to guarantee
    non-overlapping multihomed\npaths. It could possibly reduce the growth of the
    routing table in a\nrouter. The selection of which link to take would be a local\none.
    The solution is similar to the use of links and linksets within\na routeset in
    SS7.\n\t </p>\n      "
