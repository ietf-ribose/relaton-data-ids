abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new RTP header extension. The purpose
    of the\n   extension is to provide additional information that further\n   distinguishes
    the RTP datagram (and its payload) from other datagrams\n   containing the same
    type of payload.  The information may be used by\n   application layer gateways
    to drop packets, or place them in a lower\n   priority outbound queue.  Or, through
    deep packet inspection,\n   information stored in the classifier header extension
    may be used to\n   (re)set diff-serv code points set in the IP header that may
    be have\n   reset at ingress/egress boundaries of a diff-serv domain.\n\n\t </p>\n
