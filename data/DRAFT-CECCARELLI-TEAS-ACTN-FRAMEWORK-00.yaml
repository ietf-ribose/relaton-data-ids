abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transport networks have a variety of mechanisms to facilitate
    the\n   separation of the data plane and control plane.  They also have a\n   range
    of management and provisioning protocols to configure and\n   activate network
    resources.  These mechanisms represent key\n   technologies for enabling flexible
    and dynamic networking.\n\n   Abstraction of network resources is a technique
    that can be applied\n   to a single network domain or across multiple domains
    to create a\n   single virtualized network that is under the control of a network\n
    \  operator that may be the customer of the operator that actually owns\n   the
    network resources.\n\n   This draft provides a framework for Abstraction and Control
    of\n   Transport Networks (ACTN).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
