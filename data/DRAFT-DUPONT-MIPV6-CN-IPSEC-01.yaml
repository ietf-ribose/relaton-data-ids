abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IPv6 [1] uses IPsec [2] to protect signaling between the\n
    \  mobile node and the home agent [3]. This document defines how IPsec\n   could
    be used between the mobile node and correspondent nodes,\n   including home address
    option validation (aka. triangular routing),\n   protection of mobility signaling
    for routing optimization and\n   suitable configurations.\n\t </p>\n      "
