abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document suggests extensions to TLS designed to make TLS
    more \namenable to use within wireless environments. The extensions may be\nused
    by TLS clients and servers. The extensions are backwards\ncompatible - communication
    is possible between TLS 1.0 clients\nthat support the extensions and TLS 1.0 servers
    that do not\nsupport the extensions, and vice versa.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
