abstract:
- content: <p>This Internet Draft describes an enhanced way to exchange prefix information,
    to permit multiple copies of a prefix with different paths to be announced and
    withdrawn. This negotiated capability provides faster local (inter-AS) and global
    (intra-AS) convergence, reduces path-hunting, improves route- reflector behaviour,
    including eliminating both persistent oscillations and BGP "wedgies". Additional
    prefix instances have new optional BGP attributes, to control path selection.
    Withdrawl of prefixes will require new attributes to disambiguate prefix instances.
    Benefits are seen both when deployed intra-AS, and on inter-AS peering.Author's
    Note This Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related draft(s)
    being placed on the Standards Track for idr. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
    "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
    and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [5].</p>
