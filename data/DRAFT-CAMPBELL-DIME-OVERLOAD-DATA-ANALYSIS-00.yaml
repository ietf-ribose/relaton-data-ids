abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs
    to be\n   able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to\n
    \  reduce sending traffic for some period of time.  Multiple mechanisms\n   have
    been proposed for transporting overload and load information.\n   While these
    proposals differ in many ways, they share similar data\n   requirements.  This
    document analyzes the data requirements of each\n   proposal with a view towards
    proposing a common set of of Diameter\n   Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs).\n\n\t
