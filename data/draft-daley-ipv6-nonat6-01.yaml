abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Proposals have been made to include Network Address Translation
    (NAT)in IPv6. Network Address Translation substitutes a source address inthe outbound
    Packet headers at the Internet Egress point for onepresent at the network edge.
    It then matches the responding packetsby destination address, and restores the
    original headers.NAT itself is not a feature. It is a mechanism which providesfeatures
    at an application cost. This document identifies featureswhich are supplied by
    NAT in IPv4 and how these features may beprovisioned in IPv6. Both NAT and application-friendly
    alternativesare presented.</p>"
