abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents a new method for the PMTU discovery for
    IPv6. \nTo discover the PMTU of a path, a source node measures its actual PMTU\nusing
    the newly defined Hop-by-Hop Option header, whereas a source \nnode initially
    assumes that the PMTU of a path is the known MTU of \nthe first hop in the path
    in the previous one [1981]. In order to \nmeasure the actual PMTU, the source
    node sends the IP packet with the\nnewly defined Hop-by-Hop Option header to the
    destination node with \nthe first data packet when node is beginning. This can
    eliminate the \nchance of occurrence of several iterations of the somewhat complex
    \ndiscovery cycle (sending a packet, receiving a Packet Too Big message,\nreducing
    a packet size). Most of all, since existing PMTU has a weak \npoint for security
    and denial-of-service attacks, this document \nsuggests a security function when
    PMTU is going on.\nAll IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers, must implement
    newly\nOptions as defined in this specification.\n    \n\t </p>\n      "
