abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is a guide to the introduction of IPv6 in the IPv4
    \nbased Internet or Intranets.  Several general issues to start IPv6 \nnetworking
    in a predominantly IPv4 world are discussed, such as IPv6\naddresses, IPv6 DNS
    and routing issues.  Short descriptions are given\nof the different translation
    and migration tools and mechanisms that\ntranslate between IPv6 and IPv4 and/or
    tunnel IPv6 over IPv4.  The \nremainder of this document describes how IPv6 can
    be introduced in \nvarious environments, such as ISPs, Internet Exchanges and
    end user \nenvironments.  Suggestions are given on the use of the different \ntranslation
    and migration tools in each environment.\n\t </p>\n      "
