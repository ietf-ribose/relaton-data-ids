abstract:
- content: "<p>In defining the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), some features
    have turned up that would be nice to have. In the interest of completing this
    specification in a timely manner, the present document was started to collect
    nice-to-have features that did not make it into the first RFC for CDDL, RFC 8610,
    or the specifications exercising its extension points, such as RFC 9165. It is
    now time to discuss thawing some of the concepts discussed here. A number of additional
    proposals have been added.</p>"
