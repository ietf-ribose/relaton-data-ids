abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document illustrates various conceptual deployment scenarios
    of \nSession/Border Controller (S/BC). The objective is to depict a provider's
    \narchitectural requirements of S/BC function deployment. The document will help
    the IETF community to understand that S/BC functions can be deployed in the network
    in scalable approach.\n\t </p>\n      "
