abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides a description of a GSS-API mechanism usable\nthrough
    the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface \n(as specified in
    Internet-Drafts [GSSV2] and [GSSV2-C]) that is \neasy to deploy since it does
    not rely on the existence of a \nsecurity infrastructure nor the existence of
    a security server.\nThe GSS-API-Easy mechanism enables unilateral and mutual \nauthentication
    of peers as well as per-message protections. It is \nbased on the use of an identifier
    and a SharedSecret shared between \nthe client and the server and uses a protocol
    where the passphrase \n(i.e. a long phrase used like a password) is never sent
    in the clear. \nIn addition, this document describes a protocol to change the
    \nSharedSecret.\n\t </p>\n      "
