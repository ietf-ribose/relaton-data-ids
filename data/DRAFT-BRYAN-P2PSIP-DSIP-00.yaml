abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document outlines the motivation, requirements, and\n
    \  architectural design for a distributed Session Initiation Protocol\n   (dSIP).
    dSIP is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) based approach for SIP\n   registration and resource
    discovery using distributed hash tables\n   maintained with SIP messages.  This
    design removes the need for\n   central servers from SIP, while offering full
    backward compatibility\n   with SIP, allowing reuse of existing clients, and allowing
    P2P\n   enabled peers to communicate with conventional SIP entities.  A basic\n
    \  introduction to the concepts of P2P is presented, backward\n   compatibility
    issues addressed, and security considerations are\n   discussed.\n\n   dSIP is
    one possible implementation of the protocols being discussed\n   for creation
    in the P2PSIP WG.  In the context of the work being\n   proposed, this draft represents
    a concrete proposal for the P2PSIP\n   Peer Protocol, using SIP with extensions
    as the underlying protocol.\n   In this architecture, no P2PSIP Client Protocol
    is needed, rather\n   unmodified SIP is used for access by non-peers.\n\n\t </p>\n
