abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As emerging real-time services on the Internet, such as Voice
    over IP\n(VoIP), increase their visibility, a security framework has to be\nprovided.
    In particular, confidentiality is a main concern in the\nmultimedia scenario.\nTo
    support full flexibility of the services, a solution with IP all\nthe way (to
    the terminal) is believed to offer advantages, if\ntechnically and economically
    feasible. Therefore, new requirements\nhave to be met on cellular access networks,
    and this has an impact on\nthe security solutions.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
