abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Some Relay Agents extract lease information from the DHCP message\n
    \  exchanged between the client and DHCP server.  This lease information\n   is
    used by relay agents for various purposes like antispoofing,\n   prevention of
    flooding.  RFC 4388 defines a mechanism for relay\n   agents to retrieve the lease
    information from the DHCP server as and\n   when this information is lost.  Existing
    leasequery mechanism is data\n   driven which means that a relay agent can initiate
    the leasequery only when it starts receiving data from/to the clients.  In certain\n
    \  scenarios, this model is not scalable.  This document first looks at\n   issues
    in existing mechanism and then proposes a new query type,\n   query by remote
    ID, to address these issues.\n\t </p>\n      "
