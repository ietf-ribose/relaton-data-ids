abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines access to the Adj-RIB-In\n
    \  and locally originated routes (e.g. routes distributed into BGP from\n   protocols
    such as static) but not access to the BGP instance Loc-RIB.\n   This document
    updates the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) RFC 7854 by\n   adding access to the
    BGP instance Local-RIB, as defined in RFC 4271\n   the routes that have been selected
    by the local BGP speaker's\n   Decision Process. These are the routes over all
    peers, locally\n   originated, and after best-path selection.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
