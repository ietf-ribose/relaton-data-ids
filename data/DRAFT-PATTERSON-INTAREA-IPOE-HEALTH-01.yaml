abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   PPP over Ethernet clients have the functionality to detect
    path\n   unavailability by using PPP Keepalives.  IP over Ethernet does not\n
    \  have this functionality, and it's not specified when an IP over\n   Ethernet
    client should consider its WAN connectivity down, unless\n   there is a physical
    layer link down event.\n\n   This document describes a way for IP over Ethernet
    clients to achieve\n   connectivity validation, similar to that of PPP over Ethernet,
    by\n   using BFD Echo, or ARP and Neighbor Discovery functions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
