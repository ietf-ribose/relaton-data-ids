abstract:
- content: <p>This document extends the work of Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures
    (BRSKI) by replacing the Circuit-proxy between Pledge and Registrar by a stateless/stateful
    constrained Join Proxy. The constrained Join Proxy is a mesh neighbor of the Pledge
    and can relay a DTLS session originating from a Pledge with only link-local addresses
    to a Registrar which is not a mesh neighbor of the Pledge. This document defines
    a protocol to securely assign a Pledge to a domain, represented by a Registrar,
    using an intermediary node between Pledge and Registrar. This intermediary node
    is known as a "constrained Join Proxy". An enrolled Pledge can act as a constrained
    Join Proxy.</p>
