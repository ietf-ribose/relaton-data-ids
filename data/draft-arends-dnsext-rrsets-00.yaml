abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In order for DNSSEC to be deployed operationally, there needs tobe
    a mechanism that allows for unsigned RRsets in a secure zone.In the current definition
    of DNSSEC [RFC 2535], it is allowed tohave 2 types of unsigned records, i.e. glue
    address RRsets anddelegation point NS RRsets. There exists several reasons toallow
    other unsigned RRsets, all related to the scalability andmaintenance of a secure
    zone.</p>"
