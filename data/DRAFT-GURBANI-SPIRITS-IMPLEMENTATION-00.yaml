abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The SPIRITS protocol defines the mechanisms and the semantics
    to\nsubscribe to and convey certain PSTN events to interested Internet\nhosts
    for service execution [1].  This Internet-Draft describes our\ninitial implementation
    of a SPIRITS framework based on the\narchitecture and requirements outlined in
    [2] and [3], respectively.\nWe have implemented two services based on such an
    architecture: a\nSPIRITS-based presence service which provides a coarse-grained\npresence
    status for a user represented by a device (phone), and a\nSPIRITS-based Instant
    Messaging (IM) service whereby the PSTN sends a\nSIP IM to a SPIRITS User Agent
    (UA).  These services, the attendant\narchitecture and the relevant call flows
    are described next.\nIt is expected that the reader is conversant in the SPIRITS
    and SIP\nterminology.  For those who are not, [5,6] provide a good reference\nfor
    SIP and its event-based mechanism, and [1,2,3] provide a good\nreference for SPIRITS.\nIt
    is important to point out that the SPIRITS protocol [1] is not a\nstandard yet,
    it is still an Internet-Draft.  Thus, what is described\nin this draft is an early
    implementation designed to validate the\nsuitability of the protocol as well as
    provide some implementation\nexperience that will be leveraged in further refining
    the protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
