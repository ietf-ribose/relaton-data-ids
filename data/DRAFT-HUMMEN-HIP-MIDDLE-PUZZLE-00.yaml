abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Host Identity Protocol [RFC5201] is a secure signaling
    protocol\n   with a cryptographic namespace.  It provides the communicating peers\n
    \  with a cryptographic puzzle mechanism to protect against Denial of\n   Service
    (DoS) attacks targeting its computation and memory overhead.\n   This document
    specifies an extension that enables middleboxes to\n   assist in the choice of
    the puzzle difficulty as well as in solving\n   the puzzle on behalf of the host.\n\n\n\t
