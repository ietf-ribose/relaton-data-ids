abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial information
    networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network performance criteria (e.g.
    latency) are becoming as critical to data path selection as other metrics and
    constraints. These metrics are associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA)
    between customers and service providers. The link bandwidth utilization (the total
    bandwidth of a link in current use for the forwarding) is another important factor
    to consider during path computation. IGP Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric extensions
    describe mechanisms with which network performance information is distributed
    via OSPF and IS-IS respectively. The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
    computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. This document
    describes the extension to PCEP to carry latency, delay variation, packet loss
    and link bandwidth utilization as constraints for end to end path computation.</p>"
