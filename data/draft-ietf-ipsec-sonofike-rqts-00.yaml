abstract:
- content: "<p>Various proposals have been made for updating the IKE protocol. This
    effort has been known as 'Son of IKE (SOI)'. One thing that is missing from the
    discussion is an evaluation of the scope of SOI, identifying which problems it
    should solve. Sections of this document discuss various scenarios that are considered
    important for SOI. Once this scoping is done, it becomes easier to specify the
    requirements of the protocol. This document also discusses protocol, policy and
    security requirements for SOI, along with recommendations for protocol improvement
    in such areas as modularity, extensibility, protocol convergence and simplicity,
    which are important regardless of the scope of SOI.</p>"
