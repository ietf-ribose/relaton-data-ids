abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   New fields are occasionally added to civic addresses.  A backwardly-\n
    \  compatible mechanism for adding civic address elements to the Geopriv\n   civic
    address format is described.  A formal mechanism for handling\n   unsupported
    extensions when translating between XML and DHCP civic\n   address forms is defined
    for entities that need to perform this\n   translation.  Intial extensions for
    some new elements are also\n   defined.  The LoST (RFC5222) protocol mechanism
    that returns civic\n   address element names used for validation of location information
    is\n   clarified and is normatively updated to require a qualifying\n   namespace
    identifier on each civic address element returned as part\n   of the validation
    process.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
