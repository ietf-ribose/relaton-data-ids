abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework method that network operations
    may use their addresses. Network operators, who have large IPv6 address space,
    may choose to embedded some semantics into IPv6 addresses by assigning additional
    significance to specific bits within the prefix. By embedded semantics into IPv6
    prefixes, the semantics of packets can be inspected easily. Routers and other
    intermediary devices can easily apply relevant policies as required. Packet-level
    differentiation can also enable flow-level and user- level differentiation. Consequently,
    the network operators can accordingly treat network packets differently and efficiently.
    The management and maintenance of networks can be much simpler.</p>"
