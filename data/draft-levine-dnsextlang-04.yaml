abstract:
- content: "<p>Adding new RRTYPEs to the DNS requires that DNS servers and provisioning
    software be upgraded to support each new RRTYPE in Master files. This document
    defines a DNS extension language intended to allow most new RRTYPEs to be supported
    by adding a line to a configuration file read by the DNS software, with no changed
    software.</p>"
