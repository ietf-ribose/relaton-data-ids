abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a solution to the Internet address
    depletion\n   issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part
    of\n   the original IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for\n   Easy
    IPv4), outlines the IPv4 public address pool expansion and the\n   Internet system
    architecture enhancement considerations. EzIP may\n   expand an IPv4 address by
    a factor of 256M without affecting the\n   existing IPv4 based Internet, or the
    current private networks. It is\n   in full conformance with the IPv4 protocol,
    and supports not only\n   both direct and private network connectivity, but also
    their\n   interoperability. EzIP deployments may coexist with existing Internet\n
    \  traffic and IoTs (Internet of Things) operations without perturbing\n   their
    setups, while offering end-users the freedom to indepdently\n   choose which service.
    EzIP may be implemented as a software or\n   firmware enhancement to Internet
    edge routers or private network\n   routing gateways, wherever needed, or simply
    installed as an inline\n   adjunct hardware module between the two, enabling a
    seamless\n   introduction. The 256M case detailed here establishes a complete\n
    \  spherical layer of routers for interfacing between the Internet fabic\n   (core
    plus edge routers) and the end user premises. Incorporating\n   caching proxy
    technology in the gateway, a fairly large geographical\n   region may enjoy address
    expansion based on as little as one ordinary\n   IPv4 public address utilizing
    IP packets with degenerated EzIP\n   header. If IPv4 public pool allocations were
    reorganized, the\n   assignable pool could be multiplied 512M fold or even more.
    Enabling\n   hierarchical address architecture which facilitates both hierarchical\n
    \  and mesh routing, EzIP can provide nearly the same order of magnitude\n   of
    address pool resources as IPv6 while streamlining the\n   administrative aspects
    of it. The basic EzIP will immediately resolve\n   local IPv4 address shortage,
    while being transparent to the rest of\n   the Internet. Under the Dual-Stack
    environment, these proposed\n   interim facilities will relieve the IPv4 address
    shortage issue,\n   while affording IPv6 more time to reach maturity for providing
    the\n   availability levels required for delivering a long-term general\n   service.\n\n\t
