abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Virtual machines, or virtualized servers, basically allow one\nphysical
    server to support multiple hosts (20, 30, or hundreds of).\nAs virtual machines
    are introduced to Data center, the number of\nhosts within one data center can
    grow dramatically, which could\ncreate tremendous impact to networks and hosts.\n\nThis
    document describes reasons why it is still desirable to have\nvirtual machines
    in Data Center to be in one Layer 2 network and\npotential problems this type
    of Layer 2 network will face. The goal\nis to justify why it is necessary for
    IETF to create a working group\nto work on interoperable and scalable solutions
    for data center(s)\nwith large number of virtual machines.\n\t </p>\n      "
