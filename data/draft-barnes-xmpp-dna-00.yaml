abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Many Internet applications allow service delegation via the DNS.However,
    in the absence of DNSSEC, these delegations areunauthenticated, so clients have
    to authenticate the delegate as ifhe were the original service. This situation
    causes severaloperational problems. This document describes a mechanism forclients
    to discover and validate information that authenticates DNS-based service delegations,
    without relying on the global deploymentof DNSSEC.</p>"
