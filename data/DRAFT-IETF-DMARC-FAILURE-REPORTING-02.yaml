abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n
    \  (DMARC) is a scalable mechanism by which a domain owner can request\n   feedback
    about email messages using their domain in the From: address\n   field.  This
    document describes \"failure reports,\" or \"failed message\n   reports,\" which
    provide details about individual messages that failed\n   to authenticate according
    to the DMARC mechanism.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
