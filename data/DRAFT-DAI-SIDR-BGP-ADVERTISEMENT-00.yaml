abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SIDR working group is working on an extended architecture for
    \ninterdomain routing security framework. One of the functions that \nthis architecture
    should provide is origin authentication of prefixes \nfor BGP, i.e. a BGP speaker
    must be able to determine whether an AS \n(autonomous system) is authorized to
    originate certain prefixes. This \ndraft documents some ideas from the perspective
    of internal control \nin order to alleviate this problem. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
