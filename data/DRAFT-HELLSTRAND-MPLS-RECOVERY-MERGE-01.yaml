abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To protect an Explicit Routed Label Switched Path (ER-LSP) an\nexplicitly
    routed LSP can be used as a recovery path. We consider a\nrepair scheme where
    a Recovery LSP (R-LSP) spans one or several hops.\nAfter a switchover of traffic
    to the R-LSP we want to allow the\ntraffic to merge onto the original LSP at the
    merging node downstream\nof the fault without causing any extra resource reservation.
    This\nmerge operation differs in a number of details from that employed for\na
    normal MP2P LSP.\nOur objective is to define extensions to both CR-LDP and RSVP-TE
    that\naddress these differences. CR-LDP and RSVP-TE are defined in [CR-LDP]\nand
    [RSVP-TE], respectively, for path setup within a MPLS domain. In\nthis draft we
    specify mechanisms required to support this merge.\n\t </p>\n      "
