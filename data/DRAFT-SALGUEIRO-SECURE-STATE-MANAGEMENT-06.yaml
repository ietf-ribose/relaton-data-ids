abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Virtually every application on the web today that allows a
    user to\n   log in or manipulate information stored on a server maintains some\n
    \  form of state management information.  Usually, the session context\n   is
    established through the use of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)\n   parameter
    or a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) cookie that\n   identifies the session.
    \ Without the use of Transport Layer Security\n   (TLS), such an information exchange
    introduces a security risk.  For\n   a variety of reasons, TLS may not be desired
    or preferred in all\n   situations and, in those cases, users are left vulnerable.
    \ This\n   memo provides a simple method for enabling secure exchange of state\n
    \  management information through HTTP in situations where TLS is not\n   employed.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
