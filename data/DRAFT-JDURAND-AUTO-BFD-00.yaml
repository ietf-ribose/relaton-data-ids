abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a solution called AUTO-BFD, that\n
    \  automatically initiates BFD sessions for BGP next-hops.  This makes\n   it
    possible to avoid blackholing scenarios when a BGP peer is not the\n   BGP next-hop,
    especially on Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) when BGP\n   Route-Servers are deployed.
    \ When they are configured with this\n   mechanism, routers can automatically
    try to establish a new adjacency\n   for every new BGP next-hop.  BGP routes are
    then checked against the\n   state of the BFD session for the corresponding next-hop.\n\nForeword\n\n
    \  A placeholder to list general observations about this document.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
