abstract:
  content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables asubscriber
    to receive asynchronous notification of various eventsfrom other SIP user agents.
    It defines mechanisms to create,refresh, terminate subscriptions. This framework
    also definesmechanism to fetch (poll) an event state of a resource withoutcreating
    persistent subscriptions. There is no mechanism totemporarily pause the notifications,
    while still maintaining asubscription on the server. This lack of functionality
    sometimeresults in a lot of superfluous notification traffic, and putunnecessary
    load on the server. This draft defines an extension toSIP events that allows the
    subscriber to pause, un-pausenotifications, and be able to perform fetch (poll)
    subscriptionswithin an established (created) subscription dialog.</p>"
