abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Due to the lack of layer interaction between networked applications\nand
    the network during service provisioning, many end user\napplications and services
    cannot efficiently utilize the network\ncapabilities, nor can achieve the desired
    quality of service\nobjectives.\n\nThis document describes the general problem
    of cross layer\noptimization. Cross-layer optimization (CLO) involves the overall\noptimization
    of application layer and network resources by providing\nan interface for interactions
    and exchanges between the two layers.\nThe potential gains of cross layer optimization
    are illustrated via\nexamples from content delivery systems, video on demand systems,
    and\ngrid computing.\n\t </p>\n      "
