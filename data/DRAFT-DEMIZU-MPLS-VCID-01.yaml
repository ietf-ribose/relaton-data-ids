abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Several label switching schemes have been proposed to fuse
    and\n   integrate the cost-performance and QoS assurance of Layer 2 devices\n
    \  and the flexibility and functionality of Layer 3 protocols.\n \n   Some of
    these proposals assume that Label Switching Routers (LSRs)\n   are placed in a
    homogeneous LSR cloud in a campus area network or a\n   backbone network, and
    they are connected directly to each other.\n   However, this assumption sometimes
    does not hold true in the real\n   situation.  For example, some campuses will
    be connected via ATM SVC\n   service, and LSR networks will be constructed hierarchically.\n
    \n   To deal with Virtual Connections (VCs) in these environments, this\n   document
    proposes to identify a VC with a VCID instead of a label.\n\t </p>\n      "
