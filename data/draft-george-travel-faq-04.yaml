abstract:
- content: "<p>This document attempts to provide a list of the common Frequently Asked
    Questions (FAQs) that IETF meeting attendees often ask regarding travel logistics
    and local information. It is intended to assist those who are willing to provide
    local information, so that if they wish to pre-populate answers to some or all
    of these questions either in the IETF Wiki or a meeting-specific site, they have
    a reasonably complete list of ideas to draw from. It is not meant as a list of
    required information that the host or secretariat needs to provide, merely as
    a guideline.</p>"
