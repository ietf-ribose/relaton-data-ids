abstract:
- content: "<p>The current memo documents extensions to ICMP that permit Label Switching
    Routers to append MPLS header information to ICMP messages. These ICMP extensions
    support an MPLS aware traceroute application that network operators can use to
    trace paths through the MPLS user plane. Although these extensions are not being
    proposed as Internet Standards, they are documented here because they have been
    implemented by several vendors and deployed by several operators.</p>"
