abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides environment security requirements for the SFC
    architecture. Environment security requirements are independent of the protocols
    used for SFC - such as NSH for example. As a result, the requirements provided
    in this document are intended to provide good security practices so SFC can be
    securely deployed and operated. These security requirements are designated as
    environment security requirements as opposed to the protocol security requirements.</p>"
