abstract:
- content: "<p>Discovery of the (Path Computation Element (PCE) within an IGP area
    or domain is possible using OSPF [RFC5088] and IS-IS [RFC5089]. However, in some
    deployment scenarios PCEs may not wish, or be able, to participate within the
    IGP process. Therefore it would be beneficial for the Path Computation Client
    (PCC) to discover PCEs via an alternative mechanism to those proposed in [RFC5088]
    and [RFC5089]. This document specifies the requirements, use cases, procedures
    and extensions to support DNS for PCE discovery.</p>"
