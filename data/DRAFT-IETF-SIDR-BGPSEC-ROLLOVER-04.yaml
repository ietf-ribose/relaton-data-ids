abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGPsec will need to address the impact from regular and emergency\n
    \  rollover processes for the BGPsec End-Entity (EE) certificates that\n   will
    be performed by Certificate Authorities (CAs) participating at\n   the Resource
    Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  Rollovers of BGPsec\n   EE certificates must
    be carefully managed in order to synchronize\n   distribution of router public
    keys and the usage of those pubic keys\n   by BGPsec routers.  This document provides
    general recommendations\n   for that process, as well as describing reasons why
    the rollover of\n   BGPsec EE certificates might be necessary.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
