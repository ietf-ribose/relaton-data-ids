abstract:
  content: "<p>For the purpose of this document, a subnetwork is defined as a virtual
    topology configured over a connected IP network routing region and bounded by
    encapsulating border nodes. These virtual topologies are manifested by tunnels
    that may span multiple IP and/or sub-IP layer forwarding hops, where they may
    incur packet duplication, packet reordering, source address spoofing and traversal
    of links with diverse Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs). This document specifies
    a Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) that addresses these issues.</p>"
