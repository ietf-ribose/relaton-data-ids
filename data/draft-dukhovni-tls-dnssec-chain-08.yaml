abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimental TLS extension for the in-band
    transport of the complete set of records that can be validated by DNSSEC and that
    are needed to perform DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) of a TLS
    server. This extension obviates the need to perform separate, out-of-band DNS
    lookups. When the requisite DNS records do not exist, the extension conveys a
    denial-of-existence proof that can be validated. This experimental extension is
    developed outside the IETF and is published here to guide implementation of the
    extension and to ensure interoperability among implementations.</p>"
