abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a use case and a method for a DNS recursive\n
    \  resolver to use unauthenticated encryption when communicating with\n   authoritative
    servers.  The motivating use case for this method is\n   that more encryption
    on the Internet is better, and some resolver\n   operators believe that unauthenticated
    encryption is better than no\n   encryption at all.  The method described here
    is optional for both\n   the recursive resolver and the authoritative server.
    \ This method\n   supports unauthenticated encryption using the same mechanism
    for\n   discovery of encryption support for the server as [FULL-AUTH].\n\n\t </p>\n
