abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is to allow record based equipment a common record
    \noffload layer suitable for other protocols.  As all storage protocols \nanticipate
    hardware acceleration, it becomes incumbent to provide \nthis hardware a generic
    structure that can be applied to many \nprotocols and yet allow an unencumbered
    feature set.  The structures \ndefined for SCTP [RFC2960] were developed to provide
    record based \nsolutions and are well suited for this common record offload layer.
    \ \nThis document will assume either direct use of SCTP, a modified SCTP \ncommon
    header used as a TCP option, or this modified SCTP common \nheader placed within
    the TCP byte stream.  SCTP conventions will be \nused to enable enhanced features
    such as connection recovery in lieu \nof other techniques.  The sequential handling
    of delineated records \nis done in accordance with SCTP.\n\t </p>\n      "
