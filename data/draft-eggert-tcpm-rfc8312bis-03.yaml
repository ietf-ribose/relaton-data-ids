abstract:
- content: "<p>CUBIC is an extension to the traditional TCP standards. It differs
    from the traditional TCP standards only in the congestion control algorithm on
    the sender side. In particular, it uses a cubic function instead of the linear
    window increase function of the traditional TCP standards to improve scalability
    and stability under fast and long-distance networks. CUBIC has been adopted as
    the default TCP congestion control algorithm by the Linux, Windows, and Apple
    stacks. This document updates the specification of CUBIC to include algorithmic
    improvements based on these implementations and recent academic work. Based on
    the extensive deployment experience with CUBIC, it also moves the specification
    to the Standards Track, obsoleting [RFC8312].</p>"
