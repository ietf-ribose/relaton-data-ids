abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ID/Location separation protocols are proposed for scalable
    routing,\n   enhancing mobility and privacy in IPv6-based vehicular networks.
    \ In\n   IPv6-based vehicular networks, ID/Location separation architecture is\n
    \  expected to offer benefits.  This document analyzes how ID/Location\n   separation
    protocols can adjust into IP based vehicular networks and\n   suggests requirements
    for efficient ID/Location separation in\n   vehicular networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
