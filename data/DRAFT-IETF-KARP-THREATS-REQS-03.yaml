abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Different routing protocols exist and each employs its own
    mechanism\n   for securing the protocol packets on the wire.  While most already\n
    \  have some method for accomplishing cryptographic message\n   authentication,
    in many cases the existing methods are dated,\n   vulnerable to attack, and employ
    cryptographic algorithms that have\n   been deprecated.  The \"Keying and Authentication
    for Routing\n   Protocols\" (KARP) effort aims to overhaul and improve these\n
    \  mechanisms.\n\n   This document has two main parts - the first describes the
    threat\n   analysis for attacks against routing protocols' transports and the\n
    \  second enumerates the requirements for addressing the described\n   threats.
    \ This document, along with the KARP design guide will be\n   used by KARP design
    teams for specific protocol review and overhaul.\n   This document reflects the
    input of both the IETF's Security Area and\n   Routing Area in order to form a
    jointly agreed upon guidance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
