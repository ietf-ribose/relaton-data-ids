abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Well-Known BGP Communities are manipulated inconsistently by
    current\n   implementations.  This results in difficulties for operators.\n   Network
    operators are encouraged to deploy consistent community\n   handling across their
    networks, taking the inconsistent behaviors\n   from the various BGP implementations
    they operate into consideration.\n   Also, BGP implementors are expected to not
    create any further\n   inconsistencies from this point forward.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
