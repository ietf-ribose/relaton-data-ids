abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes an approach to negotiate ESP SA when both
    sides\nare using CGAs as IP address.  The solution provides as an alternate\nsolution
    of IKE when CGAs are available.  One round of message\nexchanges is described
    in order to take place of the initial\nexchanges of IKEv2 or the phase 1 exchange
    of IKE.  A new IPv6\nextension header, CGA extension header, is described in order
    to\ncarry CGA related payloads.\n\t </p>\n      "
