abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The document describes the process of discovering CoAP serversdistributed
    in multiple subnets in a non-specified topology. CoAPDiscovery Gateways are used
    to discover one subnet from another.CoAP Discovery Gateways may provide caching
    to enable discovery ofsleeping nodes in LLN environments. The solution scales
    to largeinstallations since discovery is handled by the client in anincremental
    fashion.</p>"
