abstract:
- content: "<p>The document describes the process of discovering CoAP servers distributed
    in multiple subnets in a non-specified topology. CoAP Discovery Gateways are used
    to discover one subnet from another. CoAP Discovery Gateways may provide caching
    to enable discovery of sleeping nodes in LLN environments. The solution scales
    to large installations since discovery is handled by the client in an incremental
    fashion.</p>"
