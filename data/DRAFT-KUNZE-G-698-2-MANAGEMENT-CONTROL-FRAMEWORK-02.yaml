abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a framework that describes a solution
    space\n   for the control and management of optical interfaces parameters\n   according
    to the Black Link approach as specified by ITU-T [ITU\n   G.698.2].  In particular,
    it examines topological elements and\n   related network management processes
    to operate this construct.  This\n   framework is scoped to address the Optical
    Channel (OCh)-layer\n   covered by G.698.2.  The focus is on enabling the wavelength\n
    \  provisioning process in a black link approach irrespective on how it\n   is
    triggered i.e. by EMS, NMS or GMPLS.  This document covers\n   management as well
    as control plane considerations in different\n   management cases of a single
    channel DWDM interface as defined by\n   ITU-G.698.2.  The purpose is to identify
    the necessary information\n   elements and processes to be used by control or
    management devices\n   for further processing.  Hence wavelength routing and selection\n
    \  processes as defined e.g. in WSON are beyond the scope of this\n   document.\n\n\t
