abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a set of practices for connecting stub\n
    \  networks to adjacent infrastructure networks, as well as to larger\n   network
    fabrics.  This is applicable in cases such as constrained\n   (Internet of Things)
    networks where there is a need to provide\n   functional parity of service discovery
    and reachability between\n   devices on the stub network and devices on an adjacent
    infrastructure\n   link (for example, a home network).  The stub networks use
    case is\n   intended to fully address the need to attach a single network link
    to\n   an infrastructure network, where the attached link provides no\n   through
    routing and in cases where integration to the infrastructure\n   routing fabric
    (if any) is not available.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
