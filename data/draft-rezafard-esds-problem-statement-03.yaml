abstract:
  content: '<p>This document discusses the requirements of an application layerprotocol
    for Discovery Services. Discovery Services at its coreoffers to authenticated
    and authorized users the means to discoverresources of information for a particular
    identifier. Theinformation resource can be any data source which provides aninterface
    on a network that allows for retrieval of the data. Aninformation resource could
    publish its network address (reference tothe resource) to a Discovery Service
    coupled with an identifier.Then an authenticated and authorized user could query
    the DiscoveryService with the same identifier to receive reference information
    tothe resources. Interfacing with the resources for actuallyretrieving the data
    is out of scope of Discovery Services; the roleof Discovery Services is to enable
    a client to find the networkaddresses and types (e.g. URLs) of information resources
    for aparticular identifier of interest.This protocol is applicable to numerous
    scenarios such as track andtrace in trade supply chains, where a number of independent
    resourcesmay hold information about a particular object and may have aninterest
    in selective sharing of that information, in order toimprove the efficiency of
    the supply chain network.However, other applications can be envisaged, as a ''bottom-up''
    or''grassroots'' way for generators of information content to: 1) declarethat
    they have information or commentary on a particular topic orsubject (which might
    be a physical object, geographic location oreven an abstract concept) 2) specify
    a network address through whichthat content can be retrieved, 3) specify restrictions
    about thecommunity of clients that are entitled to receive knowledge about theexistence
    of their content or see the link. This approach can becontrasted with the top-down
    approach of existing web search enginesthat rely on crawling/spidering of content
    that must be alreadyposted in the public domain before it can be indexed - and
    where thelink information is generally made publicly available in a mannerthat
    does not discriminate between clients on an individual basis.This document outlines
    a set of design concerns that an applicationlayer protocol needs to address in
    order to be widely adopted anddeployable on public networksThis document obsoletes
    "Extensible Supply-chain Discovery ServiceProblem Statement draft-rezafard-esds-problem-statement-02".Comments
    are solicited and should be addressed to the mailing list atesds@ietf.org and/or
    the author(s).</p>'
