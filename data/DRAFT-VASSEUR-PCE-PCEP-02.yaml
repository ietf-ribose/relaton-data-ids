abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the Path Computation Element communication
    \nProtocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation Client \n(PCC)
    and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs. Such \ninteractions
    include path computation requests and path computation \nreplies as well as notifications
    of specific states related to the \nuse of a PCE in the context of MPLS and GMPLS
    Traffic Engineering. \nThe PCEP protocol is designed to be flexible and extensible
    so as to \neasily allow for the addition of further messages and objects, should
    \nfurther requirements be expressed in the future. \n\t </p>\n      "
