abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo specifies methods for text media handling in multi-partycalls,
    where the text is carried by the RTP protocol. Real-time textis carried in a time-sampled
    mode according to RFC 4103. Centralizedmulti-party handling of real-time text
    is achieved through a mediacontrol unit coordinating multiple RTP text streams
    into one singlestream RTP session, identifying each stream with its own CSRC.Identification
    for the streams are provided through the RTCPmessages. This mechanism enables
    the receiving application topresent the received real-time text medium in different
    waysaccording to user preferences. Some presentation related featuresare also
    described explaining suitable variations of transmission andpresentation of text.
    Call control features are described for theSIP environment, while the transport
    mechanisms should be suitablefor any IP based call control environment using RTP
    transport. Twoalternative methods using a single RTP stream and sourceidentification
    inline in the text stream are also described.</p>"
