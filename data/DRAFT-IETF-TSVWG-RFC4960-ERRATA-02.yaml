abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is a compilation of issues found since the publication\n
    \  of RFC4960 in September 2007 based on experience with implementing,\n   testing,
    and using SCTP along with the suggested fixes.  This\n   document provides deltas
    to RFC4960 and is organized in a time based\n   way.  The issues are listed in
    the order they were brought up.\n   Because some text is changed several times
    the last delta in the text\n   is the one which should be applied.  In addition
    to the delta a\n   description of the problem and the details of the solution
    are also\n   provided.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
