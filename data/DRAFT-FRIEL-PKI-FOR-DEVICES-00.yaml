abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a standard Subject field identifier format
    for\n   certificates issued to Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  This will\n
    \  allow applications to easily and uniquely identify certificates\n   issued
    to devices as opposed to certificates issue to services or\n   users.  The certificates
    will adhere to standard Web PKI\n   specifications thus ensuring interoperability
    with existing\n   Certificate Authorities processes and workflows, and standard
    client\n   and service libraries and applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
