abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is intended to be a source of information about
    updated\n   version of the block cipher with block length of n=64 bits and key\n
    \  length k=256 bits (RFC5830), which is also referred as \"Magma\" and is\n   described
    in the Russian Federal standard GOST R 34.12-2015,\n   containing also the description
    of block cipher \"Kuznechik\"\n   (RFC7801)/&gt;.  These algorithms are from the
    set of Russian\n   cryptographic standard algorithms (called GOST algorithms).\n\n\t
