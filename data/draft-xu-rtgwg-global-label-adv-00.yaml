abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) [SR-ARCH] is a new MPLS paradigm in which each
    SR-capable router is required to independently advertise global MPLS labels for
    its attached prefixes using IGP [SR-ISIS-EXT][SR-OSPF-EXT]. One major challenge
    associated with such label advertisement mechanism is how to avoid a given global
    MPLS label from being allocated by different routers to different prefixes. Although
    manual allocation can address such label allocation collision problem, it is error-prone
    and therefore may not be suitable for large SR network environments. This document
    proposes an alternative approach for advertising global labels without any risk
    of label allocation collision.</p>"
