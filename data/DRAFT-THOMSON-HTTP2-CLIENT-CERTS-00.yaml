abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some HTTP servers provide a subset of resources that require\n
    \  additional authentication to interact with.  HTTP/1.1 servers rely on\n   TLS
    renegotiation that is triggered by a request to a protected\n   resource.  HTTP/2
    made this pattern impossible by forbidding the use\n   of TLS renegotiation.\n\n
    \  This document describes a how client authentication might be\n   requested
    by a server as a result of receiving a request to a\n   protected resource.  This
    document updates RFC 7540 to allow TLS\n   renegotiation in limited circumstances.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
