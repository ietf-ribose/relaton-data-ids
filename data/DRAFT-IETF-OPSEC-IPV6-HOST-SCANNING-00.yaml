abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4\n
    \  counterpart.  The standard /64 IPv6 subnets can (in theory)\n   accommodate
    approximately 1.844 * 10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a\n   much lower host density
    (#hosts/#addresses) than their IPv4\n   counterparts.  As a result, it is widely
    assumed that it would take a\n   tremendous effort to perform address scanning
    attacks against IPv6\n   networks, and therefore IPv6 address scanning attacks
    have long been\n   considered unfeasible.  This document analyzes how traditional\n
    \  address scanning techniques apply to IPv6 networks, and also explores\n   a
    number of other techniques that can be employed for IPv6 network\n   reconnaissance.
    \ Additionally, this document formally obsoletes RFC\n   5157.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
