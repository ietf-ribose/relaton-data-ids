abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes a method of representing the registration policy
    that a zone administrator uses for registering Internationalised Domain Names
    using Extensible Markup Language (XML). These registry policies, commonly known
    as "IDN tables", are used to enforce and share policy on which specific code-points
    are permitted for registrations, and which alternative code-points are considered
    variants.</p>
