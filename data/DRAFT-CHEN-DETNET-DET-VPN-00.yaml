abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) services are expected to
    be\n   integrated with VPN technologies.  Such deployment scenarios include\n
    \  mobile backhauls and TSN islands inter-connections.  This document\n   describes
    an overall VPN framework that provides deterministic\n   transport services (called
    deterministic VPN), specifies\n   corresponding control and data plane protocols
    that are required to\n   support the framework, and initially summarizes potential
    extensions\n   of existing protocols to enable deterministic VPNs.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
