abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IKEv2 supports multiple authentication mechanisms like public
    key\nsignatures, shared secrets and EAP.  EAP based authentication\nrequires server
    to maintain information about the client until EAP\ncompletes.  Public key based
    authentication mechanisms are highly\ncomputational intensive and demands server
    CPU resources.\n\nRedirect Mechanism for IKEv2 proposes a mechanism for IKEv2
    that\nenables a VPN gateway to redirect the VPN client to another VPN\ngateway,
    for example, based on the load condition.\n\nIKEv2 Session Resumption proposes
    an extension to IKEv2 that allows a\nclient to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway
    in a highly efficient\nmanner, utilizing a previously established IKE SA.\n\nRedirect
    mechanism can also be used to redirect a client to another\nrouter (trust anchor)
    to do mutual authentication and an optional\nproxy session negotiation on behalf
    of the server.  This redirection\nhappens during the IKE_SA_INIT and server does
    not maintain any\ninformation about the redirected client.  After mutual authentication\nand
    optional proxy session negotiation trust anchor redirects the\nclient back to
    the server with an Access Token which can be used as a\ndynamic pre-shared key
    between the server and client for password\nbased IKE_AUTH exchange.  Mechanism
    described here allows servers to\ncompute the same pre-shared key dynamically,
    without contacting trust\nanchors, based on the information provided by the client
    during\nIKE_AUTH exchange.  Access Token based authentication permits IDr of\nthe
    responder to be different from that specified in Ticket and\npermits client to
    reuse the proxy session (negotiated between client\nand trust anchor) between
    client and server.\n\nSuch a mechanism is useful especially for low power devices
    like\nhandsets.  For example, a mobile node can redirect a correspondent\nnode
    to its home agent.  Home agent can form a proxy session with\ncorrespondent node
    and then redirect it back to mobile node.\n\nStatus of this Memo\nThis Internet-Draft
