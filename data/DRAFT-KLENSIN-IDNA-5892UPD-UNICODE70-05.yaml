abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current version of the IDNA specifications anticipated
    that each\n   new version of Unicode would be reviewed to verify that no changes\n
    \  had been introduced that required adjustments to the set of rules\n   and,
    in particular, whether new exceptions or backward compatibility\n   adjustments
    were needed.  The review for Unicode 7.0.0 first\n   identified a potentially
    problematic new code point and then a much\n   more general and difficult issue
    with Unicode normalization.  This\n   specification discusses those issues and
    proposes updates to IDNA\n   and, potentially, the way the IETF handles comparison
    of identifiers\n   more generally, especially when there is no associated language
    or\n   language identification.  It also applies an editorial clarification\n
    \  to RFC 5892 that was the subject of an earlier erratum and updates\n   RFC
    5894 to point to the issues involved.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
