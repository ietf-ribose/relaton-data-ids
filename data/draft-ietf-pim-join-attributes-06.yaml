abstract:
- content: <p>A "Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode" Join message sent by
    a given node identifies one or more multicast distribution trees that that node
    wishes to join. Each tree is identified by the combination of a multicast group
    address and a source address (where the source address is possibly a "wild card").
    Under certain conditions it can be useful, when joining a tree, to specify additional
    information related to the construction of the tree. However, there has been no
    way to do so until now. This document describes a modification of the Join message
    that allows a node to associate attributes with a particular tree. The attributes
    are encoded in Type-Length-Value format. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
