abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes TCP/IP field behavior in the context of header
    compression. Header compression is possible thanks to the fact that most header
    fields do not vary randomly from packet to packet. Many of the fields exhibit
    static behavior or change in a more or less predictable way. When designing a
    header compression scheme, it is of fundamental importance to understand the behavior
    of the fields in detail.</p>"
