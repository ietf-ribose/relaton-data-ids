abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes and extension of the port range assignment\nmechanisms
    used for the IPv4 address sharing framework (SHARA) that\nis based on port range
    routing.  The extension provides means for\ndynamically changes port range assignments
    by allowing clients to\nsmoothly migrate to a new port range before releasing
    the range that\nis currently in use.  This way, the number of ports per client
    can be\nadjusted to actual usage patterns.\n\t </p>\n      "
