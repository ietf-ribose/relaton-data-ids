abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traffic traversing an SR domain is encapsulated in an outer
    IPv6\n   header for its journey through the SR domain.\n\n   To implement transport
    services strictly within the SR domain, the SR\n   domain may require insertion
    or deletion of an SRH after the outer\n   IPv6 header of the SR domain.  Any segment
    within the SRH is strictly\n   contained within the SR domain.\n\n   This document
    extends SRv6 Network Programming [RFC8986] with new SR\n   endpoint and transit
    behaviors to be performed only within the SR\n   domain in any packet owned by
    the domain.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
