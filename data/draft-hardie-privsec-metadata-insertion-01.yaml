abstract:
- content: "<p>The IAB has published [RFC7624] in response to several revelations
    of pervasive attack on Internet communications. In this document we consider the
    implications of protocol designs which associate metadata with encrypted flows.
    In particular, we assert that designs which do so by explicit actions of the end
    system are preferable to designs in which middleboxes insert them.</p>"
