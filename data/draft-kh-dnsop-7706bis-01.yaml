abstract:
- content: "<p>Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip times
    to the closest DNS root server. Some DNS recursive resolver operators want to
    prevent snooping of requests sent to DNS root servers by third parties. Such resolvers
    can greatly decrease the round-trip time and prevent observation of requests by
    running a copy of the full root zone on the same server, such as on a loopback
    address. This document shows how to start and maintain such a copy of the root
    zone that does not pose a threat to other users of the DNS, at the cost of adding
    some operational fragility for the operator. This draft will update RFC 7706.
    See Section 1.1 for a list of topics that will be added in the update. [ Ed note:
    Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background information, answers
    to freqently asked questions, general musings, etc. They will be removed before
    publication.] [ This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-kh-dnsop-7706bis.
    The most recent version of the document, open issues, and so on should all be
    available there. The authors gratefully accept pull requests. ]</p>"
