abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an experimental method to extend the
    limited\n   space for control options in every segment of a TCP connection.  It\n
    \  can use a dual handshake so that, from the very first SYN segment,\n   extra
    option space can immediately start to be used optimistically.\n   At the same
    time a dual handshake prevents a legacy server from\n   getting confused and sending
    the control options to the application\n   as user-data.  The dual handshake is
    only one strategy - a single\n   handshake will usually suffice once deployment
    has got started.  The\n   protocol is designed to traverse most known middleboxes
    including\n   connection splitters, because it sits wholly within the TCP Data.
    \ It\n   also provides reliable ordered delivery for control options.\n   Therefore,
    it should allow new TCP options to be introduced i) with\n   minimal middlebox
    traversal problems; ii) with incremental deployment\n   from legacy servers; iii)
    without an extra round of handshaking delay\n   iv) without having to provide
    its own loss recovery and ordering\n   mechanism and v) without arbitrary limits
    on available space.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
