abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to resolve the problem of IP address shortage Internet society
    try hard and use or intend to use some technologies such as NAT/NAPT, IPv6. But
    the shortcoming or difficult deployment make it progress slowly. Here provides
    an extensible IP network realization method to exist IP version 4. Two-level extensible
    IP network architecture is adopted which includes public IP address domain and
    private IP address domain. With the position denotation of source IP node and
    destination IP node, IP datagram can progress through the whole extensible IP
    network freely using the source route based method.</p>"
