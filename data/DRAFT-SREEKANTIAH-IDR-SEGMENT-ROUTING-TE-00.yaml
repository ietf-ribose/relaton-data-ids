abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes mechanisms allowing advertising Segment\n
    \  Routing Traffic Engineering (SRTE) policies using BGP.  Through the\n   mechanisms
    described in this document, a BGP speaker has the ability\n   to trigger, in a
    remote BGP node, the setup of a SR Encapsulation\n   policy with specific characteristics
    and an explicit path.  Steering\n   mechanisms are also defined to enable the
    application of the policy\n   on a per BGP route basis.\n\t </p>\n      "
