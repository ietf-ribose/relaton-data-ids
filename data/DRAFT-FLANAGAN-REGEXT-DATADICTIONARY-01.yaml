abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multiple applications related to the domain name system are
    built\n   around a list of data elements.  There is currently no unified public\n
    \  list of these data elements, nor is there an organized and\n   independent
    change control process.  This document codifies the\n   multiple similar but not
    quite identical lists of data elements into\n   a neutral DNS Data Dictionary
    to be maintained as an independent IANA\n   Registry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
