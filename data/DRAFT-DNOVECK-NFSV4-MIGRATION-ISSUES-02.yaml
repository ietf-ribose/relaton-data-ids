abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The migration feature of NFSv4 provides for moving responsibility
    for\n   a single filesystem from one server to another, without disruption to\n
    \  clients.  Recent implementation experience has shown problems in the\n   existing
    specification for this feature.  This document discusses the\n   issues which
    have arisen and explores the options available for\n   curing the issues via clarification
    and correction of the NFSv4.0\n   specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
