abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining
    BGP path information. BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP Route Monitoring
    (RM) messages. This document proposes an extension to BMP to convey additional
    path information that is not already encapsulated in the BGP Update PDU, e.g.,
    BPG path status. This extension makes use of the TLV mechanims described in draft-grow-bmp-
    tlv [I-D.grow-bmp-tlv].</p>"
