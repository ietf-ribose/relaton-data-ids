abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Being the widely used transport protocol in Internet, TCP might
    be \ninfluenced by the congestion occurred in those nodes (i.e., routers, \nIP/ATM
    access nodes, and ATM switches) along the travelling path. Since \nTCP relies
    on the end-to-end window-based mechanism to explain the \ncongestion, there is
    limited room for intermediate network elements to \nexplicitly contribute to the
    TCP control. However, in huge pipe networks, TCP might be ineffective because
    it starts decreasing its rate just after it senses packet's loss, implying that
    the network has already been congested somewhere. A general mechanism of delaying
    ACKs in congested nodes is presented in this draft to connect the traffic \ncontrol
    of TCP with that of network elements. This mechanism can be \nconsidered as an
    enhancement to the currently prevalent TCP and referred \nto Fast-TCP. The basic
    idea of Fast-TCP arises from the fact that \ncontrolling ACK flows can indirectly
    affect the dynamics of TCP's \nbehavior. ACK delay mechanism can be easily implemented
    in various \nnetwork nodes where information of link utilization or buffer occupancy
    \nmay be employed to notify the congestion. By using ACK delay policy at \nIP
    routers in a complex network, we present the simulation results to \nshow that
    this policy achieves good TCP throughput and reduces the \nbuffer requirement.\n\t
