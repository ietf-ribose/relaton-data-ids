abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Auto-Configuration in Virtual Aggregation as specified in\n
    \  [I-D.ietf-grow-va-auto] requires configuration of a \"VP-range list\"\n   in
    ASBRs connected to transit and peer ISPs.  These ASBRs simply tag\n   some routes
    whose prefix falls within the VP-Range with a \"can-\n   suppress\" tag to indicate
    whether these routes should be FIB\n   installed.  This draft specified an extended
    auto-configuration\n   mechanism in Virtual Aggregation to support the configuration
    of both\n   \"VP-List\" and \"popular prefixes\".  Specifically, based on this\n
    \  mechanism, the ratio of lost packets when VP routes fail could be\n   minimized.\n\t
