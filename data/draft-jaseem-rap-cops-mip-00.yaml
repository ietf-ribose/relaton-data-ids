abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP is a protocol that is used to achieve transparent routing
    of IP packets to a mobile node. A mobile node obtains a care-of- address in the
    foreign network and registers that address with the home agent. The home agent
    as well as the foreign agent can apply policies to the mobile node registration.
    This draft defines COPS [1] usage for Mobile IPv4 [2]. It describes how COPS is
    used to control Mobile IP registration based on policies. It defines the interactions
    between the PEP and the PDP to handle Mobile IP registration messages. It also
    provides a guideline for mobility agents on how to use this COPS client with regards
    to the registration messages.</p>"
