abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the problem statement and use cases
    of an\n   interface named Application Intelligent Policy Interface (AIPI) that\n
    \  translates the real application requirements (e.g., network should\n   ensure
    how many users of the OTT provider watch high definition video\n   simultaneously.)
    into network level requirements, e.g.,\n   configurations or service deployments
    requirements and network QoS\n   requirements, are useful and necessary for modern
    networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
