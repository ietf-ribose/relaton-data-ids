abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks, network performance data such as packet
    loss,\n   delay and delay variation (jitter) as well as bandwidth usage is a\n
    \  critical measure for Traffic Engineering (TE).  This data provides\n   operators
    the characteristics of their networks for performance\n   evaluation that is required
    to ensure the Service Level Agreements\n   (SLAs).  Performance Measurement (PM)
    mechanisms can be employed to\n   monitor these metrics for TE Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs) in real-\n   time.  This document describes Path Computation Element
    Protocol\n   (PCEP) extensions for reporting such performance measurements to
    an\n   Active Stateful PCE.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
