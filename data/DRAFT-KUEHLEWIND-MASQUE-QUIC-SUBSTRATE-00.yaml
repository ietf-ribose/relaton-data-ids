abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In situations where direct connectivity is not available or
    desired,\n   proxies in the network are used to forward and potentially translate\n
    \  traffic.  TCP is often used as a proxying or tunneling protocol.\n   QUIC is
    a new, emerging transport protocol and there is a similar\n   expectation that
    it too will be used as a substrate once it is widely\n   deployed.  Using QUIC
    instead of TCP in existing scenarios will allow\n   proxying and tunneling services
    to maintain the benefits of QUIC\n   natively, without degrading the performance
    and security\n   characteristics.  QUIC also opens up new opportunities for these\n
    \  services to have lower latency and better multistreaming support.\n   This
    document summarizes current and future usage scenarios to derive\n   requirements
    for QUIC as a substrate and to provide additional\n   considerations for proxy
    signaling and control protocol as proposed\n   by MASQUE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
