- content: "<p>This document attempts the case for new work that needs to be developed
    for 5G users to improve faster download and upload of the user's data in a scenario
    of dual-connectivity 3GPP access outlining the poor radio coverage issues. This
    document also outlines the faster user data mechanism accompanying 3GPP access
    of 5G user device via bearer offloading in case of a poor coverage.</p>"
