abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This draft explores a way SIP can be extended to allow a
    new dialog\n   directly between the endpoints to replace an initial dialog that
    had\n   one or more proxies in the signalling path.  This technique relies on\n
    \  ICE to perform hole punching that allows a direct connection to be\n   used
    in deployments where a sip-outbound proxy or SBC is used to\n   establish SIP
    connections across NAT or firewall boundaries.  It can\n   also be used to replace
    such a dialog with a secure connection\n   directly between the endpoints.  This
    technique can be applied to\n   traditional proxy-based SIP routing as well as
    to emerging P2PSIP\n   deployments that lack centrally located proxies.\n\n   This
    draft describes early work that evolved from ideas initially\n   developed for
    P2PSIP that are no longer being pursued.  We are\n   interested in feedback on
    whether there is broader interest in these\n   techniques.\n\t </p>\n      "
