abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new function for the Generic Security Service
    Application Program Interface (GSS-API), which allows applications to store delegated
    (and other) credentials in the implicit GSS-API credential store. This is needed
    for GSS-API applications to use delegated credentials as they would use other
    credentials. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
