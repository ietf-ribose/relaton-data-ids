abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The document \"FIB Suppression with Virtual Aggregation\"\n[I-D.francis-intra-va]
    describes how router FIB size may be reduced.\nThis approach entails a trade-off
    between path-length and load versus\nFIB size.  It also has the potential to reduce
    convergence time.\nThis document describes the results of several studies that
    examine\nthese characteristics.  The results of a study for a Tier-1 ISP with\na
    relatively sophisticated deployment of VA, shows that FIB size\ncould be reduced
    ten times or more with a worst-case latency penalty\nof 4ms and a worst-case load
    increase of &lt;1.5%.  Another study,\nexamining a much simpler style of VA deployment,
    also for a Tier-1\nISP, shows that FIB size can be reduced by four times (in routers\nserving
    as APRs), and more than 10 times in other routers.  Here,\nworst-case latency
    increase was 16 ms, though this is almost\ncertainly an over-estimate, both because
    traceroute was used to make\nthe measurement, and because popular prefixes were
    not considered.\n\t </p>\n      "
