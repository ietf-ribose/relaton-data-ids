abstract:
- content: "<p>According to the current Mobile IPv6 specification, a mobile node may
    have several Care-of Addresses, but only one, termed the primary Care-of Address,
    can be registered with its home agent and the correspondent nodes. However, for
    matters of cost, bandwidth, delay, etc, it is useful for the mobile node to get
    Internet access through multiple access media simultaneously, in which case multiple
    active IPv6 Care-of Addresses would be assigned to the mobile node. We thus propose
    Mobile IPv6 extensions designed to register multiple Care-of Addresses bound to
    a single Home Address instead of the sole primary Care-of Address. For doing so,
    a new identification number must be carried in each binding for the receiver to
    distinguish between the bindings corresponding to the same Home Address. Those
    extensions are targeted to NEMO (Network Mobility) Basic Support as well as to
    Mobile IPv6.</p>"
