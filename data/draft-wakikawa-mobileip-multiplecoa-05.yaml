abstract:
  content: "\t <t>According to the current Mobile IPv6 specification, a mobile node
    mayhave several Care-of Addresses, but only one, termed the primaryCare-of Address,
    can be registered with its home agent and thecorrespondent nodes. However, for
    matters of cost, bandwidth, delay,etc, it is useful for the mobile node to get
    Internet access throughmultiple access media simultaneously, in which case multiple
    activeIPv6 Care-of Addresses would be assigned to the mobile node. We thuspropose
    Mobile IPv6 extensions designed to register multiple Care-ofAddresses bound to
    a single Home Address instead of the sole primaryCare-of Address. For doing so,
    a new identification number must becarried in each binding for the receiver to
    distinguish between thebindings corresponding to the same Home Address. Those
    extensionsare targeted to NEMO (Network Mobility) Basic Support as well as toMobile
    IPv6.</p>"
