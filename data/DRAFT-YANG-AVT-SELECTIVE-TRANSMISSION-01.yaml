abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When network congestion occurs or dynamic transient burst stream\ntransfers
    on a bandwidth constrained network, it is easy to cause\nbursts of consecutive
    packet loss.  Video streams are very vulnerable\nto packet loss because of motion
    compensation predictive coding at\nthe decoder.  In this document, we describe
    a method of using\nselective transmission to decrease the effect of random drop
    to video\nstream when necessary.  At the same time, this document describes a\nmethod
    to avoid retransmission request due to selective transmission.\n\t </p>\n      "
