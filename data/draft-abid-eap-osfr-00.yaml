abstract:
- content: "<p>In a public WLAN hotspot, we need to have an easy and secure way to
    authenticate users. We have to find also mobility solutions, given by providers,
    to perform well the roaming. A roaming mobile terminal MT may be within radio
    range of more than one access point AP. Therefore, we need to make an intelligent
    network selection decision after receiving some roaming information. Currently,
    the information is typically provisioned on the MTs as static roaming tables.
    But, this approach is not scalable when there is a large number of access points.
    In this draft, we propose our solution called OSFR, Optimized Network Selection
    for Fast Roaming to improve association speed and scalability.</p>"
