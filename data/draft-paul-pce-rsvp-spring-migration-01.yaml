abstract:
- content: "<p>In a SDN environment, path computation element protocol(PCEP) (RFC
    5440) is used between a controller and the network devices, using which controller
    can setup and tear down Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) based label switched
    paths(LSPs) in the network having Path Computation Client (PCC) as Label Switched
    Router (LSR). Draft draft-sivabalan-pce-segment-routing extends PCEP specification
    in order to support setup and teardown of Segment Routing(SR) Label Switched Path(LSR).
    In a mixed environment where some of the LSPs are setup using PCEP use RSVP and
    some LSPs are based on Segment routing(SR). The specifications lacks a method
    to advertise the LSP preferenace to use one type of LSP over other when those
    are setup using PCEP. This draft defines a method to advertise the preference
    for any LSP which is setup using PCEP. This document proposes new optional TLV
    that can be used to announce the preference of LSP which is being setup using
    PCEP.</p>"
