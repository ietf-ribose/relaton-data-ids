abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture for
    unicast\n   traffic has been proposed to cope with the use cases in traffic\n
    \  engineering, fast re-reroute, service chain, etc.  It can leverage\n   existing
    MPLS dataplane without any modification.  In fact, the label\n   stack capability
    in MPLS would have been utilized well to implement\n   flexible path programming
    to satisfy all kinds of requirements of\n   service bearing.  But in the distributed
    environment, the flexible\n   programming capability is difficult to implement
    and always confined\n   to reachability.  As the introducing of central control
    in the\n   network, the flexible MPLS programming capability becomes possible\n
    \  owing to two factors: 1.  It becomes easier to allocate label for\n   more
    purposes than reachability; 2.  It is easy to calculate the MPLS\n   path in a
    global network view.  Moreover, the MPLS path programming\n   capability can be
    utilized to satify more requirements of service\n   bearing in the service layer
    which is defined as service-oriented\n   MPLS path programming.  This document
    defines the concept of MPLS\n   path programming, then proposes use cases, architecture
    and protocol\n   extension requirements in the service layer for the Source Packet\n
    \  Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
