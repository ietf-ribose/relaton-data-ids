abstract:
- content: "<p>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
    is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating organization can express domain-level
    policies and preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting, that
    a mail-receiving organization can use to improve mail handling. DMARC policies
    can be applied to individual domains or to all domains within an organization.
    The design of DMARC precludes grouping policies for domains based on policy published
    above the organizational level, such as TLDs (Top Level Domains). Domains at this
    higher level of the DNS tree (but not necessarily at the top of the DNS tree)
    can be collectively referred to as Public Suffix Domains (PSDs). This document
    describes an extension to DMARC to enable DMARC functionality PSDs.</p>"
