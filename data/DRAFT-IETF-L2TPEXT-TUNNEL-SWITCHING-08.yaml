abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>PPP [7] over L2TP Tunnel Switching, also called L2TP Multihop,
    is the \n   process of forwarding PPP payload from an L2TP session to another
    \n   L2TP session over a different tunnel.  It facilitates moving the \n   logical
    termination point of an L2TP session, based on layer 2 \n   characteristics or
    administrative policies, to different L2tp \n   Endpoint.  This document introduces
    the L2TP tunnel switching \n   nomenclature and defines the behavior of standard
    AVPs in tunnel \n   switching deployment.  The scope of this document is limited
    to the \n   discussion of switching PPP frames over L2TPv2 or L2TPv3 tunnels.\n\t
