abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The primary state variables used by all TCP congestion control\n
    \  algorithms, cwnd and ssthresh, are heavily overloaded, carrying\n   different
    semantics in different states.  This leads to excess\n   implementation complexity
    and poorly defined behaviors under some\n   combinations of events, such as application
    stalls during loss\n   recovery.  We propose a new framework for TCP congestion
    control, and\n   to recast current standard algorithms to use new state variables.\n
    \  This new framework will not generally change the behavior of any of\n   the
    primary congestion control algorithms when they are invoked in\n   isolation.
    \ It will permit new algorithms with better behaviors in\n   many corner cases,
    such as when two distinct primary algorithms are\n   invoked concurrently.  It
    will also foster the creation of new\n   algorithms to address some events that
    are poorly treated by today's\n   standards.  For the vast majority of traditional
    algorithms the\n   transformation to the new state variables is completely\n   straightforward.
    \ However, the resulting implementation is likely to\n   technically be in violation
    of existing TCP standards, even if it is\n   fully compliant with their principles
    and intent.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
