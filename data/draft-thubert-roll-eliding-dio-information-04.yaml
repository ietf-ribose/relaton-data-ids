abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a method to safely elide a group of RPL options
    in a DIO message by synchronizing the state associated with each of these options
    between parent and child using a new sequence counter in DIO messages. A child
    that missed a DIO message with an update of any of those protected options detects
    it by the change of sequence counter and queries the update with a DIS Message.
    The draft also provides a method to fully elide the options in a DAO message.</p>"
