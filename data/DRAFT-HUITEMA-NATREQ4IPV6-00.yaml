abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>During the next few years, as the Ipv4 address space moves toward
    \nexhaustion, it is likely that the deployment of NAT will accelerate. \nBy 2005,
    millions of NAT devices will likely be deployed on the \nInternet, both within
    enterprises and consumer households. Should \nthose NAT devices not support either
    native Ipv6, or IPv6 transition \nmechanisms such as 6 to 4, the result would
    be significant delays in \nthe deployment of IPv6. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
