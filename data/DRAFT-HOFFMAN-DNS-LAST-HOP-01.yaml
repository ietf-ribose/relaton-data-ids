abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>DNS queries from one resolver to an upstream resolver are often
    run\nover connections with no protection of any kind.  The stub resolvers\nthat
    initiate queries for an application are ofte called \"last-hop\",\nand their queries
    go to trusted recursive resolvers.  The connection\nbetween last-hop resolvers
    and their upstream resolver is currently\nsusceptible to both malicious and unintentional
    alteration that\nprevents the querying resolver from being sure that the results
    it\nreceives are valid.  Some middleboxes can prevent a stub resolver,\neven one
    that does DNSSEC validation, from getting enough information\nto validate a response.
    \ Further, a non-validating stub resolver is\nsusceptible to active attacks in
    which the results are purposely\naltered.\n\nThe protocol described in this document
    provides a method to avoid\nthese problems and thus make resolution significantly
    more secure.\nThis protocol can be used between any two DNS resolvers, but the\nfocus
    of this document is on last-hop resolvers.\n\t </p>\n      "
