abstract:
- content: <p>This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTP Control Protocol
    (RTCP) with a new RTCP Extended Reports (XR) (RFC3611) block type to report new
    metrics regarding media transmission or reception quality, following RTCP guideline
    established in RFC5968. This memo suggests that a new block should contain a single
    metric or a small number of metrics relevant to a single parameter of interest
    or concern, rather than containing a number of metrics which attempt to provide
    full coverage of all those parameters of concern to a specific application. Applications
    may then "mix and match" to create a set of blocks which covers their set of concerns.
    Where possible, a specific block should be designed to be re-usable across more
    than one application, for example, for all of voice, streaming audio and video.</p>
