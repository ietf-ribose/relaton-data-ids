abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an architecture for BIER-TE: Traffic Engineering
    for Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER). BIER-TE shares part of its architecture
    with BIER as described in [RFC8279]. It also proposes to share the packet format
    with BIER. BIER-TE forwards and replicates packets like BIER based on a BitString
    in the packet header but it does not require an IGP. It does support traffic engineering
    by explicit hop-by-hop forwarding and loose hop forwarding of packets. It does
    support Fast ReRoute (FRR) for link and node protection and incremental deployment.
    Because BIER-TE like BIER operates without explicit in-network tree- building
    but also supports traffic engineering, it is more similar to SR than RSVP-TE.</p>"
