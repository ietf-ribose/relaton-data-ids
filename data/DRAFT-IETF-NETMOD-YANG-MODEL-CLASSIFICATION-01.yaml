abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The YANG [RFC6020] data modeling language is currently being\n
    \  considered for a wide variety of applications throughout the\n   networking
    industry at large.  Many standards-defining organizations\n   (SDOs), open source
    software projects, vendors and users are using\n   YANG to develop and publish
    models of configuration, state data and\n   operations for a wide variety of applications.
    \ At the same time,\n   there is currently no well-known terminology to categorize
    various\n   types of YANG models.\n\n   A consistent terminology would help with
    the categorization of\n   models, assist in the analysis the YANG data modeling
    efforts in the\n   IETF and other organizations, and bring clarity to the YANG-related\n
    \  discussions between the different groups.\n\n   This document describes a set
    of concepts and associated terms to\n   support consistent classification of YANG
    models.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
