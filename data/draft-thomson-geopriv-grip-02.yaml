abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a means of acquiring Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) assistance data using HTTP. Assistance data aids GNSS receivers
    in acquiring and measuring satellite signals, as well as being useful in calculating
    positions. The GNSS Reference Information Protocol (GRIP) provides a framework
    for discovering resources capable of providing any kind of location-based assistance
    data.</p>"
