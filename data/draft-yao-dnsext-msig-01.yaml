  content: "\t <t>DNSSEC is trying to be deployed everywhere. Many are afraid ofDNSSEC
    deployment, which are too heavy to be deployed. There is ahuge gap between the
    resources we need to deploy DNSSEC and thebenefits or security we can get from
    the DNSSEC. This documentproposes a lightweight DNSSEC mechanism to make the DNSSEC
    to bedeployed easily while getting the similar security with the heavyDNSSEC.</p>"
