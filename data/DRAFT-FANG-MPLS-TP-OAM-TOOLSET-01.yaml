abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides an overview of the MPLS-TP OAM toolset,
    \n   which consists of MPLS-TP fault management and performance \n   monitoring.
    This overview includes a brief recap of MPLS-TP OAM \n   requirements and functions,
    and of the generic mechanisms created \n   in the MPLS data plane to support in-band
    OAM. The importance of \n   using IANA assigned code point under G-Ach when supporting
    MPLS-TP \n   OAM is also discussed. The protocol definitions for each individual
    \n   MPLS-TP OAM tool are specified in separate RFCs or Working Group \n   documents
    which are referenced by this document. \n\t </p>\n      "
