abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document considers a VPN End User establishing an IPsec
    SA with\n   a Security Gateway using the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version
    2\n   (IKEv2), where at least one of the peers has multiple interfaces or\n   where
    Security Gateway is a cluster with each node having its own IP\n   address.\n\n
    \  The protocol described allows a peer to clone an IKEv2 SA, where an\n   additional
    SA is derived from an existing one.  The newly created IKE\n   SA is set without
    the IKEv2 authentication exchange.  This IKE SA can\n   later be assigned to another
    interface or moved to another cluster\n   node.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
