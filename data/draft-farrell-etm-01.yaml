abstract:
- content: <p>We argue that an expanded threat model is needed for Internet protocol
    development as protocol endpoints can no longer be considered to be generally
    trustworthy for any general definition of "trustworthy." This draft will be a
    submission to the DEDR IAB workshop.</p>
