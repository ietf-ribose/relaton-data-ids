abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft provides the Path Computation Element communication\n
    \  Protocol (PCEP) extensions for the support of Routing and Wavelength\n   Assignment
    (RWA) in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON).\n   Lightpath provisioning
    in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength\n   assignment (RWA) process.  From
    a path computation perspective,\n   wavelength assignment is the process of determining
    which wavelength\n   can be used on each hop of a path and forms an additional
    routing\n   constraint to optical light path computation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
