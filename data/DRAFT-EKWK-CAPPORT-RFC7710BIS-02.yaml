abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet
    access\n   (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a\n
    \  captive portal mode.  This highly restricts what the customer can do\n   until
    the customer has authenticated.\n\n   This document describes a DHCP option (and
    a Router Advertisement\n   (RA) extension) to inform clients that they are behind
    some sort of\n   captive-portal device, and that they will need to authenticate
    to get\n   Internet access.  It is not a full solution to address all of the\n
    \  issues that clients may have with captive portals; it is designed to\n   be
    used in larger solutions.  The method of authenticating to, and\n   interacting
    with the captive portal is out of scope of this document.\n\n   [ This document
    is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/wkumari/draft-ekwk-capport-rfc7710bis.
    \ The most\n   recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be\n
    \  available here.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.  Text\n   in
    square brackets will be removed before publication. ]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
