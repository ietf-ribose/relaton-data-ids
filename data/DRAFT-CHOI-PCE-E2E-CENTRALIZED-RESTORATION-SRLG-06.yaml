abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes the concept of the Shared Link Risk Group
    \n   (SRLG) based logical ring configuration and recovery method using \n   ring
    SRLG for the purpose of PCE-based backup path computation.  \n   In this restoration
    architecture, backup paths can be easily \n   established through the end-to-end
    path which follows from the \n   logical ring configuration. It guarantees the
    establishment of \n   backup path disjoint from the working path at all levels.
    To take \n   advantage of bandwidth considerations and fast restoration \n   mechanisms,
    a centralized Controller is used to provide \n   dedicated protection to Optical
    Transport Networks using the \n   SRLG concept.\n\t </p>\n      "
