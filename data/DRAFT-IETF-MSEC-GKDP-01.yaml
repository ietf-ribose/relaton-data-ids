abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a group key distribution protocol (GKDP)\n
    \  based on IKEv2, the IPsec key management protocol; the new protocol\n   is
    similar to IKEv2 in message and payload formats, and message\n   semantics to
    a large extent.  The protocol in conformance with MSEC\n   key management architecture
    contains two components: member\n   registration and group rekeying, and downloads
    a group security\n   association from the GCKS to a member.  This protocol is
    independent\n   of IKEv2 except in its likeness.\n\t </p>\n      "
