abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Announcements in the past decade of better-than-expected collision\n
    \  attacks in popular hash algorithms have caused some people to\n   question
    whether common Internet protocols need to be changed, and if\n   so, how.  This
    document summarizes the use of hashes in many\n   protocols, discusses how the
    collision attacks affect and do not\n   affect the protocols, shows how to thwart
    known attacks on digital\n   certificates, and discusses future directions for
    protocol designers.\n   It also gives rationales for moving away from some hash
    algorithms\n   altogether and for choosing when to start using newer, presumably\n
    \  better, hash algorithms in Internet protocols.\n\n   This document obsoletes
    RFC 4270 and introduces significant new\n   material that has been learned since
    the publication of that\n   document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
