abstract:
  content: <p>This document attempts to describe a set of issues that arises fromthe
    desire to treat a set or group of names as "aliases" of eachother, "bundled,"
    "variants," or "the same," which is problematic interms of corresponding behavior
    for DNS labels and FQDNs.With the emergence of internationalized domain names,
    among otherpotential use cases, two or more names that users will regard ashaving
    identical meaning may sometimes require corresponding behaviorin the underlying
    infrastructure, possibly in the DNS itself. It'snot clear how to accommodate this
    required behavior of such names inDNS resolution; in particular, it's not clear
    when they are bestaccommodated in registry practices for generating names for
    lookup inthe DNS, existing DNS protocol elements and behavior, existingapplication-layer
    mechanisms and practices, or some set of protocolelements or behavior not yet
    defined. This document attempts todescribe some of these cases and the behavior
    of some of the possiblesolutions discussed to date.</p>
