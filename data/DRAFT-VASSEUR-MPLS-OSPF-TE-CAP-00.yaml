abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes OSPF traffic engineering capability TLVs.
    Two \ncapability TLVs are defined in the current draft: the Path \nComputation
    Server Discovery (PCSD) TLV that allows a router to \nannounce its Path Computation
    Server capability to other LSRs within \nan OSPF area or a routing domain and
    the Mesh-group TLV used by an \nLSR to indicate its desire to participate to a
    mesh of Traffic \nEngineering Label Switched Path (this mesh of TE LSPs is identified
    \nby a mesh-group number). They are both used in the context of MPLS \nTraffic
    Engineering. Additional OSPF TE capability TLVs may be added \nin further revision
    of this draft. Those OSPF TE capability TLVs \nwill be carried within the OSPF
    router information LSA (opaque type \nof 4, opaque ID of 0) defined in [18]. \n\t
