abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the procedures a client can follow
    to assess\n   the trust on an external NSF platform and its client-defined\n   configuration
    through the I2NSF Security Controller.  The procedure\n   to assess trustworthiness
    is based on a remote attestation of the\n   platform and the NSFs running on it
    performed through a Trusted\n   Platform Module (TPM) invoked by the Security
    Controller.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
