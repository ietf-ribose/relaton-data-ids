abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>An Open Network Handle System (ONHS) provides an intermediate
    level\nof service between IP numbers and domain names. A handle adheres\npermanently
    to an owner, who may assign and reassign it to dif-\nferent addresses at will.
    But a handle is a number, carrying no\nsignificance in natural language. Any user
    desiring a handle may\ngenerate one from a public key. This memo describes a simple
    imple-\nmentation of an Open Network Handle System using the security\nextensions
    to the Domain Name System (DNSSEC).\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
