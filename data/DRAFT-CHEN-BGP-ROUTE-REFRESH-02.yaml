abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a new BGP capability termed 'Route Refresh\nCapability',
    which would allow the dynamic exchange of route refresh\nrequest between BGP speakers
    and subsequent re-advertisement of the\nrespective Adj-RIB-Out. One possible application
    of this capability\nis to facilitate non-disruptive routing policy changes.\n\t
