abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward
    Error\nCorrection (FEC) that is generated by the non-interleaved and\ninterleaved
    parity codes from a source media encapsulated in RTP.\nThese parity codes are
    systematic codes, where a number of repair\nsymbols are generated from a set of
    source symbols and sent in a\nrepair flow separate from the source flow that carries
    the source\nsymbols.  The non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes offer a\ngood
    protection against random and bursty packet losses,\nrespectively, at a cost of
    decent complexity.  The RTP payload\nformats that are defined in this document
    address the scalability\nissues experienced with the earlier specifications including
    RFC\n2733, RFC 5109 and SMPTE 2022-1, and offer several improvements.  Due\nto
    these changes, the new payload formats are not backward compatible\nwith the earlier
    specifications.\n\t </p>\n      "
