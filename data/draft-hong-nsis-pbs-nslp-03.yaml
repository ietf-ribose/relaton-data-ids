abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the NSIS Signaling Layer protocol (NSLP)
    fornetwork traffic authorization on the Internet, the Permission-BasedSending
    (PBS) NSLP. This NSLP aims to prevent Denial-of-Service(DoS) attacks and other
    forms of unauthorized traffic. PBS NSLP isbased on the proactive approach of explicitly
    granting permissionsand the reactive approach of monitoring and reacting against
    theattacks. Signaling installs and maintains the permission state ofrouters for
    a data flow. PBS NSLP uses two security mechanisms:message security in an end-to-end
    fashion and channel security in ahop-by-hop fashion. The message security is for
    protecting theintegrity of the message on end-to-end traffic and channel securityis
    for protecting the integrity and confidentiality between adjacentnodes. These
    security mechanisms enable the secure distribution ofshared keys, as well as protection
    of signaling messages. Toauthenticate data packets, the PBS NSLP requests a sender
    to use anexisting security protocol, the IPsec Authentication Header (AH).This
    allows routers to drop bogus packets by using an IP packetfilter. To avoid a compromised
    router that drops legitimate packets,the PBS NSLP triggers the sender to change
    the data flow path.Status of this MemoThis Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF
