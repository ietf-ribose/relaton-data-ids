abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For the ubiquitous and highly important Internet protocols
    (TCP, UDP,\n   IP), flows are conventionally identified by the \"5-tuple\" of
    source\n   and destination IP addresses, source and destination port, and\n   protocol
    type in an IP packet.  Information Centric Networking (ICN)\n   is a new paradigm
    where network communications are accomplished by\n   requesting named content,
    instead of sending packets to destination\n   addresses.  This document describes
    mechanisms allowing ICN\n   forwarders, consumers, producers and other ICN nodes
    to encode,\n   decode, and process equivalence class identifiers (flows) at any\n
    \  desired granularity of a routable name prefix and beyond the routable\n   name
    prefix.  This document is a product of the IRTF Information-\n   Centric Networking
    Research Group (ICNRG).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
