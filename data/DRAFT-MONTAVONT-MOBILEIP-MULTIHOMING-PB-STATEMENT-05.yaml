abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The use of multiple interfaces is foreseen to provide ubiquitous,
    \  \n   permanent and fault-tolerant access to the Internet, particularly on\n
    \  mobile nodes which are more prone to failure or sudden lack of\n   connectivity.
    \ However, Mobile IPv6 currently lacks support for such\n   multihomed nodes.
    \ Individual solutions have been proposed to extend\n   Mobile IPv6 but all issues
    have not been addressed in a single\n   document.  The purpose of the present
    document is thus to fill up\n   this gap and to raise the discussion in order
    to make sure that\n   forthcoming solutions will address all the issues.  In this
    document,\n   we propose a taxonomy to classify the situations where a mobile
    node\n   could be multihomed.  This taxonomy is then used to highlight the\n   issues
    preventing mobile nodes operating Mobile IPv6 to be\n   multihomed.\n\t </p>\n
