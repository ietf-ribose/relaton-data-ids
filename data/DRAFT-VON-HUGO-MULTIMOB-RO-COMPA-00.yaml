abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Multimob WG has defined a basic mobile multicast solution\nleveraging
    on network localized mobility management, i.e.  Proxy\nMobile IPv6 protocol.  The
    basic solution incorporates multicast\naware routers co-located with the mobility
    anchor and a proxy \nfunctionality for group management, i.e.  IGMP/MLD, at the
    access\ngateway.  Although such a basic solution solves the issue from an \noperational
    point of view, challenges with respect to optimization,\ne.g. efficient resource
    utilization, still remain.\n\nThis document attempts to evaluate proposed solutions
    for the\nchartered work item of \"PMIPv6 routing optimizations to avoid tunnel\nconvergence
    problem\". A corresponding deployment specific extension\nwould cover dynamic
    and/or automatic tunnel configuration and a\ndirect or local routing approach.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
