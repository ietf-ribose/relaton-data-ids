abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Resource sharing in a network means two or more Label Switched
    Paths\n   (LSPs) use common pieces of resource along their paths.  This can\n
    \  help save network resources and is useful in scenarios such as LSP\n   recovery
    or when two LSPs do not need to be active at the same time.\n   A Path Computation
    Element (PCE) is responsible for path computation\n   with such requirement.\n\n
    \  Existing extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)\n   allow
    one path computation request for an LSP to be associated with\n   other (existing)
    LSPs through the use of the PCEP Association Object.\n\n   This document extends
    PCEP in order to support resource-sharing-based\n   path computation as another
    use of the Association Object to enable\n   better efficiency in the computation
    and in the resultant paths and\n   network resource usage.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
