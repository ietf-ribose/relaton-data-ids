abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Common Operation and Management of network Slicing (COMS)
    intends\n   to provide a comprehensive approach for the overall operation and\n
    \  management of network slicing in the scope if IETF.  The system is\n   designed
    in a hierarchical and inter-operative manner.  COMS is\n   capable of recursive
    adaption in a hierarchical network management\n   system.  It is also independent
    of data plane technologies used in\n   different administrative domains.  Both
    network slice operator and\n   network slice tenant may benefit for COMS for the
    purpose of slice\n   management and maitenance.The purpose of this document is
    to discuss\n   the use cases of COMS in different views.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
