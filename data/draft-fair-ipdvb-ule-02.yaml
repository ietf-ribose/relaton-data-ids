abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPEG-2 TS has been widely accepted not only for providing digital
    TV services, but also as a subnetwork technology for building IP networks. This
    document describes an Ultra Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) mechanism for the
    transport of IPv4 and IPv6 Datagrams and other network protocol packets directly
    over ISO MPEG- 2 Transport Streams (TS) as TS Private Data.</p>"
