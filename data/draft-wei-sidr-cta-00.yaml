abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an enhanced certificate profile for trust anchors,
    in which the issuer field of the TA certificate is cryptographically generated.
    In the RPKI architecture, the trust anchor uses self-signed certificate. However,
    this sort of certificate is vulnerable to various attacks. For example, the attackers
    can easily create its own public-private key pair and declaims that the issuer
    field belongs to him. This means attackers can easily impersonate the trust anchor.
    To address it, this document adds identity based cryptographic technique to the
    self- signed certificate. Since the issuer field of the trust anchor's certificate
    is cryptographically generated from the trust anchor's public key, the attacker
    will not be able to create another key pair and declaim that the issuer field
    generated by the trust anchor belongs to him. Therefore, attackers can not impersonate
    the trust anchor.</p>"
