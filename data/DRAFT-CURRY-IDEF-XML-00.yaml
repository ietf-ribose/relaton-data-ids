abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of the Intrusion Detection Exchange Format (IDEF)
    is to\ndefine data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information\nof
    interest to intrusion detection and response systems, and to the\nmanagement systems
    which may need to interact with them.  The goals\nand requirements of the IDEF
    are described in [2].\nThis Internet-Draft describes a proposed implementation
    of the data\nformat component of the IDEF, using the Extensible Markup Language\n(XML)
    [3] to represent the class hierarchy defined by Debar and\nHuang [4].  The rationale
    for choosing XML is explained, a Document\nType Definition (DTD) is developed,
    and examples are provided.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
