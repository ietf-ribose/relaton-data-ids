abstract:
- content: "<p>The vision of a quantum internet is to fundamentally enhance Internet
    technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on Earth.
    To achieve this goal, a quantum network stack must be built from the ground up
    as the physical nature of the communication is fundamentally different. The first
    realisations of quantum networks are imminent, but there is no practical proposal
    for how to organise, utilise, and manage such networks. In this memo, we attempt
    lay down the framework and introduce some basic architectural principles for a
    quantum internet. This is intended for general guidance and general interest,
    but also to provide a foundation for discussion between physicists and network
    specialists.</p>"
