abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC6939 specifies a method for DHCPv6 relay agents to insert a Client
    Link Layer Address Option (CLLAO) in a DHCPv6 Relay-Forward message as informational
    material for the DHCPv6 server. The server in turn is not required to echo the
    CLLAO back in its replies. In some cases, however, the DHCPv6 client may be interested
    to receive the CLLAO, e.g., to determine if there are L2 devices (e.g., L2 proxies)
    that rewrite the link-layer address. This document discusses updates to RFC6939
    to allow the server to echo the CLLAO back to the client.</p>"
