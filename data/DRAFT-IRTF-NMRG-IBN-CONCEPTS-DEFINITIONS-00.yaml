abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Intent and Intent-Based Networking are taking the industry
    by storm.\n   At the same time, those terms are used loosely and often\n   inconsistently,
    in many cases overlapping and confused with other\n   concepts such as \"policy\".
    \ This document is intended to clarify the\n   concept of \"Intent\" and provide
    an overview of functionality that\n   associated with it.  The goal is to contribute
    towards a common and\n   shared understanding of terms, concepts, and functionality
    which can\n   be used as foundation to guide further definition of associated\n
    \  research and engineering problems and their solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
