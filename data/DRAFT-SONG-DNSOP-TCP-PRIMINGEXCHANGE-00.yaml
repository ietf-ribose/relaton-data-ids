abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS payload size limitation constrains operational and policy
    choice\n   for many years.  It is become increasingly notable in IPv6 transition\n
    \  and DNSSEC development, specifically during Priming Exchange process.\n   Given
    that the load of priming exchange on the root system is\n   relatively low, this
    memo proposes using TCP by default in Priming\n   Exchange between resolver and
    root server.  This approach is aiming\n   to treat Priming Exchange as a special
    process which brings a little\n   change to the current root system and provide
    solution to the long-\n   term problems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
