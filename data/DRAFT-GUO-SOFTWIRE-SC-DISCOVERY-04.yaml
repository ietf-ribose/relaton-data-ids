abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Several types of Carrier Grade NATs have been proposed to simplify
    \nIPv4/IPv6 transition of the edge network by integrating tunnels and \nNAT. A
    very common scenario is that many users set up softwires to a \nsoftwire concentrator
    for public or private access services. In order \nto establish softwires successfully,
    a new mechanism is required to \nenable users in the edge network to discover
    the information of the \nconcentrator. This document describes how a host or Customer
    Premises \nEquipment discovers the remote softwire concentrator or CGN in a hub
    \nand spoke network using DHCP. Based on two new Softwire Concentrator \nDiscovery
    DHCP Options, proposed in the document, a user can obtain \nthe information of
    the softwire concentrator or CGN and then set up a \ntunnel to it.\n\t </p>\n
