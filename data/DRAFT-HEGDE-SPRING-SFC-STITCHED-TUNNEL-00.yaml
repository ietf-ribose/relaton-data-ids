abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The term \"service function chaining\" is used to describe
    the\n   definition and instantiation of an ordered list of instances of such\n
    \  service functions, and the subsequent \"steering\" of traffic flows\n   through
    those service functions.This document describes transport\n   mechanisms that
    use stitched tunnels to achieve end-to-end service\n   chaining.  This document
    specifies two different types of transport\n   encodings, one based on SR-MPLS
    and another based on IP tunnels.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
