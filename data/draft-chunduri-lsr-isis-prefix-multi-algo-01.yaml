abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to Intermediate System to Intermediate
    System (IS-IS) protocol by adding an Algorithm support for prefixes advertised.
    This allows multiple independent algorithm usage for computing the reachability
    of nodes and prefixes as opposed to only one algorithm.</p>"
