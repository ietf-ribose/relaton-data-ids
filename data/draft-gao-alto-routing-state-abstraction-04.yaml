abstract:
- content: "<p>The path vector extension [I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector] has extended
    the original ALTO protocol [RFC7285] with the ability to represent not only end-to-end
    metrics but also information about shared link risk groups (SLRG). However, straw
    man algorithms to compute ALTO path vector can contain redundant information and
    result in unnecessary communication overhead. The situation gets even worse when
    certain ALTO extensions are enabled, for example, the incremental extension [I-D.ietf-alto-incr-update-sse]
    which continuously pushes data changes to ALTO clients. In this document, an algorithm
    is described which can effectively reduce the communication overhead while still
    containing the same information as in the original path vector. The algorithm
    is fully compatible with the path vector extension and has several by-products
    which can be leveraged by other extensions to achieve better performance.</p>"
