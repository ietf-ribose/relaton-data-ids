abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a management architecture suitable for deployment
    in the Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) architecture. The DTN environment is characterized
    by a lack of end-to-end connectivity and communications delays that are both long-lives
    and unpredictable. A DTN Management Architecture (DTNMA) is needed that can operate
    without human- or system-in-the-loop synchronous interactivity and without reliance
    on transport-layer sessions. Within a DTNMA, nodes must provide both eventual
    data exchange and in-time local protection. This can be accomplished with the
    use of autonomous and asynchronous configuration and reporting. Despite the significant
    challenges to data transport, nodes must exhibit behavior that is both determinable
    and autonomous while maintaining as much compatibility with non-challenged-network
    operations concepts as possible. The DTNMA is supported by two types of asynchronous
    behavior. First, the DTNMA does not presuppose any synchronized transport behavior
    between managed and managing devices. Second, the DTNMA does not support any query-response
    semantics. In this way, the DTNMA allows for operation in extremely challenging
    conditions, to include over uni-directional links and cases where delays/disruptions
    prevent operation over traditional transport layers.</p>"
