abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes an RFC 3933 [RFC3933] experiment for the
    IETF\nRFC publication process.  The experiment is limited in scope and\nduration.
    \ The specific experiment has been chosen because (a) it has\npotential to provide
    a significant process improvement, (b) it can be\nexecuted at a low cost, (c)
    it addresses a widely recognized problem\nin the IETF process, and (d) tool support
    can be (and has been) built\nfor it.  The experiment relates to the copyediting
    and other manual\ntasks in the publication process.  Specifically, the amount
    of work\nthese manual tasks require differs widely between drafts, and for a\ncertain
    subset of drafts there are either very minor editorial\nchanges or no changes
    needed at all, if we discount the different\nformatting requirements between RFCs
    and drafts.  The experiment\ninvolves identification of this subset of drafts
    and processing them\nseparately with a \"fast path\" process that uses almost
    entirely\nautomated processes.  For the drafts that belong to this subset, it\nis
    expected that the RFC Editor queuing time is reduced from months\nor years to
    weeks or less.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
