abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobile IP protocols provide IP session continuity to Mobile
    Nodes at\n   the expense of creating triangular routes via a centralized Home\n
    \  Agent.  Increased latency and network resource use, introduction of a\n   single
    point of failure and a network choke point are among the\n   undesirable side
    effects of the current protocols.  This document\n   describes an alternative
    approach where the Mobile Node makes use of\n   dynamically-assigned Home Agent
    that is located close to the\n   Corresponding Node.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
