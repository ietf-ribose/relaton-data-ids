abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A Path Computation Element (PCE) based architecture has been\n
    \  specified for the computation of Traffic Engineering (TE) Label\n   Switched
    Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and\n   Generalized MPLS
    (GMPLS) networks in the context of single or\n   multiple domains (where a domain
    is referred to as a collection of\n   network elements within a common sphere
    of address management or path\n   computational responsibility such as IGP areas
    and Autonomous\n   Systems).  In PCE-based environments it is thus critical to
    monitor\n   the state of the path computation chain for troubleshooting and\n
    \  performance monitoring purposes: liveness of each element (PCE)\n   involved
    in the PCE chain, detection of potential resource contention\n   states, statistics
    in term of path computation times are examples of\n   such metrics of interest.
    \ This document specifies procedures and\n   extensions to the Path Computation
    Element Protocol (PCEP) in order\n   to gather such information.\n\t </p>\n      "
