abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a distributed system that provides themechanisms
    needed for discovering, accessing and processing securitypolicy information of
    hosts, subnets or networks of a security domain.In this system policy clients
    and servers exchange information usingthe Security Policy Protocol. The protocol
    defines how the policyinformation is exchanged, processed, and protected by clients
    andservers. The system accommodates topology changes, hence policychanges, rather
    easily without the scalability constraints imposed bystatic reconfiguration of
    each client. The protocol is extensible andflexible. It allows the exchange of
    complex policy objects betweenclients and servers.</p>"
