abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a distributed system that provides the mechanisms
    needed for discovering, accessing and processing security policy information of
    hosts, subnets or networks of a security domain. In this system policy clients
    and servers exchange information using the Security Policy Protocol. The protocol
    defines how the policy information is exchanged, processed, and protected by clients
    and servers. The system accommodates topology changes, hence policy changes, rather
    easily without the scalability constraints imposed by static reconfiguration of
    each client. The protocol is extensible and flexible. It allows the exchange of
    complex policy objects between clients and servers.</p>"
