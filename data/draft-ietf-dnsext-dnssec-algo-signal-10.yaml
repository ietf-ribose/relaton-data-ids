abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin
    authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.
    These digital signatures can be generated using different algorithms. This document
    specifies a way for validating end-system resolvers to signal to a server which
    digital signature and hash algorithms they support. The extensions allow the signaling
    of new algorithm uptake in client code to allow zone administrators to know when
    it is possible to complete an algorithm rollover in a DNSSEC-signed zone.</p>"
