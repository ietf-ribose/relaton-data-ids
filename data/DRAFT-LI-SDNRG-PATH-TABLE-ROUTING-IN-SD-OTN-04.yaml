abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The dynamic establishment and removal of an end-to-end light-path\n
    \  consume a lot of time which are also the main burden of control plane\n   in
    optical transport networks. With the frequent arrival and\n   departure of services,
    the control plane needs to handle a large\n   number of control and management
    messages to conduct path\n   computation, resource reservation and cross connection
    configuration.\n   This draft proposes a novel routing mechanism based on Path
    Table for\n   software-defined optical transport networks (SD-OTN). The Path Table\n
    \  reserves partial activated established light-paths that can be\n   directly
    used by subsequent requests for subsequent services. This\n   new routing mechanism
    can reduce the network load and save routing\n   time for some services.\n\n\t
