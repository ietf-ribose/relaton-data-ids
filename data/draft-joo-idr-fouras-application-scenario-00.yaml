abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document is designed to help organizations in their use of
    4-octet AS numbers in the future by checking the possibility ofinteraction between
    2-octet AS numbers and 4-octet AS numbers foreach scenario, based on the compatibility
    of heterogeneous equipmentused in the actual network related to 4-octet AS numbers,
    and byverifying the interoperability of networks specified in each scenario- before
    using 4-octet AS numbers, before applying 4-octet ASnumbers, as well as the influence
    on service traffic at the time ofinteraction.</p>"
