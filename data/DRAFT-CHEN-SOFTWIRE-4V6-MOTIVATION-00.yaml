abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The growth of Internet obliged to accelerate IPv6 deployment.
    \ IPv6-\n   only network likely become prevalent due to low costs and higher\n
    \  efficiency for operators to employ.  Meanwhile, a significant part of\n   network
    will still stay in IPv4 for long time.  Regarding IPv4\n   depletion, address
    sharing mode should be deployed in small segmented\n   IPv4 networks.  Operators
    expect 4via6 solution with low capital and\n   operational expense by balancing
    tradeoff between simple core network\n   and edge-distributed management.  This
    memo discusses several\n   motivations, and it recommends the 4via6 stateless
    solution should be\n   specified for deployment models in the guideline document.\n\n\t
