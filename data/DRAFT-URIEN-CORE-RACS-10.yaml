abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Remote APDU Call Protocol Secure
    (RACS)\n   protocol, dedicated to Grid of Secure Elements (GoSE). These servers\n
    \  host Secure Elements (SE), i.e. tamper resistant chips offering\n   secure
    storage and cryptographic resources.\n\n   Secure Elements are microcontrollers
    whose chip area is about 25mm2;\n   they deliver trusted computing services in
    constrained environments.\n\n   RACS supports commands for GoSE inventory and
    data exchange with\n   secure elements. It is designed according to the representational\n
    \  State Transfer (REST) architecture. RACS resources are identified by\n   dedicated
    URIs. An HTTP interface is also supported.\n\n   An open implementation [OPENRACS]
    is available\n   (https://github.com/purien/racs_0_1) for various OS.\n\n\n\t
