abstract:
  content: "<p>Many Internet hosts - such as PCs - while capable of running multicastapplications,
    cannot access the MBone (or other wide-area multicastnetwork) because the router(s)
    that connect them to the Internetdo not yet support IP multicast routing. The
    'UDP Multicast TunnelingProtocol' (UMTP) enables such a host to establish an 'ad
    hoc' connection to the MBone by tunneling multicast UDP datagrams inside unicast
    UDP datagrams. By using UDP, this tunneling can be implemented as a 'user level'
    application, without requiring changes to the host'soperating system.</p>"
