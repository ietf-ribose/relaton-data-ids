abstract:
- content: "<p>Delayed Acknowledgments (ACKs) allow reducing protocol overhead in
    many scenarios. However, in some cases, Delayed ACKs may significantly degrade
    network and device performance in terms of link utilization, latency, memory usage
    and/or energy consumption. This document presents the problem statement regarding
    Delayed ACKs suppression. The document discusses the scenarios and use cases in
    which Delayed ACKs suppression offers advantages. Then, requirements for a potential
    solution are derived. Finally, a number of potential solutions are discussed,
    based on the requirements, and also considering pros and cons in each case.</p>"
