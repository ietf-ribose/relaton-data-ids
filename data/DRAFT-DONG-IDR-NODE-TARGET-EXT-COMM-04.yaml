abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP has been used to distribute different types of routing
    and policy\n   information.  In some cases, the information distributed may be
    only\n   intended for one or a particular group of BGP nodes in the network.\n
    \  Currently BGP does not have a generic mechanism of designating the\n   target
    nodes of the routing information.  This document defines a new\n   type of BGP
    Extended Community called \"Node Target\".  The mechanism\n   of using the Node
    Target Extended Community to steer BGP route\n   distribution to particular BGP
    nodes is specified.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
