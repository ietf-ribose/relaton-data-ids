abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an architecture for Drone Remote Identification\n
    \  Protocol (DRIP) Working Group protocols and services to support\n   Unmanned
    Aircraft System Remote Identification (UAS RID) and RID-\n   related communications,
    including its building blocks and their\n   interfaces, all to be standardized.\n\n
    \  CAVEAT LECTOR: This draft version is undergoing substantial\n   restructuring
    and is submitted to the DRIP WG only to spark\n   discussion on architecture and
    to be adopted as a placeholder if\n   there is consensus that there should be
    an architecture document\n   (however far from any future consensus on that architecture
    this\n   draft may be).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
