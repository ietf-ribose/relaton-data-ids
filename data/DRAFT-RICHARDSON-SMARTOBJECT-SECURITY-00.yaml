abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is a position paper for the pre-IETF83 Workshop on Smart
    Object\n   Security.  The author contends that layer-2 security solutions are\n
    \  not only in-adequate, but may in fact be harmful when deployed into\n   smart
    object systems.  While layer-2 security services may be\n   valuable, they must
    be channel bound up to the layer-7 application\n   layer.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
