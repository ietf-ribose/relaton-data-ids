abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism of using concept of Domain
    Wide\n   MPLS Labels in parallel with any of the existing deployments using\n
    \  other label distribution and allocation methods where multi protocol\n   label
    switching paradigm is used for transport.  Specifically it\n   defines a new type
    of context label which can be used to\n   differentiate lookup tables when using
    Domain Wide transport Labels\n   from other downstream or upstream assigned transport
    labels.  The end\n   result is creation of clean new label space in data plane
    allowing\n   very easy and smooth migration to the number of applications choosing\n
    \  to use Domain Wide MPLS Labels.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
