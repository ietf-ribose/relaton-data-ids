    This memo defines a programming interface for the management of cryptographic
    channels as outlined in draft-lanz-cicm-lm-00 and required by draft-lanz-cicm-02
    including creating and negotiating channels for encryption, decryption, bypass,
    data integrity, or to generate random data. Comments are solicited and should
    be addressed to the mailing list at cicm@ietf.org.</p>"
