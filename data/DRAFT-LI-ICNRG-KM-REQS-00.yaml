abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Signature is adopted as the fundamental function in Content-Centric\n
    \  Networking (CCN) / Named Data Networking (NDN).  Its service and\n   performance
    rely heavily on the key management (KM) schemes, which\n   are the processes to
    generate, deliver, store, protect, update, and\n   revoke cryptographic keys.
    \ This document describes the use scenarios\n   and further requirements for KM
    schemes in CCN/NDN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
