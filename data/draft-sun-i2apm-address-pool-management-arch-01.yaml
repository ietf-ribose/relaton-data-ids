abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an mechanism for a standard, programmatic interface
    for address pool management. With the remaining IPv4 address becoming more and
    more scattered, it is complicated to manually configure the address pools on lots
    of Broadband Network Gateways(BNGs) for operators. By introducing SDN/NFV in BNG,
    the address pools can be allocated in a centralized way. It will not only simplify
    the address management for operators, but also improve the utilization efficiency
    of the address pool.</p>"
