abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this draft the first key idea for a full two-way authentication\n
    \  security scheme for the Internet of Things (IoT) based on existing\n   Internet
    standards, specifically the Datagram Transport Layer\n   Security (DTLS) protocol,
    is introduced.  By relying on an\n   established standard, existing implementations,
    engineering\n   techniques, and security infrastructure can be reused, which enables\n
    \  an easy security uptake.  The proposed security scheme is, therefore,\n   based
    on RSA, the most widely used public key cryptography algorithm.\n   It is designed
    to work over standard communication stacks that offer\n   UDP/IPv6 networking
    for Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks\n   (6LoWPANs).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
