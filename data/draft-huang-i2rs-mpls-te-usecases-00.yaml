abstract:
- content: "<p>An MPLS Traffic Engineering(TE) network is typically configured and
    results of its operation are analyzed by Command Line Interface (CLI), SNMP or
    NETCONF. These interactions to control MPLS TE and diagnose its operation encompass:
    MPLS TE configuration, MPLS TE protection, traffic switching-over, monitoring
    of MPLS TE and fault detection. Interface to the Routing System's (I2RS) Programmatic
    interfaces, as defined in [I-D.ward-i2rs-framework], provides an alternate way
    to control the configuration and diagnose the operation of MPLS TE. I2RS may be
    used for the configuration, manipulation, polling or analyzing MPLS TE. This document
    describes set of use cases for which I2RS can be used for MPLS TE. It is intended
    to provide a base for the solution draft describing a set of interfaces to MPLS
    TE.</p>"
