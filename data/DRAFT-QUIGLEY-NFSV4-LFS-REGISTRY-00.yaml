abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the past Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have used
    very\n   rigid policies which were hardcoded into the particular protocol and\n
    \  platform.  As MAC systems are more widely deployed additional\n   flexibility
    in mechanism and policy is required.  Where traditional\n   trusted systems implemented
    Multi-Level Security (MLS) and integrity\n   models, modern systems have expanded
    to include technologies such as\n   type enforcement.  Due to the wide range of
    policies and mechanisms\n   it has proven through past efforts to be virtually
    impossible to\n   accomodate all parties in one security label format and model.\n\n
    \  To allow multiple MAC mechanisms and label formats in a network, this\n   document
    proposes a registry of label format specifications.  This\n   registry contains
    several identifiers to accomodate both integer and\n   string preferences and
    associates those identifiers with an extensive\n   document outlining the exact
    syntax and use of the particular label\n   format.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
