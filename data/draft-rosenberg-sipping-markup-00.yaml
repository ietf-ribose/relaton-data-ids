abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In order for SIP applications to work, they will frequently need
    tocollect user input and provide feedback to users. Traditionally, userinput has
    been done in the PSTN through DTMF. Much work has occurredon extending these DTMF
    models into the domain of SIP, typically bytransporting DTMF digits or user input
    through some SIP message to anapplication server. We propose a broader framework
    for stimulus usingmarkup. The approach can support traditional DTMF user input,
    butalso a rich variety of devices, user interfaces and stimulus thatgoes well
    beyond DTMF.</p>"
