abstract:
- content: "<p>The current local repair mechanism, e.g., TI-LFA, allows local repair
    actions on the direct neighbors of the failed node or link to temporarily route
    traffic to the destination. This mechanism could not work properly when the failure
    happens in the destination point. In SRv6 TE, the IPv6 destination address in
    the outer IPv6 header could be the segment endpoint of the TE path rather than
    the destination of the TE path. When the SRv6 endpoint fails, local repair couldn't
    work on the direct neighbor of the failed endpoint either. This document defines
    midpoint protection for SRv6 TE path, which enables other nodes on the network
    to perform endpoint behaviors instead of the faulty node, Update the IPv6 destination
    address to the other endpoint, and choose the next hop based on the new destination
    address.</p>"
