abstract:
- content: "<p>When a mobile node roams, its location information can be revealed
    by monitoring the IP addresses in its IP packets. This document proposes a technique
    for hiding a mobile node's care-of adress from its correspondent node and its
    home address from an eavesdropper using reverse tunelling. It also proposes another
    technique for preventing movement tracing of a mobile node by an eavesdropper
    during route optimization.</p>"
