abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network Time Protocol version 4 (NTPv4), as defined in
    RFC 5905,\n   is the mechanism used by NTP clients to synchronize with NTP servers\n
    \  across the Internet.  This document specifies an extension to the\n   NTPv4
    client, named Chronos, which is used as a \"watchdog\" alongside\n   NTPv4, and
    provides improved security against time shifting attacks.\n   Chronos involves
    changes to the NTP client's system process only and\n   is backwards compatible
    with NTPv4 servers.  Chronos is also\n   applicable to the emerging NTPv5, since
    it does not affect the wire\n   protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
