abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes an RTP header extension mechanism to be used
    \nwith timestamp-based decoding order recovery of RTP flows containing \nlayered
    codecs.  The header extension may be most useful in the \npresence of clock skew
    as well as for early decoding order recovery.  \nThe RTP header extension is based
    on [RFC5285] and extends the RTP \nheader by the lower 56bit part of the NTP timestamp
    corresponding to \nthe RTP timestamp of the same packet as defined in [RFC3550]
    for the \nRTCP sender reports.  This memo further gives guidance on how \ndecoding
    order is recovered in RTP flows using the NTP timestamp \ninformation when parts
    of a layered, multi-view or multi-\ndescriptions coding media are transported
    in different RTP flows.\n\t </p>\n      "
