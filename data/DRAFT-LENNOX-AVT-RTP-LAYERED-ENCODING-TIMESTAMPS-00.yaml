abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) specification defines how\nlayered
    encodings can be sent over a layered transmission system.  A\nsource can stripe
    the progressive layers of a hierarchically\nrepresented signal across multiple
    RTP sessions, each carried on, for\nexample, its own multicast group.  These layered
    encodings are given\nspecial treatment in RTP, notably in that the same synchronization\nsource
    (SSRC) identifier space is used across the sessions of all\nlayers.\nThe RTP protocol
    specification does not, however, explicitly state\nhow RTP timestamps are to be
    used with layered encodings.  This\ndocument updates the RTP specification to
    require that RTP timestamps\nfor layered encodings be synchronized, i.e. that
    every layer chooses\nthe same random initial value for the timestamp.\n\t </p>\n
