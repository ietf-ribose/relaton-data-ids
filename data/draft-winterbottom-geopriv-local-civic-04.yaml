abstract:
- content: "<p>New fields are occasionally added to civic addresses. A backwardly-
    compatible mechanism for adding civic address elements to the Geopriv civic address
    format is described. A formal mechanism for handling unsupported extensions when
    translating between XML and DHCP civic address forms is defined for entities that
    need to perform this translation.</p>"
