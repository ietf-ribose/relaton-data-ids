abstract:
- content: "<p>This documents defines the Lightweight Authenticated Time (LATe) Synchronization
    Protocol, a secure time synchronization protocol for constrained environments.
    The messages are encoded using Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and
    basic security services are provided by CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE).
    A secure source of time is a base assumption for many other services, including
    security services. LATe Synchronization protocol enables these time-dependent
    services to run in the context of a constrained environment.</p>"
