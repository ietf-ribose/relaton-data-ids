abstract:
- content: '<p>This document registers the Enumservice named "vmsg", which is used
    to facilitate the real-time routing of voice, video, and unified communications
    to a messaging system. This vmsg Enumservice registers three Enumservice types:
    "voicemsg", "videomsg", and "unifmsg". Each type also registers the subtypes "sip",
    "sips", "http", and "https", as well as the subtype "tel" for the "voicemsg" type.
