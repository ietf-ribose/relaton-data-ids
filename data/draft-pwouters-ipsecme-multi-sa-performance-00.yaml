abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines four Notify Message Type Payloads for the Internet
    Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) indicating support for the negotiation
    of multiple identical Child SAs to optimize performance. The CPU_QUEUES notification
    indicates support for multiple queues or CPUs. The QOS_QUEUES notification indicates
    support for different Quality of Service (QoS) levels. The CPU_QUEUE_INFO and
    QOS_QUEUE_INFO notification are used to confirm and optionally convey information
    about the specific queue, such as QoS level. Using multiple identical Child SAs
    has the benefit that each stream has its own Sequence Number Counter, ensuring
    that CPUs don't have to synchronize their crypto state or disable their packet
    replay protection.</p>"
