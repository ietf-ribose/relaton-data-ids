abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Telephone-Related Information (TeRI) framework defines
    an\n   information model for data objects used in the acquisiton,\n   management,
    and retrieval of telephone numbers and information\n   related to them via the
    Internet.  This document defines a profile\n   that extends the base Record format
    of TeRI to carry information\n   about valid and allocated telephone numbers,
    which can help to detect\n   and prevent certain forms of abuse in the telephone
    network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
