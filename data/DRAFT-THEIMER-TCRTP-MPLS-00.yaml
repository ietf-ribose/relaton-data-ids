abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a method to improve the bandwidth efficiency\nof
    voice transmission over an IP/MPLS network by combining RTP\ncompression, PPP
    multiplexing and MPLS tunneling. This proposal does\nnot require any additions
    or modifications to existing protocols, and\ntherefore should be fully interoperable
    with existing implementations\nof RTP compression and PPP multiplexing. It only
    requires specific\nuse of some attributes of MPLS signalling protocols to setup
    a pair\nof unidirectional MPLS tunnels providing a bidirectional link for\ncompressed
    RTP over PPP.\n\t </p>\n      "
