abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The increasing world-wide demands in deep space scientific
    missions,\n   such as Lunar, Mars and other Planetary Exploration, along with
    the\n   rapidly growing advances in space communication technologies have\n   triggered
    the vision of so called future Deep Space Information\n   Networks (DSINs). The
    coined DSIN paradigm is envisioned to be an\n   integrated high speed self-organizing
    hypernetwork consisting of the\n   terrestrial ground-based information networks
    and the outer space-\n   based entities to provide maximum network capacity. In
    this document,\n   the problem of network infrastructure and architecture for
    DSINs is\n   investigated. Taking into account the major challenges or\n   characteristics
    affecting link, networking, transport, and security\n   design of DSINs, this
    document employs hypergraph theory to construct\n   network infrastructure and
    node architecture of space optical\n   switching, and further presents a five-layered
    hypernetwork model of\n   DSINs to enhance network connectivity. Combining with
    the benefits\n   in interconnection and interoperability of heterogeneous challenged\n
    \  networks, brought by the well-known Delay-and Disruption-Tolerant\n   Networking
    (DTN) architecture, this document proposes a novel\n   architecture of DSINs from
    two levels including Layered Protocol\n   Stack and Management Plane. The proposed
    architecture preliminarily\n   achieves the basic concepts and the relevant mechanisms
    of wisdom\n   network, and the performance and quality of service (QoS) of DSINs\n
    \  are thereby improved.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
