abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Privacy is a concept that has been debated and argued throughout
    the\n   last few millennia by all manner of people.  Its most striking\n   feature
    is that nobody seems able to agree upon a precise definition\n   of what it actually
    is.  In order to discuss privacy in any\n   meaningful way a tightly defined context
    needs to be elucidated.  The\n   specific context of privacy used within this
    document is that of\n   \"personal data\", any information relating to a data
    subject; a data\n   subject is an identified natural person or a natural person
    who can\n   be identified, directly or indirectly.  This context is highly\n   relevant
    since a lot of work within the IETF involves defining\n   protocols that can potentially
    transport (either explicitly or\n   implicitly) personal data.\n\n   This document
    aims to establish a basic lexicon around privacy so\n   that IETF contributors
    who wish to discuss privacy considerations\n   within their work can do so using
    terminology consistent across the\n   area.\n\n   Note: This document is discussed
    at\n   https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-privacy\n\n\t </p>\n      "
