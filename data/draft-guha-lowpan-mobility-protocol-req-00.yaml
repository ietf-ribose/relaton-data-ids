abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we propose some protocol requirements for mobility in
    LowPAN networks within the context of the IETF LowPAN working group (IPv6 over
    IEEE 802.15.4). To achieve mobility in LowPAN networks, there may be inter-domain
    movement of network elements across different LowPAN domains or across domains
    that do not comprise LowPAN autonomous systems. To address routing issues in inter-domain
    LowPAN networks that conform to fitting within a single IEEE 802.15.4 frame, there
    are needs for collaborative and distributed methodologies for route computation,
    information storage and retrieval, and security issues in protocols targeted to
    LowPAN mobility. This draft proposes some requirements of mobility in LowPAN protocols
    from the perspective of protocol-independent metrics, algorithm complexities,
    scalability and security criteria.</p>"
