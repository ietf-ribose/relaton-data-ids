abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Efficient techniques for rapid restoration must be addressed within
    \nGMPLS. This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE signaling in \nsupport
    of shared mesh restoration. Shared mesh restoration \ndescribes restoration plans
    in which restoration capacity is shared \nacross multiple independent failures.
    In particular, this document \nproposes extensions enabling reservation of restoration
    capacity, \nLSP restoration, LSP reversion and LSP deletion.\n\t </p>\n      "
