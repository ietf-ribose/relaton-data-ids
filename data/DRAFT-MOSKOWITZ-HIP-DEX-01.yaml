abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Host Identity Protocol Diet EXchange
    (HIP\n   DEX), a variant of the HIP Base EXchange (HIP BEX) [rfc5201-bis].\n   The
    HIP DEX protocol design aims at reducing the overhead of the\n   employed cryptographic
    primitives by omitting public-key signatures\n   and hash functions.  In doing
    so, the main goal is to still deliver\n   similar security properties to HIP BEX.\n\n
    \  The HIP DEX protocol is primarily targeted at computation or memory-\n   constrained
    sensor devices.  Like HIP BEX, it is expected to be used\n   together with another
    suitable security protocol such as the\n   Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP)
    [rfc5202-bis] for the protection\n   of upper layer protocols.  HIP DEX can also
    be used as a keying\n   mechanism for a MAC layer security protocol as is supported
    by IEEE\n   802.15.4 [IEEE.802-15-4.2011].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
