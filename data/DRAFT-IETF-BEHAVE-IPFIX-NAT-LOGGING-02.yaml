abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NAT devices are required to log events like creation and deletion
    of\n   translations and information about the resources it is managing.  The\n
    \  logs are required in many cases to identify an attacker or a host\n   that
    was used to launch malicious attacks and/or for various other\n   purposes of
    accounting.  Since there is no standard way of logging\n   this information, different
    NAT devices behave differently and hence\n   it is difficult to expect a consistent
    behavior.  The lack of a\n   consistent way makes it difficult to write the collector
    applications\n   that would receive this data and process it to present useful\n
    \  information.  This document describes the information that is\n   required
    to be logged by the NAT devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
