abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This text is intended to open discussion towards the adoption
    of\n   support for tokenised IPv6 interface identifiers in IPv6 nodes.  The\n
    \  primary target for such support is server platforms where addresses\n   are
    usually manually configured, rather than using DHCPv6 or SLAAC.\n   By using tokenised
    identifiers, hosts can still determine their\n   network prefix by use of SLAAC,
    but more readily be automatically\n   renumbered should their network prefix change.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
