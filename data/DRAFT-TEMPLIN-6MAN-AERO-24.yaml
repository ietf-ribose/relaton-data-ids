abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an Automatic Extended Route Optimization\n
    \  (AERO) service for IP internetworking over Overlay Multilink Network\n   (OMNI)
    interfaces.  AERO/OMNI use an IPv6 link-local address format\n   that supports
    operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND)\n   protocol.  Prefix delegation/registration
    services are employed for\n   network admission and to manage the IP forwarding
    and routing\n   systems.  Secure multilink operation, mobility management, multicast,\n
    \  traffic selector signaling and route optimization are naturally\n   supported
    through dynamic neighbor cache updates.  AERO is a widely-\n   applicable mobile
    internetworking service especially well-suited to\n   aviation services, intelligent
    transportation systems, mobile end\n   user devices and many other applications.\n\n\t
