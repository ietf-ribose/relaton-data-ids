abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   Tunnel Endpoint Discovery is an enhancement to the Softwire
    feature.\n   Defining a dynamic tunnel endpoint map allows you to be able to\n
    \  dynamically determine a Tunnel Broker peer; however, only the\n   receiving
    client has this ability.  This document frets out the\n   problem scope as well
    as the motivation for specifying such a feature\n   within the Softwire protocol.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
