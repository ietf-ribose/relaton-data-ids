abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of
    standard\n   Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing\n
    \  communication.  The security needs are well-recognized and and many\n   standardization
    steps for providing security have been taken, for\n   example, the specification
    of Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\n   over Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS).  However, the design\n   space of IoT applications and systems is complex
    and exposed to\n   multiple types of threats.  In particular, threats keep evolving
    at a\n   fast pace while many IoT systems are rarely updated and still remain\n
    \  operational for decades.\n\n   This document has three main parts: First, it
    summarizes exemplary\n   security threats and suitable mitigation strategies to
    protect\n   against multiple types of threats.  Second, it describes a\n   comprehensive
    agile security framework to integrate existing security\n   processes such as
    risk asssement or vulnerability assessment in the\n   lifecycle of a smart object
    in an IoT application.  Thus, instead of\n   having a security configuration that
    is fixed at manufacturing time,\n   our approach allows us to apply a - security
    profile - on the device\n   tailored for a specific environment at any point of
    time.  Third, we\n   discuss the concept of security profiles and give examples
    of them.\n\n   The core of our agile security approach relies on two protocols:
    the\n   Protocol for Automatic Security Configuration (PASC) and the Protocol\n
    \  for Automatic Vulnerability Assessment (PAVA).  PACS is executed\n   during
    the onboarding phase of a smart object in an IoT system and is\n   in charge of
    automatically performing a risk assessment and assigning\n   a security profile
    to defeat the identified risks.  The assigned\n   security profile fits the specific
    environment and threat model of\n   the application in which the device has been
    deployed.  PAVA is\n   executed during the operation of the IoT object and ensures
    that\n   vulnerabilities in the smart object and IoT system are discovered in\n
    \  a proactive way.  These two protocols can benefit users, manufactures\n   and
    operators by automating IoT security.  We describe a few\n   examplary security
    profiles that could be applicable in different\n   application areas and automatically
    configured by means of PASC and\n   PAVA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
