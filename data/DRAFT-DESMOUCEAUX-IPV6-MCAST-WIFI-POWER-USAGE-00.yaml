abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 networks make a consequent use of multicast for several\n
    \  purposes, including mandatory functions such as Neighbor Discovery.\n   Although
    this use of multicast does not create real difficulties on\n   wired networks,
    it can become painful on wireless ones, notably in\n   terms of power consumption.
    \ There might be little effect on home\n   networks, however, such effects become
    more important on large-scale\n   networks.  This memo provides statistics about
    the multicast traffic\n   rate in a large IPv6 wireless network and the induced
    device power\n   consumption, in response to a call emitted at IETF 89.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
