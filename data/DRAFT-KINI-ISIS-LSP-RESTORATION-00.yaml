abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Traffic engineering using MPLS involves the setting up of label\nswitched
    paths (LSP) possibly with explicit routing and with\nbandwidth guarantees (for
    label switched paths). The reliability of\nthese LSPs can be increased by providing
    a backup LSP onto which\ntraffic can be switched upon failure of an element in
    the path of the\nactive LSP. Backup LSPs can be routed in a way that bandwidth
    can be\nshared between backup links of more than one active path while still\nguaranteeing
    recoverability for a set of failures. This sharing greatly\nincreases the network
    efficiency thereby increasing the number of LSPs\nthat can be carried while maintaining
    guarantees. Algorithms which can\nroute such recoverable LSPs while using only
    aggregate network usage \ninformation are being developed. To route the active
    LSP and the\n(possibly shared) backup LSP, the topology information of the network\nis
    needed and  this can be provided by a link state routing protocol\nlike IS-IS.
    This document describes the encoding of the additional\ninformation within the
    link state protocol data unit (LSPdu) of IS-IS\nto enable routing of shared backup
    paths.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
