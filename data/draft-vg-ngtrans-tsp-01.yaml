abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes a control protocol to setup tunnels between
    aclient and a tunnel server or broker. It provides a framework forthe negociation
    of tunnel parameters between the two entities. It isa generic TCP protocol based
    on simple XML messaging. This frameworkprotocol enables the negociation of any
    kind of tunnel, and isextensible to support new parameters or extensions. The
    first targetapplication is to setup IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels which is one of thetransition
    mechanism identified by the ngtrans and ipv6 workinggroups. This IPv6 over IPv4
    tunnel setup application of the genericTSP protocol is defined by a profile of
    the TSP protocol, in acompanion document.</p>"
