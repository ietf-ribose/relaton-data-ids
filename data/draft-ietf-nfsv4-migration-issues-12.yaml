abstract:
- content: "<p>The migration feature of NFSv4 provides for moving responsibility for
    a single filesystem from one server to another, without disruption to clients.
    A number of problems in the specification of this feature in NFSv4.0 were resolved
    by the publication of RFC 7931. In addition, there are specification issues to
    be resolved with regard to the NFSv4.1 version of this feature which are discussed
    in this document.</p>"
