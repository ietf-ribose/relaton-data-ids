abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes new challenges such as strict latency, uplink
    cost, uninterrupted services, privacy and security, for IoT services originated
    from the IoT environmental changes. In order to address those new challenges,
    the integration of Edge computing and IoT has been emerged as a promising solution.
    This document discribes the concept of IoT integrated with Edge computing as well
    as the state- of-the-art of IoT Edge computing. It also proposes an architecture
    of IoT Edge computing. The direction of Edge computing for IoT should be discussed
    in the IETF/IRTF.</p>"
