abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) Policy is a set of candidate paths, each consisting
    of one or more segment lists and the associated information. The header of a packet
    steered in an SR Policy is augmented with an ordered list of segments associated
    with that SR Policy. In scenarios where multiple Virtual Transport Networks (VTNs)
    exist in the network, the VTN in which the SR policy is instantiated may also
    need to be specified, so that the header of packet can also be augmented with
    the information associated with the VTN. An SR Policy candidate path can be distributed
    using BGP SR Policy. This document defines extensions to BGP SR policy to specify
    the VTN associated with the SR policy.</p>"
