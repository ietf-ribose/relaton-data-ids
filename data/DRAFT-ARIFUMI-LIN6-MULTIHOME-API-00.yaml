abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a method for multihoming support in\napplication
    layer. We extend the basic socket API(Application\nProgramming Interface) and
    propose some new interfaces for\nmultihoming. Multihoming nodes are expected to
    have multiple\naddresses. The existing socket APIs, however, are not designed
    to\nmanipulate multiple addresses in a connection. Proposed APIs help an\napplication
    to handle multiple addresses, to avoid connection failure\nand to do load-balancing
    possibly. Right now, the proposed APIs are\nfor LIN6 nodes, one of the mobile
    protocols. This is because LIN6's\naddressing architecture, which is called '8+8',
    is very friendly and\nconsistent with multihoming. In this document, we propose
    a host-\nbased multihoming solution and which is called end-to-end\nmultihoming.
    In end-to-end multihoming, a fault-tolerant connection\ncan be achieved relying
    not on routers but on the pair of end-nodes\nonly.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
