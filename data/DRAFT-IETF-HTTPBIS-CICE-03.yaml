abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In HTTP, content codings allow for payload encodings such as for
    compression or integrity checks. In particular, the \"gzip\" content coding is
    widely used for payload data sent in response messages.\n\n Content codings can
    be used in request messages as well; however, discoverability is not on par with
    response messages. This document extends the HTTP \"Accept-Encoding\" header field
    for use in responses, to indicate the content codings that are supported in requests.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
