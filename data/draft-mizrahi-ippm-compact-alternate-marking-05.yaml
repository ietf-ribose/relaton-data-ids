abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces new alternate marking methods that require a compact
    overhead of either a single bit per packet, or zero bits per packet. This memo
    also presents a summary of alternate marking methods, and discusses the tradeoffs
    among them. The target audience of this document is network protocol designers;
    this document is intended to help protocol designers choose the best alternate
    marking method(s) based on the protocol's constraints and requirements.</p>"
