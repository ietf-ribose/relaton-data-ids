abstract:
  content: "<p>Devices using zeroconf networking protocols can communicate using IPwithout
    requiring user configuration or infrastructure services likeDHCP and DNS.The options
    available to secure zeroconf networks are canvassed. Acomparison is made between
    bootstrapping IPSec and securing sampleprotocols from each area listed in the
    zeroconf working groupcharter. This shows IPSec to be the most promising approach
    forsecuring zeroconf protocols.</p>"
