abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The TCP-IMPL working group has documented a number of TCP\n
    \  implementation problems [PADHV98].  However, a significant number\n   still
    have not been fully described and documented in the form used\n   in [PADHV98].
    \ This memo briefly describes a number of these,\n   including commentary as to
    the authors' opinions regarding the\n   importance of documenting the problem.
    \ This memo is *not* intended\n   to ever see light as an RFC of some form; its
    sole function is to\n   facilitate working group discussion of which problems
    are more\n   pressing to document than others, and to aid in arriving at a\n   decision
    as to when [PADHV98] will be sufficiently complete to merit\n   its publication
    as an Informational RFC.\n\n   We divide the descriptions into ''serious'' problems,
    meaning those    we think should be included in [PADHV98] prior to its publication;\n
    \  ''security'' problems, which might not be viewed as implementation\n   problems
    per se, but represent significant security problems of which\n   TCP implementors
    should be aware; and ''less serious'' problems, those\n   that, if the working
    group fails to find volunteers to document them,\n   should not hold up [PADHV98].\n
    \n   It might be worthwhile to separate the security problems out into\n   their
    own document.  We particularly solicit working group input on\n   this subject.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
