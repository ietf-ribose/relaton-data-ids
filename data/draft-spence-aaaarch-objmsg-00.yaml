abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies the top level data objects to be carried in an
    AAA Protocol that supports the generic AAA architecture described in RFC 2903.
    It also specifies the required message types. Data objects and message types are
    defined in an abstract way without regard to encoding. The message types defined
    could be thought of as the use cases (in the UML sense) for a generic AAA server.
    They define what can be asked of or provided to a generic AAA server. The data
    objects specify what kinds of information can be routed among the AAA servers
    in the generic AAA infrastructure. Suggestions as to which data objects would
    be carried in each message type are provided.</p>"
