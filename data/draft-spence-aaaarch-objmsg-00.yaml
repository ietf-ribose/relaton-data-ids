abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo specifies the top level data objects to be carried in anAAA
    Protocol that supports the generic AAA architecture described inRFC 2903. It also
    specifies the required message types. Dataobjects and message types are defined
    in an abstract way withoutregard to encoding. The message types defined could
    be thought of asthe use cases (in the UML sense) for a generic AAA server. Theydefine
    what can be asked of or provided to a generic AAA server. Thedata objects specify
    what kinds of information can be routed amongthe AAA servers in the generic AAA
    infrastructure. Suggestions as towhich data objects would be carried in each message
    type areprovided.</p>"
