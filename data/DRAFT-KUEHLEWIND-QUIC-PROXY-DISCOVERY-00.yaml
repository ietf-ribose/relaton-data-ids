abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Often an intermediate instance (such as a proxy server) is
    used to\n   connect to a web server or a communicating peer if a direct end-to-\n
    \  end IP connectivity is not possible or the proxy can provide a\n   support
    service like, e.g., address anonymisation.  To use a non-\n   transparent proxy
    a client explicitly connects to it and requests\n   forwarding to the final target
    server.  The client either knows the\n   proxy address as preconfigured in the
    application or can dynamically\n   learn about available proxy services.  This
    document describes\n   different discovery mechanisms for non-transparent proxies
    that are\n   either located in the local network, e.g. home or enterprise network,\n
    \  in the access network, or somewhere else on the Internet usually\n   close
    to the target server or even in the same network as the target\n   server.\n\n
    \  This document assumes that the non-transparent proxy server is\n   connected
    via QUIC and discusses potential discovery mechanisms for\n   such a QUIC-based,
    non-transparent proxy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
