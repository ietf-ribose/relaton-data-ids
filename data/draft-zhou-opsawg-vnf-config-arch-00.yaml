abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the architecture of remote service installation
    and configuration in the provider's network through a centralized management system.
    This is a typical scenario for virtual network function installation and dynamic
    configuration in network function virtualization (NFV) context. It is also a typical
    scenario in cloud computing environment where end users do not have to install
    applications on their end hosts, but can install their own featured powerful software
    application in the cloud. This specification describes an architecture of virtual
    network function installation and configuration. It is also applicable to other
    use cases with similar requirements.</p>"
