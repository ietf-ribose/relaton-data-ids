abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides a framework and methodology for performing\nperformance
    test and benchmarking of wireless LAN (WLAN) switches and\ncontrollers, including
    systems comprising groups of controllers and\nWTPs.  This document defines and
    discusses a number of tests and\nassociated test conditions that may be used to
    characterize the\nperformance of such systems, and also supplies the methods used
    to\ncalculate the expected results of these tests.  Specific formats for\nreporting
    the results of the tests are also provided, where\napplicable.  The tests described
    in this document extend the\nmethodology defined for benchmarking network interconnect
    devices in\nRFC 2544, and LAN switches in RFC 2889, to WLAN switch controller\nsystems.
    \ The methodology herein is to be used together with the\ncompanion terminology
    document.\n\t </p>\n      "
