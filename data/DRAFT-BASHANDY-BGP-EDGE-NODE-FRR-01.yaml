abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the edge BGP speakers
    PE1,\nPE2,..., PEn know about a prefix P/p via the external routers CE1,\nCE2,...,
    CEm.  If the edge router PEi crashes or becomes totally\ndisconnected from the
    core, it desirable for a penultimate hop route\n\"P\" carrying traffic to the
    failed edge router PEi to immediately\nrestore traffic by re-tunneling packets
    originally tunneled to PEi\nand destined to the prefix P/p to one of the other
    edge routers that\nadvertised P/p, say PEj, until BGP re-converges. In doing so,
    it is\nhighly desirable to keep the core BGP-free while not imposing\nrestrictions
    on external connectivity. Thus (1) a core router should\nnot be required to learn
    any BGP prefix, (2) the size of the\nforwarding and routing tables in the core
    routers should be\nindependent of the number of BGP prefixes,(3) there should
    be no\nspecial router (or group of routers) that handles restoring traffic,\nand
    (4) there should be no restrictions on what edge routers\nadvertise what prefixes.
    For labeled prefixes, (5) the penultimate\nhop router must swap the label advertised
    by the failed edge router\nPEi for the prefix P/p with the label advertised for
    the same prefix\nby the edge router PEj before re-tunneling the packet to PEj\n\n\t
