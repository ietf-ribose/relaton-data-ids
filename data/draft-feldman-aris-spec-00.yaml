abstract:
- content: "<p>ARIS (Aggregate Route-Based IP Switching) adds the advantages of high-speed
    switching to a network based on routing protocols. It provides a means of mapping
    network-layer routing information to link-layer switched paths, enabling datagrams
    to traverse a network at media speeds. This memo defines the ARIS protocol and
    its mechanisms.</p>"
