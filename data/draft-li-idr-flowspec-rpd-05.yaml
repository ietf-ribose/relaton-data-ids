abstract:
- content: "<p>It is hard to adjust traffic and optimize traffic paths on a traditional
    IP network from time to time through manual configurations. It is desirable to
    have an automatic mechanism for setting up routing policies, which adjust traffic
    and optimize traffic paths automatically. This document describes BGP Extensions
    for Routing Policy Distribution (BGP RPD) to support this.</p>"
