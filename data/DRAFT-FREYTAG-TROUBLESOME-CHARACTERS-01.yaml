abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Unicode's design goal is to be the universal character set
    for all\n   applications.  The goal entails the inclusion of very large numbers\n
    \  of characters.  It is also focused on written language; special\n   provisions
    have always been needed for identifiers.  The sheer size\n   of the repertoire
    increases the possibility of accidental or\n   intentional use of characters that
    can cause confusion among users,\n   particularly where linguistic context is
    ambiguous, unavailable, or\n   impossible to determine.  A registry of code points
    that can be\n   sometimes especially problematic may be useful to guide system\n
    \  administrators in setting parameters for allowable code points in an\n   identifier
    system, and to aid applications in creating security aids\n   for users.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
