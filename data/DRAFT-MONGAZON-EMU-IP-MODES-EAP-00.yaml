abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is defined in [RFC3748].\nThis
    document defines a mechanism that allows an access network to\nprovide IP connectivity
    modes hints to an EAP peer -- the end of the\nlink that responds to the authenticator.
    \ The purpose is to allow the\nEAP peer in executing in a reliable and efficient
    manner the IP\nconnectivity step as soon as the authentication phase completes.\nThis
    is useful in situations where a peer and the networks it visits\nsupport various
    IP connectivity modes.  Without the hint, such a peer\nmight fail or take some
    time to select a valid IP connectivity mode\non the visited network.  With the
    help of the hint, a visited network\nprovides the peer with a list of supported
    IP connectivity modes and\nallows it to execute successfully the convenient IP
    connectivity as\nsoon as the authentication is complete.  The hint is particularly\nuseful
    when users are performing vertical handovers through different\nnetwork technologies
    such as wireless ones.\n\t </p>\n      "
