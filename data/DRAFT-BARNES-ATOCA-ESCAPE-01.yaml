abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recipients of emergency alerts need to be able to verify that
    an\n   alert they receive was issued by an authorized source.  The Common\n   Alerting
    Protocol (CAP) provides a standard way of encoding alert\n   information, but
    does not provide any security features that would\n   support authentication of
    alert originators.  This document describes\n   a security wrapper for Common
    Alerting Protocol objects to allow\n   alerts to be signed by alert originators.\n\n
    \  Please send feedback to the atoca@ietf.org mailing list.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
