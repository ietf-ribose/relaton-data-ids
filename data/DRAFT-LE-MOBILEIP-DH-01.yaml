abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IP [1] requires several security associations: the Mobile
    Node\nmust share a security association with its Home agent and its\nCorrespondent
    Nodes to send the binding update; these messages must\nbe authenticated to prevent
    potential denial of service attacks [2].\nThe MN and the Home Agent can have a
    static security association,\nestablished at the configuration time, but the case
    of the\nCorrespondent Node is more complex since it cannot be assumed that\nthe
    MN and the CN have any pre-established security association.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
