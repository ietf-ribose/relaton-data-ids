abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document outlines a mechanism for generating forwarding tables
    \nthat include scoped IPv6 addresses.  It defines a set of rules for \nrouters
    to implement in order to forward packets addressed to scoped \nunicast or multicast
    addresses regardless of the routing protocol.  \nThese rules apply to all scoped
    addresses.\n\t </p>\n      "
