abstract:
- content: "<p>The current version of the IDNA specifications anticipated that each
    new version of Unicode would be reviewed to verify that no changes had been introduced
    that required adjustments to the set of rules and, in particular, whether new
    exceptions or backward compatibility adjustments were needed. That review was
    conducted for Unicode 7.0.0 and identified a potentially problematic new code
    point. This specification discusses that code point and associated issues and
    updates RFC 5982 accordingly. It also applies an editorial clarification that
    was the subject of an earlier erratum. In addition, the discussion of the specific
    issue updates RFC 5894.</p>"
