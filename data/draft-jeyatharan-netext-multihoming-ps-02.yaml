abstract:
  content: "<p>The Proxy Mobile Internet Protocol version 6 (PMIPv6) supportsmultihoming
    whereby a mobile node (1) gets assigned prefixes by thelocal mobility anchor which
    are associated with an interface of amobile node and are managed by the PMIPv6
    elements as a single IPmobility session, and (2) can connect to a Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 domainthrough multiple interfaces for simultaneous access and get assigneda
    different set of prefix(es) per interface, since being eachinterface managed via
    an independent mobility session. However,PMIPv6 needs multihoming enhancements
    such that it needs the abilityto instantiate additional IP mobility sessions associated
    with analready active interface or a secondary interface of the mobile nodewhich
    has an established IP mobility session at a local mobilityanchor (LMA), the ability
    to selectively share home networkprefix(es) across access technology types, the
    ability to performflow mobility tied to a subset of prefixes associated with an
    accesstechnology to another access technology and extended support formultiple
    IP mobility sessions in a scenario where multiple interfacesof the mobile node
    are connected to a single mobile access gateway(MAG). This memo highlights such
    required enhancements to PMIPv6multihoming with respect to improved operations
    and extendedapplicability to different deployment scenarios.</p>"
