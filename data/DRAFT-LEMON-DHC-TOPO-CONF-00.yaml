abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DHCP servers have evolved over the years to provide significant\n
    \  functionality beyond that which is described in the DHCP base\n   specifications.
    \ One aspect of this functionality is support for\n   context-specific configuration
    information.  This memo describes some\n   such features and makes recommendations
    as to how they can be used.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
