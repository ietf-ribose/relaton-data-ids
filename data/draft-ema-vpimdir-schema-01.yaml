abstract:
  content: "<p>One use of a directory service is the retrieval of information,such
    as email address and spoken name, to support voice messaging.This document defines
    the directory schema required for anX.500/LDAP-based directory service for use
    by applicationssupporting Voice Profile for Internet Mail [VPIM2]. The directoryservice
    is intended to assist the exchange of voice messagesbetween voice messaging systems.
    Interaction with desktopapplications is outside the scope of this draft.Some schema
    elements defined herein may be of more general use thanjust for voice messaging.
    They are included here because they arenot defined elsewhere. It is anticipated
    that the next version ofthis schema will only reference such definitions if they
    getdefined in more appropriate areas.</p>"
