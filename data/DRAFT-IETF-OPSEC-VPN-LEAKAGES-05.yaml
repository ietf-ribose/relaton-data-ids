abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The subtle way in which the IPv6 and IPv4 protocols co-exist
    in\n   typical networks, together with the lack of proper IPv6 support in\n   popular
    Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel products, may\n   inadvertently result in
    VPN tunnel traffic leaks.  That is, traffic\n   meant to be transferred over an
    encrypted and integrity protected VPN\n   tunnel may leak out of such tunnel and
    be sent in the clear on the\n   local network towards the final destination.  This
    document discusses\n   some scenarios in which such VPN tunnel traffic leakages
    may occur as\n   a result of employing IPv6-unaware VPN software.  Additionally,
    this\n   document offers possible mitigations for this issue.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
