abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a new mechanism to solve mobility problems
    \nover IPv6 transition networks which IPv6 sites are interconnected \nover a wide
    area network which has no native IPv6 support[4]. This \ndraft defines an extended
    mechanism of 6to4 mechanism[4] and Mobile \nIPv6[2] to support mobility over 6to4.
    It also describes scenarios \nfor using the proposed mechanism during the co-existence
    period.  \n\t </p>\n      "
