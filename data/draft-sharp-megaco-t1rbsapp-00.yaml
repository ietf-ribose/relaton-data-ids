abstract:
  content: "<p>The Media Gateway Control Protocol (megaco) can be used to carry T1Robbed
    Bit Signaling (RBS) between the Media Gateway (MG) and theMedia Gateway Controller
    (MGC). This document describes theapplicability of megaco to carrying T1 Robbed
    Bit Signaling. T1Robbed Bit Signaling is a type of Channel Associated Signaling
    usedmainly in the United States of America (USA) and Canada. Adescription and
    specification for T1 RBS can be found in EIA/TIA-464-B. This draft does not define
    any new packages, but identifiesthe need for new packages to support Robbed Bit
    Signaling. It isanticipated that packages for FX service will be very similar
    topackages defined for analog lines.</p>"
