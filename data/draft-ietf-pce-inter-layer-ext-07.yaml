abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. MPLS and GMPLS networks may be constructed
    from layered service networks. It is advantageous for overall network efficiency
    to provide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network layers through
    a process called inter-layer traffic engineering. PCE is a candidate solution
    for such requirements. The PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) is designed as a
    communication protocol between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs. This
    document presents PCEP extensions for inter-layer traffic engineering.</p>"
