abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes two generic use-cases that illustrate application
    layer traffic optimization applied to high bandwidth core networks. The type of
    information and interactions needed to perform various optimizations is described.
    In addition extensions to the existing ALTO protocol widely applicable to any
    high bandwidth applications are suggested. These include bandwidth constraint
    representations for a diverse range of control and data plane technologies as
    well as advanced filtering based on constraints.</p>"
