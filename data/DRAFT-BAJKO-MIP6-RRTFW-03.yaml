abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a slightly modified Return Routability Test
    \n(RRT) for MIPv6 [RFC3775]. The herein defined RRT mechanism is \nintended for
    CoA exchanges between the MN and the CN. Once the MN \nand CN find out their peers'
    valid addresses, an additional \nmechanism, defined in [I-D.tschofenig-mip6-ice],
    will be used to run \nconnectivity checks to figure out which of the address pairs
    have \nconnectivity and, if needed, open the required pinholes in the \nfirewalls
    as described in [4]. \nThe defined mechanism is intended to work with current
    firewalls \nwithout requiring any support from them.\n\t </p>\n      "
