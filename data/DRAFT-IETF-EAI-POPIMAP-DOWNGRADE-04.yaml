abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Email Address Internationalization (SMTPUTF8) extension
    allows\n   UTF-8 characters in mail header fields.  Upgraded POP and IMAP\n   servers
    support internationalized email messages.  If a POP/IMAP\n   client does not support
    Email Address Internationalization, POP/IMAP\n   servers cannot send Internationalized
    Email Headers to the client and\n   cannot remove the message.  To avoid the situation,
    this document\n   describes a conversion mechanism for internationalized Email
    messages\n   to be traditional message format.  The purpose of post-delivery\n
    \  message downgrading is to enable POP/IMAP servers to deliver\n   internationalized
    messages to traditional POP/IMAP clients.  In the\n   process, message elements
    requiring internationalized treatment can\n   be removed or recoded and receivers
    can know they received messages\n   containing such elements even if they cannot
    receive the elements\n   themselves.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
