abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The framework for preparation and comparison of internationalized\n
    \  strings (\"PRECIS\") defines several classes of strings for preparation\n   and
    comparison.  Case mapping is defined because many protocols\n   perform case-sensitive
    or case-insensitive string comparison and so\n   preparation of the string is
    mandatory.  The Internationalized Domain\n   Names in Applications (IDNA) and
    the PRECIS problem statement\n   describes mappings for internationalized strings
    that are not limited\n   to case, but include width mapping and mapping of delimiters
    and\n   other specials that can be taken into consideration.  This document\n
    \  provides guidelines for authors of protocol profiles of the PRECIS\n   framework
    and describes several mappings that can be applied between\n   receiving user
    input and passing permitted code points to\n   internationalized protocols.  The
    mappings described here are\n   expected to be applied as an additional mapping
    in the PRECIS\n   framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
