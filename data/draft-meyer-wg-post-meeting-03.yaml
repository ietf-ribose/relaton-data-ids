    contains little information about post-IETF meeting working groupchair responsibilities.
    In particular, it gives little guidance withrespect to either form or submission
    deadlines for the artifacts ofthe meeting, namely, session minutes and presentation
    materials. Thisdocument addresses those issues.</p>"
