abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to transmit IPv6 packets on IEEE 802.11 networks run
    outside\n   the context of a basic service set (OCB, earlier \"802.11p\") there
    is\n   a need to define a few parameters such as the recommended Maximum\n   Transmission
    Unit size, the header format preceding the IPv6 header,\n   the Type value within
    it, and others.  This document describes these\n   parameters for IPv6 and IEEE
    802.11 OCB networks; it portrays the\n   layering of IPv6 on 802.11 OCB similarly
    to other known 802.11 and\n   Ethernet layers - by using an Ethernet Adaptation
    Layer.\n\n   In addition, the document attempts to list what is different in\n
    \  802.11 OCB (802.11p) compared to more 'traditional' 802.11a/b/g/n\n   layers,
    layers over which IPv6 protocols run ok.  Most notably, the\n   operation outside
    the context of a BSS (OCB) has impact on IPv6\n   handover behaviour and on IPv6
    security.\n\n   An example of an IPv6 packet captured while transmitted over an
    IEEE\n   802.11 OCB link (802.11p) is given.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
