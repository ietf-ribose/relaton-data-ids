abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The QUERY opcode in the DNS is designed for unicast. With the
    \ndevelopment of multicast capabilities in the DNS, it is desireable\nto have
    a more robust opcode for server interactions since a single\nrequest may result
    in replies from multiple responders. So DISCOVER\nis defined to deal with replies
    from multiple responders.\nAs such, this document extend the core DNS specifications
    to allow\nclients to have a method for coping with replies from multiple\nresponders.
    Use of this new opcode may facilitate DNS operations in\nmodern networking topologies.
    A prototype of the DISCOVER opcode\nwas developed as part of the TBDS project,
    funded under DARPA grant\nF30602-99-1-0523.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
