abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to introduce the challenges to overcome when
    network management problems may require to be couple with AI solutions. On one
    hand, there are many difficult problems in Network Management that to this date
    have no good solutions, or where any solutions come with significant limitations
    and constraints. Artificial Intelligence may help produce novel solutions to those
    problems. On the other hand, for several reasons (computational costs of AI solutions,
    privacy of data), distribution of AI tasks became primordial. It is thus also
    expected that network SHOULD be operated efficiently to support those tasks. To
    identify the right set of challenges, the document defines a method based on the
    evolution and nature of NM problems. This will be done in parallel with advances
    and the nature of existing solutions in AI in order to highlight where AI and
    NM have been already coupled together or could benefit from a higher integration.
    So, the method aims at evaluating the gap between NM problems and AI solutions.
    Challenges are derived accordingly, assuming solving these challenges will help
    to reduce the gap between NM and AI.</p>"
