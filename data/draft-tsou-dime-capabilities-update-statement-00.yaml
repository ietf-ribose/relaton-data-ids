abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This specification clarifies \"Capabilities Update\" in OPEN statedefined
    in RFC 3588bis. Capabilities update in OPEN state can reusecommands CER/CEA commands
    for re-negotiation between Diameter peerswhen one of them changes its capabilities.It
    is a very importantfunction in Diameter.However, RFC 3588 has defined a mechanism
    of containing capabilitieslist both in CER and CEA commands and the peer should
    update itslocal database whenever it receives CER/CEA. This makes the processcomplex
    and redundant when they are used in OPEN state. So thisdraft proposes a simpler
    solution based on CER/CEA commands to dealwith this problem.</p>"
