abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a trust framework, which may improve the security
    and reliability of routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLN), against an
    increased set of attacks. The development of the framework builds upon previous
    work on trust and secure routing, adapting the trust assessments to the issues
    and constraints specific to LLNs. The proposed trust management scheme is based
    on direct and indirect interactions with neighboring nodes, to compute their trust
    value and thus select the most trusted path or forwarding node. To reduce the
    overhead of nodes' communication during the indirect trust value retrieval procedure,
    indirect trust information is requested from a limited number of neighbors, which
    respond only when they have highly reliable trust information</p>"
