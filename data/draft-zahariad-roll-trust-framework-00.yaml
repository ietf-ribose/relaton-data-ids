abstract:
  content: "<p>This document presents a trust framework, which may improve thesecurity
    and reliability of routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks(LLN), against an
    increased set of attacks. The development of theframework builds upon previous
    work on trust and secure routing,adapting the trust assessments to the issues
    and constraints specificto LLNs.The proposed trust management scheme is based
    on direct and indirectinteractions with neighboring nodes, to compute their trust
    value andthus select the most trusted path or forwarding node. To reduce theoverhead
    of nodes' communication during the indirect trust valueretrieval procedure, indirect
    trust information is requested from alimited number of neighbors, which respond
    only when they have highlyreliable trust information</p>"
