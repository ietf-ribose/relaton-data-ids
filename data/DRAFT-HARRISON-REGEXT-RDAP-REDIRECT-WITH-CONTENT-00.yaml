abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) is used by Regional\n
    \  Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs) to\n   provide
    access to their resource registration information.  When an\n   RDAP service operator
    has delegated authority for a resource to a\n   third party, the operator will
    configure its RDAP service to redirect\n   requests for that resource to the third
    party.  However, the client\n   may be interested in the resource registration
    data that the first\n   service operator has in its own right, for various reasons.
    \ This\n   document defines a conformance code that a service operator can use\n
    \  to indicate that when redirecting requests, it will also include as\n   the
    body of the response the RDAP object (if any) that it has in its\n   own right
    for the requested resource.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
