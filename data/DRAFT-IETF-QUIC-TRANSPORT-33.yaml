abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the core of the QUIC transport protocol.
    \ QUIC\n   provides applications with flow-controlled streams for structured\n
    \  communication, low-latency connection establishment, and network path\n   migration.
    \ QUIC includes security measures that ensure\n   confidentiality, integrity,
    and availability in a range of deployment\n   circumstances.  Accompanying documents
    describe the integration of\n   TLS for key negotiation, loss detection, and an
    exemplary congestion\n   control algorithm.\n\nDO NOT DEPLOY THIS VERSION OF QUIC\n\n
    \  DO NOT DEPLOY THIS VERSION OF QUIC UNTIL IT IS IN AN RFC.  This\n   verion
    is still a work in progress.  For trial deployments, please\n   use earlier versions.\n\nNote
    to Readers\n\n   Discussion of this draft takes place on the QUIC working group\n
    \  mailing list (quic@ietf.org (mailto:quic@ietf.org)), which is\n   archived
    at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=quic\n\n   Working Group
    information can be found at https://github.com/quicwg;\n   source code and issues
    list for this draft can be found at\n   https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/labels/-transport.\n\n\t
