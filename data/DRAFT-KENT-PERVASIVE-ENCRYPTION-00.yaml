abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document was prepared as part of the IETF response to
    concerns\n   about \"pervasive monitoring\" as articulated in [I-D.farrell-perpass-\n
    \  attack].  It begins by exploring terminology that has been used in\n   IETF
    standards (and in academic publications) to describe encryption\n   and key management
    techniques, with a focus on authentication vs.\n   anonymity.  Based on this analysis,
    it propose a new term, \"pervasive\n   encryption\" (PE) to describe a goal for
    IETF security protocols, one\n   countermeasure to pervasive monitoring.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
