abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The path vector extension [I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector] has extended\n
    \  the original ALTO protocol [RFC7285] with the ability to represent\n   not
    only end-to-end metrics but also information about shared link\n   risk groups
    (SLRG).\n\n   However, straw man algorithms to compute ALTO path vector can contain\n
    \  redundant information and result in unnecessary communication\n   overhead.
    \ The situation gets even worse when certain ALTO extensions\n   are enabled,
    for example, the incremental extension\n   [I-D.ietf-alto-incr-update-sse] which
    continuously pushes data\n   changes to ALTO clients.\n\n   In this document,
    an algorithm is described which can effectively\n   reduce the communication overhead
    while still containing the same\n   information as in the original path vector.
    \ The algorithm is fully\n   compatible with the path vector extension and has
    several by-products\n   which can be leveraged by other extensions to achieve
    better\n   performance.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
