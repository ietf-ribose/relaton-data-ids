abstract:
- content: "<p>The BIER WG includes, in it's charter, work on developing mechanisms
    to transport BIER natively in IPv6. This document is intended to help the WG with
    this effort by specifying requirements for transporting packets, with Bit Index
    Explicit Replication (BIER) headers, in an IPv6 environment. There will be a need
    to send IPv6 payloads, to multiple IPv6 destinations, using BIER. There have been
    several proposed solutions in this area. But there hasn't been a document which
    describes the problem and lists the requirements. The goal of this document is
    to describe the BIER IPv6 requirements, summarize the proposed solutions, and
    guide the working group in understanding the benefits, and drawbacks, of the various
    solutions and to help in the development of acceptable solutions.</p>"
