abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note presents mechanisms for address selection in hosts
    within a\n   multihomed site.  The goal of the presented mechanisms is to allow\n
    \  hosts within the multihomed site to establish new communications\n   after
    an outage.  The presented mechanisms are not by themselves a\n   complete multihoming
    solution but rather a component of such\n   solution.\n\t </p>\n      "
