abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a mechanism for creating shared,secret,
    random bits. This document describes extensions to the IKEv2protocol to use random
    bits created via QKD as keys for IPsec. TheDiffie-Hellman key agreement mechanism
    is replaced with QKD. The useof QKD-generated keys with standard IPsec will extend
    the lifetime ofprivacy guarantees for IPsec-protected data: future technologicaladvances
    that break Diffie-Hellman key exchange will not disclosedata until such time as
    the encryption algorithm used for the IPsectunnel is broken.</p>"
