abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination
    of\n   traffic flow specification rules.  This has many possible\n   applications
    but the primary one for many network operators is the\n   distribution of traffic
    filtering actions for DDoS mitigation.  The\n   flow-spec standard RFC5575 [2]
    defines a redirect-to-VRF action for\n   policy-based forwarding but this mechanism
    is not always sufficient,\n   particular if the redirected traffic needs to be
    steered into an\n   engineered path.\n\n   This document defines a new redirect-to-Path-id
    (32-bit or 128-bit)\n   flow-spec action to provide advanced redirection capabilities.
    \ When\n   activated, the flowspec signalled Path-id is used to identify the\n
    \  next-hop redirect information within a localized to the router Path-\n   id
    redirect table.  The Path-id redirect table is a table providing a\n   list of
    Path-id's and router local redirect information.  This allows\n   a Flowspec signalled
    redirect towards a next-hop IP address, next-hop\n   local interface or next-hop
    (traffic engineered) tunnel interface.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
