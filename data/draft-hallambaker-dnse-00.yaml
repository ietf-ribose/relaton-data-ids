abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes DNSE-JX, a transport security mechanism for
    the DNS protocol. The mechanism may be employed to secure communication between
    a client and its resolver or between a resolver and an authoritative server. Service
    binding including key exchange is effected using the JSON Service Connect (JCX)
    Protocol. DNS protocol messages are wrapped in a new framing protocol. Deployment
    of the new security mechanism compliments DNSSEC.</p>"
