abstract:
  content: <p>This document defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), apeer-to-peer
    (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet. A P2Psignaling protocol provides
    its clients with an abstract storage andmessaging service between a set of cooperating
    peers that form theoverlay network. RELOAD is designed to support a P2P SessionInitiation
    Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by otherapplications with similar
    requirements by defining new usages thatspecify the kinds of data that must be
    stored for a particularapplication. RELOAD defines a security model based on a
    certificateenrollment service that provides unique identities. NAT traversal isa
    fundamental service of the protocol. RELOAD also allows accessfrom "client" nodes
    which do not need to route traffic or store datafor others.</p>
