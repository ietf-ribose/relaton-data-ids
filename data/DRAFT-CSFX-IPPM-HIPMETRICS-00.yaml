abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a set of metrics for high-precision networking\n
    \  services.  These metrics can be used to assess the service levels\n   that
    are being delivered for a networking flow.  Specifically, they\n   can be used
    to determine the degree of compliance with which service\n   levels are being
    delivered relative to service level objectives that\n   were defined for the flow.
    \ The metrics can be used as part of flow\n   records and/or accounting records.
    \ They can also be used to\n   continuously monitor the quality with which high-precision
    networking\n   service are being delivered.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
