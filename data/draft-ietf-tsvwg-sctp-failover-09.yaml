abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the major advantages of SCTP is the support of multi-homed communication.
    A multi-homed SCTP end-point has the ability to withstand network failures by
    migrating the traffic from an inactive network to an active one. However, if the
    failover operation as specified in [RFC4960] is followed, there can be a significant
    delay in the migration to the active destination addresses, thus severely reducing
    the effectiveness of the SCTP failover operation. This memo complements [RFC4960]
    by the introduction of the Potentially Failed path state and the associated new
    failover operation called SCTP-PF to apply during a network failure. In addition,
    the memo complements [RFC4960] by introducing of alternative switchover operation
    modes for the data transfer path management after the recovery of a failed primary
    path. These modes offers for more performance optimal operation in some network
    environments. The implementation of the additional switchover operation modes
    is optional. The procedures defined in the document require only minimal modifications
    to the current specification. The procedures are sender-side only and do not impact
    the SCTP receiver.</p>"
