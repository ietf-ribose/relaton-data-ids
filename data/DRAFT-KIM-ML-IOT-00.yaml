abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document shares knowledge and insights regarding applying\n
    \  machine learning techniques on wireless sensor networks.  It firstly\n   introduces
    advantages and difficulties in adopting machine learning\n   techniques on wireless
    sensor networks.  Though dynamicity and\n   unpredictability of wireless networks
    make it difficult to train the\n   model with various possible scenarios, it has
    strong ability in terms\n   of flexibility.  This document also overviews several
    works that\n   applied machine learning techniques on diverse research areas\n
    \  including networking, communications and lossy environment.  The\n   ultimate
    purpose of this document is to discuss a proper research\n   direction aiming
    the realization of a system that detects, predicts\n   and recovers from abnormal
    situations on wireless sensor networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
