abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Users are often connected to Internet with very few outgoing
    ports\n   available, such as only port 80 and 443 over TCP.  This situation has\n
    \  many implications on designing, deploying and using IETF protocols,\n   such
    as encaspulating protocols within HTTP, difficulty to do traffic\n   engineering,
    quality of service, peer-to-peer, multi-channel\n   protocols or deploying new
    transport protocols.  This document\n   describes the situation and its implications.\n\n\t
