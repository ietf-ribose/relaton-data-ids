abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two methods for producing an integrity check
    value from a Diffie-Hellman key pair and one method for producing an integrity
    check value from an Elliptic Curve key pair. This behavior is needed for such
    operations as creating the signature of a PKCS #10 certification request. These
    algorithms are designed to provide a proof-of-possession rather than general purpose
    signing.</p>"
