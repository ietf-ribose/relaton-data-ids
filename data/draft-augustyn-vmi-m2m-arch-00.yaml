abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture and model for an unrestricted
    interconnect, 'many-to-many', case of Virtual Metropolitan Internetworks (VMI).
    This model most closely resembles LAN operations of L2 services offered by many
    Providers. It is intended to facilitate the continuing effort to specify the set
    of protocols and capabilities necessary for implementation of provider provisioned,
    broadcast domain, L2 networks (VMI)[4]. VMI is a case of a Provider Provisioned
    Virtual Private Network (PPVPN)[2].</p>"
