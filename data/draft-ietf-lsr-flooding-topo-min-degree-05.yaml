abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an algorithm for a node to compute a flooding
    topology, which is a subgraph of the complete topology per underline physical
    network. When every node in an area automatically calculates a flooding topology
    by using a same algorithm and floods the link states using the flooding topology,
    the amount of flooding traffic in the network is greatly reduced. This would reduce
    convergence time with a more stable and optimized routing environment.</p>"
