abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Saratoga transfer protocol.  Saratoga
    was\n   originally developed to transfer remote-sensing imagery efficiently\n
    \  from a low-Earth-orbiting satellite constellation, but is useful for\n   many
    other scenarios, including ad-hoc peer-to-peer communications,\n   delay-tolerant
    networking, and grid computing.  Saratoga is a simple,\n   lightweight, content
    dissemination protocol that builds on UDP, and\n   optionally uses UDP-Lite.  Saratoga
    is intended for use when moving\n   files or streaming data between peers which
    may have permanent,\n   sporadic or intermittent connectivity, and is capable
    of transferring\n   very large amounts of data reliably under adverse conditions.
    \ The\n   Saratoga protocol is designed to cope with highly asymmetric link or\n
    \  path capacity between peers, and can support fully-unidirectional\n   data
    transfer if required.  In scenarios with dedicated links,\n   Saratoga focuses
    on high link utilization to make the most of limited\n   connectivity times, while
    standard congestion control mechanisms can\n   be implemented for operation over
    shared links.  Loss recovery is\n   implemented via a simple negative-ack ARQ
    mechanism.  The protocol\n   specified in this document is considered to be appropriate
    for\n   experimental use on private IP networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
