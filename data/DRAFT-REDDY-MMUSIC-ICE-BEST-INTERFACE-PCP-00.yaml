abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A host with multiple interfaces needs to choose the best interface\n
    \  for communication.  Oftentimes, this decision is based on a static\n   configuration
    and does not consider the link characteristics of that\n   interface, which may
    affect the user experience.\n\n   This document describes a mechanism for an endpoint
    to query the link\n   characteristics from the access router (the router at the
    other end\n   of the endpoint's access link) using a Port Control Protocol (PCP)\n
    \  Flow Extension.  This information influences endpoint's Interactive\n   Connectivity
    Establishment (ICE) candidate selection algorithm.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
