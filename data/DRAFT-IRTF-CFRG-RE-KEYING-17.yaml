abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A certain maximum amount of data can be safely encrypted when
    encryption is performed under a single key. This amount is called the \"key lifetime\".
    This specification describes a variety of methods for increasing the lifetime
    of symmetric keys. It provides two types of re-keying mechanisms based on hash
    functions and block ciphers that can be used with modes of operations such as
    CTR, GCM, CBC, CFB, and OMAC.\n\n This document is a product of the Crypto Forum
    Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.\n\t </p>\n      "
