abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Networks that use SIP to start and stop sessions between their
    users\nwill frequently be upgraded with software and hardware changes.\nUsers
    will similarly frequently change their client software and the\nway they use the
    network.  In order to allow troubleshooting and\nregression testing, it is useful
    to provide debugging as part of the\nnetwork fabric.  This draft describes a SIP
    private header that\ntriggers logging of SIP signalling and identifies logs at
    mulitiple\nSIP entities as belonging to a single end-to-end session.\n\t </p>\n
