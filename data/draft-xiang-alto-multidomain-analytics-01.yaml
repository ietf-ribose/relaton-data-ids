abstract:
- content: "<p>As the data volume increases exponentially over time, data analytics
    is transiting from a single-domain network to a multi-domain, geo- distributed
    network, where different member networks contribute various resources, e.g., computation,
    storage and networking resources, to collaboratively collect, share and analyze
    extremely large amounts of data. Such a network calls for a resource orchestration
    framework that emphasizes the performance predictability of data analytics jobs,
    the high utilization of resources, and the autonomy and privacy of member networks.
    This document presents the design of Unicorn, a unified resource orchestration
    framework for multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics, which uses the Application-Layer
    Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol as the key component for (1) allows member
    networks to provide accurate information on different types of resources; (2)
    keeps the private information of member networks; and (3) allows data analytics
    jobs to accurately describe their requirements of different types of resources.
    As a part of Unicorn, an ALTO extension for privacy-preserving interdomain information
    aggregation is also presented.</p>"
