abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Extension Headers allow for the extension of the IPv6
    protocol,\n   and provide support for some core functionality such as IPv6\n   fragmentation.
    \ However, IPv6 Extension Headers are deemed to present\n   a challenge to IPv6
    implementations and networks, and are known to be\n   intentionally filtered in
    some existing IPv6 deployments.  This\n   summarizes the issues associated with
    IPv6 extension headers, and\n   presents real-world data regarding the extent
    to which packets with\n   IPv6 extension headers are filtered in the public Internet,
    and where\n   in the network such filtering occurs.  Additionally, it provides
    some\n   guidance to operators in troubleshooting IPv6 blackholes resulting\n
    \  from the use of IPv6 extension headers.  Finally, this document\n   provides
    some advice to protocol designers, and discusses areas where\n   further work
    might be needed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
