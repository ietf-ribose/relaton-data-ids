abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A wavelength switched optical network (WSON) requires that certain
    \nkey information elements are made available to facilitate path \ncomputation
    and the establishment of label switching paths (LSPs). \nThe information model
    described in \"Routing and Wavelength Assignment \nInformation for Wavelength
    Switched Optical Networks\" shows what \ninformation is required at specific points
    in the WSON. \n\nThe information may be used in Generalized Multiprotocol Label
    \nSwitching (GMPLS) signaling protocols, and may be distributed by \nGMSPL routing
    protocols. Other distribution mechanisms (for example, \nXML-based protocols)
    may also be used. \n\nThis document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings
    for the \ninformation elements necessary to operate a WSON. It is intended that
    \nprotocol-specific documents will reference this memo to describe how \ninformation
    is carried for specific uses. \n\n \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].\n\t </p>\n      "
