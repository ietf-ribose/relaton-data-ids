abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how Message Disposition Notifications
    [MDN]\n   are used to indicate the supported features of a user's Mail User\n
    \  Agent (MUA).  Knowing the supported features of a recipient or the\n   recipient's
    MUA allows a sender to generate messages which take\n   advantage of those features.\n
    \n   Features indicate the MIME content-types are supported by the\n   Mail User
    Agent, or finer gradations of features such as\n   resolution, maximum image size,
    or software version number.\n   The representation of features is still under
    discussion in\n   the CONNEG working group.\n \n   Features are registered using
    the framework described in [FEATURES].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
