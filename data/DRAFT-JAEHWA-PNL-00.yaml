abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>An important challenge in wireless sensor network (WSN) is that
    how\nto route data packets from sources to base station energy efficiently.\nInspiring
    data fusion feature and multi-hop routing, in this document,\nwe introduce a clustering
    approach called PLIR (Prolonging Network\nLifetime via Intra-Cluster Routing)
    for saving energy and\ndistributing data dissipation evenly by improving BS cluster
    formation\nalgorithm of LEACH-Centralized and providing 3-hop routing algorithm\nwithin
    clusters. Hence, it prolongs the lifetime of WSN. PLIR consumes\nless energy and
    reduces communication overhead, and extends the\nnetwork lifetime compared with
    other approaches.\n\t </p>\n      "
