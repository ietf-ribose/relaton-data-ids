abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms\n
    \  [RFC6291] are basic building blocks for every communication layer and\n   technology.
    \ The current practice is that many technologies and\n   layers have their own
    OAM protocols.  In the current situation there\n   is a little or no re-use of
    software and hardware in the existing OAM\n   protocols.  Vendors and operators
    waste a lot through the whole OAM\n   life-cycle when a new technology is introduced.
    \ Integration of OAM\n   across multiple technologies is extremely difficult.
    \ In many cases\n   it is desirable to have a generic OAM to cover heterogeneous\n
    \  networking technologies.  An example to this generic approach is the\n   Bidirectional
    Forwarding Detection [BFD] mechanism that offers a way\n   to monitor, troubleshoot
    and maintain the network and services in\n   support multi-layer OAM independent
    of media, data protocols, and\n   routing protocols.  Generic OAM tools can be
    deployed over various\n   encapsulating protocols, and in various medium types.\n\n
    \  An example of an environment in which a generic and integrated OAM\n   protocol
    would be valuable is Service Function Chaining.  A Service\n   Function Chaining
    is composed by series of service Functions, that\n   can act in different layers
    but providing an end-to-end chain or path\n   from a source to destination in
    a given order [I.D-ietf-sfc-problem-\n   statement].  In service function chaining
    environment it is necessary\n   to provide end to end OAM across certain or all
    entities and\n   involving many layers.  OAM information should be exchanged between\n
    \  service functions in different layers while using various\n   encapsulating
    protocols.  In some cases OAM should cross different\n   administration and/or
    maintenance domains.\n\n   This document sets out the problem statement and architecture
    for the\n   Generic OAM in the Service Layer Routing.  This document will cover\n
    \  at least the basic OAM functions and information such as Connectivity\n   Verification
    (CV), Path Verification and Continuity Checks (CC),Path\n   Discovery / Fault
    Localization and Performance Monitoring necessary\n   to monitor and maintain
    the network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
