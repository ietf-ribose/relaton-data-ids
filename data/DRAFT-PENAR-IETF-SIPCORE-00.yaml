abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the 184 (Rated) Session Initiation Protocol\n
    \  (SIP) response code. This response code enables calling parties to\n   learn
    an intermediary rated their call attempt.  Depending on\n   rating (e.g. Likely
    Scam), the call may be rejected or go unanswered.\n   Through a 1xx code, the
    caller?s network may become aware future\n   attempts to contact the same User
    Agent Server will likely go\n   unanswered. The initial use case driving the need
    for a 184 response\n   code is when the intermediary is an analytics engine. In
    this case,\n   the rating is constructed via machine or other process. This\n
    \  contrasts with 607 (Unwanted) &amp; 608 (Rejected) SIP response codes in\n
    \  which a human at target User Agent Server, or terminating network\n   analytics,indicate
    the call may not completed.  This document also\n   defines use of a Call-Info
    header field in 184 responses to enable\n   negatively rated callers to contact
    entities that rated their calls\n   in error. This provides a remediation mechanism
    for legal callers\n   who find their calls going unanswered (not necessarily blocked).\n\n\n\t
