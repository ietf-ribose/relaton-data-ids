abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft presents a fault notification protocol for use in
    a GMPLS-\n   based failure recovery scheme.  The protocol guarantees recovery\n
    \  path(s) activation in a bounded time in the event of single resource\n   failures.
    \ These failures include fiber cut, transponder failure and\n   node failure.
    \ Bounded recovery time is achieved by pre-signaling\n   recovery paths whose
    nodes can be reached within a specific time,\n   based on the physical capabilities
    of the nodes and the delay\n   characteristics of the control plane.  We propose
    using a flooding\n   protocol for fault notification to allow for per-failure
    notification\n   and to speed up the recovery process.  We justify choices made
    for\n   the notification method and the messaging required for the protocol.\n\n
    \  The draft does not mandate a specific implementation of the Fault\n   Notification
    Protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
