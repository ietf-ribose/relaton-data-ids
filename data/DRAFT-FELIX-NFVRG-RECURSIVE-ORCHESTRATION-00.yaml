abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a policy-based resource management
    and\n   orchestration framework which aims at contributing towards the\n   current
    namesake NFVRG near-term work items.\n\n   It describes key points of the recursive
    resource orchestration\n   framework developed within the wider research area
    of federated\n   virtual network function orchestration.  The document also relates\n
    \  this effort with respect to other orchestration frameworks, thus\n   addressing
    both the NFV research and practitioner communities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
