abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism to establish traffic\n
    \  engineering IP tunnels. Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) is\n   used as
    a signaling protocol described in Generalized\n   Multi-Protocol Lable Swithing
    (GMPLS) RSVP Traffic Engineering\n   technology, but no MPLS forwarding capability
    is assumed on the\n   switched path. IP routing is used to switch IP traffic trunks.\n
    \  A simple GMPLS RSVP Traffic Engineering extension is needed to\n   setup the
    IP Route Switched Paths (RSPs).\n\t </p>\n      "
