abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A critical factor in achieving good performance for IP mobility
    \nprotocols is the design of L2 handover. Handover occurs when a \nMobile Node
    moves from one radio Access Point to another. If the new \nradio Access Point
    is associated with a new subnet, a change in \nrouting reachability may occur
    and require L3 protocol action on the \npart of the Mobile Node or Access Routers.
    If no change in subnet \noccurs, the Access Point may still need to take some
    action to \ninform the Access Router about a change in on-link reachability. In
    \neither case, prompt and timely information from L2 to the parties \ninvolved
    about the sequencing of handover can help optimize handover \nat the IP level.
    This draft discusses requirements for an L2 \nhandover protocol or API to support
    optimized handover.\n\t </p>\n      "
