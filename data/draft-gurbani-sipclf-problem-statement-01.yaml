abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Well-known web servers such as Apache and web proxies like Squidsupport
    event logging using a common log format. The logs producedusing these de-facto
    standard formats are invaluable to systemadministrators for trouble-shooting a
    server and tool writers tocraft tools that mine the log files and produce reports
    and trends.Furthermore, these log files can also be used to train anomalydetection
    systems and feed events into a security event managementsystem. The Session Initiation
    Protocol does not have a common logformat, and as a result, each server supports
    a distinct log formatthat makes it unnecessarily complex to produce tools to do
    trendanalysis and security detection. We propose a common log file formatfor SIP
    servers that can be used uniformly by proxies, registrars,redirect servers as
    well as back-to-back user agents.Status of this MemoThis Internet-Draft is submitted
