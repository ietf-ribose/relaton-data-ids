abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 8226 specifies the use of certificates for Secure Telephone\n
    \  Identity Credentials, and these certificates are often called \"STIR\n   Certificates\".
    \ RFC 8226 provides a certificate extension to\n   constrain the JSON Web Token
    (JWT) claims that can be included in the\n   Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT)
    as defined in RFC 8225.  If the\n   PASSporT signer includes a JWT claim outside
    the constraint\n   boundaries, then the PASSporT recipient will reject the entire\n
    \  PASSporT.  This document updates RFC 8226 to define an additional way\n   that
    the JWT claims can be constrained.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
