abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Fisheye State Routing (FSR) algorithm for ad hoc networks
    \nintroduces the notion of multi-level 'scope' to reduce routing \nupdate overhead
    in large networks.  A node stores the Link State \nfor every destination in the
    network.  It periodically broadcasts \nthe Link State update of a destination
    to its neighbors with a \nfrequency that depends on the hop distance to that destination
    \n(i.e., the 'scope' relative to that destination).  State updates \ncorresponding
    to far away destinations are propagated with lower \nfrequency than those for
    close by destinations.  From state updates,\nnodes construct the topology map
    of the entire network and compute \nefficient routes.  The route on which the
    packet travels becomes \nprogressively more accurate as the packet approaches
    its \ndestination.  FSR resembles Link State routing in that it propagates\nLink
    State updates.  However, the updates are propagated as \naggregates, periodically
    (with period dependent on distance) instead\nof being flooded individually from
    each source.  FSR leads to major \nreduction in link O/H caused by routing table
    updates.  It enhances \nscalability of large, mobile ad hoc networks.\n\t </p>\n
