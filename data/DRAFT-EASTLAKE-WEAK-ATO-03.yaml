abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The packet switched nature of the Internet Protocol (IP) provides
    no\n   inherent method to assure that a packet has been issued with a source\n
    \  address authorized for the sender and no inherent method to trace the\n   actual
    source of a packet.  These characteristics make it difficult\n   to take effective
    action concerning injurious packets which may have\n   originated, by accident
    or maliciously, virtually anywhere in the\n   Internet.\n \n   A lightweight IP
    level option is proposed that provides (1) some\n   assurance that packet's source
    addresses are authorized for their\n   sender, and (2) limited statistical tracing
    information such that, if\n   many bad packets are logged, the path to their source
    will be\n   revealed.\n \n   These features, even if not implemented throughout
    the Internet,\n   would provide significantly improved protection against packet
    level\n   abuse.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
