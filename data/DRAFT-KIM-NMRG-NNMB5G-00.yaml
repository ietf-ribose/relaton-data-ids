abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is derived from the intelligent artificial intelligent\n
    \  (AI) network and autonomous security, network management intend-based\n   technology
    to ensure constant security quality in B5G.  SOAR\n   (Security Orchestration
    Automation and Response) is needed by\n   autonomous security and network management
    to optimize an adaptive\n   B5G network.  The purpose of this document is to confirm
    whether the\n   requirements are reflected to future users and to develop and\n
    \  identify user provided by useful decision how to develop the system.\n   This
    document also covers the user requirements for autonomous\n   security and intend-based
    network management to ensure constant\n   security quality on B5G.\n\n\t </p>\n
