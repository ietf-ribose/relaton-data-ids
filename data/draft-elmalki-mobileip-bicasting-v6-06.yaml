abstract:
  content: "<p>Fast Handover for Mobile IPv6 [1] minimizes the amount of service disruption
    when performing layer-3 handovers. This draft extends the Fast Handover protocol
    with a simultaneous bindings function to minimize packet loss at the MN. Traffic
    for the MN is therefore bicast or n-cast for a short period to its current location
    and to one or more locations where the MN is expected to move to shortly. This
    removes the timing ambiguity regarding when to start sending traffic for the MN
    to its new point of attachment following a Fast Handover and allows the decoupling
    of layer-2 and layer-3 handovers. It also saves the MN periods of service disruption
    in the case of ping-pong movement.</p>"
