abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS cookies are a light-weight DNS transaction security mechanism designed
    for incremental deployment. They provide limited protection to DNS servers and
    resolvers against a variety of increasingly common denial-of-service and cache
    poisoning or forgery attacks by off-path attackers. DNS Cookies are tolerant of
    NAT, NAT-PT, and Anycast.</p>"
