abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Jon Postel's famous statement of \"Be liberal in what you accept,
    and\n   conservative in what you send\" is a principle that has long guided\n
    \  the design and implementation of Internet protocols.  The posture\n   this
    statement advocates promotes interoperability, but can produce\n   negative effects
    in the protocol ecosystem in the long term.  Those\n   effects can be avoided
    by maintaining protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
