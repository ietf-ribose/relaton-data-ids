abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The organizational separation between the operator of a TLS
    endpoint\n   and the certification authority can create limitations.  For example,\n
    \  the lifetime of certificates, how they may be used, and the\n   algorithms
    they support are ultimately determined by the\n   certification authority.  This
    document describes a mechanism by\n   which operators may delegate their own credentials
    for use in TLS,\n   without breaking compatibility with peers that do not support
    this\n   specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
