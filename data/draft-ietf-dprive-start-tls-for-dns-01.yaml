abstract:
- content: "<p>This document offers an approach to initiating TLS for DNS: use of
    a dedicated DNS-over-TLS port, and fallback to a mechanism for upgrading a DNS-over-TCP
    connection over the standard port (TCP/53) to a DNS-over-TLS connection. Encryption
    provided by TLS eliminates opportunities for eavesdropping on DNS queries in the
    network, such as discussed in RFC 7258. In addition it specifies two usage profiles
    for DNS-over-TLS. Finally, it provides advice on performance considerations to
    minimize overheads from using TCP and TLS with DNS, pertaining to both approaches.</p>"
