abstract:
- content: "<p>An EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route can optionally carry an IPv4 or
    IPv6 addresses associated with a MAC address. Remote PEs can use this information
    to populate their ARP/ND tables on IRB interfaces or their proxy-ARP/ND tables
    in Broadcast Domains (BD). PEs can then reply locally (act as an ARP/ND proxy)
    to IPv4 ARP requests and IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages and reduce/suppress
    the flooding produced by the Address Resolution procedure. However, the information
    conveyed in the MAC/IP route may not be enough for the remote PE to reply to local
    ARP or ND requests. For example, if a PE learns an IPv6-&gt;MAC ND entry via EVPN,
    the PE would not know if that particular IPv6-&gt;MAC pair belongs to a host,
    a router or a host with an anycast address, as this information is not carried
    in the EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement routes. Similarly, other information relevant
    to the IP-&gt;MAC ARP/ND entries may be needed. This document defines an Extended
    Community that is advertised along with an EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route and
    carries information relevant to the ARP/ND resolution, so that an EVPN PE implementing
    a proxy-ARP/ND function can reply to ARP Requests or Neighbor Solicitations with
    the correct information.</p>"
