abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the way of encapsulating IPv6, IPv4
    and ARP \n   packets over Fibre Channel.  This document specifies also the method
    \n   of forming IPv6 link-local addresses and statelessly autoconfigured \n   IPv6
    addresses on Fibre Channel networks, and a mechanism to perform \n   IPv4 address
    resolution over Fibre Channel networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
