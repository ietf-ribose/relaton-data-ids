abstract:
- content: "<p>Many clients need to establish secure connections to application services
    but face challenges establishing these connections due to the presence of middleboxes
    that terminate TLS connections from the client and restablish new TLS connections
    to the service. This document defines a mechanism for transporting TLS records
    in HTTP message bodies between clients and services. This enables clients and
    services to establish secure connections using TLS at the application layer, and
    treat any middleboxes that are intercepting traffic at the network layer as untrusted
    transport. In short, this mechanism moves the TLS handshake up the OSI stack to
    the application layer.</p>"
