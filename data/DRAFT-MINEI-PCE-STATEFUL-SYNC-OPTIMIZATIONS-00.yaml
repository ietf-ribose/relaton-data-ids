abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) has access to not
    only the\n   information carried by the network's IGP, but also to the set of\n
    \  active paths and their reserved resources for its computations.  The\n   additional
    state allows the PCE to compute constrained paths while\n   considering individual
    LSPs and their interactions.  This requires\n   reliable state synchronization
    mechanisms between the PCE and the\n   network, PCE and path computation clients
    (PCCs), and between\n   cooperating PCEs.  The basic mechanism for state synchronization
    is\n   part of the Stateful PCE specification.  This draft specifies\n   optimizations
    related to state synchronization procedures.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
