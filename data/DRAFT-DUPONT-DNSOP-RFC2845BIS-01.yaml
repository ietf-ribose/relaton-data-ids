abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This protocol allows for transaction level authentication using\n
    \  shared secrets and one way hashing.  It can be used to authenticate\n   dynamic
    updates as coming from an approved client, or to authenticate\n   responses as
    coming from an approved name server.\n\n   No provision has been made here for
    distributing the shared secrets:\n   it is expected that a network administrator
    will statically configure\n   name servers and clients using some out of band
    mechanism.\n\n   This document includes revised original TSIG specifications (RFC2845)\n
    \  and its extension for HMAC-SHA (RFC4635).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
