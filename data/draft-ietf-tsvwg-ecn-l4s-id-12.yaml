abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines the identifier to be used on IP packets
    for a new network service called low latency, low loss and scalable throughput
    (L4S). L4S uses an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) scheme that is similar
    to the original (or 'Classic') ECN approach. 'Classic' ECN marking was required
    to be equivalent to a drop, both when applied in the network and when responded
    to by a transport. Unlike 'Classic' ECN marking, for packets carrying the L4S
    identifier, the network applies marking more immediately and more aggressively
    than drop, and the transport response to each mark is reduced and smoothed relative
    to that for drop. The two changes counterbalance each other so that the throughput
    of an L4S flow will be roughly the same as a non-L4S flow under the same conditions.
    Nonetheless, the much more frequent control signals and the finer responses to
    them result in much more fine-grained adjustments, so that ultra-low and consistently
    low queuing delay (typically sub- millisecond on average) becomes possible for
    L4S traffic without compromising link utilization. Thus even capacity-seeking
    (TCP-like) traffic can have high bandwidth and very low delay at the same time,
    even during periods of high traffic load. The L4S identifier defined in this document
    distinguishes L4S from 'Classic' (e.g. TCP-Reno-friendly) traffic. It gives an
    incremental migration path so that suitably modified network bottlenecks can distinguish
    and isolate existing traffic that still follows the Classic behaviour, to prevent
    it degrading the low queuing delay and low loss of L4S traffic. This specification
    defines the rules that L4S transports and network elements need to follow to ensure
    they neither harm each other's performance nor that of Classic traffic. Examples
    of new active queue management (AQM) marking algorithms and examples of new transports
    (whether TCP-like or real-time) are specified separately.</p>"
