abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Real-time media streams are not resilient against packet losses.
    RTP\n[1] provides all the necessary mechanisms to restore ordering and\ntiming
    to properly reproduce a media stream at the recipient.  RTP\nalso provides continuous
    feedback about the overall reception quality\nfrom all receivers -- thereby allowing
    the sender(s) in the mid-term\n(in the order of several seconds to minutes) to
    adapt their coding\nscheme and transmission behavior to the observed network QoS.\nHowever,
    except for a few payload specific mechanisms [2], RTP makes\nno provision for
    timely feedback that would allow a sender to repair\nthe media stream immediately:
    through retransmissions, retro-active\nFEC, or media-specific mechanisms such
    as reference picture\nselection.\n\t </p>\n      "
