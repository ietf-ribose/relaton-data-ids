abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditionally, routing systems have implemented routing and signaling
    (e.g. MPLS) to control traffic forwarding in a network. Route computation has
    been controlled by relatively static policies that define link cost, route cost,
    or import and export routing policies. With the advent of highly dynamic data
    center networking, on-demand WAN services, dynamic policy-driven traffic steering
    and service chaining, the need for real-time security threat responsiveness via
    traffic control, and a paradigm of separating policy-based decision- making from
    the router itself, the need has emerged to more dynamically manage and program
    routing systems in order to control routing information and traffic paths and
    to extract network topology information, traffic statistics, and other network
    analytics from routing systems. This document proposes meeting this need via an
    Interface to the Routing System (I2RS).</p>"
