abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the handling of realtime fax calls inMegaco/H.248
    controlled MGs. The call setup and capabilitynegotiation is done with support
    of the control domain with Megacocommands. The switch over to fax or modem, upon
    detection of therelevant tones, is done in an autonomous way, without interventionof
    the control domain.In the Appendix, the Megaco messages for a call setup scenario
    withcapability negotiation are shown, to point out the structure of theto the
    transmitting MG. Switching to T.38 is done after reception ofV.21 flags.In the
    other flows, T.38 is not enabled, both MGs switch to thefallback case, fax pass-through
    mode.This document is based on the superior framework (reference [2]).The reader
    should be familiar with [2].SDP sessions in the local and remote descriptors.Call
    flow diagrams are given as example:In the first flow, a T.30 CNG tone is generated
    by the transmittingterminal, the transmitting MG signals the detection towards
    thereceiving MG. Switching to T.38 is done by both MGs as soon aspossible.In the
    second example, a T.30 CED tone is sent by the receivingterminal. As this tone
    is no clear indication that a FAX will besent, the receiving MG will switch to
    VBD after signaling this event</p>"
