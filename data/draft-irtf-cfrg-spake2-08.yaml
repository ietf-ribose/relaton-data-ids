abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SPAKE2 and its augmented variant SPAKE2+, which
    are protocols for two parties that share a password to derive a strong shared
    key with no risk of disclosing the password. This method is compatible with any
    prime order group, is computationally efficient, and SPAKE2 (but not SPAKE2+)
    has a security proof.</p>"
