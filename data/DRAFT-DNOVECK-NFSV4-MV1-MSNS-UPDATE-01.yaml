abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents necessary clarifications and corrections\n
    \  concerning features related to the use of location-related attributes\n   in
    NFSv4.1.  These include migration, which transfers responsibility\n   for a file
    system from one server to another, and trunking which\n   deals with the discovery
    and control of the set of network addresses\n   to use to access a file system.
    \ This document updates RFC5661.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
