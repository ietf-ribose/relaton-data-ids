abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends the Discovery Proxy for Multicast DNS-Based\n
    \  Service Discovery specification.  It describes a lightweight relay\n   mechanism,
    a Discovery Relay, which allows Discovery Proxies to\n   provide service on links
    to which the hosts on which they are running\n   are not directly attached.\n\n\t
