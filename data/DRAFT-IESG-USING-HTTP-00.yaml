abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Recently  there  has  been  widespread  interest in using Hypertext\nTransport
    Protocol (HTTP) as a substrate  for  other  applications-level\nprotocols.   This
    \ document  relates  current  IESG  and IAB thinking on\ntechnical particulars
    of such use, including use of default  ports,  URL\nschemes,  and  HTTP  security
    \ mechanisms.   This thinking is subject to\nchange as discussion continues and
    more experience is gained  with  such\nuse.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
