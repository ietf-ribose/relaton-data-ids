abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of this document is to analyze the issues that
    have\n   arisen so far and to propose several use cases for the Fixed Mobile\n
    \  Convergence.  The term Fixed Mobile Convergence spans several\n   scenarios
    from true integration of fixed and mobile terminals,\n   services, and network
    infrastructure on both technical and management\n   level down to pure interworking
    between fixed and mobile networks in\n   serving access for multi-interface terminals
    like today's\n   smartphones.  In the interworking scenario, the mobile network
    passes\n   on the mobile subscribers policies to the fixed broadband network in\n
    \  order to maintain the end-to-end service level agreement and to\n   support
    remote terminal and access network management.  Explicitly,\n   the fixed broadband
    network must have partnership with the mobile\n   network in Fixed Mobile Convergence
    interworking scenario.  This\n   document gives a brief overview of the assumed
    Fixed Mobile\n   Convergence architecture and related works and then introduces\n
    \  several Intarea type of use cases based on the partnership in Fixed\n   Mobile
    Convergence architecture, such as User Equipment\n   identification, mobility
    consideration, such as mobility in Wi-Fi\n   network and Personalization of streaming
    type of considerations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
