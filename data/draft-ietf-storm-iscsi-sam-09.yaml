abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) is a SCSI transport
    protocol that maps the SCSI family of protocols onto TCP/IP. The iSCSI protocol
    as specified in RFC 7143 (and as previously specified by the combination of RFC
    3720 and RFC 5048) is based on the SAM-2 (SCSI Architecture Model - 2) version
    of the SCSI family of protocols. This document defines enhancements to the iSCSI
    protocol to support certain additional features of the SCSI protocol that were
    defined in SAM-3, SAM-4, and SAM-5.</p>"
