abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies SWAN, a stateless network protocol which uses
    distributed control algorithms to deliver service differentiation in MANETs. SWAN
    uses rate control for UDP and TCP best-effort traffic, and source-based admission
    control for UDP real-time traffic. SWAN also uses explicit congestion control
    notification (ECN) to dynamically regulate admitted real-time traffic in the face
    of network dynamics brought on by mobility or traffic overload conditions. SWAN
    is designed to support real-time services over best effort MACs without the need
    to install and maintain costly QOS state at MANET nodes. This makes the SWAN approach
    to MANET QOS simple, scalable, and robust. The ns-2 simulation code is available
    from the web http://comet.columbia.edu/swan/).</p>"
