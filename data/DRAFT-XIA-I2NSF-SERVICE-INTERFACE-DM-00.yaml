abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft proposes a generic and intent-driven data model
    for NSF\n   security policy configuration used by I2NSF clients to negotiate\n
    \  their security requirements with various kinds of entities that each\n   provide
    one or more NSFs. The Role Based Access Control (RBAC)\n   reference model [INCITS359
    RBAC] is used to represent which\n   operations can be performed on what set of
    secured objects.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
