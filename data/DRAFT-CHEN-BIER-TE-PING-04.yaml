abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)-TE shares architecture
    and\n   packet formats with BIER-TE forwards and replicates packets based on\n
    \  a BitString in the packet header, but every BitPosition of the\n   BitString
    of a BIER-TE packet indicates one or more adjacencies.\n\n   This document describes
    the mechanism and basic BIER-TE OAM packet\n   format that can be used to perform
    Ping and Traceroute on the BIER-TE\n   network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
