abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a base profile for TLS protocol versions
    1.2\n   and 1.3, as well as DTLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3 for use with\n
    \  the United States Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA)\n   Suite.\n\n
    \  The profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation\n   of
    all components of US National Security Systems that use TLS or\n   DTLS.  It is
    also appropriate for all other US Government systems\n   that process high-value
    information.\n\n   The profile is made publicly available here for use by developers
    and\n   operators of these and any other system deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
