abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A number of systems which understand X.509 client certificates
    have\ndeveloped various ad hoc mechanisms to map a certificate to a\n'userid'/'group(s)'
    value which can then be used for access control.\nThe mechanisms include idiosyncratic
    name forms for the SubjectName\nfield such as encoding the userid as a CommonName
    and the group as an\nOrganizationalUnit, or mapping the certificate against an
    entry in a\ndirectory system.  This document describes an otherName extension
    of\nthe GeneralName type which can be used in the SubjectAltName\nextension or
    IssuerAltName extension to directly encode userid and\ngroup information.\n\t
