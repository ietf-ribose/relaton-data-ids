abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft explores several possible remedies for a set of
    issues\n   that have been identified with the Session Initiation Protocol's non-\n
    \  INVITE transaction.  These proposed solutions are in rough form and\n   have
    not yet accumulated working group consensus.  They range from\n   minor extensions
    to protocol behavior to fundamentally changing the\n   non-INVITE transaction
    model.\n\t </p>\n      "
