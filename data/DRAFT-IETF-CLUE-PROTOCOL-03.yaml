abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CLUE protocol is an application protocol conceived for
    the\n   description and negotiation of a CLUE telepresence session.  The\n   design
    of the CLUE protocol takes into account the requirements and\n   the framework
    defined, respectively, in [I-D.ietf-clue-framework] and\n   [I-D.ietf-clue-telepresence-requirements].
    \ The companion document\n   [I-D.ietf-clue-signaling] delves into CLUE signaling
    details, as well\n   as on the SIP/SDP session establishment phase.  CLUE messages
    flow\n   across the CLUE data channel, based on reliable and ordered SCTP over\n
    \  DTLS transport, as described in [I-D.ietf-clue-datachannel].  Message\n   details,
    together with the behavior of CLUE Participants acting as\n   Media Providers
    and/or Media Consumers, are herein discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
