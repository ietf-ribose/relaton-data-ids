abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP routing protocol is used with external as well as internal
    neighbors to propagate route advertisements. In the case of external BGP sessions,
    there is typically a demarcation of administrative responsibility between the
    two entities. Provisioning, maintenance and administrative actions are communicated
    via off-line methods such as email or telephone calls. While these methods have
    been used for many years, it can be troublesome for an operator to correlate a
    BGP- related event in the network with a notice that was transmitted in email.
    This document proposes a new BGP message type, the Advisory message, which can
    be used to convey advisory information to a BGP speaker's peer. A capability is
    used to ensure that the recipient of the Advisory message is capable of supporting
    it.</p>"
