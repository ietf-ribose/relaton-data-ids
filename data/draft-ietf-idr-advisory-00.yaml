abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The BGP routing protocol is used with external as well as internalneighbors
    to propagate route advertisements. In the case of externalBGP sessions, there
    is typically a demarcation of administrativeresponsibility between the two entities.
    Provisioning, maintenanceand administrative actions are communicated via off-line
    methods suchas email or telephone calls. While these methods have been used formany
    years, it can be troublesome for an operator to correlate a BGP-related event
    in the network with a notice that was transmitted inemail.This document proposes
    a new BGP message type, the Advisory message,which can be used to convey advisory
    information to a BGP speaker'speer. A capability is used to ensure that the recipient
    of theAdvisory message is capable of supporting it.</p>"
