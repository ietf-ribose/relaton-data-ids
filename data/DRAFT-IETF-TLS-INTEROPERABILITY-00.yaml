abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a number of problems encountered when\n
    \  implementing TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and TLS Extensions for clients, and\n   their
    consequences.  The problems include servers that refuse to\n   connect with clients
    supporting newer versions of the protocol, or\n   that do not handle such negotiation
    properly.  Another problem\n   encountered is the incorrect use of values in the
    protocol messages.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
