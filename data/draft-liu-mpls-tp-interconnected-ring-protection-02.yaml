abstract:
- content: "<p>According to the ring protection Requirements in RFC 5654, Requirement
    93 : When a network is constructed from interconnected rings, MPLS-TP MUST support
    recovery mechanisms that protect user data that traverses more than one ring.
    This includes the possibility of failure of the ring-interconnect nodes and links,so
    this document will describle all kinds of interconnected ring Scenarios and several
    protection solutions for recovery the failure of the ring-interconnect nodes and
    Links. . This document is a product of a joint Internet Task Force(IETF) / International
    Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort
    to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
    to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network
    as defined by the ITU-T.</p>"
