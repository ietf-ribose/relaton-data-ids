abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes protection methods for the BIER-TE\n
    \  architecture [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].  These include 1+1 (live-live)\n   path/tree
    [RFC7431] redundancy, 1:1 path/tree protection, as well as\n   fast reroute (FRR)
    methods.  The latter may protect against link and/\n   or node failures and leverage
    infrastructure tunnels, BIER-in-BIER\n   encapsulation, or header modification
    for implementation.\n\n   In particular, this memo describes FRR for BIER-TE in
    detail.  FRR\n   for BIER-TE requires support from the BIER-TE controller and
    the BFRs\n   that are attached to a link/adjacency for which FRR protection is\n
    \  desired.  FRR relies on the BIER header described in [RFC8279] which\n   is
    also used by BIER-TE.  It does not require extensions or\n   modifications to
    existing BIER-TE tables.  However, the presented FRR\n   procedures need some
    additional forwarding plane logic on the BFR.\n   An additional table is needed
    that carries information about pre-\n   computed backup paths.  When a failure
    is detected, the information\n   from this table is used to modify the bitstring
    in the BIER header\n   before forwarding a packet over a backup path.  To prevent
    undesired\n   packet duplication, packets should be tunneled on the backup paths.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
