abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism that can be implemented in layer-2
    devices to mitigate attack vectors based on Neighbor Discovery messages. It is
    meant to complement other mechanisms implemented in layer-2 devices such as Router
    Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) and DHCPv6-Shield, with the goal of achieving a
    comprehensive IPv6 First Hop Security solution. This document is motivated by
    the desire to achieve feature parity with IPv4 with respect to First Hop Security
    mechanisms.</p>"
