abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transporting IPv4 packets encapsulated in IPv6 is a common
    solution\n   to the problem of IPv4 service continuity over IPv6-only provider\n
    \  networks.  A number of differing functional approaches have been\n   developed
    for this, each having their own specific characteristics.\n   As these approaches
    share a similar functional architecture and use\n   the same data plane mechanisms,
    this memo describes a specification\n   whereby a single CPE can interwork with
    all of the standardized and\n   proposed approaches to providing encapsulated
    IPv4 in IPv6 services.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
