abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This specification extends IPv6 Neighbor Discovery with features
    thatare useful for mobile nodes. These features provide information forthe purposes
    of detecting the loss of Router Advertisements,determining the global address
    of the router, or for discoveringwhich routers are also Mobile IPv6 home agents.
    These extensions arerequired for Mobile IPv6 operation, but they are also useful
    for anytype of nomadic or mobile nodes. This document revises a part of RFC3775
    which originally defined these extensions.</p>"
