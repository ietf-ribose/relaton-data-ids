abstract:
- content: "<p>Realizing network slices may require the Service Provider to have the
    ability to partition a physical network into multiple logical networks of varying
    sizes, structures, and functions so that each slice can be dedicated to specific
    services or customers. Multiple network slices can be realized on the same network
    while ensuring slice elasticity in terms of network resource allocation. This
    document describes a scalable solution to realize network slicing in IP/MPLS networks
    by supporting multiple services on top of a single physical network by relying
    on compliant domains and nodes to provide forwarding treatment (scheduling, drop
    policy, resource usage) on to packets that carry identifiers that indicate the
    slicing service that is to be applied to the packets.</p>"
