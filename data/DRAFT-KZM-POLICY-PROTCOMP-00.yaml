abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF's RAP Working Group has almost completed its task of
    defining\nCOPS as a standards-track protocol for RSVP Admission Policy.  The\nWG's
    charter is now being extended to cover standardizing a policy\nprovisioning protocol,
    and the proposal put forward for consideration\nby the WG is based on defining
    a new Client-type for COPS.  This new\nClient-type is intended to work in conjunction
    with the QoS Policy\nobjects and schema definitions being defined in two other
    IETF Working\nGroups: Differentiated Services, and Policy.  Before proceeding
    any\nfurther, it has been requested that a comparison be undertaken as to\nwhy
    COPS is better suited to this than a (modified if necessary)\nversion of SNMP.
    \ This memo attempts to document such a comparison.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
