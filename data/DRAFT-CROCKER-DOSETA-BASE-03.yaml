abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DomainKeys Security Tagging (DOSETA) is a component mechanism
    that\n   enables easy development of security-related services, such as for\n
    \  authentication or encryption.  It uses self-certifying keys based on\n   domain
    names.  The domain name owner can be any actor involved in the\n   handling of
    the data, such as the author's organization, a server\n   operator or one of their
    agents.  The DOSETA Library provides a\n   collection of common capabilities,
    including canonicalization,\n   parameter tagging and key retrieval.  The DOSETA
    Signing Template\n   creates common framework for a signature of data that are
    in a\n   \"header/content\" form.  Defining the meaning of a signature is the\n
    \  responsibility of the service that incorporates DOSETA.  Data\n   security
    is enforced through the use of cryptographic algorithms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
