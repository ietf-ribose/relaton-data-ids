abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a profile for compressing RTP/UDP/IP using
    the\nEfficient Protocol Independent Compression (EPIC) [2] scheme.\nThe RObust
    Header Compression [1] scheme is designed to compress\npacket headers over error
    prone channels.  It is built around an\nextensible core framework that can be
    tailored to compress new\nprotocol stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles.\nThis
    profile gives behaviours similar to (a subset of) the\nfunctionality of [1] and
    is useful to show how EPIC would work on a\nprotocol stack about which much is
    already known.\n\t </p>\n      "
