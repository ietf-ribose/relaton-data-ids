abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Over the many years since the introduction of the Internet
    Protocol,\n   we have seen a number of transitions, throughout the protocol stack,\n
    \  from one protocol or technology to another.  Many protocols and\n   technologies
    were not designed to enable smooth transition to\n   alternatives or to easily
    deploy extensions, and thus some\n   transitions, such as the introduction of
    IPv6, have been difficult.\n   This document attempts to summarize some basic
    principles to enable\n   future transitions, and also summarizes what makes for
    a good\n   transition plan.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
