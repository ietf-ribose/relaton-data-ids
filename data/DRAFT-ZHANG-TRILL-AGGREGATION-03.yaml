abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies TRILL active/active edge which allows\n
    \  multiple RBridges concurrently forward data frames of the same VLAN\n   on
    links bundled by Link Aggregation. With this kind of connection,\n   end nodes
    may increase the bandwidth and reliability of the access at\n   the edge of TRILL
    campuses. It's required that no loop or duplication\n   is caused by this new
    connection type. Besides this basic\n   requirement, this document outlines other
    potential issues associated\n   with TRILL active/active edge and investigates
    how these issues may\n   be addressed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
