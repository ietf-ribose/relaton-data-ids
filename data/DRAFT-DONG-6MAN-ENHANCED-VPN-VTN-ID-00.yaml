abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a new option type to carry virtual transport\n
    \  network identifier (VTN ID) in the IPv6 extensions headers to\n   identify
    the virtual transport network the packet belongs to. The\n   procedure of processing
    the VTN option is also specified. This\n   provides a scalable solution for data
    plane encapsulation of\n   enhanced VPN (VPN+) as described in I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn.
    One\n   typical use case of VPN+ is to provide transport network slicing in\n
    \  5G, while it could also be used in more general cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
