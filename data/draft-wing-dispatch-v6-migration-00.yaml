abstract:
  content: "\t <t>During the migration from IPv4 to IPv6, it is anticipated that anIPv6
    path might be broken for a variety of reasons, causing endpointsto not receive
    RTP data. Connectivity checks would detect and avoidthe user noticing such a problem,
    but there is industry reluctance toimplement connectivity checks.This document
    describes a mechanism allowing dual-stack SIP endpointsto attempt communications
    over IPv6 and fall back to IPv4 if the IPv6path is not working. The mechanism
    does not require connectivitychecks.</p>"
