abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft describes an IP fast re-route mechanism that providesbackup
    connectivity in the event of a link or router failure. In theabsence of single
    points of failure and asymmetric costs, themechanism provides complete protection
    against any single failure.If perfect repair is not possible, the identity of
    all theunprotected links and routers is known in advance.This IP Fast Reroute
    advanced method was invented in 2002 and draft(draft-bryant-ipfrr-tunnels-00.txt)
    describing it was submitted tothe IETF in May 2004. It was one of the first methods
    of achievingfull repair coverage in an IP Network, and as such the draft has beenwidely
    referenced in the academic literature.The authors DO NOT propose that this IPFRR
    method be implementedsince better IPFRR advanced method capable of achieving full
    repaircoverage have subsequently been invented.</p>"
