abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo proposes a way of transporting NETCONF over WebSocket\n
    \  protocol.  Web-based systems are increasing with the advancement of\n   Web
    technologies and emergence of cloud computing.  Management\n   systems that support
    browser-based interface are also getting common.\n   It's natural to expect network
    devices to have browser-based\n   managemaent interface.  Currently, however,
    few network management\n   protocols support being transported over HTTP.  NETCONF[RFC6241]
    was\n   defined to be sent over SOAP/HTTPS[RFC4743].  But, it falls short of\n
    \  fulfilling NETCONF specification in that it can't provide NETCONF\n   notification[RFC5277]
    because of HTTP's lack of bi-directional\n   capabilty.  At present, WebSocket
    protocol, the update of HTTP with\n   bi-directional capability, is available[RFC6455].
    \ This memo\n   describes the way NETCONF is sent over WebSocket protocol.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
