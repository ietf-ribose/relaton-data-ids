abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
    for\n   Persistent Web IDentifiers to web material in web archives using the\n
    \  'pwid' scheme name.  The purpose of the standard is to support\n   general,
    global, sustainable, humanly readable, technology agnostic,\n   persistent and
    precise web references for web materials in web\n   archives in a way that can
    make them potentially resolvable.\n\n   The PWID URI can assist in two ways: First,
    by providing potential\n   resolvable precise and persistent reference scheme
    for web archive\n   materials, which is not sufficiently covered by existing web\n
    \  reference practices and new suggested referencing methods.  Second,\n   to
    specify web elements in web collections (also known as web corpus)\n   even for
    collections where there are references to web elements in\n   several archives.\n\n\t
