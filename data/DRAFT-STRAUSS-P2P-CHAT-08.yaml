abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This memo presents the third version of a protocol for a
    peer-to-peer\n   based chat system.  In this version it is extended for supporting\n
    \  message exchange in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) that suffer from\n   node
    mobility.  Messages can be cryptographically signed, encrypted\n   and anonymized
    allowing authentic and closed group communication as\n   well as anonymous communication.
    \ This work is input for a practical\n   course on software engineering at Technische
    Universitaet\n   Braunschweig.  It is experimental work that is not intended to
    go to\n   the IETF standards track.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
