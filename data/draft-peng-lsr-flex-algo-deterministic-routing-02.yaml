abstract:
- content: "<p>IGP Flex Algorithm proposes a solution that allows IGPs themselves
    to compute constraint based paths over the network, and it also specifies a way
    of using Segment Routing (SR) Prefix-SIDs and SRv6 locators, or pure IP prefix
    to steer packets along the constraint- based paths. This document describes how
    to compute deterministic delay paths within Flex-algo plane.</p>"
