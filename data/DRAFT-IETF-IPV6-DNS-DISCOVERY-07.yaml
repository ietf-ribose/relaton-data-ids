abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This documents specifies 3 well known addresses to configure stub\nresolvers
    on IPv6 nodes to enable them to communicate with recursive\nDNS server with minimum
    configuration in the network and without\nrunning a discovery protocol on the
    end nodes.  This method may be\nused when no other information about the addresses
    of recursive DNS\nservers is available.  Implementation of stub resolvers using
    this as\ndefault configuration must provide a way to override this.\n\t </p>\n
