abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo proposes an extensible RTP monitoring framework for\n
    \  extending RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) with a new RTCP Extended\n   Reports
    (XR) (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding\n   media transmission
    or reception quality, following RTCP guidelines\n   established in RFC5968.  This
    memo suggests that a new block should\n   contain a single metric or a small number
    of metrics relevant to a\n   single parameter of interest or concern, rather than
    containing a\n   number of metrics which attempt to provide full coverage of all
    those\n   parameters of concern to a specific application.  Applications may\n
    \  then \"mix and match\" to create a set of blocks which covers their set\n   of
    concerns.  Where possible, a specific block should be designed to\n   be re-usable
    across more than one application, for example, for all\n   of voice, streaming
    audio and video.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
