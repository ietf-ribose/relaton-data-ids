abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a mechanism for protecting hosts connected
    to\n   a broadcast network against rogue DHCPv6 servers.  The aforementioned\n
    \  mechanism is based on DHCPv6 packet-filtering at the layer-2 device\n   on
    which the packets are received.  The aforementioned mechanism has\n   been widely
    deployed in IPv4 networks ('DHCP snooping'), and hence it\n   is desirable that
    similar functionality be provided for IPv6\n   networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
