abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document makes some observations on the effects of\n   virtualization
    on Internet architecture, as well as provides some\n   guidelines for further
    work at the IETF relating to virtualization.\n\n   This document also provides
    a summary of IETF technologies that\n   relate to network virtualization.  An
    understanding of what current\n   technologies there exist and what they can or
    cannot do is the first\n   step in developing plans for possible extensions.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
