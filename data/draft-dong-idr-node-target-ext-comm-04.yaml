abstract:
- content: <p>BGP has been used to distribute different types of routing and policy
    information. In some cases, the information distributed may be only intended for
    one or a particular group of BGP nodes in the network. Currently BGP does not
    have a generic mechanism of designating the target nodes of the routing information.
    This document defines a new type of BGP Extended Community called "Node Target".
    The mechanism of using the Node Target Extended Community to steer BGP route distribution
    to particular BGP nodes is specified.</p>
