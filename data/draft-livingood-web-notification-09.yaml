abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this document is to describe a method of providing
    critical end-user notifications to web browsers, which has been deployed by Comcast,
    an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Such a notification system is being used to
    provide near-immediate notifications to customers, such as to warn them that their
    traffic exhibits patterns that are indicative of malware or virus infection. There
    are other proprietary systems that can perform such notifications, but those systems
    utilize Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology. In contrast to DPI, this document
    describes a system that does not rely upon DPI, and is instead based in open IETF
    standards and open source applications. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
