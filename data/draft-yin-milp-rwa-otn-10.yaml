abstract:
- content: "<p>The RWA problem can be formulated as a Mixed-Integer linear program.
    Load balancing is a key factor for the optical transport networks. However, the
    existed approaches using mixed-Integer linear program to solve the RWA problem
    are not perfect enough without considering the load balancing of the networks.
    This documentary provides a model of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming to solve
    the problem of load balancing needed by routing and wavelength assignment (RWA)
    process in optical transport networks.</p>"
