abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a mechanism to extend the record header
    in TLS\n   and DTLS.  To that aim, the (D)TLS header is modified as follows: the\n
    \  length field is trimmed to 15 bits, and the length's top bit is given\n   the
    \"record header extension indicator\" semantics, allowing a sender\n   to signal
    that one or more record header extensions have been added\n   to this record.
    \ We define the generic format of a record header\n   extension and the general
    rules associated with its handling.  Any\n   details regarding syntax, semantics
    and negotiation of a specific\n   record header extension, are left to future
    documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
