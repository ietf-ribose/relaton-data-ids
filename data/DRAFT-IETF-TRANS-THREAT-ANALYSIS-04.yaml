abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an attack model and discusses threats
    for\n   the Web PKI context in which security mechanisms to detect mis-\n   issuance
    of web site certificates are being developed. The model\n   provides an analysis
    of detection and remediation mechanisms for\n   both syntactic and semantic mis-issuance.
    The model introduces an\n   outline of attacks to organize the discussion. The
    model also\n   describes the roles played by the elements of the Certificate\n
    \  Transparency (CT) system, to establish a context for the model.\n\n\t </p>\n
