  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes the decisions made in one pair of applications\n[4][5]
    that respectively serves and retrieve OpenPGP [3] Certificates\nand Revocation
    Signatures using the CERT Resources Record [2].  The\nintent is to provide a discussion
    on the kind of general updates\nneeded to the CERT specification, and some suggested
    specific updates\nfor the OpenPGP sub-type.  It is offered in the hope that this\nspecification,
    together with similar efforts for other applications,\ncan be reviewed when designing
    a generic solution or guidelines for\nstoring application keying material in the
    Domain Name System (DNS),\nshould it ever happen.\n\t </p>\n      "
