abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HTTP Level multicast, using BIER, is described as a use case
    in the\n   BIER Use Cases document.  HTTP Level Multicast is used in today's\n
    \  video streaming and delivery services such as HLS, AR/VR etc.,\n   generally
    realized over IP Multicast as well as other use cases such\n   as software update
    delivery.  A realization of \"HTTP Multicast\" over\n   \"IP Multicast\" is described
    for the video delivery use case.  IP\n   multicast is commonly used for IPTV services.
    \ DVB and BBF is also\n   developing a reference architecture for IP Multicast
    service.  A few\n   problems with IP Multicast, such as waste of transmission
    bandwidth,\n   increase in signaling when there are few users are described.\n
    \  Realization over BIER, through a BIER Multicast Overlay Layer, is\n   described
    as an alternative.  How BIER Multicast Overlay operation\n   improves over IP
    Multicast, such as reduction in signaling, dynamic\n   creation of multicast groups
    to reduce signaling and bandwidth\n   wastage is described.  We conclude with
    few next steps.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
