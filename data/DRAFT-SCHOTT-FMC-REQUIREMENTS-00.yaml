    \  Convergence) architecture and related works.  The purpose of the\n   document
    is to sketch a big picture for the FMC activity to ease\n   identifying whether

    analyzes some of issues that have arisen\n   so far and elaborates a set of requirements
    for the FMC system.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
