abstract:
  content: "<p>The IPv6 addressing architecture specifies formats for unicastaddresses,
    but provides no operational guidelines for their use.There is a clear need for
    IPv6 to support organizational-scopecommunications whether members of the organization
    are located in thesame site or different sites.Aspects of certain types of sites
    introduce challenges for supportingorganizational-scope communications. Of special
    interest are nomadicsites, e.g., sites that are intermittently-connected or disconnectedfrom
    the global Internet, sites that frequently change providerpoints of attachment,
    sites that temporarily or permanently mergewith other sites, etc. This memo will
    discuss scenarios and goals forIPv6 support organizational-scope communications.</p>"
