abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a large RTP session using the RTCP feedback mechanism defined
    in\n   RFC 4585, a feedback target may experience transient overload if some\n
    \  event causes a large number of receivers to send feedback at once.\n   This
    overload is usually avoided by ensuring that feedback reports\n   are forwarded
    to all receivers, allowing them to avoid sending\n   duplicate feedback reports.
    \ However, there are cases where it is not\n   recommended to forward feedback
    reports, and this may allow feedback\n   implosion.  This memo discusses these
    cases and defines a new RTCP\n   third-party loss report that can be used to inform
    receivers that the\n   feedback target is aware of some loss event, allowing them
    to\n   suppress feedback.  Associated SDP signalling is also defined.\n\n\t </p>\n
