abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF emergency services architecture assumes that the calling\ndevice
    has acquired rights to use the access network or that no\nauthentication is required
    for the access network, such as for public\nwireless access points.  Subsequent
    protocol interactions, such as\nobtaining location information, learning the address
    of the Public\nSafety Answering Point (PSAP) and the emergency call itself are\nlargely
    decoupled from the underlying network access procedures.\n\nIn some cases, the
    device does not have credentials for network\naccess, does not have a VoIP provider
    or application service provider\n(ASP), or the credentials have become invalid,
    e.g., because the user\nhas exhausted their prepaid balance or the account has
    expired.\n\nThis document provides a problem statement, introduces terminology\nand
    describes an extension for the base IETF emergency services\narchitecture to address
    these scenarios.\n\t </p>\n      "
