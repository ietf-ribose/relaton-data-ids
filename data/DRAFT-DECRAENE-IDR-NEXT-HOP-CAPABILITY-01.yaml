abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 5492 defines capabilities advertisement for the BGP peer.
    \ In\n   addition, it is useful to know the capabilities of the BGP Next-Hop,\n
    \  in particular for forwarding plane features.  RFC 5492 is not\n   applicable
    because the BGP peer may be different from the BGP Next-\n   Hop, in particular
    when BGP Route Reflection is used.  This document\n   defines a mechanism to advertise
    such BGP Next Hop Capabilities.\n\n   This document defines a new BGP non-transitive
    attribute to carry\n   Next-Hop Capabilities.  This attribute is deleted when
    the BGP Next\n   Hop is changed.\n\n   This document also defines a Next-Hop capability
    to advertise the\n   ability to handle the Entropy Label defined in RFC 6790.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
