abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a proposed extension to SIP [1].  This
    exten-\nsion adds the 183 Session Progress response and a new header to indi-\ncate
    why a SDP message body is included in a 18x message.\nThe introduction of the
    183 informational response message would\nallow a called user agent to indicate
    to the calling user agent\nwhether or not the calling user agent should apply
    local alerting for\nthe session.  The existing 180 Ringing message would indicate
    that\nthe calling user agent has the option of providing local alerting\n(and
    generally should).  The 183 Session Progress message would indi-\ncate that the
    calling user agent should not provide local alerting.\nIn additionally, the calling
    user agent may be called on to establish\na media session to be used by the called
    user agent to indicate the\nstatus of the session setup request as part of the
    indicated media\nstream.  The indication of whether or not to play early media
    to the\ncalling user would be controlled with a new Session header included\nin
    the 183 message.\n\t </p>\n      "
