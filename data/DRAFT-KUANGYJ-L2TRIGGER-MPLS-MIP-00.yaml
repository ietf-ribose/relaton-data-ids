abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends the integration of Mobile IP (MIP) and
    Multi-\n   Protocol Label Switch (MPLS) with Layer2 Triggers (L2T) to expedite
    \n   handoff and route optimization procedures. In the proposal, MPLS \n   acts
    as only a fast second layer switch technique to setup a \n   connection-oriented
    communication network, while MIP or IP acts as a \n   signaling protocol to operate,
    administrate and manage MPLS network. \n   L2Ts in this proposal are introduced
    to trigger signaling process of \n   rerouting, extension and recovery of label
    switch paths (LSP) rather \n   than to trigger registration or binding update
    of new care-of \n   address (CoA), in traditional MIP. Moreover, in the proposed
    \n   architecture, IP-in-IP tunneling is replaced by LSPs to support \n   mobility,
    which reduces packet overhead thus mitigates network \n   burden and makes it
    easy to support quality-of-service (QoS) or \n   class-of-service (CoS). Therefore,
    the proposed scheme is well \n   suited for time-constrained or delay-sensitive
    applications.\n\t </p>\n      "
