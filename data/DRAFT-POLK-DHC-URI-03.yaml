abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    \n   (DHC) Option to allow one or more URIs to be transmitted from a \n   server
    to a client within one or more messages, and for one or more \n   URIs, each with
    a unique purpose, to be specifically requested by a \n   client of a server.  Included
    in this Option is a purpose field to \n   identify the type of URI being requested
    by the client, or the type \n   of URI in the DHCP message from the server.\n\n\t
