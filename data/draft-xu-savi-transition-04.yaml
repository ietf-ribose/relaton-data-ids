abstract:
- content: "<p>IP spoofing is a critical breach regard to Internet security. With
    rapid development of the IPv6-based next generation Internet, this issue is more
    prominent since IPv6 Internet owns more spoofable IP address space. Existing IP
    anti-spoofing proposals, including SAVI (Source Address Validation Improvement)
    which was advocated by IETF, only focused on single-stack or simple network scenarios.
    To the best of our knowledge, none of them has paid attention to the IPv4/IPv6
    transition scenarios. However, since IPv4/IPv6 transition schemes are plenty and
    various, one solution cannot meet all requirements of them. In this draft, we
    present a SAVI-based general framework for IP source address validation and traceback
    in the IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios, which achieve this by extracting out essential
    and mutual properties from these schemes, and forming sub-solutions for each property.
    When one transition scheme is composed from various properties, its IP source
    address validation and traceback solution is directly comprised by the corresponding
    sub-solutions. Thus, the most exciting advantage of this framework is that it
    is a once-and- for-all solution no matter how transition schemes change.</p>"
