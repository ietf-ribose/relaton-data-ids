abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo provides a method for protecting a router's control
    plane\nfrom undesired or malicious traffic.  In this approach, all\nlegitimate
    control plane traffic is identifed.  Once legitimate\ntraffic has been identified,
    a filter is deployed on the router's\nforwarding plane.  That filter prevents
    traffic not specifically\nidentified as legitimate from reaching the router's
    control plane.\n\t </p>\n      "
