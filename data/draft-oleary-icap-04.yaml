abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This Internet Calendar Access Protocol (ICAP) allows a client toaccess,
    manipulate and store Calendar information on a server. ICAPemploys the iCalendar
    format [ICAL] for interchange of calendaringinformation. ICAP includes operations
    for creating Calendar stores on a server,opening them and retrieving information
    about them. When aCalendar Store has been opened, it can be bounded by start and
    endtimes so that the client can act on a smaller subset of Calendarinformation
    for more efficient operation. ICAP allows users to storenew Calendar Objects into
    their own Calendar store and Calendarstores owned by other users with a single
    operation. ICAP supports searching iCalendar objects within a Calendar Store.Searches
    can be based on any iCalendar property and filtered byiCalendar Component type.</p>"
