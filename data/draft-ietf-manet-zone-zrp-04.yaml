abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) framework,
    a hybrid routing framework suitable for a wide variety of mobile ad-hocnetworks,
    especially those with large network spans and diversemobility patterns. Each node
    proactively maintains routes within alocal region (referred to as the routing
    zone). Knowledge of therouting zone topology is leveraged by the ZRP to improve
    theefficiency of a globally reactive route query/reply mechanism. The proactive
    maintenance of routing zones also helps improve the qualityof discovered routes,
    by making them more robust to changes in networktopology. The ZRP can be configured
    for a particular network by properselection of a single parameter, the routing
    zone radius.</p>"
