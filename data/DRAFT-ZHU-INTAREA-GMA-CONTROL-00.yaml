abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A device can be simultaneously connected to multiple networks,\n
    \  e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, and DSL. It is desirable to seamlessly\n   combine the
    connectivity over these networks below the transport\n   layer (L4) to improve
    quality of experience for applications that\n   do not have built in multi-path
    capabilities. This document\n   presents a new control protocol to manage traffic
    steering,\n   splitting, and duplicating across multiple connections. The\n   solution
    has been developed by the authors based on their\n   experiences in multiple standards
    bodies including the IETF and\n   3GPP, is not an Internet Standard and does not
    represent the\n   consensus opinion of the IETF. This document will enable other\n
    \  developers to build interoperable implementations in order to\n   experiment
    with the protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
