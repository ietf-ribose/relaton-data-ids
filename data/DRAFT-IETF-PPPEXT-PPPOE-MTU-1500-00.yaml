abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Point-to-Point Protocol Over Ethernet, (PPPoE), as described
    in RFC\n   2516, mandates a maximum negotiated MRU of 1492. This memo proposes\n
    \  relaxing that restriction to allow a maximum negotiated MRU of 1500.\n   This
    can be achieved by treating the PPPoE Header and Protocol ID as\n   part of the
    Ethernet Header, taking advantage of the fact that most\n   network devices have
    buffers for the Ethernet Header and Payload that\n   are at least 1522 octets
    in size. To aid backward compatability, the\n   proposal recommends testing the
    link with MRU-sized Echo-Request\n   packets if an MRU greater than 1492 has been
    assumed or negotiated.\n\t </p>\n      "
