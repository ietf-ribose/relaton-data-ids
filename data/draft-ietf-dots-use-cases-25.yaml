abstract:
- content: "<p>The DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) effort is intended to provide
    protocols to facilitate interoperability across disparate DDoS Mitigation solutions.
    This document presents sample use cases that describe the interactions expected
    between the DOTS components as well as DOTS messaging exchanges. These use cases
    are meant to identify the interacting DOTS components, how they collaborate, and
    what the typical information to be exchanged is.</p>"
