abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is one of a set of documents, which together describe
    all aspects of the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). IPP is an application level
    protocol that can be used for distributed printing using Internet tools and technologies.
    This document describes a simplified model consisting of abstract objects, their
    attributes, and their operations that is independent of encoding and transport.
    The model consists of a Printer and a Job object. A Job optionally supports multiple
    documents. IPP 1.1 semantics allow end-users and operators to query printer capabilities,
    submit print jobs, inquire about the status of print jobs and printers, and cancel,
    hold, release, and restart print jobs. IPP 1.1 semantics allow operators to pause,
    resume, and purge (jobs from) Printer objects. This document also addresses security,
    internationalization, and directory issues.</p>"
