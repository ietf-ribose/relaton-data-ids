abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>An ad hoc mobile network is a collection of nodes, each of which\n
    \  communicates over wireless channels and is capable of movement.\n   Nodes participating
    in such an ad hoc network communicate on\n   a peer-to-peer basis.  Flooding is
    often a desired form of\n   communication in these networks, as it can enable
    both the\n   dissemination of control information and the delivery of data\n   packets.
    \ This document describes a method for sending packets to\n   every node in an
    ad hoc network.\n\t </p>\n      "
