abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Extensible Peer Protocol (XPP), a lightweight
    binary protocol for end-to-end sessions between peers in distributed overlay networks.
    One of the main goals while creating this protocol was support for nodes located
    behind firewalls and NATs. XPP therefore uses UDP and allows endpoints to simultaneously
    initiate sessions. Given the choice of the underlying protocol (UDP), XPP also
    defines mechanisms for message fragmentation and reliability.</p>"
