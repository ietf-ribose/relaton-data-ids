abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IGMPv3 for IPv4 adds the capability for applications to expresssource
    filters on multicast group memberships, which allowsreceiver applications to determine
    the set of senders (sources)from which to accept multicast traffic. This capability
    alsosimplifies support of one-to-many type multicast applications. Itis expected
    that in the future, the same capability will beavailable in IPv6 as well.This
    document specifies new socket options and ioctl commands tomanage source filters
    for IP Multicast group memberships. It alsodefines the socket structures to provide
    input and outputarguments to these new APIs. These extensions are designed toprovide
    access to the source filtering features, while introducinga minimum of change
    into the system and providing completecompatibility for existing multicast applications.</p>"
