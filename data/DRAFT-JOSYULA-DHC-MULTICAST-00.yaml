abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet Protocol Television(IPTV) is a system facilitating\n
    \  transmission of television channels as multicast streams use\n   dedicated
    multicast group addresses in IP networks.Internet Group\n   Multicast Protocol(IGMP)
    is widely used for the communication between\n   the hosts and routers to deliver
    these multicast streams.It is also\n   possible for the networks to distinguish
    these multicast streams not\n   only by their destination multicast group but
    also by the source IP\n   address of the streams.In IGMP version-3 implementation,the
    networks\n   can deliver the multicast traffic to the hosts from the specific\n
    \  multicast sources requested by the users.This needs a mechanism to\n   supply
    the available multicast source address information to the\n   hosts and the hosts
    also should be strictly implemented with IGMPv3\n   client. This document describes
    a new DHCP option which can addresses\n   these issues.In addition to this,the
    document also describes about\n   the advantages in the networks by implementing
    this option.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
