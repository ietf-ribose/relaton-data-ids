abstract:
- content: "<p>At the first meeting of the proposed Path Aware Networking Research
    Group, Oliver Bonaventure led a discussion of our mostly-unsuccessful attempts
    to exploit Path Awareness to achieve a variety of goals, over the past decade.
    At the end of that discussion, the research group agreed to catalog and analyze
    these ideas, to extract lessons for network researchers. This document contains
    that catalog and analysis.</p>"
