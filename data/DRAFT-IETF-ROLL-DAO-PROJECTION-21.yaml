abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends RFC 6550, RFC 6553,and RFC 8138 to enable
    a RPL\n   Root to install and maintain Projected Routes within its DODAG, along\n
    \  a selected set of nodes that may or may not include self, for a\n   chosen
    duration.  This potentially enables routes that are more\n   optimized or resilient
    than those obtained with the classical\n   distributed operation of RPL, either
    in terms of the size of a\n   Routing Header or in terms of path length, which
    impacts both the\n   latency and the packet delivery ratio.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
