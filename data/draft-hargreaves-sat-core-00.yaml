abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo This memo describes the Secure Asset Transfer (SAT) Protocol
    for digital assets. SAT is a protocol operating between two gateways that conducts
    the transfer of a digital asset from one gateway to another. The protocol establishes
    a secure channel between the endpoints and implements a 2-phase commit to ensure
    the properties of transfer atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.</p>"
