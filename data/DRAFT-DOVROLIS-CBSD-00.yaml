abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the Class-Based Service Differentiation
    (CBSD)\narchitecture and it proposes a set of Per-Hop-Behaviors that can be used\nfor
    implementing it. According to CBSD, the network traffic is mapped to\na set of
    classes. The differentiating factor between traffic classes is\nthe relative forwarding
    quality in a DS capable router. The Class PHBs\nhave quite similar semantics with
    the Precedence PHBs, recently proposed\nby Baker et.al. in [PREC], but an attempt
    is made here to define them in a\nmore general manner, decoupling them from specific
    implementation\npossibilities. There is also a semantical overlap between the
    Expedited\nForwarding PHB of [DSFIELD] and the highest Class PHB. Consequently,
    the\nDiffserv working group may want to combine these three PHB proposals in a\nsingle
    one, minimizing the number of DS Field bits used.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
