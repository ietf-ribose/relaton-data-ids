abstract:
  content: '<p>The goal of this document is to define approaches to achieve a "onceand
    only once" delivery of messages. The EDIINT AS2 protocol [AS2] isimplemented by
    a number of software tools on a variety of platformswith varying capabilities
    and with varying network service quality.Although the AS2 protocol defines a unique
    "Message-ID", currentimplementations of AS2 do not provide a standard method to
    preventthe same message (re-transmitted by the initial sender) from reachingback-end
    business applications at the initial receiver. TCPunderpinnings of HTTP over which
    AS2 operates generally provide agood quality of network connectivity, but experience
    indicates a needto be able to compensate for both transient server and socketexceptions,
    including "Connection refused" as well as "Server busy."In addition, difficulties
    with server availability, stability, andloads can result in reduced operational
    reliability. This documentdescribes some ways to compensate for exceptions and
    enhance thereliability of AS2 protocol operation. Implementation of thesereliability
    features is indicated by presence of the "AS2-Reliability" value in the EDIINT-Features
    header.Intended StatusThe intent of this document is to be placed on the RFC track
    as anInformational RFC.Feedback Instructions:NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: This section
    should be removed by the RFC editorprior to publication.If you want to provide
    feedback on this draft, follow theseguidelines:-Send feedback via e-mail to the
    ietf-ediint list for discussion,with "AS2 Reliability" in the Subject field. To
    enter or follow thediscussion, you need to subscribe to ietf-ediint@imc.org.-Be
    specific as to what section you are referring to, preferablyquoting the portion
    that needs modification, after which you stateyour comments.-If you are recommending
    some text to be replaced with your suggestedtext, again, quote the section to
