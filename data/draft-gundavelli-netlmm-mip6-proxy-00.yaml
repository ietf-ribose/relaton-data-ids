abstract:
- content: "<p>Localized Mobility Management (LMM) requires mobility support for a
    mobile station within a restricted and topologically localized portion of the
    network. Mobile IPv6 is a standardized mobility protocol for IPv6 that can be
    extended to address the local mobility management requirements. This document
    describes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 scheme by introducing new functional
    entities and extensions to the protocol and by restricting the mobility signaling
    to only certain entities in the network.</p>"
