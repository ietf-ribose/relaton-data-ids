abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current Email infrastructure has the property that any
    host\n   sending mail to the mail system can identify itself as any user name\n
    \  it wants.  Furthermore, the current Email framework neither\n   authenticates
    the sender nor traces the source of the mail, so even\n   find a spam, the method
    is just to reject the mail or insert the mail\n   source into \"blacklist\", and
    both of these methods can!_t deracinate\n   the generation of spam.  This document
    design a Email source address\n   authentication based on true IPv6 address access
    to identify and\n   authenticate the mail source address, to trace the mail sender\n
    \  effectively, and to deracinate the generation of spam.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
