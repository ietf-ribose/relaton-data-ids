abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The normal operation for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
    (SMTP) is\n   for the submitting device to wait for all processing to complete
    and\n   for the server to return a positive acknowledgement to the client.\n   However,
    some devices have very intermittent connectivity, such as\n   wireless mobile
    terminals.  For such devices, a means to have\n   processing continue in the case
    of a dropped connection is desirable.\n   To this end, this SMTP service extension
    enables a client to submit a\n   message and reliably detach from the session,
    indicating to the\n   server to continue in the absence of a connection to the
    client.\n\t </p>\n      "
