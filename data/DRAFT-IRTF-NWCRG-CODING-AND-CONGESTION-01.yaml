abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Coding is a reliability mechanism that is distinct and separated
    from\n   the loss detection of congestion controls.  Using coding can be a\n   useful
    way to better deal with tail losses or with networks with non-\n   congestion
    losses.  However, coding mechanisms should not hide\n   congestion signals.  This
    memo offers a discussion of how coding and\n   congestion control can coexist.
    \ This document can help the\n   comparison of FEC schemes by identifying at which
    level they are\n   operating with respect to the transport congestion control.\n\n
    \  This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network\n   Communications
    Research Group (NWCRG).  The scope of the document is\n   end-to-end communications:
    coding for tunnels is out-of-the scope of\n   the document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
