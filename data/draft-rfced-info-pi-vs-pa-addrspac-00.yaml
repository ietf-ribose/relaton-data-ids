abstract:
- content: "<p>One can currently distinguish two kinds of globally unique, unicast
    IPv4 addresses: provider independent (PI) and provider aggregatable (PA) addresses.
    These addresses are assigned to end-users by Internet Registries (IRs). There
    are also non globally unique e.g. private unicast addresses as described in RFC1597
    which are suitable for many applications.</p>"
