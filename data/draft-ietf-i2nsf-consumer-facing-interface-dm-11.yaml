abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an information model and a YANG data model for
    the Consumer-Facing Interface between an Interface to Network Security Functions
    (I2NSF) User and Security Controller in an I2NSF system in a Network Functions
    Virtualization (NFV) environment. The information model defines various types
    of managed objects and the relationship among them needed to build the interface.
    The information model is based on the "Event-Condition-Action" (ECA) policy model
    defined by a capability information model for I2NSF [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-capability],
    and the data model is defined for enabling different users of a given I2NSF system
    to define, manage, and monitor security policies for specific flows within an
    administrative domain.</p>
