abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a set of TCP options to support the migration\nof
    an active TCP connection across IP addresses and TCP port numbers.\nUsing this
    option, a TCP peer can open a migrateable connection,\ntransfer one or more bytes
    on it, and continue the connection from\nanother IP address/TCP port pair in an
    application-transparent\nfashion.  The set of addresses or ports from where a
    connection might\nbe continued need not be known in advance.  Security against\nconnection
    hijacking is achieved using a secret cryptographic cookie\nnegotiated through
    an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman [ANSI-X962]\nexchange during connection establishment.
    \ The initiation of\nmigration can be done either by one of the communicating
    peers, or by\na trusted third-party that presents the negotiated cryptographic\ncookie.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
