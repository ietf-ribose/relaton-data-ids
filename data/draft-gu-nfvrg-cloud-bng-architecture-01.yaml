abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the new architecture of BNG devices with control
    plane (CP) and user plane (UP) separation. BNG-CP is a user control management
    component while BNG-UP takes responsibility as the network edge and user policy
    implementation componenet. Both BNG-CP and BNG-UP are core components for fixed
    broadband services and deployed separately at different network layer in actual
    network.</p>"
