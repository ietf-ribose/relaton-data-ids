abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines an API-independent concept that allows applications
    to share their knowledge about upcoming communication and express their performance
    preferences in a portable and abstract way: Socket Intents. Socket Intents express
    what an application knows, assumes, expects or wants to prioritize regarding its
    own network communication. The information provided by Socket Intents should be
    taken into account by the network stack in a best-effort way. Socket Intent can
    be used to stem against the complexity and make use of multiple provisioning domains
    as well as new transport protocols and features available to a larger user base
    by expressing the applications intents in an abstract and portable way.</p>"
