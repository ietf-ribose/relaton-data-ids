abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo proposes an alternative approach to the current ECN
    mechanism\nas proposed in the internet draft [draft-kksjf].  A Backward-ECN(BECN)\nis
    proposed which uses the existing IP signalling mechanism, the\nInternet Control
    Messaging Protocol (ICMP) [RFC 792] Source Quench\nmessage.  The use of ICMP Source
    Quench (ISQ) allows a basic ECN\nmechanism for IP which does not require any negotiation
    between end\nsystems.  Congestion notification is kept at the network(IP) level.
    \ The\ncongestion state can be reflected up to the transport layer (e.g. TCP or\nUDP)
    for appropriate action. The ISQ based approach reduces the reaction\ntime to a
    congestion in the network.  In addition, the ISQ message can\ninclude information
    on the severity of the congestion allowing the end\nhost to react accordingly
    so as to make maximal use of the resources\nwhile maintaining network equilibrium.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
