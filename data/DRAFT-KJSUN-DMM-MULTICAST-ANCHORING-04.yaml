abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this draft, we define multicast support functions in a\n
    \  Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) environment. Based on the\n   decomposed
    mobility management functions in [RFC7429], each defined\n   multicast support
    function can be located and operated with DMM\n   functions.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
