abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The document describes a mechanism for basic IPv6 multihoming
    support,\nand its operational requirements.  The mechanism can be combined with\nmore
    sophisticated (or complex) multihoming support mechanisms, and can\nbe used as
    a foundation for other mechanisms.  The document is largely\nbased on RFC2260
    [Bates, 1998] by Tony Bates.\n\t </p>\n      "
