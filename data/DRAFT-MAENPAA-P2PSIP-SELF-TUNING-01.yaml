abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) is a peer-to-peer (P2P)\nsignaling
    protocol that provides an overlay network service.  Peers\nin a RELOAD overlay
    network collectively run an overlay algorithm to\norganize the overlay, and to
    store and retrieve data.  This document\ndescribes how the default topology plugin
    of RELOAD can be extended\nto support self-tuning, that is, to adapt to changing
    operating\nconditions such as churn and network size.\n\t </p>\n      "
