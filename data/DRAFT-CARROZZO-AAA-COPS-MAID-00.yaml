abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines some extensions to the COPS protocol
    under \n   the COPS-MAID client type to be used for the SP Control Plane \n   procedures
    in a Multimedia Telephony Service (MTS) context. The \n   reference SP network
    infrastructure is assumed to be based on \n   MPLS/Diffserv Control and Data Planes.
    The proposed architecture is \n   defined signalling independent because it is
    able to uphold different \n   signalling protocols used by the MTS-enabled terminals
    (e.g. SIP, \n   H.323, H.248-Megaco, MGCP, etc.) with a common approach. The overall
    \n   specification relies on the identification of a common and \n   generalized
    semantic for the service requests (policy &amp; CAC), which \n   will encapsulate
    the client-specific information in a common format \n   besides of the specific
    protocol (e.g. SIP, H.323, etc.). \n   By means of this generalized architecture
    it is possible to reduce \n   the complexity of the SP Control Plane architecture.
    \n\t </p>\n      "
