abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes scenarios at subscriber, carrier and\n
    \  enterprise sites during IPv4 sunsetting.  In each site, there may be\n   different
    requirements and issues.  The aim of this document is to\n   put forward some
    issues in these scenarios and to identify whether\n   further specifications are
    needed to solve these issues to facilitate\n   IPv4 sunsetting.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
