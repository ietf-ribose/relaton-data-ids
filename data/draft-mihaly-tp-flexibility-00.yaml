abstract:
- content: "<p>This document argues for increasing the flexibility of the transport
    layer protocols to be possible to tailor the transport protocols to different
    needs (today and tomorrow) of different applications and access networks. We discuss
    various use cases to show that there is a need for transport protocol flexibility.</p>"
