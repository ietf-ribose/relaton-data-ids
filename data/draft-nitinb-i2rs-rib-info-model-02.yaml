abstract:
- content: "<p>Routing and routing functions in enterprise and carrier networks are
    typically performed by network devices (routers and switches) using a routing
    information base (RIB). Protocols and configuration push data into the RIB and
    the RIB manager install state into the hardware; for packet forwarding. This draft
    specifies an information model for the RIB to enable defining a standardized data
    model. Such a data model can be used to define an interface to the RIB from an
    entity that may even be external to the network device. This interface can be
    used to support new use-cases being defined by the IETF I2RS WG.</p>"
