abstract:
- content: "<p>Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms allow for burst tolerance
    while enforcing short queues to minimise the time that packets spend enqueued
    at a bottleneck. This can cause noticeable performance degradation for TCP connections
    traversing such a bottleneck, especially if there are only a few flows or their
    bandwidth-delay- product is large. An Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) signal
    indicates that an AQM mechanism is used at the bottleneck, and therefore the bottleneck
    network queue is likely to be short. This document therefore proposes an update
    to RFC3168, which changes the TCP sender-side ECN reaction in congestion avoidance
    to reduce the Congestion Window (cwnd) by a smaller amount than the congestion
    control algorithm's reaction to inferred packet loss.</p>"
