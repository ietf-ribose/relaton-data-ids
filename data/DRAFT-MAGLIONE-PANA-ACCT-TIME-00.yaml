abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Two main models for providing DSL Internet Access are currently
    \navailable: one is based on PPP protocol and provides flexible AAA \n(Authentication,
    Authorization and Accounting) mechanism, dynamic IP \naddress assignment and is
    generally used by Internet Service \nProviders (ISPs) for temporary or semi-permanent
    Broadband \nconnections which may be billed on a time-basis. The other is based
    \non DHCP or static IP addressing, generally lacks flexible AAA \nmechanism and
    is most of the time associated to flat-rate broadband \nconnections. The evolution
    of services and access techniques may \nquickly lead to a wide deployment of non-PPP
    based access model \nassociated with flat rates charge, providing \"always-on\"
    Internet \nconnections. However, even in this scenario, ISPs may still require
    \nthat some services are billed on a time basis. This Internet Draft \ndescribes
    the problem typically faced by ISPs when a time-basis \nbilling model is required
    for non-PPP Broadband Connections. It also \nintroduces requirements that a possible
    solution should satisfy in \norder to address the problem. Moreover the document
    covers a brief \nanalysis of the Status of Art. \n\t </p>\n      "
