abstract:
- content: <p>This specification introduces the HTTP "Variants" response header field
    to communicate what representations are available for a given resource, and the
    companion "Variant-Key" response header field to indicate which representation
    was selected. It is an augmentation of the "Vary" mechanism in HTTP caching.</p>
