abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note describes the changes necessary for OSPFv3 to route
    classes\n   of IPv6 traffic that are defined by an IPv6 Flow Label and a\n   destination
    prefix.  This implies not routing \"to a destination\", but\n   \"traffic matching
    a classification tuple\".  The obvious application\n   is data center inter-tenant
    routing using a form of role-based access\n   control.  If the sender doesn't
    know the value to insert in the flow\n   label (the receiver's tenant ID), he
    in effect has no route to that\n   destination.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
