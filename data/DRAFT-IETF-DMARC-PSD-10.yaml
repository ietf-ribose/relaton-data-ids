abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and\n
    \  Conformance) is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating\n   organization
    can express domain-level policies and preferences for\n   message validation,
    disposition, and reporting, that a mail-receiving\n   organization can use to
    improve mail handling.  The design of DMARC\n   presumes that domain names represent
    either nodes in the tree below\n   which registrations occur, or nodes where registrations
    have\n   occurred; it does not permit a domain name to have both of these\n   properties
    simultaneously.  Since its deployment in 2015, use of\n   DMARC has shown a clear
    need for the ability to express policy for\n   these domains as well.\n\n   Domains
    at which registrations can occur are referred to as Public\n   Suffix Domains
    (PSDs).  This document describes an extension to DMARC\n   to enable DMARC functionality
    for PSDs.\n\n   This document also seeks to address implementations that consider
    a\n   domain on a public Suffix list to be ineligible for DMARC\n   enforcement.\n\n\t
