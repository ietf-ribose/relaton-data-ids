abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the 802.16 Per-MS interface prefix model, one prefix can only
    be\nassigned to one interface of a mobile station by an access router and\ndifferent
    mobile stations can't share a prefix.  Managing Per-MS\ninterface prefixes is
    likely to increase the processing load at the\naccess router.  Based on the idea
    that DHCPv6 servers can manage\nprefixes as well as addresses, we propose a new
    technique in which\nthe access router offloads delegation and release tasks of
    the\nprefixes to an DHCPv6 server.  The access router first requests a\nprefix
    for an incoming mobile station to the DHCPv6 server.  The\naccess router next
    advertises the prefix information to the mobile\nstation with a Router Advertisement
    message.  When the mobile station\nhands off, the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6
    server.  We also\ndescribe how AAA servers can help in prefix delegation.\n\t
