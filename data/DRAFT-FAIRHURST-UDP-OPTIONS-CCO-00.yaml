abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a robust method for calculating checksums
    for\n   use with UDP Options.  The new method proposes an alternative\n   checksum
    calculation for coverage of the option space.  This is based\n   on the IP checksum
    calculation, but uses an updated pseudoheader.\n   The new method only checks
    the option portion of a UDP packet, but\n   creates a checksum that compensates
    for the range of IP and UDP\n   chekcsum validation methods that have been deployed,
    in this way the\n   new method enhances the proability of NAPT traversal for packets
    that\n   carry UDP-Options.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
