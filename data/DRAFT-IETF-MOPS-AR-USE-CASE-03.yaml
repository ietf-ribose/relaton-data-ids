abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A use case describing transmission of an application on the
    Internet\n   that has several unique characteristics of Augmented Reality (AR)\n
    \  applications is presented for the consideration of the Media\n   Operations
    (MOPS) Working Group.  One key requirement identified is\n   that the Adaptive-Bit-Rate
    (ABR) algorithms' current usage of\n   policies based on heuristics and models
    is inadequate for AR\n   applications running on the Edge Computing infrastructure.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
