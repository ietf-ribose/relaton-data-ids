abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a scheme for overlapped block motion compensation
    that could be incorporated into a next-generation video codec. The scheme described
    is that currently used by Xiph's Daala project, which supports variable block
    sizes without introducing any discontinuities at block boundaries. This makes
    the scheme suitable for use with lapped transforms or other techniques where encoding
    such discontinuities is expensive.</p>"
