abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes the process for early allocation of code
    points\n   by IANA from registries for which \"Specification Required\", \"RFC\n
    \  Required\", \"IETF Review\", or \"Standards Action\" policies apply.  This\n
    \  process can be used to alleviate the problem where code point\n   allocation
    is needed to facilitate desired or required implementation\n   and deployment
    experience prior to publication of an RFC that would\n   normally trigger code
    point allocation.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 4020.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
