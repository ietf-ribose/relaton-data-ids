abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification\n
    \  is an HTTP based protocol that makes managing identities in multi-\n   domain
    scenarios easier to support through a standardized service.\n   Examples include
    but are not limited to enterprise to cloud service\n   providers, and inter-cloud
    based scenarios.  The specification suite\n   seeks to build upon experience with
    existing schemas and deployments,\n   placing specific emphasis on simplicity
    of development and\n   integration, while applying existing authentication, authorization,\n
    \  and privacy models.  SCIM's intent is to reduce the cost and\n   complexity
    of user management operations by providing a common user\n   schema, an extension
    model, and a service protocol defined by this\n   document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
