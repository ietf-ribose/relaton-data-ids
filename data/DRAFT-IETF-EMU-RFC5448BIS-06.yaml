abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The 3GPP Mobile Network Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA)
    is the\n   primary authentication mechanism for devices wishing to access mobile\n
    \  networks.  RFC 4187 (EAP-AKA) made the use of this mechanism possible\n   within
    the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) framework.  RFC\n   5448 (EAP-AKA')
    was an improved version of EAP-AKA.\n\n   This memo replaces the specification
    of EAP-AKA'.  EAP-AKA' was\n   defined in RFC 5448 and updated EAP-AKA RFC 4187.
    \ As such this\n   document obsoletes RFC 5448 and updates RFC 4187.\n\n   EAP-AKA'
    differs from EAP-AKA by providing a key derivation function\n   that binds the
    keys derived within the method to the name of the\n   access network.  The key
    derivation function has been defined in the\n   3rd Generation Partnership Project
    (3GPP).  EAP-AKA' allows its use\n   in EAP in an interoperable manner.  EAP-AKA'
    is also an algorithm\n   update, as it employs SHA-256 / HMAC-SHA-256 instead
    of SHA-1 / HMAC-\n   SHA-1 as in EAP-AKA.\n\n   This version of EAP-AKA' specification
    specifies the protocol\n   behaviour for 5G deployments as well.\n\n\t </p>\n
