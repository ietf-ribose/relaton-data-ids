abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Neighbour Discovery Proxy is used to provide an address presence
    on a\nlink from nodes which are no themselves present.  It allows a node to\nreceive
    packets directed at its address by allowing another device to\nneighbour advertise
    on its behalf.\n\nNeighbour Discovery Proxy is used in Mobile IPv6 and related\nprotocols
    to provide reachability from nodes on the home network when\na Mobile Node is
    not at home, by allowing the Home Agent to act as\nproxy.  It is also used as
    a mechanism to allow a global prefix to\nspan multiple links, where proxies act
    as relays for neighbour\ndiscovery messages.\nNeighbour Discovery Proxy currently
    cannot be secured using SEND.\nToday, SEND assumes that a node advertising an
    address is the address\nowner and in possession of appropriate public and private
    keys for\nthat node.  This document describes how existing practice for proxy\nNeighbour
    Discovery relates to Secured Neighbour Discovery.\n\t </p>\n      "
