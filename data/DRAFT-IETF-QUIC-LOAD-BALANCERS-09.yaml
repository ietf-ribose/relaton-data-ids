abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The QUIC protocol design is resistant to transparent packet\n
    \  inspection, injection, and modification by intermediaries.  However,\n   the
    server can explicitly cooperate with network services by agreeing\n   to certain
    conventions and/or sharing state with those services.\n   This specification provides
    a standardized means of solving three\n   problems: (1) maintaining routability
    to servers via a low-state load\n   balancer even when the connection IDs in use
    change; (2) explicit\n   encoding of the connection ID length in all packets to
    assist\n   hardware accelerators; and (3) injection of QUIC Retry packets by an\n
    \  anti-Denial-of-Service agent on behalf of the server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
