abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft considers an approach to the optimization of the
    traffic\n   generated by the overlay (peer-to-peer) applications, where some\n
    \  information on inter-AS (Autonomous System) paths is obtained with\n   the
    usage of dedicated communication scheme known as inter-ALTO\n   communication.\n\n
    \  The large amount of network traffic generated by overlay applications\n   requires
    effective management.  This traffic traverses inter-AS links\n   and thus generates
    substantial costs for the operators and poses\n   problems with overload on the
    external and internal links.  The\n   traffic is not time-stable as the peers
    connect and disconnect very\n   often.  Additionally, when the overlay traffic
    is observed on\n   inter-AS links, it can be seen that sources and destinations
    change\n   in a very short period of time.  The ALTO (Application-Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization) service provides the information that enables more\n   efficient
    management of the overlay traffic.  Such applications can\n   use the information
    to perform better-than-random peer selection.\n   The ALTO servers are responsible
    for a pre-selection procedure; the\n   final selection is done by overlay clients
    and then the ALTO protocol\n   conveys network information to applications.  To
    be credible, this\n   information should be as close to real network situation
    as possible.\n   However, some types of data are not hold by an operator, but
    they\n   should be gained on the basis of the additional information exchange\n
    \  with other AS operators.  This document presents rationale for the\n   need
    of introduction of the inter-ALTO communication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
