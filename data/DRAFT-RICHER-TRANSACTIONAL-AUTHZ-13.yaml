abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a mechanism for delegating authorization
    to a\n   piece of software, and conveying that delegation to the software.\n   This
    delegation can include access to a set of APIs as well as\n   information passed
    directly to the software.\n\n   This document has been prepared by the GNAP working
    group design team\n   of Kathleen Moriarty, Fabien Imbault, Dick Hardt, Mike Jones,
    and\n   Justin Richer.  This document is input into the GNAP working group\n   and
    includes many notes on areas of discussion and decision that need\n   to be made
    by the GNAP working group.  Many of the features in this\n   proposed protocol
    can be accomplished in a number of alternative\n   ways, and where possible, the
    editor has included notes and\n   discussion from the design team regarding the
    options as understood.\n   The design team believes that this document represents
    a reasonable\n   starting point for the working group and submits all content
    to the\n   working group for consensus building.\n\t </p>\n      "
