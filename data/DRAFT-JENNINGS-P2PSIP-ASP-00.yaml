abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines Address Settlement by Peer-to-Peer (ASP),
    a\npeer-to-peer (P2P) binary signaling protocol for usage on the\nInternet.  A
    P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an\nabstract hash table service
    between a set of cooperating peers that\nform the P2P network.  ASP is designed
    to support a P2P Session\nInitiation Protocol (SIP) network, but it can be utilized
    by other\napplications with similar requirements.  ASP introduces the notion of\nusages,
    which are a collection of data types that are required for a\nparticular application.
    \ For SIP, these types include location, STUN\nand TURN servers.  ASP defines
    a security model based on a\ncertificate enrollment service that provides peers
    with unique\nidentities.  ASP also provides protocol extensibility and defines
    a\nmigration methodology, allowing for major upgrades of the P2P network\nwithout
    service disruption.\n\t </p>\n      "
