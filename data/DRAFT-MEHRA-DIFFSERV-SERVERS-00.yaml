abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft motivates and presents architectural\n       considerations
    for Differentiated Services [DSARCH]\n       support in servers (referred to as
    DiffServ servers).  We\n       discuss possible deployment scenarios for Differentiated\n
    \      and Integrated Services, and highlight the benefits of\n       supporting
    DiffServ functions on servers.  We outline the\n       requirements for DiffServ-enabled
    servers and propose a\n       policy-based architecture that allows IntServ and
    DiffServ\n       functions to coexist on DiffServ servers.  We then propose a\n
    \      DiffServ API that can be used by applications to influence\n       installed
    system policies on an application-specific basis,\n       and can serve as a candidate
    for standardization.  We also\n       describe a number of host-specific DiffServ
    functions that\n       can be efficiently supported on servers.\n\t </p>\n      "
