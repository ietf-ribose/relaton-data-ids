abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SIP is extended by the SIP-events framework to provide subscriptions\nand
    notifications of SIP events.  One example of such event\nnotification mechanism
    is 'presence' and this presence information is\ncarried in Presence Information
    Data Format (PIDF) documents.\n\nThe SIP PUBLISH method specified in RFC 3903
    carrying a PIDF document\nis typically used when presentities publish their own
    presence since\nthese presentities are typically the source of the information.\nHowever,
    there are cases when the presentity is not the direct source\nof the presence
    information.  One such example is location\ninformation where the end host may
    obtain a reference to location\ninformation as opposed to as a value.  The endpoint
    is typically not\ninterested in knowing its own location information, but other
    users\nor entities might be.  So, if the endpoint gets its own location\ninformation
    with a reference and wants to publish it embedded in its\npresence information,
    it first needs to de-reference it for getting a\nvalue, and then it can embed
    that value in its presence information.\nWhile this is certainly a correct sequence,
    it adds a round-trip to\nthe presence publication, in addition to a demand processing
    power\nand network bandwidth consumption.\n\nThere is a need for a mechanism that
    the presentity can use to\npublish indirect references, such as indirect location
    references.\nThis document discusses a few variants that may be used to provide\nthis
    functionality.\n\t </p>\n      "
