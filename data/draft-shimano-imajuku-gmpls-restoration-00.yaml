abstract:
- content: "<p>There are some efforts to categorize restoration schemes [Restoration-analysis].
    We consider that pre-planned restoration has some advantages, for instance, enhancing
    the quickness to reduce downtime, extensions to recovery classes, risk management,
    and totally integrated distributed control. This document describes some requirements
    and extended properties for message objects on RSVP-TE [RSVP-GMPLS], LSR procedures,
    and pre-planned GMPLS restoration. We append a procedure to the recovery steps
    for working and restoration setup. Some objects are additionally required with
    respect to establishing working LSPs and reservation of restoration LSPs. This
    document shows that restoration activation is also needed and clarifies the required
    properties.</p>"
