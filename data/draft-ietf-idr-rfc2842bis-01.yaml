abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently BGP-4 requires that when a BGP speaker receives an OPEN message
    with one or more unrecognized Optional Parameters, the speaker must terminate
    BGP peering. This complicates introduction of new capabilities in BGP. This document
    defines new Optional Parameter, called Capabilities, that is expected to facilitate
    introduction of new capabilities in BGP by providing graceful capability advertisement
    without requiring that BGP peering be terminated. This document obsoletes RFC2842.</p>"
