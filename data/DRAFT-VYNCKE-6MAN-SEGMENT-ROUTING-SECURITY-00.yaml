abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) allows a node to steer a packet through
    a\n   controlled set of instructions, called segments, by prepending a SR\n   header
    to the packet.  A segment can represent any instruction,\n   topological or service-based.
    \ SR allows to enforce a flow through\n   any path (topological, or application/service
    based) while\n   maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node to the SR
    domain.\n\n   Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 data plane with the\n
    \  addition of a new type of Routing Extension Header.  This draft\n   analyses
    the security aspects the Segment Routing Extension Header\n   Type and how it
    is used by SR capable nodes to deliver a secure\n   service.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
