abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes an extension to IS-IS to allow the use
    of any \ncryptographic authentication algorithm in addition to the already \ndocumented
    authentication schemes, described in the base    \nspecification and RFC 3567.
    \  \n        \nAlthough this document has been written specifically for using
    MAC \nconstruct along with the SHA family of cryptographic hash functions, \nthe
    method described in this document is generic and can be used to \nextend IS-IS
    to support any cryptographic hash function in the \nfuture.\n\t </p>\n      "
