abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document registers code points to allow status codes to
    be\n   returned to an email client to indicate that a message is being\n   rejected
    or deferred specifically because of email authentication\n   failures.\n\n   This
    document updates [RFC7208] since some of the code points\n   registered replace
    the ones recommended for use in that document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
