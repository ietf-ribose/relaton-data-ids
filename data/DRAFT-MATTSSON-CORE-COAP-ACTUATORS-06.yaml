abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Being able to trust information from sensors and to securely
    control\n   actuators are essential in a world of connected and networking things\n
    \  interacting with the physical world.  In this memo we show that just\n   using
    COAP with a security protocol like DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE is not\n   enough.  We
    describe several serious attacks any on-path attacker can\n   do, and discusses
    tougher requirements and mechanisms to mitigate the\n   attacks.  While this document
    is focused on actuators, some of the\n   attacks apply equally well to sensors.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
