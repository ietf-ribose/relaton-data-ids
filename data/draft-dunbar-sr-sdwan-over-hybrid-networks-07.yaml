abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the mechanism of steering packets across SDWAN
    segments based on the metadata carried by the SRv6 packets. Some of the SDWAN
    segments are untrusted networks, and some are private networks. The goal is to
    achieve the optimal E2E quality.</p>"
