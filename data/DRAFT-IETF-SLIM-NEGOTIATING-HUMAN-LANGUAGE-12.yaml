abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities,
    and\n   preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.  This\n   document
    adds new SDP media-level attributes so that when\n   establishing interactive
    communication sessions (\"calls\"), it is\n   possible to negotiate (communicate
    and match) the caller's language\n   and media needs with the capabilities of
    the called party.  This is\n   especially important with emergency calls, where
    a call can be\n   handled by a call taker capable of communicating with the user,
    or a\n   translator or relay operator can be bridged into the call during\n   setup,
    but this applies to non-emergency calls as well (as an\n   example, when calling
    a company call center).\n\n   This document describes the need and a solution
    using new SDP media\n   attributes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
