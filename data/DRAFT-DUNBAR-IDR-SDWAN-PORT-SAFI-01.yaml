abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document specifies a new BGP NLRI and SAFI for advertising\n
    \  properties of a SDWAN edge node WAN ports that face untrusted\n   networks,
    such as the public internet. Those WAN ports may get\n   assigned IP addresses
    from the Internet Service Providers (ISPs),\n   may get assigned dynamic IP addresses
    via DHCP, or may have private\n   addresses (e.g. inside third party Cloud DCs).
    Packets sent over\n   those SDWAN WAN ports might need to be encrypted (depending
    on the\n   user policies) or need to go through NAT. SDWAN edge need to\n   propagate
    those WAN ports properties to its SDWAN controller, which\n   propagates to the
    authorized peers and manage the IPsec SAs among\n   those peers for encrypting
    traffic via the untrusted networks.\n\n   BGP Route Reflectors (RR) are proposed
    as points of combination for\n   this information in order to allow scaling of
    the SDWAN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
