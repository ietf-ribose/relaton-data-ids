abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network. MPLS
    can carry\nanydata payload which gives the flexibility to  the service provider
    to provision new service\nwith any expense. The benefit of this technology is
    core router need not understand  the\nfull customer route. If the service a layer
    2 then thereis no need of vrf, for customer the\nservice provider cloud is like
    a virtual switch.The protocol used for label distribution is LDP,\nBGP,RSVP. The
    most popular protocol for outer label distribution is LDP. LDP has the benefit
    of\nadding more TLV to its payload. In this the possibility of using ldp for generating
    labels\nfor mac address rather for ip address which gives  the benefit to service
    provider not to\nrun complex routing protocol on core, this does not require ip
    address. This gives service\nprovider the flexibility to deploy any services,
    there is no need for changes in network layer when the\ncustomer goes for ipv4
    to ipv6. This can reduce the CAPEX and OPEX of the customer and reduces the\nhardware
    cost too. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
