abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In recent widescale deployments of large public Wi-Fi networks,
    and\n   in their integration with cellular networks EAP based authentication\n
    \  has been considered as a good candidate to making Wi-Fi user\n   experience
    seamless similar to what it has been for cellular users.\n   A few new functions
    which could enhance CAPWAP protocol have been\n   identified in such deployments
    that can help improve the large scale\n   carrier grade Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\t
