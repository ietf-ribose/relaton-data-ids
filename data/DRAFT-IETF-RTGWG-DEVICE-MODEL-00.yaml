abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents an approach for organizing YANG models
    in a\n   comprehensive structure that may be used to configure and operate\n   network
    devices.  The structure is itself represented as a YANG\n   model, with all of
    the related component models logically organized\n   in a way that is operationally
    intuitive, but this model is not\n   expected to be implemented.  The identified
    component modules are\n   expected to be defined and implemented on common network
    devices.\n\n   This document is derived from work submitted to the IETF by members\n
    \  of the informal OpenConfig working group of network operators and is\n   a
    product of the Routing Area YANG Architecture design team.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
