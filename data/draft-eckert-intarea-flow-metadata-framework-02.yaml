abstract:
  content: "<p>This document provides a framework for communicating information elements
    (a.k.a. metadata) in a consistent manner between applications and the network
    to provide better visibility of application flows, thereby enabling differentiated
    treatment of those flows. These information elements can be conveyed using various
    signaling protocols, including PCP, RSVP, and STUN.</p>"
