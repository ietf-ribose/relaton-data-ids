abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As technologies for bidirectional communication over HTTP have
    become\npervasive, interest has grown in (1) defining improved mechanisms for\nsupport
    of existing technologies (short-term solutions such as new\nHTTP headers) and
    (2) the development of new bidirectional protocols\n(long-term solutions such
    as WebSocket, Bidirectional Web Transfer\nProtocol, and Reverse HTTP).  In order
    to provide context for such\nwork, this document provides a tentative map of the
    design space for\nbidirectional HTTP, with special attention to deployed infrastructure\n(e.g.
    web clients, intermediaries, firewalls, NATs, web servers) and\nprogramming environments.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
