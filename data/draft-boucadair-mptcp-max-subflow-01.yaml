abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an experimental Multipath TCP (MPTCP) option
    that is meant to negotiate the maximum number of subflows that can be established
    and maintained for a given MPTCP connection. The purpose is to minimize any possible
    performance degradation that can be induced by a possibly large number of establishment
    requests for additional subflows if the remote endpoint is not appropriately dimensioned
    to handle such requests.</p>"
