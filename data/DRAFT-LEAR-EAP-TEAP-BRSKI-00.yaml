abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain environments, in order for a device to establish
    any layer\n   three communications, it is necessary for that device to be properly\n
    \  credentialed.  This is a relatively easy problem to solve when a\n   device
    is associated with a human being and has both input and\n   display functions.
    \ It is less easy when the human, input, and\n   display functions are not present.
    \ To address this case, this memo\n   specifies extensions to the Tunnel Extensible
    Authentication Protocol\n   (TEAP) method that leverages Bootstrapping Remote
    Secure Key\n   Infrastructures (BRSKI) in order to provide a credential to a device\n
    \  at layer two.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
