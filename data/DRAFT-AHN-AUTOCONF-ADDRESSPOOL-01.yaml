abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an address configuration mechanism based
    on\n   the concept of address pool allocation in the connected MANET.\n   The
    Internet gateway acts as a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration\n   Protocol) server
    and assigns not a single address but a part of its\n   address pool to an address
    requesting node and, then, the node can\n   assign a part of its own address pool
    to its neighbor nodes.\n   By doing this, the address allocation procedure can
    be expedited.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
