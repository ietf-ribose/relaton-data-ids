abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses issues arising when moving the bundle\n
    \  protocol usage from closed or lab deployments into open,\n   heterogeneous
    environments with a variety of usages and applications\n   carried over common
    bundle agents.  We address naming conventions and\n   endpoint identifiers, content
    encapsulation, and on the\n   identification of application contents.\n\n\t </p>\n
