abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 2418 outlines the procedures for IETF Session operation.\n
    \  However, it contains little information about post-IETF meeting\n   working
    group chair responsibilities.  In particular, it provides\n   little guidance
    with respect to either form or submission deadlines\n   for the artifacts of the
    meeting, namely, session minutes and\n   presentation materials.  This document
    addresses the form and content\n   of Working Group agendas and minutes.\n\t </p>\n
