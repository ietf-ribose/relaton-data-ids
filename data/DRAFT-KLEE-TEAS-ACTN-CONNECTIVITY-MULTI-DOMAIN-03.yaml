abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for\n
    \  facilitating the application of virtual network abstractions and the\n   control
    and management of end-to-end network services that traverse\n   multiple vendor
    domain transport networks.\n\n   These abstractions shall help create a virtualized
    environment\n   supporting operators in viewing and controlling different vendor\n
    \  domains, especially for end-to-end network connectivity service for\n   a single
    operator.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
