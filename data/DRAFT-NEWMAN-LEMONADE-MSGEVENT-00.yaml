abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the missing features in the existing Internet mail and\n
    \  messaging standards is a facility for server-to-server and server-to-\n   client
    event notifications related to message store events.  As the\n   scope of Internet
    mail expands to support more diverse media (such as\n   voice mail), devices (such
    as cell phones) and to provide rich\n   interactions with other services (such
    as web portals and legal\n   compliance systems), the need for an interoperable
    notification\n   system increases.  This document attempts to enumerate the types
    of\n   events which interest real-world consumers of such a system.\n\t </p>\n
