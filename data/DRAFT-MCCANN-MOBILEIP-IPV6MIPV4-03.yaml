abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a Mobile IPv4 extension that may be used
    by \ndual stack mobile nodes to obtain IPv6 service with the use of a \nMobile
    IPv4 registration. This extension allows for immediate \ndeployment of IPv6 on
    dual stack mobile devices, without the need \nfor a full IPv6 infrastructure.
    It is believed that providing IPv6 \nservices to mobile devices in the short term
    will spur the growth of \nIPv6 networks. \nThis extension makes use of the existing
    Mobile IPv4 security model, \nincluding the interface to the AAA infrastructure,
    but does not \nprovide the route optimization capabilities included in the Mobile
    \nIPv6 protocol. Further, this specification requires that the mobile \nnode and
    Home Agent have dual IPv4 and IPv6 stacks. There are no \nchanges to the FA nor
    does it need to be dual stack. \n\t </p>\n      "
