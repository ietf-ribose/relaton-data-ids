abstract:
  content: "<p>Network service providers are increasingly moving from providingjust
    Internet connectivity to offering intermediary-based servicesand performance optimizations
    to enhance end user experience atreduced costs. These services and optimizations
    are being, orwill be, offered with the help of intermediate nodes placed in theservice
    provider network between communicating end-points. Inthis document, we list several
    intermediary-based transportservices and performance optimization mechanisms that
    are being(or could be) provided by the intermediate nodes, and identify therequirements
    of any solution that securely offers these servicesand mechanisms.</p>"
