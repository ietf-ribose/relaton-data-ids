abstract:
- content: "<p>Network service providers are increasingly moving from providing just
    Internet connectivity to offering intermediary-based services and performance
    optimizations to enhance end user experience at reduced costs. These services
    and optimizations are being, or will be, offered with the help of intermediate
    nodes placed in the service provider network between communicating end-points.
    In this document, we list several intermediary-based transport services and performance
    optimization mechanisms that are being (or could be) provided by the intermediate
    nodes, and identify the requirements of any solution that securely offers these
    services and mechanisms.</p>"
