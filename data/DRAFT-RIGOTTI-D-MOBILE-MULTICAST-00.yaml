abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The increasing deployment of both, IP multicast and mobility,
    rises\n the problem of delivering  IPv6 multicast traffic to mobile nodes.\n This
    document proposes an approach to the problem, named\n Decentralized Mobile Multicast,
    that combines tunnelling and dynamic\n subscription to the multicast groups. The
    proposed solution aims to\n reduce handover time, and to diminish the overhead
    produced\n by multicast subscriptions. As a consequence of the decentralized\n
    selection of multicast routers, a single point of failure is\n eliminated.\n\t
