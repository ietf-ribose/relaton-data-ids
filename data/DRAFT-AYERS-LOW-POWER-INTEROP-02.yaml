abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Low-power wireless networks provide IPv6 connectivity through\n
    \  6LoWPAN, a set of standards to aggressively compress IPv6 packets\n   over
    small maximum transfer unit (MTU) links such as 802.15.4.\n\n   The entire purpose
    of IP was to interconnect different networks, but\n   we find that different 6LoWPAN
    implementations fail to reliably\n   communicate with one another.  These failures
    are due to stacks\n   implementing different subsets of the standard out of concern
    for\n   code size.  We argue that this failure stems from 6LoWPAN's design,\n
    \  not implementation, and is due to applying traditional Internet\n   protocol
    design principles to low-power networks.\n\n   We propose three design principles
    for Internet protocols on low-\n   power networks, designed to prevent similar
    failures in the future.\n   These principles are based around the importance of
    providing\n   flexible tradeoffs between code size and energy efficiency.  We
    apply\n   these principles to 6LoWPAN and show that the modified protocol\n   provides
    a wide range of implementation strategies while allowing\n   implementations with
    different strategies to reliably communicate.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
