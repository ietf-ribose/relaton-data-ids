abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies a configuration workflow to enable enterprise
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks to solicit the capability set of a
    SIP service provider network. The capability set can subsequently be used to configure
    features and services on the enterprise edge element, such as a Session Border
    Controller (SBC), to ensure smooth peering between enterprise and service provider
    networks.</p>"
