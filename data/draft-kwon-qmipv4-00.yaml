abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Mobile IP (MIP) suffers from the so-called triangular routing problem.Moreover,
    MIP Home Agent (HA) tends to undergo severe data trafficload, since it should
    deliver all the data packets toward mobilenodes. This paper proposes a simple
    extension of MIP, called Query-based MIP (QMIP), in which the binding query to
    HA will be used toget the care-of address of a mobile node and to deliver thesubsequent
    data packets over the optimized data path. The proposedQMIP scheme can be applied
    to MIPv4 and Proxy MIPv6 as well.</p>"
