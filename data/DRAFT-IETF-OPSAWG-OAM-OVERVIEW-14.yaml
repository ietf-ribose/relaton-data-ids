abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general
    term\n   that refers to a toolset for fault detection and isolation, and for\n
    \  performance measurement. Over the years various OAM tools have been\n   defined
    for various layers in the protocol stack.\n\n   This document summarizes some
    of the OAM tools defined in the IETF in\n   the context of IP unicast, MPLS, MPLS
    for the transport profile\n   (MPLS-TP), pseudowires, and TRILL. This document
    focuses on tools for\n   detecting and isolating failures in networks and for
    performance\n   monitoring. Control and management aspects of OAM are outside
    the\n   scope of this document. Network repair functions such as Fast Reroute\n
    \  (FRR) and protection switching, which are often triggered by OAM\n   protocols,
    are also out of the scope of this document.\n\n   The target audience of this
    document includes network equipment\n   vendors, network operators and standard
    development organizations,\n   and can be used as an index to some of the main
    OAM tools defined in\n   the IETF. This document provides a brief description
    of each of the\n   OAM tools in the IETF. At the end of the document a list of
    the OAM\n   toolsets and a list of the OAM functions are presented as a summary.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
