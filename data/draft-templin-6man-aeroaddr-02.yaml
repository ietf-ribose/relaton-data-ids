abstract:
  content: <p>IPv6 interfaces are required to have a link-local address that is unique
    on the link. Nodes normally derive a link local address through the use of IPv6
    Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) and employ Duplicate Address Detection
    (DAD) to ensure uniqueness. This document presents a method for a node that obtains
    a delegated prefix to statelessly construct a link-local address (known as the
    "AERO address") that is assured to be unique on the link.</p>
