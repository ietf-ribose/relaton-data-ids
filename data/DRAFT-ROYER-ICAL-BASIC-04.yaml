abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is simplified iCalendar definistion.  After having learned
    from\n   RFC-2445.  This document represents the common objects needed for\n   basic
    calendaring.  The VTODO, VJOURNAL, VTIMEZONE, recurrence rules\n   (RDATE remains),
    and scheduling and their associated properties have\n   been removed.  These removals
    are expected to appear in new memos at\n   a later time and will be independent
    extensions of this\n   specification.  The new EXTENSIONS property will exist
    to allow for\n   compatible sets of extensions.\n\t </p>\n      "
