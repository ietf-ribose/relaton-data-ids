abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a need to be able to quantify and report the performance
    of\n   RTP based applications.  This performance data provides information\n   essential
    in validating service level agreements, fault isolation as\n   well as early warnings
    of greater problems.  This document describes\n   IPFIX Information Elements related
    to RTP performance measurement of\n   network based applications.  In addition,
    to the performance\n   information several non-metric information elements are
    also included\n   to provide greater context to the reports.  The measurements
    use\n   audio/video applications as a base but are not restricted to these\n   class
    of applications.  These new IPFIX Information Elements can\n   describe the entire
    duration of an RTP stream or a smaller time slice\n   of it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
