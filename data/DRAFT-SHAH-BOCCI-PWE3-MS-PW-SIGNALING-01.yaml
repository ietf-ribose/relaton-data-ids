abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The pseudowire switching [6] draft describes how a Pseudowire
    can \nspan across multiple PSN domains. This multi-segment PW (MS-PW) \nthreads
    through one or more PEs that are not the endpoints of the PW \nand are called
    switching PE (S-PE). The switching PE at each hop is \nconfigured a-priori with
    two single hops PW information that enables \nit to conduct splicing between the
    two. The configuration of such \ninformation at each S-PE for possibly thousands
    of MS-PWs is \ncumbersome. We describe a mechanism whereby a S-PE can identify
    and \nprocess the PW control signaling with the information present in the \nsignaling
    message in a manner that eliminates the requirement to \nconfigure PW splicing
    information. In this mechanism source PE \ninserts information about the destination
    PE and the PW endpoint that \nis recognized by the receiving PE to identify his
    role as a switching \nPE and engage in propagating the PW signal towards the destination
    \nPE.\n\t </p>\n      "
