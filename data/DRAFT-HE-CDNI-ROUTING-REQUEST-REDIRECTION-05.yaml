abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Request Routing Interface comprises of (1) the asynchronous\n
    \  advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a downstream CDN that\n   allows
    a upstream CDN to decide whether to redirect particular user\n   requests to that
    downstream CDN; and (2) the synchronous operation of\n   an upstream CDN requesting
    whether a downstream CDN is prepared to\n   accept a user request and of a downstream
    CDN responding with how to\n   actually redirect the user request.  This document
    describes an\n   interface for the latter part, i.e.  the CDNI request routing/\n
    \  Redirection Interface.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
