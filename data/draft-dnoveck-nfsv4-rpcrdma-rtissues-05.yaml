abstract:
- content: "<p>As currently designed and implemented, the RPC-over-RDMA protocol requires
    use of multiple internode round trips to process some common operations. For example,
    NFS WRITE operations require use of three internode round trips. This document
    looks at this issue and discusses what can and what should be done to address
    it, both within the context of an extensible version of RPC-over-RDMA and potentially
    outside that framework.</p>"
