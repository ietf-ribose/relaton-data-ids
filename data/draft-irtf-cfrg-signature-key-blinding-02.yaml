abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to existing digital signature schemes
    for key blinding. The core property of signing with key blinding is that a blinded
    public key and all signatures produced using the blinded key pair are independent
    of the unblinded key pair. Moreover, signatures produced using blinded key pairs
    are indistinguishable from signatures produced using unblinded key pairs. This
    functionality has a variety of applications, including Tor onion services and
    privacy-preserving airdrop for bootstrapping cryptocurrency systems.</p>"
