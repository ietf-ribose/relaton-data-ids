abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the advent of 5G era, sensing devices and mobile Internet\n
    \  devices in smart factories are everywhere, and a variety of\n   industrial
    data from different spatial devices becomes widely\n   available and interwoven.
    These data are usually generated by\n   streaming, with huge differences in data
    sources and structures,\n   massive scale, strong correlation and complicated
    relationship. The\n   great richness of data makes the problem of how to quickly,\n
    \  accurately and deeply dig the hidden value behind the data more\n   complicated
    than ever. The data generated in different fields are\n   distributed in a variety
    of business systems, and these data have\n   different structures and forms, so
    it is difficult to use an\n   efficient form of unified analysis. Based on the
    data characteristics\n   of heterogeneous data, the multi-source heterogeneous
    data fusion\n   method is studied based on tensor.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
