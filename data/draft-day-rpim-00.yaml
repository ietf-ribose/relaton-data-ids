abstract:
  content: "<p>This document is an alternative approach to defining the requirementsfor
    a presence information protocol. It may be usefully compared andcontrasted with
    ''Presence Information Protocol Requirements'' by LisaDusseault, draft-dusseault-pipr-00.txt.
    Although worthy in manyrespects, that document includes numerous desiderata, designconsiderations,
    and implementation concerns. This document attemptsto define only requirements,
    and a minimal set of requirements atthat. In addition, this document treats ''presence''
    and ''instantmessaging'' as distinct entities for the purpose of definingrequirements.
    We leave open the possibility of a single protocolfulfilling both sets of requirements,
    without requiring it.</p>"
