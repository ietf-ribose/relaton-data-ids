abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a TRILL (Transparent Interconnection
    of Lots\n   of Links) IS-IS application sub-TLV that enables the reporting by
    a\n   TRILL switch of sets of addresses. Each set of addresses reports all\n   of
    the addresses that designate the same interface (port) and also\n   reports the
    TRILL switch by which that interface is reachable. For\n   example, a 48-bit MAC
    (Media Access Control) address, IPv4 address,\n   and IPv6 address can be reported
    as all corresponding to the same\n   interface reachable by a particular TRILL
    switch. Such information\n   could be used in some cases to synthesize responses
    to or by-pass the\n   need for the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), the IPv6
    Neighbor\n   Discovery (ND) protocol, or the flooding of unknown MAC addresses.\n\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
