abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support
    for\n   multiple authentication methods. This document defines the Protected\n
    \  Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) Version 2, which provides\n   an
    encrypted and authenticated tunnel based on transport layer\n   security (TLS)
    that encapsulates EAP authentication mechanisms.\n   PEAPv2 uses TLS to protect
    against rogue authenticators, protect\n   against various attacks on the confidentiality
    and integrity of the\n   inner EAP method exchange and provide EAP peer identity
    privacy.\n   PEAPv2 also provides support for chaining multiple EAP mechanisms,\n
    \  cryptographic binding between authentications performed by inner EAP\n   mechanisms
    and the tunnel, exchange of arbitrary parameters (TLVs),\n   and fragmentation
    and reassembly.\n\t </p>\n      "
