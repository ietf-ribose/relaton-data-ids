abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP4 protocol specifies the selection and propagation of a single
    best path for each prefix. As defined and widely deployed today BGP has no mechanisms
    to distribute alternate paths which are not considered best path between its speakers.
    This behaviour results in number of disadvantages for new applications and services.
    This document presents an alternative mechanism for solving the problem based
    on the concept of parallel route reflector planes. Such planes can be built in
    parallel or they can co-exist on the current route reflection platforms. Document
    also compares existing solutions and proposed ideas that enable distribution of
    more paths than just the best path. This proposal does not specify any changes
    to the BGP protocol definition. It does not require upgrades to provider edge
    or core routers nor does it need network wide upgrades.</p>"
