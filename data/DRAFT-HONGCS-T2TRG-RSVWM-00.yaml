abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Wireless network virtualization is one of the auspicious\napproach
    to address the increasing\ndemand of mobile data services. It enables logically
    decoupling\nthe traditional cellular network into infrastructure providers\n(InPs)
    and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). It also\noffers a virtualized wireless
    network (VWN), efficient resource\nutilization, and isolation between network
    slices (i.e., MVNOs). In\nthis paper, we consider wireless network slicing for\na
    single InP\nwho owns radio resources and multiple MVNOs who need radio\nresources
    to provide specific services to their mobile users. One\nof the challenges in
    wireless network slicing is how to\nefficiently allocate the limited radio resources
    available at the\nInP to the MVNOs. In this paper, we address\nthe problem of
    efficient allocation of the InP radio\nresources to the MVNOs which aims to maximize
    the\ntotal network capacity of the InP. To this end,\nwe decompose our considered
    problem into two phases. The\nfirst phase is an efficient allocation of the InP
    radio\nresources (bandwidth) to the MVNOs, and the second phase\nis an optimal
    allocation of MVNOs resources gained from\nthe InP to their mobile users. We then
    propose\na Generalized Kelly Mechanism framework and the Karush-Kuhn-\nTucker
    (KKT) conditions to solve the first and the\nsecond phase of our resource allocation
    problem, respectively.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
