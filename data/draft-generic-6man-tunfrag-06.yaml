abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the network.
    Instead, links with restricting MTUs must either drop each too-large packet and
    return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) message or perform link-specific fragmentation
    and reassembly (also known as "link adaptation") at a layer below IPv6. This latter
    category of links is often performance-challenged to accommodate steady-state
    link adaptation. A common case that exhibits these link characteristics is seen
    for IPv6-within-IP tunnels. Additionally, IPv6 nodes can avoid path MTU discovery
    issues even when no link adaptation is necessary by performing a small amount
    of fragmentation and/or by probing the path as necessary. This document therefore
    proposes an update to the base IPv6 specification to better accommodate path MTU
    issues.</p>
