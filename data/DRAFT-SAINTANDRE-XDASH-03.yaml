abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Historically, there has often been a perceived distinction
    between\n   \"standard\" and \"non-standard\" parameters (such as media types
    and\n   header fields), by prefixing the latter with the string \"X-\" or\n   similar
    constructions (e.g., \"x.\").\n\n   In practice, this convention causes more problems
    than it solves.\n   Therefore, this document deprecates the \"X-\" convention
    for most\n   application protocol parameters.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
