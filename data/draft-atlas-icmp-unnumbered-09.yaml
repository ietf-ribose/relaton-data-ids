abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a data structure that can be appended to selected
    ICMP messages. The ICMP extension defined herein can be used to identify any combination
    of the following: the IP interface upon which a datagram arrived, the sub-IP component
    of an IP interface upon which a datagram arrived, the IP interface through which
    the datagram would have been forwarded had it been forwardable, and the IP next
    hop to which the datagram would have been forwarded. Devices can use this ICMP
    extension to identify interfaces and their components by any combination of the
    following: ifIndex, IPv4 address, IPv6 address, name, and MTU. ICMP-aware devices
    can use these extensions to identify both numbered and unnumbered interfaces.
