abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p> Flow measurement techniques have been developed in order to cope
    with\n   increasing bandwiths.  Flow measurement is currently being used as a\n
    \  popular method for monitoring large networks, e.g. at Internet\n   Service
    Providers or multinational corporations, for accounting,\n   management, and security
    purposes.  To construct the measurement\n   system for such networks, the biggest
    challenge is scalability.\n   Whereas packet sampling functions in current flow
    measurement\n   solutions such as NetFlow/sFlow/IPFIX help to approach this issue,\n
    \  some problems still remain.  This document describes such open\n   issues,
    which a flow-based measurement system might encounter in\n   large-scale networks.
    \ The results are intended to be used to define\n   and to develop an IPFIX Mediator
    device.\n\t </p>\n      "
