abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft is an attempt to outline a 'technique' (I hesitate to call
    it a protocol) to adapt a transport protocol to application needs, outside the
    protocol payload, without interfering with the transport protocol operation, nor
    directly affecting its implementation. It is based on an 'interposer' header between
    the IP header and the transport header (TCP or UDP) and, when needed, a trailer
    that that is appended to the transport PDU.</p>"
