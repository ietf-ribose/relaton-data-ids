abstract:
- content: "<p>The tremendous growth in Wi-Fi technology adoption over the last decade
    has met the ultimate possible goal of 100% adoption rate. All most every new mobile
    device is now equipped with IEEE 802.11-based wireless interface and with pre-configured
    policy to prefer Wi-Fi to cellular access. Matching this evolution is every service
    provider's desire to offer Wi-Fi based broadband services; a new business opportunity
    even for fixed line operators. Operators are exploring options to monetize their
    existing networks, most with nation-wide footprint, to build a high-speed Wi-Fi
    service that can be the basis for offering new wireless broadband services. This
    document identifies the requirements for supporting these new Wi-Fi community
    services and the mobility tools which have been standardized in IETF that can
    be used for enabling these architectures.</p>"
