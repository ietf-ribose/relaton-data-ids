abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In many SIP deployments, SIP entities exist in the SIP signaling\n
    \  path between the originating UAC and final terminating UAS, which go\n   beyond
    the definition of a Proxy, performing functions not defined\n   in standards-track
    RFCs.  The only term for such devices provided in\n   [RFC3261] is for a Back-to-Back
    User Agent (B2BUA), which is defined\n   as the logical concatenation of a User
    Agent Server (UAS) and User\n   Agent Client (UAC).\n\n   There are numerous types
    of SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs),\n   performing different roles in different
    ways.  For Example IP-PBXs,\n   SBCs and Application Servers.  This document identifies
    several\n   common B2BUA roles, in order to provide taxonomy other documents can\n
    \  use and reference.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
