abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines guidelines and protocol extensions for combining
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based real-time media sessions with Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) based instant messaging and presence services
    in a seamless manner. This is accomplished by integration and protocol extension
    support in the endpoints, without requiring any changes in the SIP or XMPP server
    infrastructure. It is even possible that SIP and XMPP services are offered by
    different service providers.</p>"
