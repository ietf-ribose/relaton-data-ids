abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) enables\n
    \  DHCPv6 servers to configure network parameters.  However, due to the\n   unsecured
    nature, various critical identifiers used in DHCPv6 are\n   vulnerable to several
    types of attacks, particularly pervasive\n   monitoring.  This document provides
    a mechanism to secure DHCPv6\n   messages, which achieves the client/server authentication
    and\n   encryption based on sender's certificates.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
