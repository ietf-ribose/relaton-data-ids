abstract:
  content: "\t <t>One of the main challenges in inter-domain federation of SessionInitiation
    Protocol (SIP) calls is that many domains continue toutilize phone numbers, and
    not email-style SIP URI. Consequently, amechanism is needed that enables secure
    mappings from phone numbersto domains. The main technical challenge in doing this
    securely isto verify that the domain in question truly is the \"owner\" of thephone
    number. This specification defines the PSTN ValidationProtocol (PVP), which can
    be used by a domain to verify thisownership by means of a forward routability
    check in the PSTN.LegalThis documents and the information contained therein are
