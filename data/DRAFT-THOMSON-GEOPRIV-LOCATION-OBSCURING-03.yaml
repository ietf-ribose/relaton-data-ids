abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A method for obscuring location information is described.  Both\n
    \  static and changing location information can be obscured.  A single\n   distance
    measure is input to the process; this parameter controls the\n   precision of
    location information that can be extracted by a\n   recipient.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
