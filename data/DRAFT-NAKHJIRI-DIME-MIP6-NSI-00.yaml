abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Dime working group is designing a procedure for bootstrapping
    Mobile\n   IPv6 using Diameter.  In order to reduce the complexity of Diameter\n
    \  Mobile IPv6 application, the process of Mobile IPv6 service\n   authorization
    is being separated from the initial mobile node\n   authentication.  This This
    allows for outsourcing the authentication\n   process to another application such
    as Diameter EAP[RFC4072] .  The\n   process can have security considerations,
    if the authorizing server\n   does not have a clear assurance that the MN has
    actually been\n   authenticated before, especially if the authorizing server is\n
    \  different from the authenticating server.  In this document we\n   provide
    a procedure and number of extensions to Mobile IPv6 and\n   Diameter signaling
    to address those considerations.  Specifically a\n   new Network Service Identifier
    (NSI) is defined to assist the\n   interaction between the authorizing and authenticating
    procedures and\n   servers.\n\t </p>\n      "
