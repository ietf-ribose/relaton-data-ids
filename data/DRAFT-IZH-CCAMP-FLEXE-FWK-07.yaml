abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the GMPLS control plane requirements,\n
    \  framework, and architecture for the FlexE technology.  The document\n   also
    discusses interoperation between the GMPLS control plane for\n   FlexE and the
    control plane of any networking layer using the FlexE\n   technology as a server
    layer.\n\n   As different from earlier Ethernet data planes FlexE allows for\n
    \  decoupling of the Ethernet Physical layer (PHY) and Media Access\n   Control
    layer (MAC) rates.\n\n   Study Group 15 (SG15) of the ITU-T has endorsed the FlexE\n
    \  Implementation Agreement from Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) and\n   included
    it, by reference, in some of their Recommendations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
