abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BIER introduces a novel multicast architecture.  It does not
    require\n   a signaling protocol to explicitly build multicast distribution\n
    \  trees, nor does it require intermediate nodes to maintain any per-\n   flow
    state.\n\n   Babel defines a distance-vector routing protocol that operates in
    a\n   robust and efficient fashion both in wired as well as in wireless\n   mesh
    networks.  This document defines a way to carry necessary BIER\n   signaling information
    in Babel.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
