    with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,it
    describes managed objects used for managing tunnels of any type over IPv4 and
    IPv6 networks. IP TUNNEL MIB[RFC4087] provides provisioning capability for IPv4
    and IPv6 tunnel by SNMP. But it is not eqnough to support modern tunnel protocol
    such as 6rd[RFC5969] and MAP[draft-ietf-softwire-map]. The document describes
    extention of IP TUNNEL MIB[RFC4087] to support 6rd[RFC5969] and MAP[draft-ietf-softwire-map].</p>"
