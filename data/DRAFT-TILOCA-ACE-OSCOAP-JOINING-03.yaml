abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to join a group where communications\n
    \  are based on CoAP and secured with Object Security for Constrained\n   RESTful
    Environments (OSCORE).  The proposed method delegates the\n   authentication and
    authorization of client nodes that join an OSCORE\n   group through a Group Manager
    server.  This approach builds on the\n   ACE framework for Authentication and
    Authorization, and leverages\n   protocol-specific profiles of ACE to achieve
    communication security,\n   proof-of-possession and server authentication.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
