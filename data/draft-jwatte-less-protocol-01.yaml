abstract:
  content: <p>Virtual worlds, typically implemented as multi-user sharedsimulations,
    are becoming increasingly used for serious work inaddition to the traditional
    uses of research and entertainment.Whereas previous distributed simulation protocols
    have been designedwith narrow, time-definite scope, the LESS (Live Entity State
    Stream)protocol is designed to allow open-ended join and leave for amultitude
    of simulation peers. The LESS protocol specifies how peersof a simulation collaborate
    and share state to achieve a mutuallyagreed "collective hallucination," leading
    to a user-perceivableshared state of a simulated worlds.</p>
