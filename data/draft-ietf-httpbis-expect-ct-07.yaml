abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new HTTP header field, named Expect-CT, that
    allows web host operators to instruct user agents to expect valid Signed Certificate
    Timestamps (SCTs) to be served on connections to these hosts. Expect-CT allows
    web host operators to discover misconfigurations in their Certificate Transparency
    deployments and ensure that misissued certificates accepted by UAs are discoverable
    in Certificate Transparency logs.</p>"
