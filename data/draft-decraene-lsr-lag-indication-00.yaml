abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new link flag to advertise that a layer-three
    link is composed of multiple layer-two sub-links, such as when this link is a
    Link Aggregation Group (LAG). This allows a large single flow (an elephant flow)
    to be aware that the link capacity will be lower than expected as this single
    flow is not load-balanced across the multiple layer-two sub-links. A path computation
    logic may use that information to route that elephant flow along a different path.</p>"
