abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document introduces the transport of call control related
    User\nto User Information (UUI) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),\nand
    develops several requirements for a new SIP mechanism.  Some SIP\nsessions are
    established by or related to a non-SIP application.\nThis application may have
    information that needs to be transported\nbetween the SIP User Agents during session
    establishment.  A common\nexample in another protocol is the ITU-T Q.931 User
    to User\nInformation Service.  As networks move to SIP it is important that\napplications
    requiring this data can continue to function in SIP\nnetworks as well as the ability
    to interwork with this ISDN service\nfor end-to-end transparency.  This document
    discusses requirements\nand approaches.  This extension will also be used for
    native SIP\nendpoints implementing similar services and interworking with ISDN\nservices.
    \ Example use cases include an exchange between two user\nagents, retargeting
    by a proxy, and redirection.  An example\napplication is an Automatic Call Distributor
    (ACD) in a contact\ncenter.\n\t </p>\n      "
