abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Identity Extensions using an IP address and port number to
    request a\n   location based on an individual packet flow have been previously\n
    \  specified by the GEOPRIV Working Group.\n\n   However certain kinds of NAT
    require that identifiers for both ends\n   of the packet flow must be specified
    in order to unambiguously\n   satisfy the location request.\n\n   This document
    specifieds a Flow Identity Extension for the HTTP-\n   Enabled Location Delivery
    (HELD) Protocol to support this\n   requirement.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
