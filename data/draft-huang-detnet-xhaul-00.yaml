abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet can be a very promising technology for mobile Fronthaul and
    Backhaul traffic transportation, even an integrated Fronthaul / Backhaul (XHaul),
    although there are still some challenges. This memo tries to analyze some of the
    challenges and issues, such as L2 or L3 (MPLS/IP) forwarding, packet loss, etc.,
    and to find out some requirements.</p>"
