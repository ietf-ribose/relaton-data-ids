abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides some analysis of threats against the GEOPRIV
    protocol architecture. It focuses on protocol threats, threats that result from
    the storage of data by entities in the architecture, and threats posed by the
    abuse of informaion yielded by geopriv. Some security properties that meet these
    threats are enumerated as a reference for GEOPRIV requirements.</p>"
