abstract:
- content: <p>This document addresses the problem of the size and freshness of the
    endnode learning table in edge Routing Bridges (RBridges), by allowing endnodes
    to volunteer for endnode learning and encapsulation/decapsulation. Such an endnode
    is known as a "Smart Endnode". Only the attached edge RBridge can distinguish
    a "Smart Endnode" from a "normal endnode". The Smart Endnode uses the nickname
    of the attached edge RBridge, so this solution does not consume extra nicknames.
    The solution also enables endnodes that are Fine-Grained Label (FGL) aware.</p>
