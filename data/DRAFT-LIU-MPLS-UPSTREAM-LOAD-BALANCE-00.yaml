abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for Load-Balancing among
    a set of \n   candidate upstream LSRs on a LAN interface. When there are several
    \n   candidates to be selected as an upstream LSR, according the current \n   upstream
    label allocation methods, the load on the candidate upstream \n   LSR which is
    selected by the routing protocol may be very heavy, \n   while the load on other
    candidate upstream LSRs is little. The Load-\n   Balancing also provides some
    procedures to minimize the packet loss \n   in following cases: 1) adding/removing
    a candidate upstream LSR; 2) a \n   better path emerging. \n\t </p>\n      "
