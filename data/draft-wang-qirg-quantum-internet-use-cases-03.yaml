abstract:
- content: "<p>The Quantum Internet has the potential to improve Internet application
    functionality by incorporating quantum information technology into the infrastructure
    of the overall Internet. In this document, we provide an overview of some applications
    expected to be used on the Quantum Internet, and then categorize them using the
    standard telecommunications classification of control plane versus data plane
    functionality. Other classification schemes are also possible and discussed briefly.
    We then provide detailed use cases for selected applications, and then derive
    a few key requirements for the Quantum Internet. The intent of this document is
    to provide a common understanding and framework of applications and use cases
    for the Quantum Internet.</p>"
