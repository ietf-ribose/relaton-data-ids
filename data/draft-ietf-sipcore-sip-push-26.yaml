abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how a Push Notification Service (PNS) can be
    used to wake a suspended Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA) with
    push notifications, and also describes how the UA can send binding-refresh REGISTER
    requests and receive incoming SIP requests in an environment in which the UA may
    be suspended. The document defines new SIP URI parameters to exchange PNS information
    between the UA and the SIP entity that will then request that push notifications
    be sent to the UA, and to trigger such push notification requests. The document
    also defines new feature- capability indicators that can be used to indicate support
    of this mechanism.</p>"
