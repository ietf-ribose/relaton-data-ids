  content: "\t <t>While the wide use of IPv4 \"private\" addresses [RFC1918] lead
    to agreat flexibilty degree of uninterconnected networks and use of IPv6offer
    a huge address space; no \"nice\" mechanism exist to hide overlapof existing IPv4
    \"private\" networks if and when the sum of usedaddress spaces is greater than
    the IPv4 \"private\" address space.This document specifies how to walk around
    the matter without anycoordination, renumbering or IPv6 adoption by overlapping
    networksowners.</p>"
