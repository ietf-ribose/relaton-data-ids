abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an extension to the Distributed Denial-of-\n
    \  Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) signal channel protocol so that\n   DOTS
    clients can control their filtering rules when an attack\n   mitigation is active.\n\n
    \  Particularly, this extension allows a DOTS client to activate or de-\n   activate
    existing filtering rules during a DDoS attack.  The\n   characterization of these
    filtering rules is conveyed by a DOTS\n   client during an idle time (i.e., no
    mitigation is active) by means\n   of the DOTS data channel protocol.\n\nEditorial
    Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)\n\n   Please update these statements within
    the document with the RFC\n   number to be assigned to this document:\n\n   o
    \ \"This version of this YANG module is part of RFC XXXX;\"\n\n   o  \"RFC XXXX:
    Controlling Filtering Rules Using Distributed Denial-\n      of-Service Open Threat
    Signaling (DOTS) Signal Channel\";\n\n   o  reference: RFC XXXX\n\n   o  [RFCXXXX]\n\n
    \  Please update the \"revision\" date of the YANG module.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
