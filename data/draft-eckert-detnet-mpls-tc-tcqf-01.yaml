abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the use of the MPLS TC field of MPLS Label Stack
    Entries (LSE) to support cycle tagging of packets for Multiple Buffer Cyclic Queuing
    and Forwarding (TCQF). TCQF is a mechanism to support bounded latency forwarding
    in DetNet network. Target benefits of TCQF include low end-to-end jitter, ease
    of high- speed hardware implementation, optional ability to support large number
    of flow in large networks via DiffServ style aggregation by applying TCQF to the
    DetNet aggregate instead of each DetNet flow individually, and support of wide-area
    DetNet networks with arbitrary link latencies and latency variations.</p>"
