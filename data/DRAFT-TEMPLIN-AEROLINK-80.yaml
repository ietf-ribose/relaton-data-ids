abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operation of IP over tunnel virtual
    links\n   using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO).  Nodes attached\n
    \  to AERO links can exchange packets via trusted intermediate routers\n   that
    provide forwarding services to reach off-link destinations and\n   route optimization
    services for improved performance.  AERO provides\n   an IPv6 link-local address
    format that supports operation of the IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol
    and links IPv6 ND to IP forwarding.\n   Dynamic link selection, mobility management,
    quality of service (QoS)\n   signaling and route optimization are naturally supported
    through\n   dynamic neighbor cache updates, while prefix delegation (PD) is\n
    \  supported by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6\n   (DHCPv6).
    \ AERO is a widely-applicable tunneling solution especially\n   well suited to
    mobile Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and other\n   applications as described
    in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
