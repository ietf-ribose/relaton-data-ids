abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture\n
    \  describes how Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets\n   through
    an IPv6 or MPLS network using the source routing paradigm.\n   Segment Routing
    (SR) enables any head-end node to select any path\n   without relying on a hop-by-hop
    signaling technique (e.g., LDP or\n   RSVP-TE).\n\n   It depends only on \"segments\"
    that are advertised by Link- State\n   IGPs.  A Segment Routed Path can be derived
    from a variety of\n   mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit\n
    \  configuration, or a Path Computation Element (PCE).\n\n   Since, Segment Routing
    can be applied to both MPLS and IPv6\n   forwarding plane, a PCE should be able
    to compute SR-Path for both\n   MPLS and IPv6 forwarding plane.  This draft describes
    the extensions\n   required for Segment Routing support for IPv6 data plane in
    Path\n   Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
