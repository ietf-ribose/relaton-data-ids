abstract:
- content: "<p>This document sets out a strawman proposal for how to organize the
    revision and update of any part of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
    processes including those for developing standards and other specifications. It
    does not propose specific changes to any of these processes, which should be the
    subject of future documents. However, it does propose an initial target area for
    process change.</p>"
