abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized
    to enable\n   carrier-grade packet transport.\n\n   This document provides texts
    proposal which should be discussed and\n   included in draft-fbb-mpls-tp-p2mp-framework,
    particularly focusing\n   on p2mp OAM framework in case that return paths don't
    exist. Other\n   requirements of p2mp transport path such as protection will also
    be\n   discussed.\n\n   Note: This I-D was made based on the result of discussion
    in ITU-T\n   SG15 which is described in a Liaison Statement: Request advance work\n
    \  on the p2mp framework in MPLS-TP\n   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1163/)\n\n
    \  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF)
    / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications\n   Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF
    MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
