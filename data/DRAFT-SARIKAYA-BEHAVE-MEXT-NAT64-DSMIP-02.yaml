abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo specifies modifications required to the home agent to\nintegrate
    NAT64 with Mobile IP so that IPv6 only mobile nodes (MN)\nreceiving host-based
    mobility management using Dual Stack Mobile IPv6\n(DSMIPv6) can communicate with
    IPv4 only servers.  The protocol is\nbased on home agents maintaining a table
    similar to NAT64 and linking\nit to the binding cache.  The changes include better
    keepalive\nmanagement in order to preserve battery on the mobile node as well
    as\nmulticast support for NAT64 integrated into the current multicast\nsupport
    scheme in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 so that IPv6 only mobile\nnodes can receive multicast
    data from IPv4 only content providers.\n\t </p>\n      "
