abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The call completion feature defined in this specification allows
    the\n   caller of a failed call to be notified when the callee becomes\n   available
    to receive a call.\n\n   For the realization of a basic solution without queuing,
    this\n   document references the usage of the dialog event package (RFC 4235)\n
    \  that is described as 'automatic redial' in the SIP Service Examples\n   (RFC
    5359).\n\n   For the realization of a more comprehensive solution with queuing
    ,\n   this document introduces an architecture for implementing these\n   features
    in the Session Initiation Protocol where \"Call completion\"\n   implementations
    associated with the caller's and callee's endpoints\n   cooperate to place the
    caller's request for call completion into a\n   queue at the callee's endpoint,
    and when a caller's request is ready\n   to be serviced, re-attempt of the original,
    failed call is made.\n\n   The architecture is designed to interoperate well with
    existing call-\n   completion solutions in other networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
