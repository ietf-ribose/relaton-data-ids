abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a proposal for a multi-purpose Generic
    Control\n   Protocol (IGCP) for IPv6 based networks. There is a growing need for\n
    \  a generic control protocol framework that can be further customized\n   to
    specific usage contexts in which certain types of control\n   information exchange
    messages and behavior among some functional\n   entities hosted by different nodes
    is desired. For example, the\n   growing area of self-management, self-organization
    and autonomic\n   networking introduces functional entities into the node and
    network\n   architectures that need to exchange control information in order to\n
    \  implement self-adaptive behavior and dynamic network configuration\n   and
    optimization. In this document, we capture a number of control\n   message exchange
    types of contexts for which a generic control\n   protocol would be desired. The
    extensibility of ICMPv6 offers the\n   room for designing such a generic control
    protocol. In this document,\n   we present our proposal for such a generic control
    protocol that is\n   based on extending ICMPv6, whose message format is divided
    into two\n   parts: a Common Part and a Generic Data Part that can be further\n
    \  structured according to some usage context of control messages\n   further
    encapsulated by the Data Part that need to be parsed and used\n   by entities
    meant to interpret the Data Part.  We also give an\n   example use case, where
    functional entities residing in different\n   nodes exchange information using
    the IGCP generic messages.\n\t </p>\n      "
