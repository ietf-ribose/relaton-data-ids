abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A Geopriv sighting protocol is described that is used for retrieving\nlocation
    information from a server within an access network.  The\nprotocol includes options
    for retrieving location information either\nby-value or by-reference.  The protocol
    supports mobile and nomadic\ndevices through Location URIs and location update
    URIs, which enables\ngeneration of location information at the Device.  The protocol
    is an\napplication-layer protocol that is independent of session-layer; an\nHTTP,
    web services binding is specified.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
