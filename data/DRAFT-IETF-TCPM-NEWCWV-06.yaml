abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an update to RFC 5681 to address issues
    that\n   arise when TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where\n
    \  the sending rate is limited by the application rather than the\n   congestion
    window.  It provides an experimental update to TCP that\n   allows a TCP sender
    to restart quickly following either a rate-\n   limited interval.  This method
    is expected to benefit applications\n   that send rate-limited traffic using TCP,
    while also providing an\n   appropriate response if congestion is experienced.\n\n
    \  It also evaluates the Experimental specification of TCP Congestion\n   Window
    Validation, CWV, defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that RFC\n   2861 sought to
    address important issues, but failed to deliver a\n   widely used solution.  This
    document therefore recommends that the\n   status of RFC 2861 is moved from Experimental
    to Historic, and that\n   it is replaced by the current specification.\n\n\t </p>\n
