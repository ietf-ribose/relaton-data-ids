abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a transport independent, request-responseprotocol
    for the management of trust anchors and communityidentifiers stored in a device.
    The protocol makes use of theCryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), and a digital
    signature is usedto provide integrity protection and data origin authentication.
    Eachtrust anchor is associated with a list of functions within devicesthat make
    use of digital signature mechanisms. Digital signaturescan be validated directly
    with the public key associated with thetrust anchor, or they can be validated
    with a certified public keywhose X.509 certification path terminates with the
    trust anchorpublic key.</p>"
