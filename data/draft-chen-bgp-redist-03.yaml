abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document we present several examples of non-deterministic routing
    behavior involving route redistribution into BGP. In order to eliminate such non-deterministic
    behavior, we propose an enhancement to BGP route selection that would take into
    account the administrative distance under certain conditions. We also recommend
    that the LOCAL_PREF value be reduced for the redistributed backup route, and be
    calculated automatically based on the administrative distance.</p>"
