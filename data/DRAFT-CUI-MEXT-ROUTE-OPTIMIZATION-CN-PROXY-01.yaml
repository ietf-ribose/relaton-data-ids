abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Route Optimization is a useful aspect of Mobile IPv6.  In Route\n
    \  Optimization mode a Mobile Node (MN) can communicate with a\n   Correspondent
    Node (CN) without the involvement of the MN's home\n   agent.  However, there
    are some limitations to this feature,\n   including that the Mobile Node and the
    Correspondent Node must both\n   be capable of Route Optimization.  This document
    introduces a Route\n   Optimization Proxy function that can be used to enable
    Route\n   Optimization between an MN and an arbitrary other IP CN - the Route\n
    \  Optimization functions are delegated to the Proxy.  The Route\n   Optimization
    Proxy function may be implemented in the access router\n   attached to the CN
    or any other node present on both the path from\n   the MN to the CN and from
    the HA to the CN, and the Route\n   Optimization Proxy can conduct RO-related
    signaling and accomplish\n   the Route Optimization procedure on behalf of the
    Correspondent Node.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
