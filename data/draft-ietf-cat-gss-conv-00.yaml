abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Traditionally, the GSSAPI specification has not included in its
    scopethe acquisition of initial credentials, or mechanisms which haverequired
    interaction with the user in the course of the securitycontext. This has limited
    the applicability of the GSSAPIspecification.This specification allows an application
    program to register acallback function so that a GSSAPI mechanism can request
    conversationservices from the application program. The application program isresponsible
    for displaying messages to the user and requesting inputfrom the user via the
    callback function.The goal of this specification is to allow certain low-infrastructure-requiring
    mechanisms to prompt the user for ausername, password, SecureID response, etc.
    It might also be used bymechanisms such as Kerberos when the GSSAPI library wishes
    to obtaininitial credentials itself, instead of assuming that they are alreadypresent
    in the process.</p>"
