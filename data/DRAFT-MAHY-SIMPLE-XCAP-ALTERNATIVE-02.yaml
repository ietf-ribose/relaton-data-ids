abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an alternative to XCAP (XML Configuration\n
    \  Access Protocol) for manipulating SIMPLE resource and authorization\n   lists
    using WebDAV.  XCAP and WebDAV are similar in that they are\n   both usages of
    HTTP.  Since servers could support both\n   simultaneously, WebDAV support is
    a logical progression from XCAP for\n   clients that require locking, version
    control, document moves or\n   other features of WebDAV.\n\t </p>\n      "
