abstract:
- content: "<p>Generic Router Assist (GRA) is a network-based service that enables
    end-to-end multicast transport protocols to take advantage of infor- mation distributed
    across the network elements in a given multicast distribution tree. The service
    consists of a canonical set of simple functions which network elements may apply
    to selected packets in the transport session as they traverse the distribution
    tree. The choice of function and the packet parameters to which it is applied
    can be defined and customized for a given transport session in a highly con- trolled
    fashion that still permits enough flexibility for GRA to be used to address a
    wide range of multicast transport problems not amenable to end-to-end solution.
    This document provides the motiva- tion and an architecture for GRA.</p>"
