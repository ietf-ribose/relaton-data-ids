abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an overview of the OAM toolset for MPLS
    based\n   Transport Networks.  The toolset consists of a comprehensive set of\n
    \  fault management and performance monitoring capabilities (operating\n   in
    the data-plane) which are appropriate for transport networks as\n   required in
    RFC 5860 and support the network and services at\n   different nested levels.
    \ This overview includes a brief recap of\n   MPLS-TP OAM requirements and functions,
    and of generic mechanisms\n   created in the MPLS data plane to allow the OAM
    packets run in-band\n   and share their fate with data packets.  The protocol
    definitions for\n   each of the MPLS-TP OAM tools are defined in separate documents
    (RFCs\n   or Working Group drafts) which are referenced by this document.\n\n
    \  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF)
    / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications\n   Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF
    MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network as\n   defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
