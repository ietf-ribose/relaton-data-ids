abstract:
- content: "<p>This document primarily regards the difference between the intended
    configuration and the applied configuration of a device and how intended and applied
    configuration relate to the operational state of a device. This document defines
    requirements for the applied configuration's data model and its values, as well
    as for enabling a client to know when a configuration has been fully applied or
    not, how to access operational state, and how to relate intended configuration
    nodes to applied configuration and derived state nodes.</p>"
