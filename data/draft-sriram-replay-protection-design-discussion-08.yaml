abstract:
- content: "<p>In the context of BGPsec, a withdrawal suppression occurs when an adversary
    AS suppresses a prefix withdrawal with the intension of continuing to attract
    traffic for that prefix based on a previous (signed and valid) BGPsec announcement
    that was earlier propagated. Subsequently if the adversary AS had a BGPsec session
    reset with a neighboring BGPsec speaker and when the session is restored, the
    AS replays said previous BGPsec announcement (even though it was withdrawn), then
    such a replay action is called a replay attack. The BGPsec protocol should incorporate
    a method for protection from Replay Attack and Withdrawal Suppression (RAWS),
    at least to control the window of exposure. This informational document provides
    design discussion and comparison of multiple alternative RAWS protection mechanisms
    weighing their pros and cons. This is meant to be a companion document to the
    standards track draft-ietf-sidrops-bgpsec- rollover that will specify a method
    to be used with BGPsec for RAWS protection.</p>"
