abstract:
- content: "<p>We detail the implementation of a network rate scheduler based on both
    a packet-based implementation of the generalized processor sharing (GPS) and a
    strict priority policies. This credit based scheduler called Priority Switching
    Scheduler (PSS), inherits from the standard Strict Priority Scheduler (SP) but
    dynamically changes the priority of one or several queues. Usual scheduling architectures
    often combine rate schedulers with SP to implement DiffServ service classes. Furthermore,
    usual implementations of rate scheduler schemes (such as WRR, DRR, ...) do not
    allow to efficiently guarantee the capacity dedicated to both AF and DF DiffServ
    classes as they mostly provide soft bounds. This means excessive margin is used
    to ensure the capacity requested and this impacts the number of additional users
    that could be accepted in the network. PSS allows a more predictable output rate
    per traffic class and is a one fit all scheme allowing to enable both SP and rate
    scheduling policies within a single algorithm.</p>"
