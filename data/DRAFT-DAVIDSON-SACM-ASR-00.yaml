abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines the Asset Summary Reporting (ASR),
    a data\n   model for expressing the data exchange format of summary information\n
    \  relative to one or more metrics. ASR reduces the bandwidth\n   requirement
    to report information about assets in the aggregate since\n   it allows for reporting
    aggregates relative to metrics, as opposed to\n   reporting data about each individual
    asset, which can lead to a\n   bloated data exchange. ASR is vendor neutral and
    leverages widely\n   adopted, open specifications; it is flexible, and suited
    for a wide\n   variety of reporting applications.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
