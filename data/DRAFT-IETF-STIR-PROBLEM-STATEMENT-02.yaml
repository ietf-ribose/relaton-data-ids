abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Over the past decade, Voice over IP (VoIP) systems based on
    SIP have\n   replaced many traditional telephony deployments.  Interworking VoIP\n
    \  systems with the traditional telephone network has reduced the\n   overall
    security of calling party number and Caller ID assurances by\n   granting attackers
    new and inexpensive tools to impersonate or\n   obscure calling party numbers
    when orchestrating bulk commercial\n   calling schemes, hacking voicemail boxes
    or even circumventing multi-\n   factor authentication systems trusted by banks.
    \ Despite previous\n   attempts to provide a secure assurance of the origin of
    SIP\n   communications, we still lack of effective standards for identifying\n
    \  the calling party in a VoIP session.  This document examines the\n   reasons
    why providing identity for telephone numbers on the Internet\n   has proven so
    difficult, and shows how changes in the last decade may\n   provide us with new
    strategies for attaching a secure identity to SIP\n   sessions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
