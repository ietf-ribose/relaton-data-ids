abstract:
- content: "<p>Whenever it is desireable to exactly replicated the content of a DNS
    zone into one or more other DNS zones so that the content is reachable by multiple
    names at different zone apexes, it is likewise desireable that this behaviour
    be automated so that cooperating primary and secondary nameservers can generate
    and serve the entire set of shadows without human intervention and in an open
    multivendor manner. This document describes a new CLONE resource record for a
    zone apex which can guide such cooperation.</p>"
