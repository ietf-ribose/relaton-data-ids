abstract:
- content: "<p>Within the ITU H.323 recommendation, the gatekeeper is a central point
    of communication for H.323 elements within a zone. All elements within the zone
    establish a communication channel with the gatekeeper over a registration, admission,
    and status (RAS) channel. Elements within a zone register with the gatekeeper
    and are subsequently able to communicate with other elements in the zone, or outside
    of the zone. What is needed in addition to the normal registration and connection
    admission procedures of H.323 is a means of acquiring information about elements
    in other zones. This document describes the framework for a peer gatekeeper routing
    protocol (pgrp) which allows gatekeepers to exchange information with other gatekeepers
    about elements in their respective zones. PGRP is a protocol supports the exchange
    of information among gatekeepers which may be used to make call routing decisions
    in a network. PGRP attempts to extend reliability concepts from telecommunications
    by incorporating maintenance state information exchange. This allows call routing
    decisions to be based upon the operational state of elements in the network. This
    feature is particularly useful in the H.323 gatekeeper mediated call model where
    a call may be completed to a pool of connection endpoints. An example of such
    a scenario is in the use of an H.323 to connect telecom end offices which connect
    to multiple H.323 gateways. In this context, pgrp is also able to support call
    distribution to balance the call load among the connection gateways serving an
    end office.</p>"
