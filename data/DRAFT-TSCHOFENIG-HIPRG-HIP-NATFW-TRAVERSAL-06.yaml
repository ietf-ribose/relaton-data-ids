abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) is a signaling protocol,
    which\n   supports mobility and multihoming by adding a new layer in the TCP/IP\n
    \  stack.  By carring relevant parameters in the signaling messages, HIP\n   can
    be used to establish IPsec encapsulating security payload (ESP)\n   security associations
    between two hosts.  Middleboxes (e.g. firewalls\n   and network address translators)
    cannot inspect transport layer\n   headers of data traffic if that traffic is
    sent over an IPsec ESP\n   tunnel.  However, HIP is designed to be middlebox friendly;
    it\n   enables the middleboxes to inspect the signaling messages.  The\n   information
    that they can derive from that messages enables the\n   middleboxes to uniquely
    identify the subsequent data flows, e.g. for\n   the purposes of multiplexing
    and demultiplexing .  A middlebox that\n   implements the relevant mechanisms
    is called \"HIP-aware\".  This\n   document presents a problem statement and lists
    some requirements\n   that are necessary for a HIP-aware middlebox traversal technique.\n
    \  These include authentication and authorization of signaling end-hosts\n   by
    the middleboxes.  Such authorization will help the middleboxes to\n   decide whether
    or not an end host is allowed to traverse, and can\n   potentially limit unwanted
    traffic.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
