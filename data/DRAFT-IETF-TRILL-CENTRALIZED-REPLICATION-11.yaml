abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In TRILL active-active access, an RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding)
    check\n   failure issue may occur when using the pseudo-nickname mechanism\n   specified
    in RFC 7781. This draft describes a solution to resolve\n   this RPF check failure
    issue through centralized replication. All\n   ingress RBridges send BUM (Broadcast,
    Unknown unicast and Multicast)\n   traffic to a centralized node with unicast
    TRILL encapsulation.\n   When the centralized node receives the BUM traffic, it
    decapsulates\n   the packets and forwards them to their destination RBridges using\n
    \  a distribution tree established as per TRILL base protocol RFC 6325.\n   To
    avoid RPF check failure on a RBridge sitting between the ingress\n   RBridge and
    the centralized replication node, some change in the\n   RPF calculation algorithm
    is required. RPF checks on each RBridge\n   MUST be calculated as if the centralized
    node was the ingress\n   RBridge, instead of being calculated using the actual
    ingress\n   RBridge.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
