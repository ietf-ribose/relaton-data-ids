abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The main purpose of this document is to propose new Conference
    Call \nService for the PINT WG. This document contains a description of a \nConference
    Call Service for PINT (CCSP), provides a non-exhaustive \nlist of PINT requests
    (PINT Conference Building Blocks) to support \nthem, and describes the needed
    extensions to the current PINT \narchitecture.  Current PINT services, such as
    Request to Call, use \nthe Internet only to deliver service requests from an IP
    host to the \nPSTN to be executed there.  However, limiting the PINT Conference
    \nservice to  just delivering the request to allocate the conference \nbridge
    to the PSTN, would hardly justify the practicality of the \nservice.  The PINT
    Conference Service described in this document \nallows for the following functionality:
    \no manual or automated negotiation of conference parameters, such as \ndate,
    agenda, etc., before the PSTN resources are committed;  \no requesting the PSTN
    to allocate the conference bridge; \no requesting the PSTN to start the conference
    automatically by \ncalling each participant at the specified time;  \nA proposal
    for new PINT building blocks with applications to Conference Calling    \no monitoring
    real-time conference events by keeping track of the \ncurrent speaker as well
    as of participants leaving or joining the \nconference bridge.  \nUnlike the current
    PINT services, which require exactly one request \nper service, the proposed Conference
    Call Service with the above \nfunctionality, needs to be mapped into a number
    of PINT requests.  In \nthis paper we propose a non-exhaustive list of PINT requests
    to \nsupport the basic CCSP functionality.  We also discuss the extensions \nto
    the current PINT architecture that are needed to support the CCSP. \nIf the service
    proposal is approved by the PINT WG, the protocol \nissues such as profiling SIP,
    SDP, etc.  will be addressed in the \nforthcoming documents.  \nThis document
    is intended for the PSTN-Internet Interworking (PINT) \nworki\n\t </p>\n      "
