abstract:
- content: "<p>Token binding allows HTTP servers to bind bearer tokens to TLS connections.
    In order to do this, clients or user agents must prove possession of a private
    key. However, proof-of-possession of a private key becomes truly meaningful to
    a server when accompanied by an attestation statement. This specification describes
    extensions to the existing token binding protocol to allow for attestation statements
    to be sent along with the related token binding messages.</p>"
