abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Server virtualization allows one physical server to support manyvirtual
    machines (VMs) so that multiple hosts (20, 30, or hundreds)can be running from
    one physical platform. As virtual machines areintroduced into a Data Center, the
    number of hosts within the datacenter can grow dramatically, which can have tremendous
    impact on thenetwork and hosts.This document provides an analysis of the scalability
    of IPv6Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) in data centers with a large number ofvirtual
    machines.</p>"
