abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Secure Shell protocol (SSH) [RFC4251] is widely used for
    purposes\n   including secure remote administration, file transfer using SFTP
    and\n   SCP, and encrypted tunneling of TCP connections.  Because it is based\n
    \  on TCP, SSH suffers similar problems as motivate the HTTP protocol to\n   transition
    its transport to UDP-based QUIC [QUIC].  These include:\n   unauthenticated network
    intermediaries can trivially disconnect SSH\n   sessions; SSH connections are
    lost when mobile clients change IP\n   addresses; performance limitations in OS-based
    TCP stacks; and many\n   round-trips to establish the connection.  This memo specifies
    SSH key\n   exchange over UDP and leverages QUIC to provide a UDP-based\n   transport.\n\n\t
