abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) requires that messages
    are\n   transmitted at regular intervals and provides a way to negotiate the\n
    \  interval used by BFD peers.  Some BFD implementations may be\n   restricted
    to only support several interval values.  When such BFD\n   implementations speak
    to each other, there is a possibility of two\n   sides not being able to find
    a common value for the interval to run\n   BFD sessions.\n\n   This document defines
    a small set of interval values for BFD that we\n   call \"Common Intervals\",
    and recommends implementations to support\n   the defined intervals.  This solves
    the problem of finding an\n   interval value that both BFD speakers can support
    while allowing a\n   simplified implementation as seen for hardware-based BFD.
    \ It does\n   not restrict an implementation from supporting more intervals in\n
    \  addition to the Common Intervals.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
