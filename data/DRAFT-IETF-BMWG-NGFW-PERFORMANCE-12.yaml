abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides benchmarking terminology and methodology
    for\n   next-generation network security devices including next-generation\n   firewalls
    (NGFW), next-generation intrusion prevention systems\n   (NGIPS), and unified
    threat management (UTM) implementations.  The\n   main areas covered in this document
    are test terminology, test\n   configuration parameters, and benchmarking methodology
    for NGFW and\n   NGIPS.  This document aims to improve the applicability,\n   reproducibility,
    and transparency of benchmarks and to align the test\n   methodology with today's
    increasingly complex layer 7 security\n   centric network application use cases.
    \ As a result, this document\n   makes [RFC3511] obsolete.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
