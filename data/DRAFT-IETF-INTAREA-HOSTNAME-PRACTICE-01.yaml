abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Giving a hostname to your computer and publishing it as you
    roam from\n   one network to another is the Internet equivalent of walking around\n
    \  with a name tag affixed to your lapel.  This current practice can\n   significantly
    compromise your privacy, and something should change in\n   order to mitigate
    these privacy threads.\n\n   There are several possible remedies, such as fixing
    a variety of\n   protocols or avoiding disclosing a hostname at all.  This document\n
    \  describes some of the protocols that reveal hostnames today and\n   sketches
    another possible remedy, which is to replace static\n   hostnames by frequently
    changing randomized values.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
