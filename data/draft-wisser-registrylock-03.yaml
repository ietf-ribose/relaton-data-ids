abstract:
- content: <p>This extensions defines an additional protective layer for changes to
    domain [RFC5731], host xref target="RFC5732" format="default"/&gt; and contact
    [RFC5733] objects managed through EPP. EPP allows changes to objects only by the
    sponsoring client. EPP objects are usually managed by the sponsoring client on
    behalf of the sponsoring clients customers. All of these interactions are ususally
    fully automated. In case of a system breach, there is no protection in EPP to
    changes to any object by the intruder. This extension defines a protective layer
    that aims to break automated changes and work flows by requiring manual intervention
    by the sponsoring client or it's customers. xxx</p>
