abstract:
- content: "<p>In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary
    to be able to manipulate some parameters in Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
    packets, while still providing strong end-to-end security guarantees. This document
    defines a cryptographic transform for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
    (SRTP) that uses two separate but related cryptographic operations to provide
    hop-by-hop and end-to-end security guarantees. Both the end-to-end and hop-by-hop
    cryptographic algorithms can utilize an authenticated encryption with associated
    data (AEAD) algorithm or take advantage of future SRTP transforms with different
    properties.</p>"
