abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) use Unicode for\ndomain name,
    rather than using a subset of ASCII.  This\nincreased name space, as well the
    requirement to\nmaintain compatibility with the existing domain name\nservice
    means that IDNs must be encoded in a form that\ncan be supported without changes
    to any portion of the\nDNS that does not participate in the upgrade to IDN.\nThis
    specification defines a mechanism called IDNA for\nhandling them in a standard
    fashion and specifies an\nIDNA profile for domain names used as host references.\nIDNA
    allows non-ASCII characters to be represented using\nthe same octets used in so-called
    host names today. This\nrepresentation allows IDNs to be introduced with minimal\nchanges
    to the existing DNS infrastructure. IDNA is only\nmeant for processing domain
    names, not free text.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
