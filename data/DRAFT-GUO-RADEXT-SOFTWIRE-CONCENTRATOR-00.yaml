abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>6rd and DS-Lite are two most popular methods to provide both IPv4
    and \nIPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-\nexisting
    period. Both mechanisms need to configure the softwire \nconcentrator information
    on the host. In many networks, the \ninformation may be stored in AAA servers
    while user configuration is \nmainly through DHC protocol. This document defines
    several RADIUS \nattributes that carries softwire concentrator information.\n\t
