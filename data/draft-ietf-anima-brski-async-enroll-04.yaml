abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes enhancements of bootstrapping a remote secure
    key infrastructure (BRSKI, [RFC8995] ) to also operate in domains featuring no
    or only timely limited connectivity between involved components. To support such
    use cases, BRSKI-AE relies on the exchange of authenticated self-contained objects
    (signature-wrapped objects) also for requesting and distributing of domain specific
    device certificates. The defined approach is agnostic regarding the utilized enrollment
    protocol allowing the application of existing and potentially new certificate
    management protocols.</p>"
