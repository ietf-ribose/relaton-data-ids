abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the processing of the Hop-by-Hop Options\n
    \  Header in today's routers in the aspects of standards specification,\n   common
    implementations, and default operations.  This document\n   outlines the reasons
    why the Hop-by-Hop Options Header is rarely\n   utilized in current networks.
    \ In addition, this document describes\n   why the HBH could be used as a powerful
    mechanism allowing deployment\n   and operations of new services requiring a more
    optimized way to\n   leverage network resources of an infrastructure.  The Hop-by-Hop\n
    \  Options Header is taken into consideration as a valuable container\n   for
    carrying the information facilitating the introduction of new\n   services.  The
    desired, and proposed, processing behavior of the HBH\n   and the migration strategies
    towards it are also suggested.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
