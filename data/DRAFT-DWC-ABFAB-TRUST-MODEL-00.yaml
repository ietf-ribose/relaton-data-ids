abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Trust routers form an integral part of the ABFAB infrastructure
    for\ndetermining routes between IdPs and RPs and determining CoI membership.\nSince
    it is inherent in their name that they are to be trusted, this\nInternet Draft
    specifies a trust model for their operation, so that IdPs\nand RPs can rely on
    them to perform the tasks that they are trusted to\nperform. These tasks are:\n\n-\tform
    a trusted route between an IdP and RP\n-\tensure that a community of interest
    (CoI)only has the members that it\nshould have\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
