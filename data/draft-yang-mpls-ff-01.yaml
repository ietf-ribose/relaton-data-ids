abstract:
- content: "<p>A fractional-forwarding scheme is a highly compact, flexible scheme
    for specify routing for both traffic engineering (TE) and fast rerouting. The
    ability of fractional forwarding can be a key benefit of MPLS over OSPF/IS-IS.
    Many highly effective TE algorithms are proposed and evaluated based on fractional
    forwarding. In this document, we propose MPLS-ff, an extension to MPLS to allow
    efficient implementation of fractional forwarding. We present the required extensions
    in the MPLS data forwarding plane. We also list the requirements in signaling
    for MPLS-ff.</p>"
