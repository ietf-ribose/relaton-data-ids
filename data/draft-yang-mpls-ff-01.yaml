abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A fractional-forwarding scheme is a highly compact, flexible schemefor
    specify routing for both traffic engineering (TE) and fastrerouting. The ability
    of fractional forwarding can be a key benefitof MPLS over OSPF/IS-IS. Many highly
    effective TE algorithms areproposed and evaluated based on fractional forwarding.In
    this document, we propose MPLS-ff, an extension to MPLS to allowefficient implementation
    of fractional forwarding. We present therequired extensions in the MPLS data forwarding
    plane. We also listthe requirements in signaling for MPLS-ff.</p>"
