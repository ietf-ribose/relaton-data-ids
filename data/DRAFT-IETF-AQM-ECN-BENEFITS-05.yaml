abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of this document is to describe the potential benefits
    when\n   applications use a transport that enables Explicit Congestion\n   Notification
    (ECN).  The document outlines the principal gains in\n   terms of increased throughput,
    reduced delay and other benefits when\n   ECN is used over a network path that
    includes equipment that supports\n   ECN-marking.  It also discusses challenges
    for successful deployment\n   of ECN.  It does not propose new algorithms to use
    ECN, nor does it\n   describe the details of implementation of ECN in endpoint
    devices\n   (Internet hosts), routers or other network devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
