abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working
    group is\n   charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich\n
    \  communication using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-\n   browsers.
    \ For the support of data communication, the RTCWeb working\n   group has in particular
    defined the concept of bi-directional data\n   channels over SCTP, where each
    data channel might be used to\n   transport other protocols, called sub-protocols.
    \ This document\n   specifies how the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) can
    be\n   instantiated as a WebRTC data channel sub-protocol, using the SDP\n   offer/exchange
    to negotiate out-of-band the sub-protocol specific\n   parameters.  Two network
    configurations are documented: a WebRTC end-\n   to-end configuration (connecting
    two MSRP over data channel\n   endpoints), and a gateway configuration (connecting
    an MSRP over data\n   channel endpoint with an MSRP over TCP endpoint).\n\n\t
