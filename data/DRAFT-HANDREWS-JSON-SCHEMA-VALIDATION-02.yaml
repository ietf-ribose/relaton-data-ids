abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   JSON Schema (application/schema+json) has several purposes,
    one of\n   which is JSON instance validation.  This document specifies a\n   vocabulary
    for JSON Schema to describe the meaning of JSON documents,\n   provide hints for
    user interfaces working with JSON data, and to make\n   assertions about what
    a valid document must look like.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
