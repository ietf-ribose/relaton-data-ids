abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a profile for compressing SCTP/IP using the\nRobust
    Header Compression Formal Notation.\nThe RObust Header Compression [1] scheme
    is designed to compress\npacket headers over error prone channels.  It is built
    around an\nextensible core framework that can be tailored to compress new\nprotocol
    stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles.\nThis profile describes a new profile
    for ROHC which will allow SCTP/\nIP headers to be compressed.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
