abstract:
- content: "<p>The DiffServ Working Group will produce PHBs (Per Hop Behaviors) used
    to provide differentiated services. Some of these are to be standardized, others
    may have widespread use and still others may remain experimental. The encoding
    of the PHB into a codepoint of the DS Field will not be standardized, except for
    the legacy, precedence PHBs. Therefore a method is needed to coordinate the use
    of PHBs and codepoints, even if only for the purpose of discussing them. This
    draft addresses this coordination issue.</p>"
