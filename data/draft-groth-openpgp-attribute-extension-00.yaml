abstract:
  content: "<p>A RFC was accepted extending TLS usage to include OpenPGP keys (RFC5081)
    as an alternative or in addition to X.509 certificates,however the author did
    not really standardise the way theinformation in OpenPGP keys was to be presented
    and this could bedetrimental or fragment efforts to utilise OpenPGP keys in thismanner.The
    author didn't touch on the issue generating confidence scoresbeyond potential
    use of Certificate Authorities.</p>"
