abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The immutable HTTP response Cache-Control extension allows
    servers to\n   identify resources that will not be updated during their freshness\n
    \  lifetime.  This assures that a client never needs to revalidate a\n   cached
    fresh resource to be certain it has not been modified.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
