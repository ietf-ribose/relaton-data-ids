abstract:
- content: "<p>The model describe here is based on the notion of creating transient
    'management sessions' for use by a management application. Each session is initialized
    by consulting a user profile, which has been previously configured at the agent.
    The profile specifies such information as authentication and authorization information,
    along with a maximum time that a session may be inactive before the agent destroys
    it. When a session is created, the SNMPv2 parties and corresponding access control
    information are dynamically created. These parties are used to perform protocol
    operations. If the management application completes before the management session
    expires, it may explicitly destroy the session. Regardless, when a session is
    destroyed, the corresponding resources (e.g., parties and ACLs), are deleted by
    the agent.</p>"
