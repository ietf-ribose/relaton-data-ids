abstract:
  content: "<p>Currently, the RSIP framework [RSIP-FRAM] focus its architecture onthe
    typical scenario where hosts on a private realm are connected toan external realm
    by the mean of an unique gateway where the majorityof the functionality's are
    concentrated.The aim of this document is to extend ths scope by describing ageneric
    architecture. Furthermore, it tries to identify thefunctionality's of the system,
    their purposes as well as the way theyinterwork.The benefits of this extention
    are an increase of the robustness ofthe system and an opportunity to gain benefit
    of multiple connectiontowards one or more (multi-homing) external realms (ISPs).</p>"
