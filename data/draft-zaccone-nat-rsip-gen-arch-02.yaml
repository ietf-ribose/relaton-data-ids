abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, the RSIP framework [RSIP-FRAM] focus its architecture on
    the typical scenario where hosts on a private realm are connected to an external
    realm by the mean of an unique gateway where the majority of the functionality's
    are concentrated. The aim of this document is to extend ths scope by describing
    a generic architecture. Furthermore, it tries to identify the functionality's
    of the system, their purposes as well as the way they interwork. The benefits
    of this extention are an increase of the robustness of the system and an opportunity
    to gain benefit of multiple connection towards one or more (multi-homing) external
    realms (ISPs).</p>"
