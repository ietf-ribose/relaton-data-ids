abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The core SCIM 1.0 specification is intended to provide updates
    to a\n   single cloud-based application. This extension specifies an extended\n
    \  API definition which allows a single SCIM endpoint to support updates\n   to
    multiple cloud-based applications. These extensions enable network\n   relationships
    such as proxy updates, and hub-to-hub-to-spoke\n   relationships in addition to
    the hub-spoke relationship defined in\n   the core SCIM 1.0 specification.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
