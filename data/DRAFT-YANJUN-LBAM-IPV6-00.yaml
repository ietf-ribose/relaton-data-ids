abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Load balancing is a method, by which IP packet can be distributed
    \nacross a pool of servers, instead of directing to a single server. \nThere are
    many applications needing load balancing such as Web \nservice, FTP service and
    NAT gateway. However, current load \nbalancing software and implementations have
    problems such as poor \nscalability, inability to balance session flow, long latency
    time \nand topological constraint on server pool.  \nThis document describes a
    method using pseudo-anycast and pseudo-\nmobility based on Mobile IPv6 to implement
    load balancing in \nsession level in Ipv6 network, by which those problems above
    can be \nsolved. Futhermore, this method only need little modification to \nMobile
    IPv6 in the servers' and agent's side; as for the general \nusers, it need not
    any modification. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
