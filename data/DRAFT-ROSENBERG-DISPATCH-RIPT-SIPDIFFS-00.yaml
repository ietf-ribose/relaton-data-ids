abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-Time Internet Peering for Telephony (RIPT) protocol
    and its\n   extension for inbound calls to single user devices provide an\n   alternative
    to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for several use\n   cases.  This leads
    to many questions - how is RIPT different from SIP\n   and why?  What should be
    standardized and what should not?  How much\n   of SIP do those two specifications
    replace?  This document discusses\n   the differences and their motivations, and
    presents an analysis\n   across the set of SIP specifications, and analyzes whether
    the two\n   RIPT documents replace each with similar capability, whether they\n
    \  eliminate the need for that specification, or whether some or all of\n   that
    specification are not addressed by RIPT.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
