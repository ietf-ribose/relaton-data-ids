abstract:
- content: "<p>Well-Known BGP Communities are manipulated differently across various
    current implementations; resulting in difficulties for operators. Network operators
    should deploy consistent community handling across their networks while taking
    the inconsistent behaviors from the various BGP implementations into consideration..
    This document recommends specific actions to limit future inconsistency, namely
    BGP implementors must not create further inconsistencies from this point forward.</p>"
