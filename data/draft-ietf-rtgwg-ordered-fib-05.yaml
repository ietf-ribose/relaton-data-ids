abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for use in conjunction with link
    state routing protocols which prevents the transient loops which would otherwise
    occur during topology changes. It does this by correctly sequencing the FIB updates
    on the routers. This mechanism can be used in the case of non-urgent link or node
    shutdowns and restarts or link metric changes. It can also be used in conjunction
    with a fast re-route mechanism which converts a sudden link or node failure into
    a non-urgent topology change. This is possible where a complete repair path is
    provided for all affected destinations. After a non-urgent topology change, each
    router computes a rank that defines the time at which it can safely update its
    FIB. A method for accelerating this loop-free convergence process by the use of
    completion messages is also described. The technology described in this document
    has been subject to extensive simulation using real network topologies and costs,
    and pathological convergence behaviour. A variant of the technology described
    here has been experimentally deployed in a production network.</p>"
