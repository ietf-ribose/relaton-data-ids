abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   PASSporT is specified in RFC 8225 to convey cryptographically-signed\n
    \  information about the people involved in personal communications.\n   This
    document extends PASSporT to include an indication that a call\n   has been diverted
    from its original destination to a new one.  This\n   information can greatly
    improve the decisions made by verification\n   services in call forwarding scenarios.
    \ Also specified here is an\n   encapsulation mechanism for nesting a PASSporT
    within another\n   PASSporT that assists relying parties in some diversion scenarios.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
