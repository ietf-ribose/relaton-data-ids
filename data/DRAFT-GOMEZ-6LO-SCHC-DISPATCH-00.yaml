abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A new framework called Static Context Header Compression (SCHC)
    has\n   been designed to support IPv6 over Low Power Wide Area Network\n   (LPWAN)
    technologies [RFC8724].  One of the SCHC components is a\n   header compression
    mechanism.  If used properly, SCHC header\n   compression allows a greater compression
    ratio than that achievable\n   with traditional 6LoWPAN header compression [RFC6282].
    \ For this\n   reason, it may make sense to use SCHC header compression in some\n
    \  6LoWPAN environments.  In its current form, this document proposes a\n   number
    of 6LoWPAN Dispatch type approaches to signal when a packet\n   header has been
    compressed by using SCHC header compression.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
