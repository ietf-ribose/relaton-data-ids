abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the minimal configuration required
    for a new\n   device, called \"pledge\", to securely join a 6TiSCH (IPv6 over
    the\n   TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e) network.  The entities involved use CoAP\n
    \  (Constrained Application Protocol) and OSCORE (Object Security for\n   Constrained
    RESTful Environments).  The configuration requires that\n   the pledge and the
    JRC (join registrar/coordinator, a central\n   entity), share a symmetric key.
    \ How this key is provisioned is out\n   of scope of this document.  The result
    of the joining process is that\n   the JRC configures the pledge with link-layer
    keying material and a\n   short link-layer address.  This specification also defines
    a new\n   Stateless-Proxy CoAP option.  Additional security mechanisms may be\n
    \  added on top of this minimal framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
