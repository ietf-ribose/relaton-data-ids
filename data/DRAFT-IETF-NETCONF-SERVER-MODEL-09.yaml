abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft defines a NETCONF server configuration data model
    and a\n   RESTCONF server configuration data model.  These data models enable\n
    \  configuration of the NETCONF and RESTCONF services themselves,\n   including
    which transports are supported, what ports the servers\n   listen on, call-home
    parameters, client authentication, and related\n   parameters.\n\nEditorial Note
