abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the roles and requirements for a slice gateway
    that is a function or function group for handling data plane traffic, such as
    connecting/disconnecting and compose/decompose network slice subnets and providing
    network slices from end to end. The interworkings between management and control
    elements at the management and control planes with the gateway function for controlling
    and orchestrating end-to-end network slices are also presented in this document.</p>"
