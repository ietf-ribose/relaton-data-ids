abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes some suggested practices for registeringinternationalized
    domain names (IDNs) in a zone. Before acceptingregistrations of domain names into
    a zone, the zone's registry shoulddecide which codepoints in the Unicode character
    set the zone willaccept. The registry should also decide whether particular characters
    ina registered domain name should cause registration of multipleequivalent domain
    names; these domain names might be added to the zoneor blocked from registration.
    This document also describes how to handlecharacter variants in registering IDNs,
    and how to publish tables thatlist the character variants.</p>"
