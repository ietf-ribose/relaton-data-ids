abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces the Open Password Automation Recipe
    (OPAR)\n   Protocol, a suggested format for providing instructions to password\n
    \  managers programmatically that defines the valid construction of a\n   password.
    With password managers becoming integrated into browsers,\n   websites should
    be able to describe the elements of an acceptable\n   password programmatically
    so password management plugins can read\n   and automatically generate the best
    option. Without this, manual\n   intervention by the user is required when the
    password is too long,\n   contains invalid characters, or does not meet complexity\n
    \  requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
