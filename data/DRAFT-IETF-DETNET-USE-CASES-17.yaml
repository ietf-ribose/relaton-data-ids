abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft documents requirements in several diverse industries
    to\n   establish multi-hop paths for characterized flows with deterministic\n
    \  properties.  In this context deterministic implies that flows can be\n   established
    which provide guaranteed bandwidth and latency which can\n   be established from
    either a Layer 2 or Layer 3 (IP) interface, and\n   which can co-exist on an IP
    network with best-effort traffic.\n\n   Additional requirements include optional
    redundant paths, very high\n   reliability paths, time synchronization, and clock
    distribution.\n   Industries considered include professional audio, electrical\n
    \  utilities, building automation systems, wireless for industrial,\n   cellular
    radio, industrial machine-to-machine, mining, private\n   blockchain, and network
    slicing.\n\n   For each case, this document will identify the application, identify\n
    \  representative solutions used today, and the improvements IETF DetNet\n   solutions
    may enable.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
