abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document adapts the X.500 directory administrative model
    for use\n   by the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).  The\n   administrative
    model partitions the Directory Information Tree (DIT)\n   for various aspects
    of directory data administration, e.g.,\n   subschema, access control, and collective
    attributes.  The generic\n   framework that applies to every aspect of administration
    is described\n   in this document.  The definitions that apply for a specific
    aspect\n   of administration, e.g., access control administration, are described
    \n   in other documents.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
