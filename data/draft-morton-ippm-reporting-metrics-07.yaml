abstract:
- content: <p>Consumers of IP network performance metrics have many different uses
    in mind. This memo categorizes the different audience points of view. It describes
    how the categories affect the selection of metric parameters and options when
    seeking info that serves their needs. The memo then proceeds to discuss "long-term"
    reporting considerations (e.g, days, weeks or months, as opposed to 10 seconds).</p>
