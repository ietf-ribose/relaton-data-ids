abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Several DLEP extensions are being suggested that require the
    ability\n   to group a set of DLEP Data Items into a logical set or bag.  This\n
    \  document species a generic method of defining such a bag of Data\n   Items,
    in what this document defines as a Data Item Container.  This\n   document also
    describes what an extension using Data Item Containers\n   must specify in the
    extension specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
