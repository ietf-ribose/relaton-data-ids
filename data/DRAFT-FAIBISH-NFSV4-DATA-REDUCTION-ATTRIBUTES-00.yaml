abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes extending NFSv4 operations to enable\n
    \  file extended attributes or xattr to be used in the protocol to\n   provide
    information about the data reduction properties of files.\n   New xattrs are proposed
    to allow the client application to\n   communicate to the NFSv4 server data reduction
    attributes\n   associated with files and directories using opaque metadata, not\n
    \  interpreted by the file system, but communicated to the Block\n   Storage data
    reduction engines. Corresponding new file attributes\n   are proposed to allow
    clients and client applications to query the\n   server for data reduction xattr
    support and allow to get and set\n   data reduction xattrs on files and directories.
    Such data reduction\n   metadata is used as hints to the file server about what
    type of data\n   reduction to apply. The proposed data reduction attributes include\n
    \  achievable ratios for compression and deduplication plus whether\n   each data
    reduction technique applies to the file.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
