abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile
    (MPLS-TP)\n   is the common set of MPLS protocol functions defined to enable the\n
    \  construction and operation of packet transport networks.  The MPLS-TP\n   supports
    both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint transport paths.\n   This document
    defines the elements and functions of the MPLS-TP\n   architecture applicable
    specifically to supporting point-to-\n   multipoint transport paths.\n\n   This
    document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) /
    International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\n   Standardization Sector
    (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF MPLS and
    PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and functionalities of a packet
    transport network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
