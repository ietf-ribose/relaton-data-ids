abstract:
- content: "<p>The CAA DNS record allows a domain to communicate issuance policy to
    CAs, but only allows a domain to define policy with CA-level granularity. However,
    the CAA specification also provides facilities for extension to admit more granular,
    CA-specific policy. This specification defines two such parameters, one allowing
    specific accounts of a CA to be identified by URI and one allowing specific methods
    of domain control validation as defined by the ACME protocol to be required.</p>"
