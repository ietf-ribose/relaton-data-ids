abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a "problem detail" as a way to carry machine-
    readable details of errors in a CoAP response to avoid the need to define new
    error response formats for CoAP APIs. The proposed format is inspired by the Problem
    Details for HTTP APIs defined in RFC 7807. Discussion Venues This note is to be
    removed before publishing as an RFC. Source for this draft and an issue tracker
    can be found at https://github.com/core-wg/core-problem-details (https://github.com/
    core-wg/core-problem-details).</p>
