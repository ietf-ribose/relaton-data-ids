abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a new approach
    for\n   network programmability, that is, the capacity to initialize,\n   control,
    change, and manage network behavior dynamically via open\n   interfaces as opposed
    to relying on closed-box solutions and their\n   associated proprietary interfaces.
    \ SDN emphasizes the role of\n   software in running networks through the introduction
    of an\n   abstraction for the data forwarding plane and, by doing so, separates\n
    \  it from the control plane.  This separation allows faster innovation\n   cycles
    at both planes as experience has already shown.  However,\n   there is increasing
    confusion as to what exactly SDN is, what is the\n   layer structure in an SDN
    architecture and how do layers interface\n   with each other.  This document,
    a product of the IRTF Software-\n   Defined Networking Research Group (SDNRG),
    addresses these questions\n   and provides a concise reference for the SDN research
    community based\n   on relevant peer-reviewed literature, the RFC series, and
    relevant\n   documents by other standards organizations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
