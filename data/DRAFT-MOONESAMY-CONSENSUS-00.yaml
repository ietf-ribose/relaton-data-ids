abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Decision-making is difficult when there is a need to consider
    the\n   interests of all of the affected parties and when it is important to\n
    \  gain widespread community consensus.  This document discusses about\n   consensus.
    \ It neither seeks to define consensus nor does it\n   prescribe practices for
    the Internet Standards Process.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
