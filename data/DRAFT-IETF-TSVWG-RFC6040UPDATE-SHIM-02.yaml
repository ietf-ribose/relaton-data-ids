abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 6040 on \"Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion Notification\"
    made the\n   rules for propagation of ECN consistent for all forms of IP in IP\n
    \  tunnel.  This specification extends the scope of RFC 6040 to include\n   tunnels
    where two IP headers are separated by at least one shim\n   header that is not
    sufficient on its own for packet forwarding.  It\n   surveys widely deployed IP
    tunnelling protocols separated by a shim\n   and updates the specifications of
    those that do not mention ECN\n   propagation (L2TPv2, L2TPv3, GRE and Teredo).
    \ The specification also\n   updates RFC 6040 with configuration requirements
    needed to make any\n   legacy tunnel ingress safe.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
