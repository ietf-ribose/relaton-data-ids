abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes certain optimizations to how entropy labels
    can be used for load balancing in a seamless MPLS architecture, as enabled by
    LSP concatenation and LSP hierarchies. The definition of the control plane and
    data plane behavior at LSP concatenation points; and at the ingress of an LSP
    in a hierarchy of LSPs, as described in this document, brings the benefits of
    entropy labels to certain deployment scenarios that may not have had such benefits
    as specified in [EL-RFC]. This document, if approved, updates RFC 6790.</p>"
