abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document scopes the relation between Internet protocols
    and the\n   right to freedom of assembly and association.  Increasingly, the\n
    \  Internet mediates our lives, our relationships and our ability to\n   exercise
    our human rights.  The Internet provides a global public\n   space, but one that
    is built predominantly on private infrastructure.\n   Since Internet protocols
    play a central role in the management,\n   development and use of the Internet,
    the relation between protocols\n   and the aforementioned rights should be documented
    and any adverse\n   impacts of this relation should be mitigated.\n\n\t </p>\n
