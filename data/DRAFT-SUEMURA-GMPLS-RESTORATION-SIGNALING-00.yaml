abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes extensions to RSVP-TE for supporting multiple
    \nprotection/restoration types (LSP Protection Types) in end-to-end \nprotection/restoration.
    \ We propose the LSP Protection Type field to \nbe defined in the Protection Object.
    \ Another aim of this document is \nprevention of an unintended connection for
    extra traffic when traffic \nfrom a failed working LSP is switched over to a backup
    LSP.  We \naddress this issue and propose a 3-way switchover signaling procedure.
    \n\n\t </p>\n      "
