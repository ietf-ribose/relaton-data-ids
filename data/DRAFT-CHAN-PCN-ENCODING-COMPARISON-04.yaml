abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A number of mechanisms have been proposed to support differential\nQualiy
    of Service for packets in the Internet.  DiffServ is an\nexample of such a mechanism.
    \ However, the level of assurance that\ncan be provided with DiffServ without
    substantial over-provisioning\nis limited.  Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN)
    uses path congestion\ninformation across a PCN region to enable per-flow admission
    control\nto provide the required service guarantees for the admitted traffic.\nWhile
    admission control will protect the QoS under normal operating\nconditions, an
    additional flow termination mechanism is necessary to\ncope with extreme events
    (e.g. route changes due to link or node\nfailure).\n\nIn order to allow the PCN
    mechanisms to work it is necessary for IP\npackets to be able to carry the pre-congestion
    information to the PCN\negress nodes.  This document explores different ways in
    which this\ninformation can be encoded into IP packets.  This document does not\nchoose
    the encoding but provide guidance and recommendation based on\ndifferent criteria.
    \ This document also provides a historical trace\nof the consideration on different
    encoding alternatives for Pre-\nCongestion Notification.\n\t </p>\n      "
