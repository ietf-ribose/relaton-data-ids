abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to set up a Local Security Association
    (LSA) between a user and the visited network when the user is roaming. It defines
    all the required related functionalities such as the key generation, distribution
    and update procedures; it also describes the reasons and the benefits of the adoption
    of such LSA. The applicability of this draft is mainly for AAA Diameter and for
    URP (User Registration Protocol), but the mechanism can be adopted more in general
    in each case where the user (or mobile node) needs to establish a security association
    with a foreign domain while roaming.</p>"
