abstract:
- content: "<p>In a Low Power Lossy Network, the traditional tuple of source, destination
    and ports might not be the proper indication to isolate a meaningful flow. For
    instance, it can be a requirement for the aggregation of related measurements
    from multiple sources to be treated as a single flow following a same path in
    order to experience similar jitter and latency. In that case, the Flow Label in
    packets outgoing a RPL domain could and sometimes should be set by the root of
    the RPL structure. It derives that the Flow Label could be reused inside the RPL
    domain. This document present how the Flow Label can be used inside a LLN as a
    replacement to the RPL option and provides rules for the root to set and reset
    the Flow Label when forwarding between the inside of RPL domain and the larger
    Internet, in both direction.</p>"
