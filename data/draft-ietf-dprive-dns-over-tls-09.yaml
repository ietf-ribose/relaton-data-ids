abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) to
    provide privacy for DNS. Encryption provided by TLS eliminates opportunities for
    eavesdropping and on-path tampering with DNS queries in the network, such as discussed
    in RFC 7626. In addition, this document specifies two usage profiles for DNS over
    TLS and provides advice on performance considerations to minimize overhead from
    using TCP and TLS with DNS. This document focuses on securing stub-to-recursive
    traffic, as per the charter of the DPRIVE Working Group. It does not prevent future
    applications of the protocol to recursive-to-authoritative traffic.</p>"
