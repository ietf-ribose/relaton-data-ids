abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a TDM emulation protocol for consideration by the
    PWE3 Working Group. The protocol defines methods for transporting DS3, E3, DS1,
    E1, and NxDS0 circuits over packet switched networks. It is based on ATM Circuit
    Emulation, but optimized for variable length packet networks. The intent is to
    provide a relatively simple but flexible method for transporting TDM signals over
    packet switched networks that also provides a path for interworking with ATM Circuit
    Emulation.</p>"
