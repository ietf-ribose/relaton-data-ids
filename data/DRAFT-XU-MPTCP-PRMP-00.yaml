abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo presents an extension to the Multipath Transmission
    Control\n   Protocol (MPTCP) that allows MPTCP endpoints in which case both\n
    \  sender side and receiver side support this function to provide\n   partially
    reliable data transmission service to the upper layer\n   applications. In order
    to achieve the above goal, this memo extents\n   MPTCP by adding two new subtypes
    which are expressed as \"PR_CAPABLE\"\n   and \"ACK_NOTIFY\" and the corresponding
    processes are also introduced.\n   The extension can provide the backward-compatibility
    with MPTCP if\n   the new features are not available.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
