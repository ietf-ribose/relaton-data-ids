abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined how
    the\n   WebRTC framework can be used to provide access to IMS services.\n   Users
    can use \"web credentials\" (e.g. a username and password) to\n   obtain an authorization
    token (e.g. an OAuth 2.0 access token), which\n   is included in the user registration
    request sent towards the IMS\n   network.\n\n   3GPP has specified a requirement,
    that the eP-CSCF shall be able to\n   include a string value, representing the
    identity of the WAF, in the\n   REGISTER request forwarded towards the S-CSCF.
    \ The S-CSCF can use\n   the identity for e.g. policy decisions.\n\n   This document
    defines a new Authorization header field parameter,\n   'authorization-entity',
    which the eP-CSCF can include in a REGISTER\n   request in order to convey the
    identity of the WAF towards the\n   S-CSCF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
