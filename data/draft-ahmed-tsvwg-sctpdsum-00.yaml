abstract:
- content: "<p>When SCTP was initially accepted as RFC2960 the Adler-32 checksum was
    specified to be used. However, inlight of issues raised in [STONE] it has been
    proposed that a more robust algorithm such as [CRC-32] be used instead. This poses
    compatibility problems for existing implementations of SCTP that are already using
    the Adler-32 algorithm for computing checksums. This document proposes a dynamic
    method to preserve backward compatibility between the two checksum algorithms.</p>"
