abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Encryption and other security mechanisms are on the rise on
    all\n   layers of the stack, protecting user data and making network\n   operations
    more secured.  Further, encryption is also a tool to\n   address ossification
    that has been observed over time.  Separation of\n   functions into layers and
    enforcement of layer boundaries based on\n   encryption supports selected exposure
    to those entities that are\n   addressed by a function on a certain layer.  A
    clear separation\n   supports innovation and also enables new opportunities for\n
    \  collaborative functions.  RFC 8558 describes path signals as messages\n   to
    or from on-path elements.  This document states principles for\n   designing mechanisms
    that use or provide path signals and calls for\n   actions on specific valuable
    cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
