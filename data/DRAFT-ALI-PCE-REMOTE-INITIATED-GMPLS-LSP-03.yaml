abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     Draft [I-D. draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] specifies\n
    \    procedures that can be used for creation and deletion of PCE-\n     initiated
    LSPs in the active stateful PCE model. However, this\n     specification focuses
    on MPLS networks, and does not cover remote\n     instantiation of paths in GMPLS-controlled
    networks. This document\n     complements [I-D. draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]
    by addressing\n     the requirements for remote-initiated GMPLS LSPs.\n\n\n     \n\t
