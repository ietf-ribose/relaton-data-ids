abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Well-known issues with multicast have prevented the deployment
    of\n   multicast in 802.11 (wifi) and other local-area wireless\n   environments.
    \ This document describes the problems of known\n   limitations with wireless
    (primarily 802.11) Layer-2 multicast.  Also\n   described are certain multicast
    enhancement features that have been\n   specified by the IETF, and by IEEE 802,
    for wireless media, as well\n   as some operational choices that can be taken
    to improve the\n   performance of the network.  Finally, some recommendations
    are\n   provided about the usage and combination of these features and\n   operational
    choices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
