abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many of the routing protocols today can support multiple topologies\n
    \  or multiple instances [ISISMT] [OSPFV3] [OSPFMT]. In such an\n   environment,
    prefix, address family, and topology/instance together\n   define an FEC. But
    the current LDP specificaiton is not sufficient to\n   allow multi-topology/multi-instance
    to share the same LDP session.\n\n   In this document we introduce a concept of
    'Label Binding Instance'\n   to LDP so that FECs can be unambiguiously identified
    in a multi-\n   topology/multi-instance routing environment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
