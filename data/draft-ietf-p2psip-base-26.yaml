abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD),
    a peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet. A P2P signaling
    protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage and messaging service between
    a set of cooperating peers that form the overlay network. RELOAD is designed to
    support a P2P Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized
    by other applications with similar requirements by defining new usages that specify
    the Kinds of data that need to be stored for a particular application. RELOAD
    defines a security model based on a certificate enrollment service that provides
    unique identities. NAT traversal is a fundamental service of the protocol. RELOAD
    also allows access from "client" nodes that do not need to route traffic or store
    data for others.</p>
