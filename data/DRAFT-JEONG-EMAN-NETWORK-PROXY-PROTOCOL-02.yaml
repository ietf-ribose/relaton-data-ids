abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the current Internet, it is implicitly assumed that a network
    node\n   is always active so that it can receive the incoming packets at any\n
    \  time.  Current networking services and applications are commonly\n   designed
    to be fully available at all times with minimal response\n   times.  This assumption
    keeps network nodes from entering sleeping\n   mode in order to reduce energy
    consumption.  Further, during sleeping\n   mode, network nodes may not immediately
    respond to the incoming\n   packets or even lose them.  If network nodes are allowed
    to go into a\n   sleeping mode, they can effectively reduce energy consumption
    during\n   idle period.  Network proxy allows to delegate network node's traffic\n
    \  processing to an external system within a network, so that the nodes\n   maintain
    network presence during their sleep.  This document\n   describes communication
    mechanism between network nodes and proxy in\n   order to accelerate the wider
    deployment of network proxy mechanism.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
