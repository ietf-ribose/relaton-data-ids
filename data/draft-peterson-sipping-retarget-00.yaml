abstract:
- content: "<p>Retargeting, the alteration by intermediaries of the destination of
    a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) request, is a common practice performed during
    the routing of a call. Some forms of retargeting, however, give rise to security
    problems and potential functional gaps in SIP. This document provides a general
    framework for discussion of the security problems relating to retargeting, and
    gives requirements for mechanisms that might overcome these problems.</p>"
