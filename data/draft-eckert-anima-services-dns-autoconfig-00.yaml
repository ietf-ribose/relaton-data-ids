abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines standards that enable autoconfiguration of fundamental
    centralized or decentralized network infrastructure services on ACP network nodes
    via GRASP. These are primarily the services required for initial bootstrapping
    of a network but will persist through the lifecycles of the network. These services
    include secure remote access to zero-touch bootstrapped ANI devices via SSH/Netconf
    with Radius/Diameter authentication and authorization and provides lifecycle autoconfiguration
    for other crucial services such as syslog, NTP (clock synchronization) and DNS
    for operational purposes.</p>"
