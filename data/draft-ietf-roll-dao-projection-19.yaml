abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends RFC 6550 and RFC 6553 to enable a RPL Root to
    install and maintain Projected Routes within its DODAG, along a selected set of
    nodes that may or may not include self, for a chosen duration. This potentially
    enables routes that are more optimized or resilient than those obtained with the
    classical distributed operation of RPL, either in terms of the size of a Routing
    Header or in terms of path length, which impacts both the latency and the packet
    delivery ratio.</p>"
