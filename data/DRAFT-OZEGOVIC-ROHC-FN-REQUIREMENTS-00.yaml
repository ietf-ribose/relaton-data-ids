abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes requirements expected to be achieved with
    \nprofile formal notation system for ROHC.\nThe RObust Header Compression (ROHC)
    [1] scheme is designed to \ncompress packet headers over error prone channels.
    It is built \naround an extensible core framework that can be tailored to \ncompress
    new protocol stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles.\nThe role of formal notation
    is to provide a simple method for ROHC\nprofile specification. It is to be used
    in the phase of profile\nrefinement to achieve maximal compression ratio possible,
    as well \nas in the phase of software implementation to provide unambiguous\nprofile
    specification. \n\t </p>\n      "
