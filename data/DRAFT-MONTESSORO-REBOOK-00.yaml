abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes REBOOK, a resource reservation algorithm
    for\n   deterministic and fast dynamic resource allocation and release.\n   Based
    on a stateful approach, it handles faults and network errors,\n   and recovers
    from route changes and unexpected flows shutdown.  The\n   distributed scheme
    used to store flows information have guaranteed\n   constant complexity.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
