abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie headers. Theseheaders
    can be used by HTTP servers to store state on HTTP useragents, letting the servers
    maintain a stateful session over themostly stateless HTTP protocol. The cookie
    protocol has manyhistorical infelicities and should be avoided for new applications
    ofHTTP.NOTE: If you have suggestions for improving the draft, please sendemail
    to http-state@ietf.org. Suggestions with test cases areespecially appreciated.</p>"
