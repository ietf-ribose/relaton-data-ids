abstract:
- content: "<p>Flow selection is the process of selecting a subset of flows from all
    observed flows. The Flow Selection Process may be located at an observation point,
    or on an IPFIX Mediator. Flow selection reduces the effort of post-processing
    flow data and transferring Flow Records. This document describes motivations for
    flow selection and presents flow selection techniques. It provides an information
    model for configuring flow selection techniques and discusses what information
    about a flow selection process should be exported.</p>"
