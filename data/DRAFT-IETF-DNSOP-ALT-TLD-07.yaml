abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document reserves a string (ALT) to be used as a TLD label
    in\n   non-DNS contexts, or for names that have no meaning in a global\n   context.
    \ It also provides advice and guidance to developers\n   developing alternate
    namespaces.\n\n   [Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background\n
    \  information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings,\n   etc.
    \ They will be removed before publication.This document is being\n   collaborated
    on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-\n   wkumari-dnsop-alt-tld.
    \ The most recent version of the document, open\n   issues, etc should all be
    available here.  The authors (gratefully)\n   accept pull requests.  NOTE: This
    document is currently a parked WG\n   document -- as such, all changes are being
    handled in GitHub and a\n   new version will be posted once unparked.\n\n   It
    had been suggested (off-list) that the draft should contain &lt;TBD&gt;\n   instead
    of .ALT, and then make the WG choose a string before\n   publication.  A version
    of the draft like this was published on\n   GitHub (https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-alt-tld/\n
    \  tree/7988fcf06100f7a17f21e6993b781690b5774472) (and generated no\n   feedback).
    \ This version reverts to .ALT -- the chairs stated that\n   the document was
    adopted with the string .alt, it has been discussed\n   as .alt.  IMO, it is more
    readable as .alt; it would also be a\n   difficult consensus call, boiling down
    to beauty contests.  If the WG\n   selects a different string (\"not-dns\" had
    been suggested in the\n   past), the editors will, of course, replace it. ]\n\n\t
