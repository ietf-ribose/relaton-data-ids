abstract:
- content: <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Extensions for the Web Distributed
    Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) do not define the behavior for the "POST" method
    when applied to collections, as the base specification (HTTP) leaves implementers
    lots of freedom for the semantics of "POST". This has led to a situation where
    many WebDAV servers do not implement POST for collections at all, although it
    is well suited to be used for the purpose of adding new members to a collection,
    where the server remains in control of the newly assigned URL. In fact, the Atom
    Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) uses POST exactly for that purpose. On the other
    hand, WebDAV-based protocols, such as the Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV),
    frequently require clients to pick a unique URL, although the server could easily
    perform that task. This specification defines a discovery mechanism through which
    servers can advertise support for POST requests with the aforementioned "add collection
    member" semantics. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
