abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an extension to LoST (RFC5222) that allows
    a\nrequest to specify that a PIDF be returned in the response if the\nlocation
    was valid, but there were some missing elements.  For\nexample, an civic location
    that did not include a postal code, but\nwas otherwise a complete, and unambiguous
    location, would receive a\ncomplete PIDF in the response that included the postal
    code.\n\t </p>\n      "
