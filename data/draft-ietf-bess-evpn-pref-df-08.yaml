abstract:
- content: "<p>The Designated Forwarder (DF) in Ethernet Virtual Private Networks
    (EVPN) is defined as the PE responsible for sending Broadcast, Unknown unicast
    and Broadcast traffic (BUM) to a multi-homed device/ network in the case of an
    all-active multi-homing Ethernet Segment (ES), or BUM and unicast in the case
    of single-active multi-homing. The DF is selected out of a candidate list of PEs
    that advertise the same Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) to the EVPN network,
    according to the Default DF Election algorithm. While the Default Algorithm provides
    an efficient and automated way of selecting the DF across different Ethernet Tags
    in the ES, there are some use cases where a more 'deterministic' and user-controlled
    method is required. At the same time, Service Providers require an easy way to
    force an on- demand DF switchover in order to carry out some maintenance tasks
    on the existing DF or control whether a new active PE can preempt the existing
    DF PE. This document proposes a DF Election algorithm that meets the requirements
    of determinism and operation control.</p>"
