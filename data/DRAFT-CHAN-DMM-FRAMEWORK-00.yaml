abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a framework for mobility management\n
    \  protocols in terms of their key abstracted logical functions.  The\n   framework
    is capable of presenting a unified view, reducing the\n   clutter that obscures
    a casual reader from understanding the\n   commonalities between different approaches
    in mobility management.  A\n   first order application of this framework allows
    us to examine\n   previously standardized mobility management protocols, such
    as MIPv6\n   and PMIPv6 (as well as several of their extensions), and describe\n
    \  their core functionality in terms of different configurations of the\n   logical
    functions defined by the framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
