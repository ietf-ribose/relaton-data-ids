abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the framework to support a new protocol
    for\nexplicit congestion notification (ECN), termed re-ECN, which can be\ndeployed
    incrementally around unmodified routers.  Re-ECN allows\naccurate congestion monitoring
    throughout the network thus enabling\nthe upstream party at any trust boundary
    in the internetwork to be\nheld responsible for the congestion they cause, or
    allow to be\ncaused.  So, networks can introduce straightforward accountability\nfor
    congestion and policing mechanisms for incoming traffic from end-\ncustomers or
    from neighbouring network domains.  As well as giving\nthe motivation for re-ECN
    this document also gives examples of\nmechanisms that can use the protocol to
    ensure data sources respond\ncorrectly to congestion.  And it describes example
    mechanisms that\nensure the dominant selfish strategy of both network domains
    and end-\npoints will be to use the protocol honestly.\n\t </p>\n      "
