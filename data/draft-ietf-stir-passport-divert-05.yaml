abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends PASSporT, which conveys cryptographically- signed
    information about the people involved in personal communications, to include an
    indication that a call has been diverted from its original destination to a new
    one. This information can greatly improve the decisions made by verification services
    in call forwarding scenarios. Also specified here is an encapsulation mechanism
    for nesting a PASSporT within another PASSporT that assists relying parties in
    some diversion scenarios.</p>"
