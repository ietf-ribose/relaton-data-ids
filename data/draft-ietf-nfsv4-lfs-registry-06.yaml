abstract:
  content: "<p>In the past, Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have used very
    rigid policies that were implemented in particular protocols and platforms. As
    MAC systems become more widely deployed, additional flexibility in mechanism and
    policy will be required. While traditional trusted systems implemented Multi-Level
    Security (MLS) and integrity models, modern systems have expanded to include such
    technologies as type enforcement. Due to the wide range of policies and mechanisms
    that need to be accommodated, it is unlikely that the use of a single security
    label format and model will be viable. To allow multiple MAC mechanisms and label
    formats to co-exist in a network, this document creates a registry of label format
    specifications. This registry contains label format identifiers and provides for
    the association of each such identifier with a corresponding extensive document
    outlining the exact syntax and use of the particular label format.</p>"
