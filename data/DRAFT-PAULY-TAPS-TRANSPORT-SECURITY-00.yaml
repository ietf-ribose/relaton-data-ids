abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a survey of commonly used or notable
    network\n   security protocols, with a focus on how they interact and integrate\n
    \  with applications and transport protocols.  Its goal is to supplement\n   efforts
    to define and catalog transport services [RFC8095] by\n   describing the interfaces
    required to add security protocols.  It\n   examines Transport Layer Security
    (TLS), Datagram Transport Layer\n   Security (DTLS), Quick UDP Internet Connections
    with TLS (QUIC +\n   TLS), MinimalT, CurveCP, tcpcrypt, and Internet Key Exchange
    with\n   Encapsulating Security Protocol (IKEv2 + ESP).  This survey is not\n
    \  limited to protocols developed within the scope or context of the\n   IETF.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
