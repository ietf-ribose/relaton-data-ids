abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses issues that arise when TCP is used to support
    traffic that exhibits periods where the transmission rate is limited by the application
    rather than the congestion window. It updates TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart
    quickly following either an idle or application-limited interval. The method is
    expected to benefit application-limited TCP applications, while also providing
    an appropriate response if congestion is experienced. It also evaluates TCP Congestion
    Window Validation, CWV, an IETF experimental specification defined in RFC 2861,
    and concludes that CWV sought to address important issues, but failed to deliver
    a widely used solution. This document therefore proposes an update to the status
    of RFC 2861 by recommending it is moved from Experimental to Historic status,
    and that it is replaced by the current specification.</p>"
