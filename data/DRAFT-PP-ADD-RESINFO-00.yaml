abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes methods for DNS resolvers to self-publish\n
    \  information about themselves.  The information is returned as a JSON\n   object.
    \ The names in this object are defined in an IANA registry\n   that allows for
    light-weight registration.  Applications and\n   operating systems can use the
    methods defined here to get the\n   information from resolvers in order to make
    choices about how to send\n   future queries to those resolvers.\n\n\t </p>\n
