abstract:
- content: "<p>Implementing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) advanced features and
    services requires to use numerous specifications. Today, for each service in the
    scope of BLISS, one can already find references to many possible specifications
    which do not cover the same things. Some of them are primitive operations, requirements
    or call flow examples, some have a scope larger than the others, or can not be
    compared at the same level. Very often, architecture hypothesis are hidden behind
    the same service name, either assuming that an intermediary; like an application
    server, has an active role in the service, or, as opposed, assuming a pure end-to-end
    model where only endpoint implementations are involved. The goal of this document
    is not to present the best solutions or give recommendations; but to give an overview
    of every standard specification related to these services, centralizing and categorizing
    them as input to the working group.</p>"
