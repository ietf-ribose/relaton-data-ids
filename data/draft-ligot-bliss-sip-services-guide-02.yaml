abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Implementing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) advanced features
    andservices requires to use numerous specifications. Today, for eachservice in
    the scope of BLISS, one can already find references tomany possible specifications
    which do not cover the same things.Some of them are primitive operations, requirements
    or call flowexamples, some have a scope larger than the others, or can not becompared
    at the same level. Very often, architecture hypothesis arehidden behind the same
    service name, either assuming that anintermediary; like an application server,
    has an active role in theservice, or, as opposed, assuming a pure end-to-end model
    where onlyendpoint implementations are involved. The goal of this document isnot
    to present the best solutions or give recommendations; but togive an overview
    of every standard specification related to theseservices, centralizing and categorizing
    them as input to the workinggroup.</p>"
