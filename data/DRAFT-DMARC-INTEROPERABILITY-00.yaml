abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DMARC introduces a mechanism for expressing domain-level policies
    and\n   preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting.  The\n
    \  DMARC mechanism can encounter interoperability issues when messages\n   originate
    from third party sources, are modified in transit, or are\n   forwarded enroute
    to their final destination.  Collectively these\n   email flows are referred to
    as indirect email flows.  This document\n   describes interoperability issues
    between DMARC and indirect email\n   flows.  Possible methods for addressing interoperability
    issues are\n   presented.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
