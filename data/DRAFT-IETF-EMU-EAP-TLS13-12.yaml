abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the use of EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 while\n
    \  remaining backwards compatible with existing implementations of EAP-\n   TLS.
    \ TLS 1.3 provides significantly improved security, privacy, and\n   reduced latency
    when compared to earlier versions of TLS.  EAP-TLS\n   with TLS 1.3 further improves
    security and privacy by mandating use\n   of privacy and revocation checking.
    \ This document also provides\n   guidance on authorization and resumption for
    EAP-TLS in general\n   (regardless of the underlying TLS version used).  This
    document\n   updates RFC 5216.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
