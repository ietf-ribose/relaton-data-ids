abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the existing inadequacies in the handling of
    security issues within the NFSv4 protocols and the steps that need to be taken
    to correct the situation, including the preparation of new standards-track documents
    updating existing treatments of NFSv4 security. Because the security approach
    has been and should remain the same for all minor versions, it is expected that
    the basics of security for all the NFSv4 protocols will be addressed together
    in a single NFSv4-wide standards-track document.</p>"
