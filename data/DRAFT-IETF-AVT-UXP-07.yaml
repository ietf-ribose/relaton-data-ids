abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an efficient way to ensure erasure-\nresilient
    transmission of progressively encoded multimedia \nsources via RTP using Reed-Solomon
    (RS) codes together with \ninterleaving. The level of erasure protection can be
    explicitly \nadapted to the importance of the respective parts in the source \nstream,
    thus allowing a graceful degradation of application \nquality with increasing
    packet loss rate on the network. Hence, \nthis type of unequal erasure protection
    (UXP) schemes is intended \nto cope with the rapidly varying channel conditions
    on wireless \naccess links to the Internet backbone. Furthermore, protection of
    \nnon-progressive multimedia streams is ensured, since equal \nerasure protection
    (EXP) represents a subset of generic UXP. By \napplying interleaving and RS codes
    a  payload format is defined, \nwhich can be easily integrated into the existing
    framework for \nRTP.\n\t </p>\n      "
