abstract:
  content: "<p>In networks supporting IPv6 the Internet Control Message Protocolversion
    6 (ICMPv6) plays a fundamental role with a large number offunctions, and a correspondingly
    large number of message types andoptions. A number of security risks are associated
    with uncontrolledforwarding of ICMPv6 messages. On the other hand, compared with
    IPv4and the corresponding protocol ICMP, ICMPv6 is essential to thefunctioning
    of IPv6 rather than a useful auxiliary.This document provides some recommendations
    for ICMPv6 firewallfilter configuration that will allow propagation of ICMPv6
    messagesthat are needed to maintain the functioning of the network but dropmessages
    which are potential security risks.</p>"
