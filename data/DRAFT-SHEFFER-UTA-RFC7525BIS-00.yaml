abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer
    Security\n   (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application\n
    \  protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP.  Over the\n   last
    few years, several serious attacks on TLS have emerged,\n   including attacks
    on its most commonly used cipher suites and their\n   modes of operation.  This
    document provides recommendations for\n   improving the security of deployed services
    that use TLS and DTLS.\n   The recommendations are applicable to the majority
    of use cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
