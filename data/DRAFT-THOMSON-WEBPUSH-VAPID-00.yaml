abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An application server can voluntarily identify itself to a
    push\n   service using the described technique.  This identification\n   information
    can be used by the push service to attribute requests\n   that are made by the
    same application server to a single entity.  An\n   application server is further
    able include additional information the\n   operator of a push service can use
    to contact the operator of the\n   application server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
