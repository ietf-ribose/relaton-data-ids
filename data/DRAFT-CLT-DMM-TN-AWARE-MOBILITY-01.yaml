abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a framework and a mapping function
    for 5G\n   mobile user plane with transport network slicing, integrated with\n
    \  Mobile Radio Access and a Virtualized Core Network.  The integrated\n   approach
    specified in a way to address all the mobility scenarios\n   defined in [TS23.501]
    and to be backward compatible with LTE\n   [TS.23.401-3GPP] network deployments.\n\n
    \  It focuses on an optimized mobile user plane functionality with\n   various
    transport services needed for some of the 5G traffic needing\n   low and deterministic
    latency, real-time, mission-critical services.\n   This document describes, how
    this objective is achieved agnostic to\n   the transport underlay used (IPv4,
    IPv6, MPLS) in various deployments\n   and with a new transport network underlay
    routing, called Preferred\n   Path Routing (PPR).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
