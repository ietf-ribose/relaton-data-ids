abstract:
  content: "<p>Mobility management and QoS provision have been research topics inthe
    past years. Mobile IP is the dominant protocol for mobilitymanagement, whereas
    RSVP is a well established protocol for QoSprovision. These protocols when deployed
    separately can work quiteefficiently. However, their interworking has been widely
    recognizedto be problematic. We propose a new approach that limits mobilityand
    QoS related network modifications inside the domain in which auser moves.</p>"
