abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this Internet Draft is to start discussion on the issues
    involved in interconnecting Internet and Public Switched Networks so as to provide
    more effective media than either network type can do presently. Interworking of
    the Internet and PSTNs, based on open well-defined interfaces, will promote interoperability
    of both the networks and systems built by different vendors.</p>"
