abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Misconfiguration and malicious manipulation of BGP AS_Path
    may lead\n   to route hijack.  This document proposes to enhance the BGP [RFC4271]\n
    \  Inbound/ Outbound route processing in the case of detecting an AS\n   loop.
    \ It is an enhancement to the current BGP's Inbound/Outbound\n   processing and
    can be implemented directly on the device, and this\n   document also proposes
    a centralized usecase.  This could empower\n   networks to quickly and accurately
    figure out they're being\n   victimized.\n\n   Two options are proposed for the
    enhancement, a) a local check at the\n   device; b) data collection/analysis at
    the remote network controller/\n   server.  Both approaches are beneficial for
    route hijack detection.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
