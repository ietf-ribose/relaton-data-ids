abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The SigComp static dictionary for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)signalling
    was done by first version RFC3485. SIP protocol relatedextensions were completed
    and published in a series IETF documents.Those SIP protocol extensions had been
    used in 3GPP IMS and IMS basedapplications. The new extensions to SIP protocol
    weaken theintention of static dictionary for SIP signalling compressing whichis
    to reduce overload risks in radio access network and core networkinvolving wireless
    network.</p>"
