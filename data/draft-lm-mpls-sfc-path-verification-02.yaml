abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to MPLS LSP ping mechanisms to support
    verification between the control/management plane and the data plane state for
    SR-MPLS service programming and MPLS-based NSH SFC. This document defines the
    signaling of the Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) over a Service Function Path
    (SFP) with an MPLS forwarding plane using the basic unit defined in RFC 8595.
    The document updates RFC 8595 in respect to SFF's handiling TTL expiration. The
    document also describes the processing of the G-ACh by the elements of the SFP.</p>"
