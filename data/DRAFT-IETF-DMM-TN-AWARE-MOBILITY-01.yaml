abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a framework and mapping of slices in
    5G\n   mobile systems to transport network slices in IP, Layer 2 or Layer 1\n
    \  transport networks.  Slices in 5G systems are characterized by\n   latency
    bounds, reservation guarantees, jitter, data rates,\n   availability, mobility
    speed, usage density, criticality and\n   priority.  These characteristics mapped
    to transport network slice\n   include bandwidth, latency and criteria such as
    isolation,\n   directionality and disjoint routes.  Mobile slice criteria are
    mapped\n   to the appropriate transport slice and capabilities offered in\n   backhaul,
    midhaul and fronthaul connectivity segments between radio\n   side network functions
    and user plane function(gateway).\n\n   This document describes how mobile network
    functions map its slice\n   criteria to identifiers in IP and Layer 2 packets
    that transport\n   network segments use to grant transport layer services during
    UE\n   mobility scenarios.  Applicability of this framework and underlying\n   transport
    networks, which can enable different slice properties are\n   also discussed.
    \ This is based on mapping between mobile and\n   transport underlays (L2, Segment
    Routing, IPv6, MPLS and IPv4).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
