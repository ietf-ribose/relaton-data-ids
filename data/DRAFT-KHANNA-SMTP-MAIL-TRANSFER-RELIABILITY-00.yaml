abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft discusses the issue which makes the data tranfer in
    SMTP \nprotocol highly vulnerable to a 'resend' in case of a network \ndisruption.
    We then discuss a means by which such a 'resend' can be \navoided, by tranferring
    mail data only from the point of disruption.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
