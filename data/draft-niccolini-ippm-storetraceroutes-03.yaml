abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo describes a standard way to store traceroute measurementsand
    related metrics. To better address the traceroute measurementsstoring issue, the
    authors first of all give a definition of thetraceroute tool, describe the tool
    itself as well as its parametersand the default values on the most common operating
    systems and theoutput results that can be stored. Afterwards, the commoninformation
    model with the base elements of the traceroutemeasurement storing is defined dividing
    the information elements intwo semantically separated groups (configuration elements
    and resultsones). Moreover an additional element is defined to relateconfiguration
    elements and results ones by means of a common uniqueidentifier. On the basis
    of the information model a data model isthen proposed in order to actually store
    the traceroute measurements.Finally considerations on how to extract relevant
    metrics related totraceroute measurements are given.</p>"
