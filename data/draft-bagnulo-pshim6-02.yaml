abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses extensions to the shim6 architecture to support
    shim6 proxies that would allow the provision of the following capabilities: o
    Provide Upper Layer Identifier portability. o Provide Traffic Engineering policy
    enforcement. o Off-load of the shim6 context management from the actual peers
    of the communication. o Enable legacy IPv6 nodes located in the multihomed site
    to obtain full multihoming support (no modification of the end nodes).</p>"
