abstract:
- content: "<p>Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) defines a set of
    protocols for the creation of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in various switching
    technologies. The GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) was developed in RFC4208
    in order to be applied to an overlay network architectural model. This document
    examines a number of GMPLS UNI application scenarios. It shows how techniques
    developed after the GMPLS UNI can be applied to automate or enable critical processes
    for these applications. This document also suggests simple extensions that could
    be made to existing technologies to further enable the UNI and points out some
    unresolved issues.</p>"
