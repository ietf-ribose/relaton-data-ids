abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the use of One Way Latency (OWL) for\n
    \  enhancing multipath TCP (MPTCP). Several usages of OWL, such as\n   retransmission
    policy and crucial data scheduling are analyzed. Two\n   kinds of OWL measurement
    approaches are also provided and compared.\n   More explorations related with
    OWL will be contribute to the\n   performance of MPTCP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
