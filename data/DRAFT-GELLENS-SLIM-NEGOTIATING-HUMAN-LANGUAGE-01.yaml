abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities,
    and\n   preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.  When\n   establishing
    interactive communication (\"calls\") there needs to be a\n   way to negotiate
    (communicate and match) the caller's language and\n   media needs with the capabilities
    of the called party.  This is\n   especially important with emergency calls, where
    a call can be routed\n   to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) or call taker
    capable of\n   communicating with the user, or a translator or relay operator
    can be\n   bridged into the call during setup, but this applies to non-emergency\n
    \  calls as well (as an example, when calling a company call center).\n\n   This
    document describes the need and expected use, and describes a\n   solution using
    new SDP stream attributes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
