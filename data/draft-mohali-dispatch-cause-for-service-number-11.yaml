abstract:
- content: <p>RFC4458 defines a "cause" URI parameter, which may appear in the Request-URI
    of a SIP request, that is used to indicate a reason why the request arrived to
    the User Agent Server (UAS) receiving the message. This document creates a new
    predefined value for the "cause" URI parameter to cover service number translation
    for cases of retargeting due to specific service action leading to the translation
    of a called service access number. This document also provides a guidance for
    using the "cause" URI parameter within the History-Info header field because it
    was missing in RFC4458 whereas the combination of both is mandatory in some IP
    networks implementations. This document updates RFC4458.</p>
