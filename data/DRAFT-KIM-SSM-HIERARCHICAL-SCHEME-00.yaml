abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) has been proposed to overcome
    the\ndeployment limitations of PIM-SM such as handling of well-known\nsources,
    access control, and address allocation. However, current\nSSM work seems to neglect
    some other deployment issues such as the\nconstruction of the shortest path tree
    especially in inter-domain. \nThe routing table entries for constructing SSM tree
    proportionally\nincrease depending on the number of sources and groups.\n\t </p>\n
