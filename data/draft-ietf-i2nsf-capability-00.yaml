abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the concept of an NSF (Network Security Function)
    Capability, as well as its information model. Capabilities are a set of features
    that are available from a managed entity, and are represented as data that unambiguously
    characterizes an NSF. Capabilities enable management entities to determine the
    set offer features from available NSFs that will be used, and simplify the management
    of NSFs.</p>"
