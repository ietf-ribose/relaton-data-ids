abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type and data model
    can be\n   used to send collections of resources, such as batches of sensor data\n
    \  or configuration parameters.  The CoAP iPATCH, PATCH, and FETCH\n   methods
    enable accessing and updating parts of a resource or multiple\n   resources with
    one request.  This document defines new media types\n   for the CoAP iPATCH, and
    FETCH methods for resources represented with\n   the SenML data model.\n\n\t </p>\n
