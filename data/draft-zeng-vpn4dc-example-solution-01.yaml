abstract:
- content: "<p>More and more service providers proposed VPN4DC requirements. That
    is how to maintain and manage the host-to-host connectivity through Layer 3 Virtual
    Private Networks (L3VPNs) between an enterprise legacy VPN site and the virtual
    datacenter (VDC) in datacenter, including automated provisioning, monitoring,
    and so on[VPN4DC]. This document provides an example solution by prototyping experiment
    for VPN4DC auto-provision. This solution is focus on the network side and the
    DC Edge, the DC inside is out of scope.</p>"
