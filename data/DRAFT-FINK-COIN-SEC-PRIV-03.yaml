abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the growing interconnection of devices, cyber security
    and data\n   protection are of increasing importance.  This is especially the
    case\n   regarding cyber-physical systems due to their close entanglement with\n
    \  the physical world.  Misbehavior and information leakage can lead to\n   financial
    and physical damage and endanger human lives and well-\n   being.  Thus, hard
    security and privacy requirements are necessary to\n   be met.  Furthermore, a
    thorough investigation of incidents is\n   essential for ultimate protection.
    \ Computing in the Network (COIN)\n   allows the processing of traffic and data
    directly in the network and\n   at line-rate.  Thus, COIN presents a promising
    solution for\n   efficiently providing security and privacy mechanisms as well
    as\n   network monitoring.  This document discusses select mechanisms to\n   demonstrate
    how COIN concepts can be applied to counter existing\n   shortcomings of cyber
    security and data privacy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
