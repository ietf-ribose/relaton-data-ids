abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a new ISAKMP method that allows\nconfiguration
    items to be exchanged securely by using both\npush/acknowledge or request/reply
    paradigms.\nThe authors currently intend this document to be published as an\nInformational
    RFC, not a standards-track document, so that the many\nIPsec implementations that
    have implemented to earlier drafts of\nthis protocol can have a single stable
    reference.\nComments regarding this draft should be sent to ietf-mode-\ncfg@vpnc.org
    or to the authors.\n\t </p>\n      "
