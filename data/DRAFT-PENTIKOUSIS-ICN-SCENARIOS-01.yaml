abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents scenarios for information-centric networking\n
    \  (ICN) which can be used to establish a common understanding about\n   potential
    experimental setups where different approaches can be\n   tested and compared
    against each other.  All scenarios included in\n   this document are based on
    published literature.  That is, they have\n   all been considered in one or more
    performance evaluation studies,\n   which are already available to the community.
    \ The scenarios selected\n   aim to exercise a variety of aspects that an ICN
    solution can\n   address.  They include a) general aspects, such as, network\n
    \  efficiency, mobility support, multicast and caching performance,\n   real-time
    communication efficacy, disruption and delay tolerance; and\n   b) ICN-specific
    aspects, such as, information security and trust,\n   persistence, availability,
    provenance, and location independence.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
