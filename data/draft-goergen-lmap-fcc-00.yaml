abstract:
- content: "<p>Analyzing and aggregating large-scale broadband measurements is essential
    to study trends and derive network analytics. These trends and analyses could
    be made available through well defined protocols such as the Application Layer
    Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol. However, ALTO requires network information
    to be distilled and abstracted in form of a network map and a cost map. We describe
    our methodology for analyzing the United States Federal Communication Commission's
    (FCC) Measuring Broadband America (MBA) dataset to derive required topology and
    cost maps suitable for consumption by an ALTO server.</p>"
