abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a framework to integrate a Network
    Address\n   Translation layer into an operator's network to function as a Carrier\n
    \  Grade NAT (also known as CGN or Large Scale NAT).  The CGN\n   infrastructure
    will often form a NAT444 environment as the subscriber\n   home network will likely
    also contain a NAT function.  Exhaustion of\n   the IPv4 address pool is a major
    driver compelling some operators to\n   implement CGN.  Although operators may
    wish to deploy IPv6 to\n   strategically overcome IPv4 exhaustion, near term needs
    may not be\n   satisfied with an IPv6 deployment alone.  This document provides
    a\n   practical integration model which allows the CGN platform to be\n   integrated
    into the network meeting the connectivity needs of the\n   subscriber while being
    mindful of not disrupting existing services\n   and meeting the technical challenges
    that CGN brings.  The model\n   included in this document utilizes BGP/MPLS IP
    VPNs which allow for\n   virtual routing separation helping ease the CGNs impact
    on the\n   network.  This document does not intend to defend the merits of CGN.\n\n\t
