abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely used security protocol that
    offers communication security services at the transport layer. The initial design
    of TLS was focused on the protection of applications running on top of the Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP), and was a good match for securing the Hypertext Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP). Subsequent standardization efforts lead to the publication of
    Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), which added the User Datagram Protocol
    (UDP), and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP). The Stream Control
    Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as a more recent connection-oriented transport protocol,
    also benefits from TLS support. TLS can be customized in a variety of ways and
    every feature has a certain cost. To offer input for implementers and system architects
    this document illustrates the implications of selected TLS features for the code
    size.</p>"
