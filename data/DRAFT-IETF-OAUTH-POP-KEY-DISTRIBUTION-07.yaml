abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 6750 specified the bearer token concept for securing access
    to\n   protected resources.  Bearer tokens need to be protected in transit\n   as
    well as at rest.  When a client requests access to a protected\n   resource it
    hands-over the bearer token to the resource server.\n\n   The OAuth 2.0 Proof-of-Possession
    security concept extends bearer\n   token security and requires the client to
    demonstrate possession of a\n   key when accessing a protected resource.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
