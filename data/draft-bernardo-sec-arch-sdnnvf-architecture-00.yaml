abstract:
  content: "<p>Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization
    (NFV)have been creating paradigm shifts across major service providers, governments,and
    industries. In recent years, these two novel frameworks created jitters and excitements
    acrossmajor academic institutions and communities of practice. While these are
    considered disruptiveto major network infrastructures operating on status quo,
    SDN and NFV nonetheless bringnetwork resiliency, scalability, manageability, and,
    most importantly, lower long-term operationalexpenditures when implemented properly.They
    create opportunities for innovation that engage key players from networks,security,
    and software to develop new controllers, APIs, networks, and technologies. However,new
    innovations come with associated risks and security issues.This document aims
    to propose a formal security architecture that overarchesimportant aspects of
    SDN and NFV 's frameworks. This architecture, which is considered first to be
    proposedthru this draft, can be elaborated and modified as the frameworks mature
    overtime.</p>"
