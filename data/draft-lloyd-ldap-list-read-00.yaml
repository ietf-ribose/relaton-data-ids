abstract:
  content: "<p>LDAP was originally developed as a lightweight protocol but through
    itsdevelopment it has added many features to a point where there is verylittle
    difference in terms of simplicity or code size to that of DAP.However, DAP included
    features which provided efficient navigationthrough a multi server distributed
    directory systems (List), efficientretreival (Read)and the ability to provide
    service controls to selectoperation requestpriority, permit/deny chained operations
    and theability to select master/replica data in the operation response. LDAP is
    now widely used as the access for X.500 distributed directorysystems, however
    LDAP in its original form omitted the items (List, Readand Service Controls) as
    defined above.The List/Read requirements were serviced by LDAP through the use
    of'pre-selected' Search operations. The Service Controls as per X.511for distributed
    operation control have in most part been omitted fromLDAP. (These are the subject
    of another proposal.) Experience in the field is showing that not having a List
    (and to alesser degree, Read) operations in LDAP accessing to distributeddirectory
    system causes very inefficient multi servernavigation compared to that of an LDAP
    Search being used. A Searchoperation is the most complicated of directory services,
    yet in the LDAPcase it is being used for lesser and more efficient functions.For
    instance, in the LDAP only multi - server environments, not havinga List operation
    causes considerable client re processing and protocolexchanges due to dealing
    with system referrals. This leads to extendeduser/client response times. For those
    who have already implemented aLDAP Search operation a Read and List should be
    of little consequence. This document defines two additional operations for LDAP
    namely Listand Read that extend the LDAPv3 [LDAP] operations to provide a simplenavigation/browsing
    and information retrieval mechanism by which aLDAP client can be</p>"
