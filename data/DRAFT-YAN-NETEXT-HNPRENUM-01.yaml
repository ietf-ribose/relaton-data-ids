abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification,
    a Mobile Node\n       (MN) is assigned a 64-bit Home Network Prefix (HNP) during
    the\n       initial attachment for the Home Address (HoA) configuration. During\n
    \      the movements of the MN, this prefix is unchanged and unnecessary\n       for
    the MN to reconfigure the HoA. However, the current protocol\n       does not
    specify related operations to support the MN to timely\n       receive and configure
    a new HNP when the allocated HNP changes. In\n       this draft, this problem
    is discussed and a possible solution is\n       proposed based on RFC 7077.\n\n
    \   \n\t </p>\n      "
