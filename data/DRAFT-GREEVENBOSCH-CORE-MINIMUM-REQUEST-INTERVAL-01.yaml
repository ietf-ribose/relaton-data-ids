abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an \"Minimum-Request-Interval\" option
    for CoAP,\n   which can be used to negotiate the minimum time between two\n   subsequent
    requests within a single client and server pair.  It can\n   be used for flow
    and congestion control, reducing the consumption of\n   server and network resources
    when needed.\n\nNote\n\n   Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested,
    and should\n   be sent to core@ietf.org.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
