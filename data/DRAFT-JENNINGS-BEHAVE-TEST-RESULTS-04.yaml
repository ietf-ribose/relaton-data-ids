abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IETF has several working groups that are considering the impact
    of\n   NATs on various protocols.  Having a classification of the types of\n   NATs
    that are being developed and deployed is useful in gauging the\n   impact of various
    solutions.  This draft records the results of\n   classifying NATs.\n\n   This
    draft is not complete and has only a few test results but it is\n   worth discussing
    \  results are collected.  The test results here are very old and work\n   is
    being done to update them with more current information.\n all the testing we
    wish to do before all the test\n\n\t </p>\n      "
