abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A number of Internet application protocols have a need to provide\ncontent
    negotiation for the resources with which they interact.  While\nMIME media types
    [1] provide a standard method for handling one\nmajor axis of variation, resources
    also vary in ways which cannot be\nexpressed using currently available MIME headers.
    \ This paper asserts\nthat a cross-protocol negotiation framework is needed, both
    to\nleverage work already done for specific protocols and to allow for\ncontent
    negotiation when resources will pass through several\nprotocols on their way from
    provider to recipient.  To justify the\nneed, this paper puts forward several
    content negotiation scenarios\nand discusses how they affect the requirements
    for such a framework.\n\t </p>\n      "
