abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the OPAQUE protocol, a secure asymmetric password-authenticated
    key exchange (aPAKE) that supports mutual authentication in a client-server setting
    without reliance on PKI and with security against pre-computation attacks upon
    server compromise. In addition, the protocol provides forward secrecy and the
    ability to hide the password from the server, even during password registration.
    This document specifies the core OPAQUE protocol and one instantiation based on
    3DH.</p>"
