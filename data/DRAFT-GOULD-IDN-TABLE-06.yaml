abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol
    (EPP)\n   mapping for getting Internationalized Domain Name (IDN)\n   Table information
    for the registration of IDNs, using the EPP domain\n   name mapping, and optionally
    with the IDN mapping extension.  An IDN\n   Table defines the valid set of characters
    (code points) that can be\n   used in a domain name.  Code points may overlap
    across IDN Tables and\n   the IDN Tables supported by the servers are up to server
    policy.\n\n   The IDN Table information can be used to validate an IDN prior to\n
    \  registration, can be cached by the client for pre-validation, can be\n   used
    to select the best IDN Table for the IDN, and can be used to\n   know if and what
    IDN Table Identifier to pass in a domain create.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
