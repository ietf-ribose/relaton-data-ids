abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method by which a Service Provider
    with an\n   IPv6 backbone may provide VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) and MVPNs\n
    \  (Multicast Virtual Private Networks) for its IPv4 customers.  The\n   IPv6
    core network need only deploy native multicast services using\n   Protocol Independent
    Multicast (PIM) .  All additional functionality\n   described is Customer Edge
    (CE) based and there are no additional\n   Provider (P) or Provider Edge (PE)
    protocols.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
