abstract:
- content: "<p>Backbone Routers placed at the wireless edge of a backbone link interconnect
    multiple wireless links at Layer-3 to form a large MultiLink Subnet, so that the
    broadcast domain of the backbone does not extend to the wireless links. Wireless
    nodes register or are proxy-registered to a Backbone Router to establish IPv6
    Neighbor Discovery proxy services, and the Backbone Router takes care of the ND
    operation on behalf of registered nodes and ensures and routes towards the registered
    addresses over the wireless interface.</p>"
