abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a cloud reference framework that intends
    to\n   provide a basis for designing interoperable cloud services and their\n
    \  integration into existing open Internet and enterprise IT\n   infrastructures.\n\n
    \  In general, a cloud-based system utilizes virtualized computing /\n   communications
    / storage resources and applications, and allows their\n   combined provisioning
    as complex infrastructure services.  In the\n   emerging cloud-based virtualized
    infrastructures and services are\n   provisioned on on-demand basis, and configured
    for specific customer\n   needs or tasks.\n\n   The reference framework is based
    on the survey of the SDOs and WGs\n   that are focusing on cloud-based systems
    and services (Cloud SDO,\n   I-D.Khasnabish-cloud-sdo-survey), on-going standardisation
    activities\n   and other research and developments in the cloud computing technology\n
    \  area.  Both intra-cloud and inter-cloud reference frameworks are\n   presented
    and the requirements to the general functional layers and\n   components are discussed.\n\n\t
