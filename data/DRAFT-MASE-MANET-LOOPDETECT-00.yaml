abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We consider looping issue of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET).\nTransient
    routing loops have been observed to form in Ad-hoc Networks\nrunning the MANET
    routing protocol with Link Layer Notification\n(LLN).  Even when only a small
    quantity of the traffic may enter\nthese loops and only for brief time, the effect
    is to significantly\nincrease the impact on the surrounding network and its traffic
    thus\ndegrading end-to-end transmission.  The use of MANET routing\nprotocols
    with LLN, together with loop detection and discarding of\nlooping packet to negate
    the detrimental effects on surrounding\ntraffic is found to improve performance
    significantly.\n\t </p>\n      "
