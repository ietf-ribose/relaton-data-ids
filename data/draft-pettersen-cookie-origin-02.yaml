abstract:
  content: "\t <t>HTTP Cookies, as originally defined by Netscape in [NETSC] and aslater
    updated by [RFC2109] , [RFC2965], and[I-D.ietf-httpstate-cookie] did not address
    the issue of how torestrict for which domains a server is allowed to set a cookie.
    Thisis particularly a problem for servers hosted in top-level domainshaving subdomains
    that are controlled by registries and not by domainowners, e.g., \"co.uk\" and
    \"city.state.us\" domains. In suchsituations, unless the client uses some kind
    of domain black-list, itis possible for a malicious server to set cookies, so
    they are sentto all servers in a domain the attacker does not control. Thesecookies
    may adveresly affect the function of servers receiving them.The primary reason
    this is a problem is that the server receiving thecookie has no way of telling
    which server originally set it;therefore it is not able to distinguish reliably
    an invalid cookiefrom a valid one.This document proposes a new attribute, \"$Origin\",
    that is associatedwith each cookie and sent in all client cookie headers in therequests
    sent to the server. Servers recognizing the attribute maythen check to see if
    the cookie was set by a server, which is allowedto set cookies for the server
    and, if necessary, ignore the cookie.This document updates RFC 2109 and RFC 2965.</p>"
