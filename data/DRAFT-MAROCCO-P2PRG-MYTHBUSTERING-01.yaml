abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Peer-to-peer traffic optimization techniques that aim at improving\nlocality
    in the peer selection process have attracted great interest\nin the research community
    and have been subject of much discussion.\nSome of this discussion has produced
    controversial myths, some rooted\nin reality while others remain unfounded.  This
    document evaluates\nthe most prominent myths attributed to P2P optimization techniques
    by\nreferencing the most relevant study (or studies) that have addressed\nfacts
    pertaining to the myth.  Using these studies, we hope to either\nconfirm or refute
    each specific myth.\n\t </p>\n      "
