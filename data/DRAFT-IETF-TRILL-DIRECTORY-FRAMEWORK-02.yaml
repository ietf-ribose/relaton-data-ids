abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Edge RBridges currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses
    and\n   their egress RBridges by observing the data packets ingressed or\n   egressed
    and by the TRILL ESADI protocol. When ingress RBridge\n   receives a data frame
    whose destination address (MAC&amp;VLAN) that\n   RBridge does not know, the data
    frame is flooded within the VLAN\n   across the TRILL campus.\n\n   This draft
    describes the framework for using directory services to\n   assist edge RBridges
    by reducing multi-destination frames,\n   particularly unknown unicast frames
    flooding, and ARP/ND, improving\n   TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots
    of Links) network\n   scalability in environments such as data centers.\n\n\t
