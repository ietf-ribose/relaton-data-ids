abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DHCP Relay Agents eliminate the necessity of having a DHCP
    server on\n   each physical network.  In certain network configurations, a DHCP\n
    \  server may be multiple subnets away from the DHCP client and multiple\n   Relay
    Agents may be configured to relay DHCP messages to and from\n   DHCP client.  Such
    configuration can be supported only when each\n   Relay Agent adds certain Information
    to DHCP messages before relaying\n   them.  This additional information helps
    in relaying the DHCP reply\n   back to the DHCP client through the same path.
    \ This mechanism is\n   referred as Relay Chaining.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
