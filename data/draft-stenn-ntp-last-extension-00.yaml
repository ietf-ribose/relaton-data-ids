abstract:
- content: <p>NTPv4 is defined by RFC 5905 [RFC5905], and it and earlier versions
    of the NTP Protocol have supported symmetric private key MAC authentication. MACs
    pre-date the Extension Fields introduced in RFC 5905 [RFC5905], and as the number
    of Extension Fields grows there is an increasing chance of ambiguity when deciding
    if the "next" set of data is an Extension Field or a MAC. This proposal defines
    a new Extension Field which is used to signifiy that it is the last Extension
    Field in the packet. If present, any subsequent data SHOULD be considered to be
    a legacy MAC.</p>
