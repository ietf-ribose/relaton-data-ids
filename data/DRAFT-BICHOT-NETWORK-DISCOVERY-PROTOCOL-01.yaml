abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the Network Discovery Protocol (NETDIS),
    a \nprotocol that provides a way to broadcast information about the \nnetwork
    service accessible through the access network where the \ninformation is broadcasted.
    This allows several service providers to \nshare the same access network. The
    public WLAN access network is \nparticularly targeted by this protocol. As a result
    a mobile terminal \nlistening NETDIS announcements discovers the list of Service
    \nproviders (Virtual WLAN operator) supported by the WLAN it is \ncurrently attached.
    \n\t </p>\n      "
