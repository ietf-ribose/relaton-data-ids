abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Light-weight, multicast address discovery mechanisms that can
    be used\n   by large scale client-server application deployments have been\n   virtually
    non-existent in the past.  This has resulted in many\n   multicast client-server
    applications being deployed with \"hard-coded\"\n   multicast addresses within
    the client workstations in order to\n   provide \"zero-configuration\" operation
    of the application.\n   Unfortunately, many of these hard-coded multicast addresses
    are often\n   picked at random by the application developers resulting in multicast\n
    \  address collisions with other protocols/applications or conflicts\n   with
    the multicast scoping plans of a network administrator.  This\n   document describes
    a \"light-weight\" multicast address discovery\n   protocol that can be used by
    application clients to locate their\n   nearest application server using well-known
    scope relative multicast\n   addresses.  Once located, the server can then communicate
    the\n   multicast address(es) that have been configured on the server by the\n
    \  network administrator for use by the application.  This permits\n   applications
    be written to operate in a flexible \"near-zero\"\n   configuration mode without
    having to use \"hard-coded\" addresses or\n   rely on any other network service
    other than multicast and the\n   existence of a nearby application server.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
