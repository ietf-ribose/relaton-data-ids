abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a profile of the Automatic Certificate\n
    \  Management Environment (ACME) protocol by which the holder of an\n   identifier
    (e.g., a domain name) can allow a third party to obtain an\n   X.509 certificate
    such that the certificate subject is the delegated\n   identifier while the certified
    public key corresponds to a private\n   key controlled by the third party.  A
    primary use case is that of a\n   Content Delivery Network (CDN, the third party)
    terminating TLS\n   sessions on behalf of a content provider (the holder of a
    domain\n   name).  The presented mechanism allows the holder of the identifier\n
    \  to retain control over the delegation and revoke it at any time.\n   Importantly,
    this mechanism does not require any modification to the\n   deployed TLS clients
    and servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
