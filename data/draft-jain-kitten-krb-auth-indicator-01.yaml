abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension in the Kerberos protocol. It defines
    a new Authorization Data Type AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR. The purpose of introducing
    this data type is to include an indicator of the client's authentication strength
    in the service tickets so that the application services can use it as an input
    into policy decisions.</p>"
