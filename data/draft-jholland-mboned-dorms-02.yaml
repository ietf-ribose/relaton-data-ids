abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines DORMS (Discovery Of Restconf Metadata for Source-specific
    multicast), a method to discover and retrieve extensible metadata about source-specific
    multicast channels using RESTCONF. The reverse IP DNS zone for a multicast sender's
    IP address is configured to use SRV resource records to advertise the hostname
    of a RESTCONF server that publishes metadata according to a new YANG module with
    support for extensions. A new service name and the new YANG module are defined.</p>"
