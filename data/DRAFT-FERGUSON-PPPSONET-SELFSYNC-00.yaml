abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The use of a self-synchronous scrambler to minimize the possibility\n
    \  that a carefully chosen PPP over SONET/SDH payload can cause a long\n   sequence
    of zero bits to be transmitted is examined.  It is pointed\n   out that, while
    self-synchronous scramblers have some attractive\n   properties for the application,
    the x^43 + 1 scrambler used by ATM\n   for the same purpose has some unfortunate
    interactions with the\n   16-bit CRC Frame Check Sequence which is the PPP default
    FCS.  It is\n   suggested that adding a third term to the self-synchronous generator\n
    \  polynomial might improve its behaviour, and that inverting the\n   scrambler
    bit ordering so it is applied to the data in the same bit\n   order as the PPP
    CRC FCS algorithms are defined for may eliminate any\n   remaining effect such
    scramblers have on either PPP FCS.\n\t </p>\n      "
