abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a protocol which enables resource constrained
    nodes to perform authentication and authorization operations in a constrained
    environment. By using this protocol, a resource constrained node can delegate
    the authentication of communication peers and management of authorization information
    to a trusted third party with less severe limitations regarding processing power
    and memory. This specification is based on the pull model architecture.</p>"
