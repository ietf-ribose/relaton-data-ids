abstract:
- content: "<p>A framework for NSIS is in preparation, and will identify a split into
    two layers. The lower layer, referred to as the NSIS Transport Layer Protocol
    (NTLP) provides generic support for different types of path coupled signalling,
    including QoS signalling. This document discusses issues to be considered in the
    design of an NSIS Transport Layer Protocol (NTLP).</p>"
