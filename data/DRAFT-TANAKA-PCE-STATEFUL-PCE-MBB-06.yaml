abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) and its corresponding\n
    \  protocol extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do\n   stateful
    control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic\n   Engineering Label
    Switched Paths (TE LSP).  Stateful PCE supports\n   manipulating of the existing
    LSP's state and attributes (e.g.,\n   bandwidth and path) via delegation and also
    instantiation of new LSPs\n   in the network via PCE Initiation procedures.\n\n
    \  In the current MPLS TE network using Resource ReSerVation Protocol\n   (RSVP-TE),
    LSPs are often controlled by Make-before-break (M-B-B)\n   signaling by the headend
    for the purpose of LSP restoration and\n   reoptimization.  In most cases, it
    is an essential operation to\n   reroute LSP traffic without any data disruption.\n\n
    \  This document specifies the procedure of applying stateful PCE's\n   control
    to make-before-break RSVP-TE signaling.  In this document,\n   two types of restoration/reoptimization
    procedures are defined,\n   implicit mode and explicit mode.  This document also
    specifies the\n   usage and handling of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication Protocol)\n
    \  messages, expected behavior of PCC as RSVP-TE headend and necessary\n   extensions
    of additional PCEP objects.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
