abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a key management, designated as StealthKeyManagement.
    StealthKey Management establishes short-term keys whichare derived from a common
    long-term key in two entities, referredto as sender and receiver, for symmetric
    encryption algorithms andcryptographic authentication protocols based on a common
    secret.Stealthkey Management covers two main parts:- Independent generation of
    the short-term keys by the sender andreceiver from either the common long-term
    key and the time, orfrom the common long-term key and a sequence number.- Synchronization
    of the short-term keys between both entities.The important advantages of using
    StealthKey Management for messageencryption and authentication are the ability
    to change the short-term keys frequently, without exchanges between sender and
    receiverand the independence of other applications for the key changeprocess (in
    band). A commonly used term for key change is rekeying.The required long-term
    key can be established remotely through theuse of known symmetric or asymmetric
    key protocols, or locally viamanual setup. StealthKey Management improves the
    performance of anyof today's key management protocols, by extending the protocol
    withthe frequent changing of keys.</p>"
