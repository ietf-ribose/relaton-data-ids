abstract:
- content: "<p>Redundancy Protection is a generalized protection mechanism to achieve
    the high reliability of service transmission in Segment Routing network. Specifically,
    packets of flows are replicated at a network node into two or more copies, which
    are transported via different and disjoint paths in parallel. To support redundancy
    protection in Segment Routing domain, this document introduces Redundancy Policy,
    as a variant of SR Policy, to intrust the replication of service packets and the
    multiple ordered lists of segments used for packet carrying.</p>"
