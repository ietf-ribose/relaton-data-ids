abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n
    \  protocol provides support for flow level multi-pathing for both\n   unicast
    and multi-destination traffic in networks with arbitrary\n   topology. Active-active
    access at the TRILL edge is the extension of\n   these characteristics to end
    stations that are multiply connected to\n   a TRILL campus as discussed in RFC
    7379. In this document, the edge\n   RBridge (TRILL switch) group providing active-active
    access to such\n   an end station are represented as a Virtual RBridge. Based
    on the\n   concept of Virtual RBridge along with its pseudo-nickname, this\n   document
    specifies a method for TRILL active-active access by such\n   end stations.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
