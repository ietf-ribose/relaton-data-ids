abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SSL and TLS renegotiation are vulnerable to an attack in which
    the\nattacker forms a TLS connection with the target server, injects\ncontent
    of his choice, and then splices in a new TLS connection from\na client.  The server
    treats the client's initial TLS handshake as a\nrenegotiation and thus believes
    that the initial data transmitted by\nthe attacker is from the same entity as
    the subsequent client data.\nThis draft defines a TLS extension to cryptographically
    tie\nrenegotiations to the TLS connections they are being performed over,\nthus
    preventing this attack.\n\t </p>\n      "
