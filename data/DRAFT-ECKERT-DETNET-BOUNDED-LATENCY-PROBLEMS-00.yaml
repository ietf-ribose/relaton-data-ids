abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of this memo is to explain the challenges and limitations\n
    \  of existing (standardized) bounded latency queuing mechanisms for\n   desirable
    (large scale) MPLS and/or IP based networks to allow them\n   to support DetNet
    services.  These challenges relate to low-cost,\n   high-speed hardware implementations,
    desirable network design\n   approaches, system complexity, reliability, scalability,
    cost of\n   signaling, performance and jitter experience for the DetNet\n   applications.
    \ Many of these problems are rooted in the use of per-\n   hop, per-flow (DetNet)
    forwarding and queuing state, but highly\n   accurate network wide time synchronization
    can be another challenge\n   for some networks.\n\n   This memo does not intend
    to propose a specific queuing solution, but\n   in the same way in which it describes
    the challenges of mechanisms,\n   it reviews how those problem are addressed by
    currently proposed new\n   queuing mechanisms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
