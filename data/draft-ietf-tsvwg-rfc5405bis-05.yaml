abstract:
- content: "<p>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing
    transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms. This document provides
    guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels and other
    protocols that use UDP. Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but
    the document also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes,
    reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of ECN, DSCPs, and ports.
    Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet,
    applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport
    must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree
    of fairness with concurrent traffic. They may also need to implement additional
    mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP. Some guidance is also applicable to
    the design of other protocols (e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based
    tunnels), especially when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion
    control. If published as an RFC, this document will obsolete RFC5405.</p>"
