abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is written to capture the design rationale primarily
    for the individual draft-00 version of BGPsec protocol specification [I-D.lepinski-bgpsec-protocol].
    However, where appropriate, the document also provides brief notes on design decisions
    that changed (relative to individual draft-00 version) in the finalized protocol
    specification [RFC8205]. The notes mention what the differences are and provide
    pointers to where the details and/or rationale can be found about those changes
    in design. The document lists the decisions that were made in favor of or against
    each design choice, and presents brief summaries of the arguments that aided the
    decision process.</p>"
