abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS over TCP and traditional HTTP are both stream-oriented,
    client-\n   speaks-first protocols.  They can both be run over a stream-based\n
    \  security protocol like TLS.  A server accepting a stream-based client\n   can
    distinguish between a valid stream of DNS queries and valid\n   stream of HTTP
    requests by simple observation of the first few octets\n   sent by the client.
    \ This can be done without any external\n   demultiplexing mechanism like TCP
    port number or ALPN.\n\n   Implicit multiplexing of the two protocols over a single
    listening\n   port can be useful for obscuring the presence of DNS queries from
    a\n   network observer, which makes it relevant for DNS privacy.\n\n   Widespread
    adoption of the described approach could constrain future\n   evolution of the
    stream-based variants of both DNS ([RFC1035]) and\n   HTTP ([RFC7230] and [RFC7540])
    by ossifying existing distinguishing\n   bit patterns in early octets sent by
    the client.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
