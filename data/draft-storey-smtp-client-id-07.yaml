abstract:
  content: <p>This document defines an extension for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
    (SMTP) called "CLIENTID" to provide a method for clients to indicate an identity
    to the server. This identity is an additional token that may be used for security
    and/or informational purposes, and with it a server may optionally apply heuristics
    using this token.</p>
