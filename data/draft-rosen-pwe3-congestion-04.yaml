abstract:
- content: <p>Given that pseudowires may be used to carry non-TCP data flows, it is
    necessary to provide pseudowire-specific congestion control procedures. These
    procedures should ensure that pseudowire traffic is "TCP-compatible", as defined
    in RFC 2914. This document attempts to lay out the issues which must be considered
    when defining such procedures.</p>
