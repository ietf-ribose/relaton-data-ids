abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo provides a mechanism whereby messages conforming to theMIME
    specifications [RFC 2045, RFC 2046, RFC 2047, RFC 2048, RFC 2049]can convey presentational
    information. It specifies the 'Content-Disposition' header field, which is optional
    and valid for any MIMEentity ('message' or 'body part'). Two values for this header
    field aredescribed in this memo; one for the ordinary linear presentation of thebody
    part, and another to facilitate the use of mail to transfer files.Another content-disposition
    value, for use in HTML file uploads, hasbeen defined in a separate document. [RFC
    2388]. It is expected thatadditional values will be defined in the future, and
    this memo definesthe procedures for extending the set of values. This document
    is intended as an extension to MIME, which itself isan extension to [RFC 822].
    As such, the reader is assumed to befamiliar with both the MIME specifications
    and RFC 822. The informationpresented herein supplements but does not replace
    that found in thosedocuments. This document is a revision to the Proposed Standard
    protocoldefined in RFC 2183. As compared to RFC 2183, this document containsminor
    editorial updates, which are summarized in section 10 of thisdocument.</p>"
