abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft specifies a Per Domain Behavior that provides the
    ability \n   to Diffserv nodes located outside Diffserv domain(s), e.g., receiver
    \n   or other Diffserv enabled router to detect when the resources \n   provided
    by the Diffserv domain(s) are not available. The \n   unavailability of resources
    in the domain is monitored and detected \n   by proportionally marking packets
    whenever the current link rate \n   exceeds some pre-configured SLS agreed throughput
    (bandwidth) \n   threshold. It is considered that the SLS agreed throughput threshold
    \n   is not statically but loosely defined in order to allow a more \n   efficient
    utilization of the Diffserv domain(s) and a simpler network\n   management operation.
    This PDB can be applied in association with \n   either a single Diffserv domain
    or multiple neighboring Diffserv \n   domains, when a trust relationship exist
    between these multiple \n   Diffserv domains. This specification is denoted as
    Resource \n   Unavailability (RU) PDB and it follows the guidelines given in \n
    \  [RFC3086].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
