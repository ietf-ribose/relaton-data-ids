abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an authenticated in-band method for
    automatic\n   signaling of a Child DNS zone's delegation signer information from\n
    \  the zone's DNS operator(s).  The zone's registrar or registry may\n   subsequently
    use this signal for automatic DS record provisioning in\n   the parent zone.  The
    protocol is particularly useful in case of\n   managed DNS providers hosting registrant's
    domains, where DS\n   provisioning has so far been cumbersome.\n\n   The signaling
    channel is not specific to the DS bootstrapping use\n   case, but equally suitable
    for announcing other zone-specific\n   information from the DNS Operator in an
    authenticated fashion.\n   Further potential applications thus include, for example,
    key\n   exchange between parties in an [RFC8901] multisigner setup.\n\n   [ Ed
