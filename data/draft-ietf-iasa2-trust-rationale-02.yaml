abstract:
- content: '<p>This document is published to capture the rationale for the changes
    introduced in RFC NNNN (RFC Editor: please replace NNNN with the RFC number of
    [I-D.ietf-iasa2-trust-update]), Update to the Process for Selection of Trustees
    for the IETF Trust. At the time RFC NNNN was published, IETF administrative structure
    changes ("IASA 2.0") had an impact on the IETF Trust because members of the IETF
    Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) IAOC, which was being phased out, had
    served as Trustees of the IETF Trust. This document provides background on the
    past IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect of the rules in the founding
    documents during the transition to the new arrangement, and provides a rationale
    for the update.</p>'
