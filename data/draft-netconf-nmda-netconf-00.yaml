abstract:
- content: <p>The "Network Management Datastore Architecture" (NMDA) improves on NETCONF
    by adding new features to give more accurate handling of configuration and operational
    data. These include ability to inspect the current operational values of configuration
    data, allowing clients to use identical paths for retrieving the configured values
    and the operational values. These new features require additional operations in
    network management applications such as NETCONF. This draft details those new
    operations.</p>
