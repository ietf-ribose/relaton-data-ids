abstract:
- content: '<p>Content delivery includes one or more CDNs and in many instances involves
    cascaded delegation when handling encrypted data. The delivery of such content
    over HTTPS though raises credential management issues. Two models of HTTPS delegation
    can be considered: direct delegation, and "cascaded" delegation. While the first
    model of delegation is addressed by most of the work at the IETF, in the latter
    case, it is up to downstream CDN(s) delivering the content to an end-user to present
    legacy credentials of either the origin or of the upstream CDN which delegated
    the delivery to the aforementioned dCDN. This document presents updates needed
    in CDNI Control and Metadata interfaces to setup HTTPS delegation between an uCDN
    and dCDN.</p>'
