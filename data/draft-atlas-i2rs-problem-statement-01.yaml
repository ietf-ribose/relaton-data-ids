abstract:
- content: "<p>As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the need for rapid
    and dynamic control increases. With scale, the need to automate even the simplest
    operations is important, but even more critical is the ability to quickly interact
    with more complex operations such as policy-based controls. In order to enable
    applications to have access to and control over information in the Internet's
    routing system, we need a publicly documented interface specification. The interface
    needs to support real-time, asynchronous interactions using data models and encodings
    that are efficient and potentially different from those available today. Furthermore,
    the interface must be tailored to support a variety of use cases. This document
    expands upon these statements of requirements to provide a detailed problem statement
    for an Interface to the Internet Routing System (I2RS).</p>"
