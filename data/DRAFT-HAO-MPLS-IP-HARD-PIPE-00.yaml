abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is intended to become an Informational RFC on
    the\n   independent stream.  The document does not specify any new protocol\n
    \  or procedures.  It does explain how MPLS standards been implemented,\n   deployed
    and operated to meet the requirements from operators that\n   offer traditional
    Virtual Leased Line services.\n\n   This document introduces the concept of \"Hard
    Pipes\", a Hard Pipe is\n   an MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) or a Pseudowire
    (PW) with a\n   bandwidth that is guaranteed and can neither be exceeded nor\n
    \  infringed upon.\n\n   This document describes an MPLS/IP network that has an
    infrastructure\n   that can be separated into two or more strata.  For the\n   implementation
    described in this document the infrastructure has been\n   separated into two
    strata.  One for the 'Hard Pipes', called the\n   'Hard Pipe Stratum\".  And one
    for the normal IP/MPLS traffic - called\n   the 'Normal IP/MPLS stratum'.\n\n
    \  The Hard Pipe stratum does not use statistical multiplexing, for the\n   LSPs
    and PWs setup within this stratum the bandwidth are guaranteed\n   end to end.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
