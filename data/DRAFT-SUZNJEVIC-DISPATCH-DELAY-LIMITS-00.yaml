abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network delay is one of the main factors which can degrade
    the\n   Quality of Experience (QoE) of network services.  This document\n   surveys
    a set of recommendations about the maximum latency tolerated\n   by the users
    of services with delay constraints.  Some\n   recommendations already exist for
    e.g.  VoIP, but emerging services\n   as e.g. online gaming, have different requirements.
    \ Different papers\n   in the literature reporting these constraints are surveyed,
    and a\n   summary of the latency limits for each service is provided.\n\n\t </p>\n
