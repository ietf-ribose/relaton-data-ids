abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The specification for a EAP based keying methodology for Proxy
    Mobile \n   IP security is a topic of interest within some standard bodies such
    \n   as WiMAX and is still under consideration. In this document, the \n   authors
    intend to provide an first pass illustration on how the EAP \n   keying framework
    may be used for bootstrapping keys between two \n   agents performing a network
    service such as Proxy Mobile IP function. \n   Care is taken so that the solution
    is aligned as closely as possible \n   to the guidelines provided by the EAP Keying
    framework [EAPKEY]. The \n   solution is, however, fitted to the constraints of
    the existing SDO \n   scenarios and may not fully fit a future generic application
    keying \n   solutions defined by HOAKEY.   \n\t </p>\n      "
