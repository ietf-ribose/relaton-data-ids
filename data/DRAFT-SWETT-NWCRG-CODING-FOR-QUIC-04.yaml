abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document focuses on the integration of FEC coding in the
    QUIC\n   transport protocol, in order to recover from packet losses.  This\n   document
    does not specify any FEC code but defines mechanisms to\n   negotiate and integrate
    FEC Schemes in QUIC.  By using proactive loss\n   recovery, it is expected to
    improve QUIC performance in sessions\n   impacted by packet losses.  More precisely
    it is expected to improve\n   QUIC performance with real-time sessions (since
    FEC coding makes\n   packet loss recovery insensitive to the round trip time),
    with short\n   sessions (since FEC coding can help recovering from tail losses
    more\n   rapidely than through retransmissions), with multicast sessions\n   (since
    the same repair packet can recover several different losses at\n   several receivers),
    and with multipath sessions (since repair packets\n   add diversity and flexibility).\n\n\t
