abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines two new link types that indicate relationships\n
    \  between resources in terms of cache invalidation, along with a HTTP\n   cache-control
    extension that takes advantage of those relationships\n   to use them to extend
    response freshness.  Collectively, this is\n   referred to as Linked Cache Invalidation
    (LCI).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
