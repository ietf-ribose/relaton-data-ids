abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A Virtual Interface is a software semantic internal to the hostoperating
    system. This semantic is widely available in all popularoperating systems and
    is used in various protocol implementations.The Virtual Interface support is also
    required on the mobile nodeoperating in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, for leveraging
    variousmobility features such as inter-technology handoffs, multihoming andflow
    mobility support. This document explains the operationaldetails of Virtual Interface
    construct and the inter-working with thenetwork elements in the Proxy Mobile IPv6
    domain for supportingvarious network-based mobility management features.</p>"
