abstract:
- content: "<p>A Virtual Interface is a software semantic internal to the host operating
    system. This semantic is widely available in all popular operating systems and
    is used in various protocol implementations. The Virtual Interface support is
    also required on the mobile node operating in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, for
    leveraging various mobility features such as inter-technology handoffs, multihoming
    and flow mobility support. This document explains the operational details of Virtual
    Interface construct and the inter-working with the network elements in the Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 domain for supporting various network-based mobility management features.</p>"
