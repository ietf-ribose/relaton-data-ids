abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification defines a document format that can be used
    to\n   describe the differences between versions of resources managed by the\n
    \  Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol\n   (XCAP).
    \ Documents of this format can be delivered to clients using a\n   number of means,
    including the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n   event package for configuration
    data.  By subscribing to this event\n   package, clients can learn about document
    changes made by other\n   clients.\n\t </p>\n      "
