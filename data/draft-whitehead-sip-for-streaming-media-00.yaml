abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft reviews requirements and evaluates solutions to improvethe
    integration of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)[RFC3261] to the Real Time
    Streaming Protocol (RTSP and RTSP v2)[RFC 2326 and IDRTSP] especially in the context
    of converged mediaservices. The document develops a rationale and solution space
    for using SIP with streaming media applications. This is done by first considering
    use cases that are used to define generic requirementsto help compare the current
    and potentially new solutions. Therange of solutions is sketched out (at high-level)
    and advantages anddisadvantages discussed. The solutions evaluated address differentlevels
    of integration from SIP-only approaches to dual-protocolsolutions.</p>"
