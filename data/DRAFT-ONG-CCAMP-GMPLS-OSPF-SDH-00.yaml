abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft defines an optimization for bandwidth advertisement
    for\nSONET/SDH that removes the need to carry multiple copies of the ISCD\nsub-TLV
    and has been designed to be consistent with the work on\nTechnology Agnostic OSPF
    Traffic Engineering Extensions for \nGeneralized MPLS (GMPLS) [BA-TLV].\nThese
    formats are based on previous experience prototyping and\ntesting control plane
    for ASON networks and are proposed for\nadoption as a Standards Track RFC for
    support of ASON routing.\n\t </p>\n      "
