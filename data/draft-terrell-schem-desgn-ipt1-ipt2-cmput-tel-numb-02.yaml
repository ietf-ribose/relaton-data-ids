abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This paper focuses upon the simplification of the presentation forDefining
    the New Schematic of what was called the IPv7 and IPv8 IPProtocol Specifications.
    Which is accomplished by first, Renamingthese Protocols to 'IPt1' and 'IPt2',
    where the 't' represents'Tele-Communications-Specification'. And second, by eliminatingeither
    all, or most of the extraneous information, which is notessential (at least not
    anymore) for understanding the overallSchematic Structure, nor the benefits, these
    Protocol Specificationsactually represent. Which is further emphasized with a
    comparison,that uses The New and the Modern Binary Systems. Where is it shownthat
    an increase in efficiency still exist, while the Number of IPAddresses remains
    Astronomically Large in both cases.In other words, the 'IPt1' and 'IPt2' IP Specifications
    represents aformat, which is nothing more than a 'Telephone Number Implementation'that
    can be used as the primary IP Addressing format in anyTelecommunications System,
    regardless of the choice for the Method inBinary Enumeration. Which means, in
    essence, this a TelecommunicationsProtocol that is essentially the 'Computer's
    Telephone Number'.</p>"
