abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) evolves, EAP
    peers\n   rely increasingly on information received from the EAP server.  EAP\n
    \  extensions such as channel binding or network posture information are\n   often
    carried in tunnel methods; peers are likely to rely on this\n   information.  [RFC
    3748] is a facility that protects tunnel methods\n   against man-in-the-middle
    attacks.  However, cryptographic binding\n   focuses on protecting the server
    rather than the peer.  This memo\n   explores attacks possible when the peer is
    not protected from man-in-\n   the-middle attacks and recommends mutual cryptographic
    binding, a new\n   form of cryptographic binding that protects both peer and server.\n\n\t
