abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Real-time applications impose very strict requirements on the\nunderlying
    transmission network that requires a high level of quality\nof service (QoS).
    This level of QoS can only be achieved by means of\nQoS management on an end-to-end
    basis (i.e., end user to end user),\nfrom application to application, potentially
    across many domains, as\nthe current Internet is a concatenation of many domains,
    usually\nmanaged by different QoS administrators (operators).\nThe requirement
    for end-to-end QoS management does not necessarily\nmean that a single resource
    reservation protocol must be applied end-\nto-end. In fact it is most likely that
    the end-to-end QoS management\narchitecture will consist of many interoperable
    and concatenated QoS\nmanagement architectures rather than one global end-to-end
    QoS\ninfrastructure. Usually a network consists of three network parts,\ni.e.,
    a host to first hop router, access network and the backbone of\nthe network. Each
    of these three network parts imposes different\nrequirements on the provided QoS
    solution.\nThis draft describes a framework for NSIS QoS signaling in edge to\nedge
    networks. The main goal is to provide a skeleton for lightweight\nedge to edge
    NSIS signaling in a network. This skeleton would be used\nas input to the NSIS
    'Framework signaling architecture'.\nEven though designed for edge-to-edge signaling
    the applicability of\nthis framework is not to be limited only to signaling between
    the\nedges of a network, but it can be extended in other signaling\nscenarios
    as well, such as end host - to - end host signaling.\nThe QoS protocol that will
    be applied in an edge to edge network is\ndenoted as edge-to-edge NSIS protocol.\n\n\n\t
