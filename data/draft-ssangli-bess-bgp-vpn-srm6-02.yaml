abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines BGP protocol extensions for encoding and carrying
    SRm6 Tunnel Payload Forwarding information (TPF) to support Virtual Private Network
    services. This is applicable when the VPN services are offered in a SRm6 enabled
    IPv6 network such that the VPN payload is transported over IPv6. The Tunnel Payload
    Information is encoded in the IPv6 Destination Option Header in the IPv6 data
    packets.</p>"
