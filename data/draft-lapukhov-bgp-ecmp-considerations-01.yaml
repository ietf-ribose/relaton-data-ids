abstract:
- content: <p>BGP routing protocol defined in ([RFC4271]) employs tie-breaking logic
    to elect single best path among multiple possible. At the same time, it has been
    common in all practical BGP implementations to allow for "equal-cost multipath"
    (ECMP) path election and programming of multiple next-hops in routing tables.
    This documents provides some common considerations for the ECMP logic, with the
    intent of providing common reference on otherwise unstandardized feature.</p>
