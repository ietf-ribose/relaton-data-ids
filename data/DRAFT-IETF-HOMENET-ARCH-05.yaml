abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This text describes evolving networking technology within\n
    \  increasingly large residential home networks.  The goal of this\n   document
    is to define an architecture for IPv6-based home networking,\n   while describing
    the associated principles, considerations and\n   requirements.  The text briefly
    highlights the specific implications\n   of the introduction of IPv6 for home
    networking, discusses the\n   elements of the architecture, and suggests how standard
    IPv6\n   mechanisms and addressing can be employed in home networking.  The\n
    \  architecture describes the need for specific protocol extensions for\n   certain
    additional functionality.  It is assumed that the IPv6 home\n   network is not
    actively managed, and runs as an IPv6-only or dual-\n   stack network.  There
    are no recommendations in this text for the\n   IPv4 part of the network.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
