abstract:
- content: "<p>Circuit Cross-Connect (CCC) was the ground-breaking design and implementation
    of the transport of Layer 2 frames over Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS),
    which is now seen as an important application of MPLS. Thus, documenting CCC is
    important from a historical point of view. Furthermore, CCC is still in production
    in many networks, providing yet another reason to document it. It is hoped that
    those interested in this area will see where it started, how far we have come,
    and the strengths and weaknesses of this particular approach, and thereby gain
    some perspective of the area. If in the process they get new insights for the
    future development in this area, that is a bonus.</p>"
