abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Shared mesh restoration technique efficiently uses network resources\nsince
    restoration capacity is shared across multiple independent\nfailures. In this
    scheme, when a new working LSP is established, its\ncorresponding backup LSP is
    pre-calculated and resources along the\nrestoration route are reserved. The resources
    reserved on each link\nalong the restoration path may be shared across different
    working\nLSPs that are not expected to fail simultaneously. To make the method\nfor
    selection of backup LSPs more efficient in terms of utilization\nof network resources,
    each link should provide the route calculator\nwith information about its restoration
    capacity and SRLGs of working\nLSPs whose backup LSPs share the link restoration
    capacity. In this\ndocument we propose extensions to OSPF-TE in support of carrying
    link\n'Sharable Bandwidth' information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
