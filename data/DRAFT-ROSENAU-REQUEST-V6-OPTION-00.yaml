abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an idea for a header \"option\" for
    the\n   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).\n\n   The extension is used by dual-stack
    nodes to force the use of the\n   IPv6 protocol instead of the IPv4 protocol when
    exchanging data over\n   TCP.\n\n   Especially if one of the two nodes is a NAT64
    or NAT46 router it\n   makes sense not to use IPv4 but IPv6 if both nodes are
    dual-stack\n   nodes.\n\n   This document also suggests to declare the usage of
    such a method\n   mandatory for all nodes that use IPv4 addresses that will be
    assigned\n   by RIRs in the future.\n\n   Doing so will make it impossible to
    (mis-) use IPv4 addresses\n   assigned by RIRs to ISPs for IPv4-only nodes that
    do not support\n   IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
