abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the requirements for using multiple Generic
    Associated Channel Labels (GALs) in an MPLS label stack. As a result, the document
    updates RFC 5586 by removing the restriction imposed on the usage of GAL that
    limits the number of GAL in the MPLS label stack to one.</p>"
