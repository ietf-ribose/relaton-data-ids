abstract:
  content: "<p>The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selectedmailbox.
    A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and aclient that wishes to support
    this must issue a series of SELECT andSEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete
    before moving on to thenext. This extension allows a client to search multiple
    mailboxeswith one command, limiting the round-trips and waiting for varioussearches
    to complete. This also introduces mailbox field in ESEARCHresponses, allowing
    a client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.NoteA revised version of this
    draft document will be submitted to the RFCeditor as a Proposed Standard for the
    Internet Community. Discussionand suggestions for improvement are requested, and
    should be sent toietf-imapext@imc.org.</p>"
