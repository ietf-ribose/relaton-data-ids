abstract:
- content: "<p>The ALTO base protocol [RFC7285] uses HTTP/1.x as the transport protocol
    and hence ALTO transport includes the limitations of HTTP/1.x. ALTO/SSE [RFC8895]
    addresses some of the limitations, but is still based on HTTP/1.x. This document
    introduces ALTO/H2, which provides the transport of ALTO information resources
    on top of HTTP/2.</p>"
