abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document describes Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation (BIBE),
    a\n   Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol (BP) \"convergence\n   layer\"
    protocol that tunnels BP \"bundles\" through encapsulating\n   bundles.  The services
    provided by the BIBE convergence-layer\n   protocol adapter encapsulate an outbound
    BP \"bundle\" in a BIBE\n   convergence-layer protocol data unit for transmission
    as the payload\n   of a bundle.  Security measures applied to the encapsulating
    bundle\n   may augment those applied to the encapsulated bundle.\n\n\t </p>\n
