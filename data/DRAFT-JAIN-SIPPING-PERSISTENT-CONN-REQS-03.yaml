abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SIP over connection-oriented transport protocol based systems
    are \nlikely to face certain distinct performance and behavioral issues \nthat
    are not manifest when SIP is transported over connectionless \nprotocols. Allowing
    SIP entities to mutually conserve connections \nover a predictable, extended period
    of time is one of the leading \nrequirements to help SIP entities deliver their
    optimal \nperformance in the network. Overall, this document contemplates \ntransport
    layer connection management issues relating to SIP. \nRequirements and potential
    solutions for introducing a backward \ncompatible notion of persistent connections
    in SIP are presented.\n\t </p>\n      "
