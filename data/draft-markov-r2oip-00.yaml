abstract:
- content: "<p>A way of sending of telephone interexchange R2 signals over the Internet
    is presented. Signals are sent as named events. All signals/events are divided
    in four groups. The label of the group is transferred as payload type, and type
    of signal inside the group is transferred as an event code. Transfer of signaling
    packets over the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) utilizes sequencing, numbering
    and timestamping provided by this protocol. Packets used to transfer the long
    lasting line signals are intensively transferred only after the change. Labelling
    of start and the end of signal is performed by marker fields in the header and
    payload. The reliability of transfer can be increased using the well-known methods
    of redundant transfer.</p>"
