abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To improve scalability of MPLS TE it may be useful to aggregate
    TE\nLSPs.  The aggregation is accomplished by (a) an LSR creating a TE\nLSP, (b)
    the LSR forming a forwarding adjacency out of that LSP\n(advertising this LSP
    as a link into ISIS/OSPF), (c) allowing other\nLSRs to use forwarding adjacencies
    for their path computation, and\n(d) nesting of LSPs originated by other LSRs
    into that LSP (by using\nthe label stack construct).\nThis document describes
    the mechanisms to accomplish this.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
