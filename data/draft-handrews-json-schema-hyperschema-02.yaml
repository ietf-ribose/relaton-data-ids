abstract:
- content: "<p>JSON Schema is a JSON-based format for describing JSON data using various
    vocabularies. This document specifies a vocabulary for annotating JSON documents
    with hyperlinks. These hyperlinks include attributes describing how to manipulate
    and interact with remote resources through hypermedia environments such as HTTP,
    as well as determining whether the link is usable based on the instance value.
    The hyperlink serialization format described in this document is also usable independent
    of JSON Schema.</p>"
