abstract:
- content: '<p>The address to which email is delivered might be different than any
    of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were created by
    the email''s author. For example, the address used by the email transport service
    is provided separately, such as through SMTP''s "RCPT TO" command, and might not
    match any address in the To: or cc: fields. In addition before final delivery,
    handling can entail a sequence of submission/delivery events, using a sequence
    of different destination addresses that (eventually) lead to the recipient. As
    well, a receiving system''s delivery process can produce local address transformations.
    It can be helpful for a message to have a common way to record each delivery in
    such a sequence, and to note each address used in the sequence to that recipient,
    such as for analyzing the path a message has taken, or for loop detection, or
    for formulating the author''s address in a reply message. This document defines
    a header field for this information. Email handling information discloses details
    about the email infrastructure, as well as about a particular recipient; this
    can raise privacy concerns. A header field such as this is not automatically assured
    of widespread use. Therefore this is being published as an Experiment, looking
    for constituency and for operational utility. The document is produced through
    the Independent RFC stream and was not subject to the IETF''s approval process.</p>'
