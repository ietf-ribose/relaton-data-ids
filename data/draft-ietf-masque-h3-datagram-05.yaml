abstract:
- content: "<p>The QUIC DATAGRAM extension provides application protocols running
    over QUIC with a mechanism to send unreliable data while leveraging the security
    and congestion-control properties of QUIC. However, QUIC DATAGRAM frames do not
    provide a means to demultiplex application contexts. This document describes how
    to use QUIC DATAGRAM frames when the application protocol running over QUIC is
    HTTP/3. It associates datagrams with client-initiated bidirectional streams and
    defines an optional additional demultiplexing layer. Additionally, this document
    defines how to convey datagrams over prior versions of HTTP.</p>"
