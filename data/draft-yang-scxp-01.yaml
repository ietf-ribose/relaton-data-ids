abstract:
- content: "<p>At present, various security components have appeared. All the security
    components should work together to establish a stronger defense architecture in
    the future, so it is necessary for these components to communicate with each other.
    This document describes the Security Components Exchange Protocol (SCXP), an application-level
    protocol for exchanging data between security components. SCXP supports mutual-authentication,
    integrity, confidentiality and replay protection over a connection-oriented protocol.</p>"
