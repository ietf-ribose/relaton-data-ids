abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) only supports session continuity for
    onebasic scenario of vertical handoff -- the transfer of all prefixesassigned
    from one interface to another. However, there are someother advanced scenarios
    associated with vertical handoff thatinvolves only transferring one (or some,
    but not all) of the prefixesthat are allocated to an existing interface to a newly
    powered oninterface. This draft outlines extensions to PMIPv6 protocol inorder
    for a multiple interfaced mobile node to achieve such partialvertical handoff
    of selected prefix(es).</p>"
