abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Voice messaging evolved as telephone answering service into a fullsend,
    receive, and forward messaging paradigm with unique messagefeatures, semantics
    and usage patterns. Voice messaging wasintroduced on special purpose computers
    that interface to a telephoneswitch and provide call answering and voice messaging
    services.Traditionally, messages sent from one voice messaging system toanother
    were transported using analog networking protocols based onDTMF signaling and
    analog voice playback. As the demand fornetworking increases, there was a need
    for a standard high-qualitydigital protocol to connect these machines. VPIM has
    successfullydemonstrated its usefulness as this new standard. VPIM is widelyimplemented
    and is seeing deployment in early adopter customernetworks. This document clarifies
    ambiguities found in the earlierspecification and is consistent with implementation
    practice. Theprofile is referred to as VPIM (Voice Profile for Internet Mail)
    inthis document.This second revision of the version 2 of obsoletes RFC 2421 whichless
    precisely describes version 2 of the profile.</p>"
