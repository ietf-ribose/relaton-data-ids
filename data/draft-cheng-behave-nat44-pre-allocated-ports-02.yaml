    are pre-allocated per subscriber. The NAT44 function isdeployed in carrier's networks
    also known as CGN. Three new RADIUSattributes are proposed to support that operation
    forconfiguration and billing purpose. Translation logging on aNAT44 device is
    significantly reduced with this operational model.</p>"
