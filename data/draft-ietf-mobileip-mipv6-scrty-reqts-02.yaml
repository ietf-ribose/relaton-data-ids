abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The IESG returned the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) draft to the working groupdue
    to concerns about the security and scalability of binding updates(BUs) sent to
    correspondent nodes and the associated IPsec processingthat is specified in the
    draft. Since that time discussions havecontinued to attempt to define what is
    really needed to make bindingupdates secure while taking into consideration the
    aspect ofscalability as well as the fact that IPsec may not be the mostsuitable
    security mechanism for securing BUs between MNs and CNs.</p>"
