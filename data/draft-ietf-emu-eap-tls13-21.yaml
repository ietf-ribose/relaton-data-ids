abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748,
    provides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication methods.
    This document specifies the use of EAP-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) with
    TLS 1.3 while remaining backwards compatible with existing implementations of
    EAP-TLS. TLS 1.3 provides significantly improved security and privacy, and reduced
    latency when compared to earlier versions of TLS. EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 (EAP-TLS
    1.3) further improves security and privacy by always providing forward secrecy,
    never disclosing the peer identity, and by mandating use of revocation checking,
    when compared to EAP-TLS with earlier versions of TLS. This document also provides
    guidance on authentication, authorization, and resumption for EAP-TLS in general
    (regardless of the underlying TLS version used). This document updates RFC 5216.</p>"
