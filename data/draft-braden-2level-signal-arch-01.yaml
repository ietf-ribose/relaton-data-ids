abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo defines an architectural framework for a wide variety
    ofInternet signaling protocols. This framework has a two-levelorganization: a
    common lower layer 'transport' protocol together witha suite of upper-level signaling
    protocols. The common lower levelprotocol CSTP (Common Signaling Transport Protocol)
    provides atransport-like service that may include reliable delivery and softstate
    management. The upper layer protocols, which implementalgorithms and data structures
    specific to particular signalingapplications, are generically called ULSPs (Upper-layer
    SignalingProtocols). This memo motivates the two-level design and describesthe
    service model, API, and operation of the lower level CSTP.</p>"
