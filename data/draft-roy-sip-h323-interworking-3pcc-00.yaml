abstract:
- content: "<p>This contribution describes a generalized interworking mechanism between
    SIP and H.323 for third party call control where the controller function can reside
    anywhere within the IP Telephony network. The proposed generalized interworking
    mechanism offers transparent IP Telephony services between the SIP and H.323 endpoints
    considering the third party call control function resides in a separate application
    server. The implementation of the third party call control function on a SIP proxy,
    SIP endpoint, H.323 GK, H.323 endpoint, MCU, or IWF is a special case of the generalized
    mechanism proposed in this document</p>"
