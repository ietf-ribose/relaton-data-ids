abstract:
  content: "<p>This contribution describes a generalized interworking mechanismbetween
    SIP and H.323 for third party call control where thecontroller function can reside
    anywhere within the IP Telephonynetwork. The proposed generalized interworking
    mechanism offerstransparent IP Telephony services between the SIP and H.323endpoints
    considering the third party call control function residesin a separate application
    server. The implementation of the thirdparty call control function on a SIP proxy,
    SIP endpoint, H.323 GK,H.323 endpoint, MCU, or IWF is a special case of the generalizedmechanism
    proposed in this document</p>"
