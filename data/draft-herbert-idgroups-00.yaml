abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a means to create logical identifier groups to
    manage identifiers in a mapping system for identifier-locator protocols. An identifier
    group consists of identifiers that have similar properties in the context of the
    mapping system. Identifier groups facilitate bulk operations on the mapping system
    that would affect multiple identifiers. A primary use case for this is to facilitate
    mobility of devices that are associated with possibly thousands or even millions
    of identifiers.</p>"
