abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is investigating\n
    \  mobile routing solutions for a worldwide Aeronautical\n   Telecommunications
    Network with Internet Protocol Services (ATN/IPS).\n   The ATN/IPS will eventually
    replace existing communication services\n   with an IPv6-based service supporting
    pervasive Air Traffic\n   Management (ATM) for Air Traffic Controllers (ATC),
    Airline\n   Operations Controllers (AOC), and all commercial aircraft worldwide.\n
    \  This informational document describes a simple and extensible mobile\n   routing
    service based on industry-standard BGP to address the ATN/IPS\n   requirements.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
