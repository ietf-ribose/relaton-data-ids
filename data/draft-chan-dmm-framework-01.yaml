abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a framework for mobility management protocols
    in terms of their key, abstract logical functions. We explain how the framework
    is capable of presenting a unified view, reducing the clutter that prevents a
    casual reader from understanding the commonalities between different approaches
    in mobility management. A first order application of this framework is to enable
    us to examine previously standardized mobility management protocols, such as MIPv6
    and PMIPv6 (as well as several of their extensions), and describe their core functionality
    in terms of different configurations of the logical functions defined by the framework.</p>"
