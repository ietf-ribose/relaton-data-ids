abstract:
- content: "<p>This document gives an overview of the IETF network management standards
    and summarizes existing and ongoing development of IETF Standards Track network
    management protocols and data models. The document refers to other overview documents,
    where they exist and classifies the standards for easy orientation. The purpose
    of this document is, on the one hand, to help system developers and users to select
    appropriate standard management protocols and data models to address relevant
    management needs. On the other hand, the document can be used as an overview and
    guideline by other Standard Development Organizations or bodies planning to use
    IETF management technologies and data models. This document does not cover Operations,
    Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) technologies on the data-path, e.g., OAM
    of tunnels, MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) OAM, and pseudowire as well as the
    corresponding management models. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
