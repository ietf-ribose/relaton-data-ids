abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In Information-centric network (ICN), everything is an identifiable\n
    \  object with a name such as a named data chunk.  Different from host-\n   centric
    connectivity, ICN connects named entities using name-based\n   routing and forwarding.
    \ At the same time, network entities, end\n   devices, and applications have variant
    demands to verify the\n   integrity, authenticity, and validation of these entities
    through\n   names.  This document proposes a generic naming schema, called PID,\n
    \  which supports security provenance, content lookup, routing, and\n   inter-domain
    resolution for ICN.  With PID schema, a name consists of\n   three components:
    principal(s), identifier(s), and domain(s).  In\n   this draft, we only illustrate
    the principles and concepts of PID and\n   the functional role of each component,
    and leave encoding approaches\n   as implementation options.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
