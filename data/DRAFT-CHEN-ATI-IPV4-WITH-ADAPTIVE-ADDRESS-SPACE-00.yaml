abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a solution to the Internet address
    depletion\n   issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part
    of\n   the original IPv4 protocol.  This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for\n
    \  Easy IPv4), discusses the IPv4 public address pool expansion and the\n   Internet
    system architecture enhancement aspects.  It was originated\n   by a study called
    ExIP (Extended IPv4) analyzing the use of the first\n   available octet (eight
    bits) in the reserved private network pools\n   (10/8, 172.16/12 and 192.168/16)
    to achieve a moderate address space\n   expansion factor of 256 by each, while
    maintaining their familiar\n   operation characteristics.  Along the way, a parallel
    yet similar\n   effort, called EnIP (Enhanced IPv4), was discovered.  EnIP fully\n
    \  utilizes the same private network pools to increase the address space\n   by
    a factor of 17.1M with end-to-end connectivity.  EzIP is a\n   superset that proposes
    one unified format for not only encompassing\n   the considerations of both, but
    also identifying additional\n   capabilities and flexibilities.  For example,
    EzIP may expand an IPv4\n   address at least by a factor of 256 to as high as
    256M without\n   affecting the existing IPv4 public address assignments, while
    still\n   keeping intact the current private networks for the 256M case if\n   desired.
    \ The EzIP is in full conformance with the IPv4 protocol, and\n   supports not
    only both categories of connectivity, but also their\n   interoperability.  The
    traditional Internet traffic and the IoT\n   operations may coexist simultaneously
    without perturbing their\n   existing setups, while offering end-users the freedom
    to choose one\n   or the other.  If the IPv4 public pool were reorganized, the\n
    \  assignable pool could be multiplied by 512M or even up to 2B times\n   with
    end-to-end connectivity.  EzIP may be deployed as a firmware\n   enhancement to
    the Internet edge routers or private network gateways\n   wherever needed, or
    simply installed as an inline adjunct module\n   between the two, enabling a seamless
    introduction.  The 256M case\n   establishes a spherical layer of routers providing
    a complete\n   interconnection between the Internet and end-users.  This\n   configuration
    enables the entire current Internet and private\n   networks characteristics to
    remain intact.  These proposed interim\n   facilities would afford IPv6 more time
    to orderly reach the maturity\n   and the availability levels required for delivering
    a long-term\n   general service.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
