abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF Routing Area director has chartered a design team
    to look at\n   common issues for the different data plane encapsulations being\n
    \  discussed in the NVO3 and SFC working groups and also in the BIER\n   BoF,
    and also to look at the relationship between such encapsulations\n   in the case
    that they might be used at the same time.  The purpose of\n   this design team
    is to discover, discuss and document considerations\n   across the different encapsulations
    in the different WGs/BoFs so that\n   we can reduce the number of wheels that
    need to be reinvented in the\n   future.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
