abstract:
- content: "<p>Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate changes
    to a common IMAP mailbox. Examples include different clients working on behalf
    of the same user, and multiple users accessing shared mailboxes. These clients
    need a mechanism to synchronize state changes for messages within the mailbox.
    They must be able to guarantee that only one client can change message state (e.g.,
    message flags) at any time. An example of such an application is use of an IMAP
    mailbox as a message queue with multiple dequeueing clients. The Conditional Store
    facility provides a protected update mechanism for message state information that
    can detect and resolve conflicts between multiple writing mail clients. The Conditional
    Store facility also allows a client to quickly resynchronize mailbox flag changes.
    This document additionally defines another IMAP extension, which gives an IMAP
    client the ability to quickly resynchronize any previously opened mailbox as part
    of the SELECT command, without the need for server-side state or additional client
    round-trips. This extension also introduces a new response that allows for a more
    compact representation of a list of expunged messages (and always includes the
    Unique Identifiers (UIDs) expunged).</p>"
