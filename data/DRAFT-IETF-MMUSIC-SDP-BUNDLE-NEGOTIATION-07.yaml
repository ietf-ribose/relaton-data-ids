abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a new SDP Grouping Framework extension,\n
    \  \"BUNDLE\", that can be used with the Session Description Protocol\n   (SDP)
    Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of bundled media,\n   which refers
    to the usage of a single 5-tuple for sending and\n   receiving media associated
    with multiple SDP media descriptions (\"m=\"\n   lines).\n\n   This specification
    also updates sections 5.1, 8.1 and 8.2 of RFC\n   3264, in order to allow an answerer
    to in an SDP answer assign a non-\n   zero port value to an \"m=\" line, even
    if the offerer in the\n   associated SDP offer had assigned a zero port value
    to the \"m=\" line.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
