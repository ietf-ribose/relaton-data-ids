abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP (RFC7252) comes with a conservative base congestion control\n
    \  scheme.  Advanced congestion control schemes can be defined where\n   better
    performance is desired for a certain area of application.\n\n   This document
    is a strawman for a set of questions that could be used\n   in qualifying a CoAP
    advanced congestion control scheme.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
