abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) allows clients to synchronize
    to a\n   time server using timestamped protocol messages. To faciliate\n   accurate
    timestamping, some implementations use hardware-based\n   timestamping engines
    that integrate the accurate transmission time\n   into every outgoing NTP packet
    during transmission. Since these\n   packets are transported over UDP, the UDP
    checksum field is then\n   updated to reflect this modification. This document
    proposes an\n   extension field that includes a 2-octet Checksum Trailer, allowing\n
    \  timestamping engines to reflect the checksum modification in the last\n   2
    octets of the packet rather than in the UDP checksum field. The\n   behavior defined
    in this document is interoperable with existing NTP\n   implementations.\n\n\t
