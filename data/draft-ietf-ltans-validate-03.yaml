abstract:
- content: "<p>Digitally signed documents and data in a LTANS service receive the
    signature renwal procedures and non-repudiation services. As documents can be
    stored for very long (theoretically inifinite) times, it is very important to
    understand which data is and will be necessary for the verification of the contained
    digital signatures and the applied timestamps and the evidence records. This document
    shall describe various pieces of information which SHOULD and MUST be provided
    to effectively verify evidence records and their protected data and signatures.</p>"
