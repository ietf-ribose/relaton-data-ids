abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile multicast is a research hotspot. Some mobile multicast schemes
    was proposed, but most of them depend on the traditional group membership management
    protocol and concern on the reconstruction of multicast delivery tree by various
    algorithms, and they little consider the mobile group membership management. So
    in this memo, we extend the MLD protocol to support the mobile multicast group
    management. The extension is compatible with the traditional MLD protocols, and
    it can also be applied to the IGMP protocol to manage the mobile multicast in
    IPv4.</p>"
