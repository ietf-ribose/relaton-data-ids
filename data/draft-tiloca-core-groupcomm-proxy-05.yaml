abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the operations performed by a proxy, when using
    the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) in group communication scenarios.
    Such a proxy processes a single request sent by a client over unicast, and distributes
    the request over IP multicast to a group of servers. Then, the proxy collects
    the individual responses from those servers and relays those responses back to
    the client, in a way that allows the client to distinguish the responses and their
    origin servers through embedded addressing information. This document updates
    RFC7252 with respect to caching of response messages at proxies.</p>"
