abstract:
- content: "<p>Sometimes, a DNS name is known to be in use in the wild even though
    it was never properly delegated. This situation appears particularly, but not
    only, true in certain domains near the root of the tree: people have independently
    used those non-existent top-level domains as private namespaces. If those names
    are to be delegated in the public DNS, prudence dictates that collisions between
    the private uses and the public use be minimized. We outline a procedure to evaluate
    the harm of delegation.</p>"
