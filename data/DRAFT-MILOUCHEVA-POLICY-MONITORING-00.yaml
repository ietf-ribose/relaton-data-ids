abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In order to enhance the policy provisioning and QoS guarantees,
    \n   policy  monitoring and context learning facilities are used.\n   This document
    is focussed on facilities for monitoring and learning\n   of context integrated
    in autonomous policy management system for \n   enhanced user-centric Quality
    of Service (QoS) guarantees in\n   heterogeneous Internet environment.     \n
    \  The autonomous policy management includes components aimed \n   at automation
    of QoS policy specification, provisioning and \n   adaptation based on common
    policy repository.\n   Integration of monitoring and context learning facilities
    allows\n   to consider measurement and context data for more efficient \n   policy
    provisioning and adaptation.\n   The goal is to collect measurement and context
    information, in order\n   to support automated policy decision and adaptation
    of actor's policies,\n   when specific events (patterns) are detected in a given
    network context.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
