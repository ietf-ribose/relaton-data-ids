abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft proposes a distributed local mobility anchorsarchitecture.
    It splits the functions of a local mobility anchorinto different logical functions:
    (1) allocation of home networkprefixes or home addresses to mobile nodes, (2)
    location management(LM) which includes managing the IP addresses and locations
    of themobile nodes, and (3) mobility routing (MR) which includesintercepting and
    forwarding packets. The distributed local mobilityanchors architecture consists
    of home local mobility anchors (H-LMA)at the registered networks and visited local
    mobility anchors (V-LMA)at the visited networks. The V-LMA provides mobility routingfunction
    to avoid triangle routing problem in Proxy mobile IP,whereas the H-LMA keeps the
    location management function. The neededlocation information of a mobile node
    is acquired by a V-LMA from theH-LMA only when a packet is first sent to the mobile
    node via theV-LMA and are then cached at the V-LMA to enable optimized mobilityrouting
    for packets subsequently sent to the mobile node.When either the source or the
    destination node is a fixed node,bypassing the tunneling role of all LMA's will
    expose the locationinformation of the mobile node in some cases. Yet unnecessarily
    longroutes are still avoid by having multiple V-LMA's in differentnetworks and
    serving the packet transport with the nearest V-LMA.</p>"
