abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the architecture of the eduroam service for
    federated (wireless) network access in academia. The combination of 802.1X, EAP
    and RADIUS that is used in eduroam provides a secure, scalable and deployable
    service for roaming network access. The successful deployment of eduroam over
    the last decade in the educational sector may serve as an example for other sectors,
    hence this document. In particular the initial architectural and standards choices
    and the changes that were prompted by operational experience are highlighted.</p>"
