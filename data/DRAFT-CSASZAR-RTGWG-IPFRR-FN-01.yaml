abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the benefits and main applications
    of sending\n   explicit fast notification (FN) packets to routers in an area.
    FN\n   packets are generated and processed in the dataplane, and a single FN\n
    \  service can substitute existing OAM methods for remote failure\n   detection,
    such as a full mesh of multi-hop BFD session. The FN\n   service, therefore, decreases
    network overhead considerable. The main\n   application is fast reroute in pure
    IP and in IP/LDP-MPLS networks\n   called IPFRR-FN. The detour paths used when
    IPFRR-FN is active are in\n   most cases identical to those used after Interior
    Gateway Protocol\n   (IGP) convergence. The proposed mechanism can address all
    single\n   link, node, and SRLG failures in an area; moreover it is an efficient\n
    \  solution to protect against BGP ASBR failures as well as VPN PE\n   router
    failures. IPFRR-FN can be a supplemental tool to provide FRR\n   when LFA cannot
    repair a failure case, while it can be a replacement\n   of existing ASBR/PE protection
    mechanisms by overcoming their\n   scalability and complexity issues.\n\n\t </p>\n
