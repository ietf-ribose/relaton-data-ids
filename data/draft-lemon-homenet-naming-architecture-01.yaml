abstract:
- content: "<p>This document recommends a naming and service discovery resolution
    architecture for homenets. This architecture covers local and global publication
    of names, discusses security and privacy implications, and addresses those implications.
    The architecture also covers name resolution and service discovery for hosts on
    the homenet, and for hosts that roam off of the homenet and still need access
    to homenet services.</p>"
