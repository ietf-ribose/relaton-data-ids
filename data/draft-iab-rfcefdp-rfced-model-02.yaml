abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes updated processes for defining and implementing
    policies regarding the RFC Series. As specified here, the model divides the responsibilities
    for the RFC Series into two high-level functions: policy definition governing
    the RFC Series as a whole, and policy implementation for publication of documents
    in the RFC Series. The policy definition function is the responsibility of the
    RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces policy proposals that are subject
    to approval by the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB). The policy implementation
    function is primarily the responsibility of the RFC Production Center (RPC), under
    the ultimate authority of the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF
    LLC). This document reflects experience gained with version 1 of the RFC Editor
    Model as specified in RFC 5620 and with version 2 as specified in RFC 6635 and
    RFC 8728. This document obsoletes RFC 8728.</p>"
