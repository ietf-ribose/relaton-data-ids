abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The two key issues of today's Internet are autonomy and\n   extensibility.
    Autonomous Internet(AIP) technology can provide\n   extensible internet architecture,
    own independent root DNS servers\n   and self management internet network; Furthermore,
    based on the\n   Autonomous Internet, here provides a way with extensible address\n
    \  capacity to solve IP address deficiency and realize\n   Autonomous Extensible
    Internet(AEIP) with global network address\n   and multiplexing local network
    address. This AEIP with Network\n   Address Multiplexing(AEIP NAM) can realize
    autonomy and extensibility\n   with minimal cost.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
