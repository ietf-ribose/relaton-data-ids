abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface
    (GSS-\n   API), as defined in RFC-1508, provides security services to callers\n
    \  in a generic fashion, supportable with a range of underlying\n   mechanisms
    and technologies and hence allowing source-level\n   portability of applications
    to different environments. It defines\n   GSS-API services and primitives at a
    level independent of underlying\n   mechanism and programming language environment.\n
    \n   The GSSAPI allows a caller application to authenticate a principal\n   identity
    associated with a peer application, to delegate rights to a\n   peer, and to apply
    security services such as confidentiality and\n   integrity on a per-message basis.\n
    \n   The primitives of the GSS-API do not currently allow support of\n   security
    attributes other than a single identity and do not allow\n   fine control of delegation.\n
    \n   The additional primitives described in this document provide support\n   for:\n
    \n   * the exchange of a variety of security attributes, and the\n   construction
    of authorization functions using these attributes,\n   including delegated ones,
    (attribute handling support functions),\n\n   * fine control over delegation by
    allowing specification of the\n   delegation method, the acceptor(s) of a security
    context, their type\n   and the restrictions that may apply (acceptor control
    and support\n   functions).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
