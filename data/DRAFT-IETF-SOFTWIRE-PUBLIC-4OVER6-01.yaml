abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When the service provider networks are upgraded to IPv6, IPv4\n
    \  connectivity will still be demanded by network users, at least in the\n   recent
    future.  This draft proposes a mechanism for end hosts or\n   networks in IPv6
    access networks to build bidirectional IPv4\n   communication with the IPv4 Internet.
    \ The mechanism follows the\n   softwire hub and spoke model, and uses IPv4-over-IPv6
    tunnel as basic\n   method to traverse IPv6 network.  The bi-directionality of
    end-to-end\n   communication is achieved by allocating public IPv4 addresses to
    end\n   hosts/networks.  This mechanism is an IPv4 access method for network\n
    \  users in IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
