abstract:
- content: "<p>Researchers proposed DNS cache poisoning attacks using IP fragmentation.
    This document shows feasible and adequate measures at full-service resolvers against
    these attacks. To protect resolvers from these attacks, avoid fragmentation (limit
    requestor's UDP payload size to 1220/1232), drop fragmented UDP DNS responses
    and use TCP at resolver side.</p>"
