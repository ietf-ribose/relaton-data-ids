abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In traditional telecommunication system, operators usually
    provide\n   general and limited security protection service for users during\n
    \  access (e.g. AKA in 3G/4G network). Now, with the development of\n   network
    virtualization technology and data center, physical network\n   devices can be
    replaced by network function softwares which are\n   running on virtual machines
    and the network function can be flexible\n   and elastic. Operators can provide
    users with more security services.\n   So this interfaces between operator's network
    and users are highly\n   desired.  These interfaces will be used to request/achieve
    (Virtual)\n   Network Security Functions from operator's network. This draft\n
    \  describes use cases for using the interface in operator's network\n   environment.\n\n\t
