abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a mechanism
    to load\n   balance traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).  An ingress Label\n
    \  Switching Router (LSR) cannot insert ELs for packets going into a\n   given
    tunnel unless an egress LSR has indicated via signaling that it\n   has the capability
    of processing ELs, referred to as Entropy Label\n   Capability (ELC), on that
    tunnel.  In addition, it would be useful\n   for ingress LSRs to know each LSR's
    capability of reading the maximum\n   label stack depth and performing EL-based
    load-balancing, referred to\n   as Entropy Readable Label Depth (ERLD), in the
    cases where stacked\n   LSPs are used for whatever reasons.  This document defines
    mechanisms\n   to signal these two capabilities using OSPF.  These mechanisms
    are\n   useful when the label advertisement is also done via OSPF.  In\n   addition,
    this document introduces the Non-IGP Functional\n   Capabilities TLV for advertising
    OSPF router's actual non-IGP\n   functional capabilities.  ELC is one of such
    non-IGP functional\n   capabilities.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
