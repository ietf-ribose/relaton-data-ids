abstract:
- content: "<p>At the first meeting of the proposed Path Aware Networking Research
    Group, Oliver Bonaventure led a discussion of our mostly-unsuccessful attempts
    to exploit Path Awareness to achieve a variety of goals, over the past decade.
    At the end of that discussion, the research group agreed to catalog and analyze
    these ideas, to extract insights and lessons for path-aware networking researchers.
    This document contains that catalog and analysis.</p>"
