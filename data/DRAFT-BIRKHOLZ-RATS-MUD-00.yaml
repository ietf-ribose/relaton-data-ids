abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) files and the MUD URI
    that point\n   to them are defined in RFC 8520.  This document introduces a new
    type\n   of MUD file to be delivered in conjunction with a MUD file signature\n
    \  and/or to be referenced via a MUD URI embedded in an IEEE 802.1AR\n   Secure
    Device Identifier (DevID).  A DevID is a device specific pub-\n   key identity
    document that can be presented to other entities, e.g. a\n   network management
    system.  If this entity is also a verifier as\n   defined by the IETF Remote ATtestation
    procedureS (RATS)\n   architecture, this verifier can use the references found
    in the MUD\n   file specified in this document in order to discover appropriate\n
    \  Reference Integrity Measurements (RIM), Endorsement Documents, or\n   even
    globally suitable Remote Attestation Services (RAS).  All three\n   types of theses
    resources are required to conduct RATS.  Hence, the\n   MUD file defined in this
    document enables remote attestation\n   procedures by supporting the discovery
    of these required resources or\n   services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
