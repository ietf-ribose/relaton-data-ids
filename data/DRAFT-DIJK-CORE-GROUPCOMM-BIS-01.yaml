abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the use of the Constrained Application\n
    \  Protocol (CoAP) for group communication, using UDP/IP multicast as\n   the
    underlying data transport.  The target application area is any\n   group communication
    use cases in resource-constrained networks.  Both\n   unsecured and secured CoAP
    group communication are specified.\n   Security is achieved by use of the Group
    Object Security for\n   Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE) protocol.
    \ Aspects of\n   operation of using multicast CoAP in combination with CoAP block-wise\n
    \  transfers and CoAP observe are also specified.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
