abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies Echo protocol, that was firstly defined
    in\nRFC 862.  However that document does not match current Internet\nStandards
    and specifies Echo protocol for TCP and UDP only, while a\nnumber of other transport-layer
    protocols have appeared since the\ntime of publication of RFC 862. \n\nThis document
    aligns Echo protocol specification with the current\nInternet Standards and specifies
    Echo protocol for the most wide-\nspread transport-layer protocols.  It obsoletes
    RFC 347 and RFC 862\nand moves the last to Historic status.\n\t </p>\n      "
