  content: "\n\t <p>This draft is the product of Group B, which is one of, at least,
    two\nsubgroups in the IRTF-Routing Research Group working on requirements\nfor
    routing solutions for the future.  This document sets out a set\nof requirements
    that we believe are important for the future routing\narchitecture and future
    routing protocols.  It should be noted that\nthe IRTF-Routing Research group does
    not endorse this set of\nrequirements or any other set of requirements as the
    one and only set\nof requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
