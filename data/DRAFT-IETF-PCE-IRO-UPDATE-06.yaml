abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides\n   for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a
    PCE,\n   or between two PCEs.  RFC 5440 defines the Include Route Object (IRO)\n
    \  to specify network elements to be traversed in the computed path.\n   The specification
    did not specify if the IRO contains an ordered or\n   un-ordered list of sub-objects.
    \ During recent discussions, it was\n   determined that there was a need to define
    a standard representation\n   to ensure interoperability.\n\n   An informal survey
    was conducted to determine the state of current\n   and planned implementations
    with respect to IRO ordering and the\n   handling of an attribute of the IRO's
    sub-object, the Loose hop bit\n   (L bit).\n\n   This document updates RFC 5440
    regarding the IRO specification, based\n   on the survey conclusion and recommendation.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
