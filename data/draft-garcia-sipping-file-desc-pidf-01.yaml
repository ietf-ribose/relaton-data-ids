    presence information, typically towards presenceagents. PIDF has been extended
    to provide rich presence information,including, for example, the location of the
    presentity, theiractivities, mood, the capabilities of their user agents, etc.Presentities
    are willing to provide the description of availablefiles at watcher's disposal.
    This might be the case for photographstaken with a mobile device, a recorded lecture

    for thedescription of files within the PIDF.</p>"
