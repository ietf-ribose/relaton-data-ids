abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In networks with routers of different capabilities, some routers
    may\n   not be able to participate fully in supporting new features or\n   handling
    large databases and the associated flooding.  In some cases,\n   these restrictions
    can cause severe scalability issues for the\n   network in general.  This document
    proposes virtual multi-instances,\n   a generic mechanism for OSPF and IS-IS,
    that allows groups of routers\n   in specific topologies to have a reduced database
    and reduces the\n   topology changes that are seen.  The virtual multi-instances
    are\n   specified so that no software or protocol changes are required in the\n
    \  restricted routers.  Due to the potential number of virtual multi-\n   instances
    in a network, the configuration is limited and is not\n   specified per virtual
    instance.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
