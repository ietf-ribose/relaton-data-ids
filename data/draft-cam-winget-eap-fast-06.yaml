abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
    based Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST) protocol. EAP-FAST
    is an EAP method that enables secure communication between a peer and a server
    by using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a mutually authenticated
    tunnel. Within the tunnel, Type-Length-Value (TLV) objects are used to convey
    authentication related data between the peer and the EAP server. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
