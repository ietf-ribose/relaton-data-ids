abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN technology to enable it
    to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications that are associated
    with 5G services. These applications require better isolation and have more stringent
    performance requirements than can be provided with overlay VPNs. The characteristics
    of an enhanced VPN as perceived by its tenant needs to be comparable to those
    of a dedicated private network. This requires tight integration between the overlay
    VPN and the underlay network resources in a scalable manner. An enhanced VPN may
    form the underpin of 5G network slicing, but will also be of use in its own right.
    This document describes the use of segment routing based mechanisms to provide
    the enhanced VPN service with dedicated underlay network resources.</p>"
