abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Unknown key-share attacks are a class of attacks that allow
    an\n   attacker to deceive one peer of a secure communication as to the\n   identity
    of the remote peer.  When used with traditional, PKI-based\n   authentication,
    TLS-based applications are generally safe from\n   unknown key-share attacks.
    \ DNS-based Authentication of Named\n   Entities (DANE), however, proposes that
    applications perform a\n   different set of checks as part of authenticating a
    TLS connection.\n   As a result, DANE as currently specified is likely to lead
    to unknown\n   key-share attacks when clients support DANE for authentication.
    \ We\n   describe these risks and some simple mitigations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
