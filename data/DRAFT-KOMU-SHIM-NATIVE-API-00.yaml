abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes extensions to the current networking
    APIs for\n   protocols based on identifier/locator split.  Currently, the document\n
    \  focuses on HIP, but the extensions can be used also by other\n   protocols
    similar \"shim\" layer protocols.  Using the API extensions,\n   new SHIM aware
    applications can gain a better control of the SHIM\n   layer and endpoint identifiers.
    \ For example, the applications can\n   query and set SHIM related attributes,
    or specify their own endpoint\n   identifiers for a host.  In addition, a new
    indirection element\n   called endpoint descriptor is defined for SHIM aware applications.\n\t
