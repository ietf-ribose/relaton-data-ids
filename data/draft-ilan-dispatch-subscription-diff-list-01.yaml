abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP SIMPLE work group has defined several improvements to SIP Presence
    event notification model, such as subscription to a list of resources in the body
    of single SUBSCRIBE request, and Resource List Server (RLS) to create subscription
    to resource list identified by a URI. This document presents an extension to incrementally
    update resource list contained in the body of subscription requests for SIP presence.
    The document defines semantics for creating incremental changes to resource list
    that are carried in requests for subscription refreshes. This enables reduction
    in the number of messages exchanged for subscriptions in large network of inter-
    connected SIP based presence servers.</p>"
