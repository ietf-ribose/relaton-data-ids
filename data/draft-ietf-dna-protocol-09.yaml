abstract:
- content: "<p>In this memo, a mechanism that was developed for detection of network
    attachement is documented for future reference. This memo is an informational
    document and thus does not define a new standard. The mechanism proposed in this
    experimental RFC requires the hosts to monitor all the prefixes advertised on
    the link and use it for link identification in the presence of non-DNAv6 routers
    is presented. A more efficient link-identification mechanism requiring the DNAv6
    routers to monitor the link for advertised prefixes to assist the hosts in link
    identification combined with a fast router advertisement mechanism that selects
    the order of response for the router deterministically is also presented.</p>"
