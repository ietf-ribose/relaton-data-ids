abstract:
  content: "<p>In this memo, a mechanism that was developed for detection of networkattachement
    is documented for future reference. This memo is aninformational document and
    thus does not define a new standard. Themechanism proposed in this experimental
    RFC requires the hosts tomonitor all the prefixes advertised on the link and use
    it for linkidentification in the presence of non-DNAv6 routers is presented. Amore
    efficient link-identification mechanism requiring the DNAv6routers to monitor
    the link for advertised prefixes to assist thehosts in link identification combined
    with a fast routeradvertisement mechanism that selects the order of response for
    therouter deterministically is also presented.</p>"
