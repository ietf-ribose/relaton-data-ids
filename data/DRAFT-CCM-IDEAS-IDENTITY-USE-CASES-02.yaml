    Identity\n   (IDy) into networking.  An IDy represents a high-level identifier\n
    \  representing a collection of identifiers of a device, node, or\n   process
    used for communication purposes.  It is used for\n   authentication purposes and
    never revealed in data plane packets.\n   This document summarizes some conceptual
    use cases to illustrate the\n   usefulness of IDEAS.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
