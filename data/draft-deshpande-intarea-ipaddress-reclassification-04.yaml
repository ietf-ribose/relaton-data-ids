abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes IP address reclassification. By understanding how
    the Network is evolving from wireless technologies and comparing with an abstract
    mathematical topological space model, changes such as addition of a Virtual address
    space and Virtual BGP neighborship are proposed. The limitations of current Internet
    Architecture are identified and the corrections needed for the traffic bottleneck
    present in the current Internet Architecture are described further. The interdependence
    of IPv6 ULA addressing scheme, multipath and multipath TCP with the virtual neighborship
    and the virtual address space are explored.</p>"
