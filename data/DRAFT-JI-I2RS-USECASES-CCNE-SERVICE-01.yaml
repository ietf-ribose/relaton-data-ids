abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As network expand bridging access, Data Center and WAN, more
    networks\n   have a central control point for the network elements in one\n   administrative
    domain.  This document defines that network device as\n   central control network
    element (CCNE).  The CCNE can be RR Router,\n   PCE Server, or a federation of
    RR Router and PCE Server, or other\n   devices.  This document describes use case
    where the CCNE can utilize\n   both these the traditional functions and the programmatic
    Interface\n   to Routing System (I2RS) to communicate with devices in the network.\n
    \  The I2RS use cases described in this document encompass: Control IP\n   Network
    by RR Router, Control MPLS TE Network by PCE Server.\n\n   The goal of this document
    is to inform the community's understanding\n   of how CCNE extensions fit within
    the overall I2RS architecture.  It\n   is intended to provide a basis for the
    solutions draft describing the\n   set of interfaces for the CCNE device.\n\n\n\t
