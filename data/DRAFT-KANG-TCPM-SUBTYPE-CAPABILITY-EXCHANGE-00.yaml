abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple\n
    \  paths between peers.  MPTCP protocol defines seven subtypes in MPTCP\n   v0
    [RFC6824] and ten subtypes in MPTCP v1 [RFC8684] to differentiate\n   message
    types and implement some additional functions during a\n   session.\n\n   This
    draft proposes an enhancement to support Subtype Capability\n   Exchange during
    MPTCP connection establishment in order to improve\n   elastic scalability of
    MPTCP protocol.  It includes: 1) requirements\n   for which this kind of capability
    exchange during handshake is\n   important for a MPTCP session; 2) a typical flow
    for Subtype\n   Capability Exchange between peers; 3) a feasible solution on protocol\n
    \  design is suggested.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
