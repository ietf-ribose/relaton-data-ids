abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data leaks are a serious privacy problem for Internet users.
    \ Data in\n   flight and at rest can be protected with traditional communications\n
    \  security and data encryption.  Protecting data in use is more\n   difficult.
    \ In addition, failure to protect data in use can lead to\n   disclosing session
    or encryption keys needed for protecting data in\n   flight or at rest.\n\n   This
    document discusses the use of Confidential Computing, to reduce\n   the risk of
    leaks from data in use.  Our example use case is in the\n   context of DNS resolution
    services.  The document looks at the\n   operational implications of running services
    in a way that even the\n   owner of the service or compute platform cannot access
    user-specific\n   information produced by the resolution process.\n\n\t </p>\n
