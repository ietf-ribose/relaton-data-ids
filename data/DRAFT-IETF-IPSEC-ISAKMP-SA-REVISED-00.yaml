abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>ISAKMP/OAKLEY [2][3] is the key management protocol defined by
    IPSEC\n   working to be a framework for authentication, security association\n
    \  negotiation and key management. The protocol defines two phases\n   whereby,
    in the phase 1, the peers are authenticates, the security\n   association (SA)
    for ISAKMP/Oakley, and keying material is agreed\n   upon by the peers to secure
    ISAKMP messages. The phase 2 is used to\n   negotiate security association for
    security applications (e.g.,\n   IPSEC AH and ESP). When perfect forward secrecy
    is required, phase 2\n   is also used to exchange keying material for the application.\n
    \  However, when perfect forward secrecy is not a requirement, the\n   keying
    material from the phase 1 is used to generate session keys\n   for the secure
    communication applications.\n \n   The proposal in this document is based on the
    observation that when\n   perfect forward secrecy is not a requirement, if application\n
    \  specific SA was negotiated during phase 1, the application can start\n   immediately
    after phase 1. The phase 2 can be used subsequently for\n   key refresh on per
    need bases in the future. Therefore, this\n   proposal reduces startup time for
    communication and improves the\n   efficiency of the protocol.\n \n   Remark:
    This document is NOT self-contained, it is intended as an\n   addendum to [2][3].
    Thus, it is best read in conjunction with\n   [2][3].\n\t </p>\n      "
