abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services\n
    \  mechanisms to support the next generation of emergency calls placed\n   by
    vehicles (automatically in the event of a crash or serious\n   incident, or manually
    invoked by a vehicle occupant) and conveying\n   vehicle, sensor, and location
    data related to the crash or incident.\n   Such calls are often referred to as
    \"Automatic Crash Notification\"\n   (ACN), or \"Advanced Automatic Crash Notification\"
    (AACN), even in the\n   case of manual trigger.  The \"Advanced\" qualifier refers
    to the\n   ability to carry a richer set of data.\n\n   This document also registers
    a MIME media type and Emergency Call\n   Additional Data Block for the vehicle,
    sensor, and location data\n   (often referred to as \"crash data\" even though
    there is not\n   necessarily a crash) and an INFO package to enable carrying this
    and\n   related data in INFO requests.  An external specification for the\n   data
    format, contents, and structure are referenced in this document.\n\n   This document
    reuses the technical aspects of next-generation pan-\n   European eCall (a mandated
    and standardized system for emergency\n   calls by in-vehicle systems within Europe
    and other regions).\n   However, this document specifies a different set of vehicle
    (crash)\n   data, specifically, the Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS) rather than\n
    \  the eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD).  This document is an extension\n   of
    the eCall document, with the primary differences being that this\n   document
    makes the MSD data set optional and VEDS mandatory, and adds\n   attribute values
    to the metadata/control object to permit greater\n   functionality.  This document
    registers a new INFO package (identical\n   to that registered for eCall but with
    the addition of the VEDS MIME\n   type).  This document also describes legacy
    (circuit-switched) ACN\n   systems and their migration to next-generation emergency
    calling, to\n   provide background information and context.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
