abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet Draft proposes a mechanism to encode relevant
    data for\n   NS records on the parental side of a zone cut by encoding them in
    DS\n   records based on a new DNSKEY algorithm.\n\n   Since DS records are signed
    by the parent, this creates a method for\n   validation of the otherwise unsigned
    delegation records.\n\n   Notably, support for updating DS records in a parent
    zone is already\n   present (by necessity) in the Registry-Registrar-Registrant
    (RRR)\n   provisioning system, EPP.  Thus, no changes to the EPP protocol are\n
    \  needed, and no changes to registry database or publication systems\n   upstream
    of the DNS zones published by top level domains (TLDs).\n\n   This NS validation
    mechanism is beneficial if the name server _names_\n   need to be validated prior
    to use.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
