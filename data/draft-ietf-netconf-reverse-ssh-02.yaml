abstract:
- content: <p>This memo presents a technique for a NETCONF server to initiate a SSH
    connection to a NETCONF client. This is accomplished by the NETCONF client listening
    on IANA-assigned TCP port YYYY and starting the SSH client protocol immediately
    after accepting a TCP connection on it. This role-reversal is necessary as the
    NETCONF server must also be the SSH Server, in order for the NETCONF client to
    open the IANA- assigned SSH subsystem "netconf".</p>
