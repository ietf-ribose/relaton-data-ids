abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Pseudowires (PWs) are used in MPLS networks for various services\n
    \  including carrying layer 2 and layer 3 data packets.  This document\n   describes
    the procedure for encapsulation of the Simple Two-Way\n   Active Measurement Protocol
    (STAMP) defined in RFC 8762 and its\n   optional extensions defined in RFC 8972
    for PWs in MPLS networks.\n   The procedure uses PW Generic Associated Channel
    (G-ACh) to\n   encapsulate the STAMP test packets with or without an IP/UDP header.\n\n\t
