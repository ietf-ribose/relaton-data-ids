abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the use of the Quick-Start mechanism by
    the \nDatagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  DCCP is a transport \nprotocol
    that allows the transmission of congestion-controlled, \nunreliable datagrams.
    \ DCCP is intended for applications such as \nstreaming media, Internet telephony,
    and on-line games.  In DCCP, an \napplication has a choice of congestion control
    mechanisms, each \nspecified by a Congestion Control Identifier (CCID). This document
    \nspecifies general procedures applicable to all DCCP CCIDs and \nspecific procedures
    for the use of Quick-Start with DCCP CCID-2 and \nCCID-3.  Quick-Start enables
    a DCCP sender to cooperate with any \nQuick-Start routers along the end-to-end
    path to determine an \nallowed sending rate at the start and, at times, in the
    middle of a \nDCCP connection (e.g., after an idle or application-limited period).
    \ \nThe present specification is provided for use in controlled \nenvironments,
    and not as a mechanism that would be intended or \nappropriate for ubiquitous
    deployment in the global Internet.\n\t </p>\n      "
