abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that\n
    \  provides optimal multicast forwarding through a \"multicast domain\",\n   without
    requiring intermediate routers to maintain any per-flow state\n   or to engage
    in an explicit tree-building protocol.  There may be\n   some routers which could
    not support BIER technology (We name them as\n   non-BIER node in this document)
    in the BIER domain when deployed.\n   This document specifies a solution for the
    BIER packet transiting the\n   non-BIER nodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
