abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The data model defined in RFC 8345 introduces vertical layering\n
    \  relationships between networks that can be augmented to cover network\n   and
    service topologies.  This document defines a YANG module for both\n   network
    performance monitoring (PM) and VPN service performance\n   monitoring that can
    be used to monitor and manage network performance\n   on the topology at higher
    layer or the service topology between VPN\n   sites.\n\n   The YANG model defined
    in this document is designed as an\n   augmentation to the network topology YANG
    model defined in RFC 8345\n   and draws on relevant YANG types defined in RFC
    6991, RFC 8345, and\n   RFC 8532.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
