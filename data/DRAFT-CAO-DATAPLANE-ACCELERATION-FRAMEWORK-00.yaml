abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is getting popular to running data applications over general\n
    \  purpose hardware/chipsets, instead of customized and dedicated\n   hardware/chipset.
    \ This way further decouples the software functions\n   from the hardware.  But
    moving data processing intensive applications\n   to general purpose hardware
    is still challenging, although the\n   industry has supplied some proprietary
    solutions.  This document\n   discusses the problems of data plane acceleration
    and proposes its\n   framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
