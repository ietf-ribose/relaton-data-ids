abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The VPWS service [L2VPN Framework] provides point-to-point \n
    \   connections between pairs of Customer Edge (CE) devices.  It does \n    so
    by binding two Attachment Circuits (each connecting a CE device \n    with a Provider
    Edge, PE, device) to a Pseudowire (connecting the \n    two PEs).  In general,
    the Attachment Circuits must be of the same \n    technology (e.g., both ethernet,
    both ATM), and the Pseudowire must \n    carry the frames of that technology.
    \ However, if it is known that \n    the frames' payload consists solely of IP
    datagrams, it is possible \n    to provide a point-to-point connection in which
    the Pseudowire \n    connects Attachment Circuits of different technologies.  This
    \n    requires the PEs to perform a function known as 'ARP Mediation'.  \n    This
    document specifies the ARP Mediation function, and specifies \n                 draft-shah-l2vpn-arp-mediation-03.txt
    \n  \n    the encapsulation used to carry the IP datagrams on the Pseudowires
    \n    when ARP mediation is used.\n\t </p>\n      "
