abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes some circumstances that are common in SIP\ndeployments
    which lack a rigorous authorization model, and points out\nsome ways in which
    this has resulted in poor security\ncharacteristics.\n\nThe purpose of this document
    is to stimulate discussion of the\nidentified problem and proposed requirements
    for any solution.\n\nComments are solicited, and should be directed to the DISPATCH\nworking
    group list at 'dispatch@ietf.org'.\n\t </p>\n      "
