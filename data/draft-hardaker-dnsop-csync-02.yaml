abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how a child zone in the DNS can publish a record
    to indicate to a parental agent that it may copy and process certain records from
    the child zone. The existence and change of the record may be monitored by a parental
    agent, after which the parent may act on the data appropriately.</p>"
