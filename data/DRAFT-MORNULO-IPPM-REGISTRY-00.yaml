abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo investigates a scheme to organize registry entries,\n
    \  especially those defined in RFCs prepared in the IP Performance\n   Metrics
    (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF, and applicable to all IETF\n   metrics.  Three
    aspects make IPPM metric registration difficult: (1)\n   Use of the Type-P notion
    to allow users to specify their own packet\n   types. (2) Use of flexible input
    variables, called Parameters in IPPM\n   definitions, some which determine the
    quantity measured and others\n   which should not be specified until execution
    of the measurement. (3)\n   Allowing flexibility in choice of statistics to summarize
    the results\n   on a stream of measurement packets.  Specifically, this memo proposes\n
    \  a way to organize registry entries into columns that are well-\n   defined,
    permiting consistent development of entries over time.\n   Also, this fosters
    development of registry entries based on existing\n   reference RFCs for performance
    metrics, and requires expert review\n   for every entry before IANA action.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
