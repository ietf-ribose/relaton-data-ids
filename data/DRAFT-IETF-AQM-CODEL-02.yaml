abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a general framework called CoDel (Controlled\n
    \  Delay) [CODEL2012] that controls bufferbloat-generated excess delay\n   in
    modern networking environments.  CoDel consists of an estimator, a\n   setpoint,
    and a control loop.  It requires no configuration in normal\n   Internet deployments.
    \ CoDel comprises some major technical\n   innovations and has been made available
    as open source so that the\n   framework can be applied by the community to a
    range of problems.  It\n   has been implemented in Linux (and available in the
    Linux\n   distribution) and deployed in some networks at the consumer edge.  In\n
    \  addition, the framework has been successfully applied in other ways.\n\n   Note:
    Code Components extracted from this document must include the\n   license as included
    with the code in Section 5.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
