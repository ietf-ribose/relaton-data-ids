abstract:
- content: <p>In this document we present a mechanism that enhances the "IGP-metric
    based MED" approach so that load balancing is maintained while limiting the number
    of BGP alternate paths carried in a network. The mechanism involves the use of
    a "scale factor" to scale down the IGP metrics for the purpose of setting MEDs,
    and is thus termed "scaled IGP-metric based MED".</p>
