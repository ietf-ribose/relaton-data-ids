abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Content providers delivering content via CDNs will sometimes
    deliver\n   content over HTTPS (or both HTTPS and HTTP) but configure the CDN
    to\n   pull from the origin over cleartext and unauthenticated HTTP.  From\n   the
    perspective of a client, it appears that their requests and\n   associated responses
    are delivered over HTTPS, while in reality their\n   requests are being sent across
    the network in-the-clear and responses\n   are delivered unauthenticated.  This
    exposes user request data to\n   pervasive monitoring [RFC7258]; it also means
    response data may be\n   tampered with by active adversaries.  Terminating TLS
    connections on\n   a load balancer and contacting a backend over cleartext has
    long been\n   common within data centers, but doing this TLS termination and\n
    \  downgrade to HTTP at a CDN introduces additional risk when the\n   unprotected
    traffic is sent over the general Internet, sometimes\n   across national boundaries.\n\n
    \  While it would be nice to say \"never do this,\" customer demand,\n   content
    provider use-cases, and market forces today make it\n   impossible for CDNs to
    not support downgrade.  However, following a\n   set of best practices can provide
    visibility into when this is\n   happening and can reduce some of the risks.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
