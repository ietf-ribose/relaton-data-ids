abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture specifies
    use of\n   the DSField in the IPv4 and IPv6 packet header to carry the Diffserv\n
    \  Codepoint (DSCP). The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)\n   maintains
    a registry of assigned DSCP values.\n\n   This update to RFC2474 requests a change
    to the IANA assignment\n   method for Pool 3 of the registry to change this to
    Standards Action\n   assignment.  The update also removes permission for Local
    Use of the\n   codepoints that form Pool 3 of the DSCP registry.\n\n\t </p>\n
