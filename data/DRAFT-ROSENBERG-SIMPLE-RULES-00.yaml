abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Authorization is a key function in presence systems. Authorization\n
    \  policies, also known as authorization rules, specify what presence\n   information
    can be given to which watchers, and when. This\n   specification defines an Extensible
    Markup Language (XML) document\n   format for expressing presence authorization
    rules. Such a document\n   can be manipulated by clients using the XML Configuration
    Access\n   Protocol (XCAP), although other techniques are permitted.\n\t </p>\n
