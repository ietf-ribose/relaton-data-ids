abstract:
  content: "<p>Hysteresis delays the effect of changes in link metric on parentselection.
    Such delay makes the topology stable despite jitters inlink metrics. The Routing
    Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks(RPL) allows the use of objective functions
    to construct routes thatoptimize or constrain a routing metric on the paths. Thisspecification
    describes the Minimum Rank Objective Function withHysteresis (MRHOF), an objective
    function that minimizes the noderank in terms of a given metric, while using hysteresis
    to preventexcessive rank churn. The use of MRHOF with RPL results in nodesselecting
    stable paths that minimize the given routing metric to theroots of a Directed
    Acyclic Graph (DAG).</p>"
