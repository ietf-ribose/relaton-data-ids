abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC7344 specifies how DNS trust can be maintained across key\n
    \  rollovers in-band between parent and child.  This document elevates\n   RFC7344
    from informational to standards track and adds a standard\n   track method for
    initial trust setup and removal of secure entry\n   point.\n\n   Changing a domain's
    DNSSEC status can be a complicated matter\n   involving multiple unrelated parties.
    \ Some of these parties, such as\n   the DNS operator, might not even be known
    by all the organizations\n   involved.  The inability to disable DNSSEC via in-band
    signaling is\n   seen as a problem or liability that prevents some DNSSEC adoption
    at\n   large scale.  This document adds a method for in-band signaling of\n   these
    DNSSEC status changes.\n\n   This document describes reasonable policies to ease
    deployment of the\n   initial acceptance of new secure entry points (DS records)\n\n
    \  It is preferable that operators collaborate on the transfer or move\n   of
    a domain.  The best method is to perform a Key Signing Key (\"KSK\")\n   plus
    Zone Signing Key (\"ZSK\") rollover.  If that is not possible, the\n   method
    using an unsigned intermediate state described in this\n   document can be used
    to move the domain between two parties.  This\n   leaves the domain temporarily
    unsigned and vulnerable to DNS\n   spoofing, but that is preferred over the alternative
    of validation\n   failures due to a mismatched DS and DNSKEY record.\n\n\t </p>\n
