abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bufferbloat is a phenomenon in which excess buffers in the
    network\n   cause high latency and latency variation. As more and more\n   interactive
    applications (e.g. voice over IP, real time video\n   streaming and financial
    transactions) run in the Internet, high\n   latency and latency variation degrade
    application performance. There\n   is a pressing need to design intelligent queue
    management schemes\n   that can control latency and latency variation, and hence
    provide\n   desirable quality of service to users.\n\n   This document presents
    a lightweight active queue management design,\n   called PIE (Proportional Integral
    controller Enhanced), that can\n   effectively control the average queueing latency
    to a target value.\n   Simulation results, theoretical analysis and Linux testbed
    results\n   have shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link\n
    \  utilization under various congestion situations. The design does not\n   require
    per-packet timestamps, so it incurs very little overhead and\n   is simple enough
    to implement in both hardware and software.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
