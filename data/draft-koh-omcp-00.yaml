abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes Overlay Multicast Control Protocol (OMCP)used
    for realizing and managing Overlay Multicast, as also known asApplication Layer
    Multicast. Overlay Multicast is a data deliveryscheme for multicast applications,
    in which one or more intermediaterelay agents are employed for relaying application
    data from a senderto many receivers along a pre-configured or automatically configuredtree
    hierarchy. In OMCP, a special- purpose entity, called SessionManager, is used
    to manage and control the tree configuration andsession monitoring. OMCP is designed
    to ensure that the multicastapplications and services can be provided over current
    Internetenvironments in which IP multicast has not completely been deployed.</p>"
