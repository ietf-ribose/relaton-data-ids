abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes Overlay Multicast Control Protocol (OMCP) used
    for realizing and managing Overlay Multicast, as also known as Application Layer
    Multicast. Overlay Multicast is a data delivery scheme for multicast applications,
    in which one or more intermediate relay agents are employed for relaying application
    data from a sender to many receivers along a pre-configured or automatically configured
    tree hierarchy. In OMCP, a special- purpose entity, called Session Manager, is
    used to manage and control the tree configuration and session monitoring. OMCP
    is designed to ensure that the multicast applications and services can be provided
    over current Internet environments in which IP multicast has not completely been
    deployed.</p>"
