abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operation of IPv6 over tunnel virtual\n
    \  Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) links using Asymmetric Extended\n   Route
    Optimization (AERO).  Nodes attached to AERO links can exchange\n   packets via
    trusted intermediate routers on the link that provide\n   forwarding services
    to reach off-link destinations and/or redirection\n   services to inform the node
    of an on-link neighbor that is closer to\n   the final destination.  Operation
    of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)\n   protocol over AERO links is based on an
    IPv6 link local address\n   format known as the AERO address.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
