abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes an architecture for the source addressvalidation
    with help of Host Identity Protocol (HIP), SAVAH. Thearchitecture utilizes the
    properties of cryptographically strongprotocol to authenticate an originator of
    a network communication.In addition this architecture offers network access control,
    dataprotection, host mobilty and multihoming features and is suitable forthe wireless
    networks. The proposed, architecture is the first-hoprouter solution, meaning
    that it should be deployed on the routerplaced on the edge of a local network
    topology.</p>"
