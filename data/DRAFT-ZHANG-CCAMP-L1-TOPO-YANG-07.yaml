abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A transport network is a server-layer network designed to provide\n
    \  connectivity services for a client-layer network to carry the client\n   traffic
    transparently across the server-layer network resources.  A\n   transport network
    can be constructed from equipments utilizing any of\n   a number of different
    transport technologies such as the evolving\n   Optical Transport Networks (OTN)
    or packet transport as provided by\n   the MPLS-Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).\n\n
    \  This draft describes a YANG data model to describe the topologies of\n   an
    Optical Transport Network (OTN).  It is independent of control\n   plane protocols
    and captures topological and resource related\n   information pertaining to OTN.
    \ This model enables clients, which\n   interact with a transport domain controller
    via a REST interface, for\n   OTN topology related operations such as obtaining
    the relevant\n   topology resource information.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
