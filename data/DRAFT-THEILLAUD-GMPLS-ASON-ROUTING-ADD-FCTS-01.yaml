abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>[OSPF-ASON] defines OSPFv2 extensions to fulfill the requirements\ndefined
    in [RFC4258].  In OIF discussion of ASON routing, OIF members\nhave noted that
    some additional functionality beyond that defined in\n[OSPF-ASON] would be useful
    for deployment of ASON routing by OIF\ncarriers.\n\nThe purpose of this document
    is to list such additional\nfunctionalities, so that CCAMP experts study whether
    such\nfunctionalities can be fulfilled by existing GMPLS mechanisms, or\nwhether
    extensions to [OSPF-ASON] are required.\n\nSome proposals for potential extensions
    are provided for review by\nIETF CCAMP.\n\t </p>\n      "
