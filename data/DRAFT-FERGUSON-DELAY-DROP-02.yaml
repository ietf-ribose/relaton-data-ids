abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    Recent opinions and sentiments expressed in the Internet\n
    \   Service Provider (ISP) community, as well as the Internet\n    community at-large,
    have voiced concern over the applicability\n    and scalability of RSVP and the
    Integrated Service model in\n    the global Internet infrastructure. Convincing
    arguments have\n    been made for a differential services model which offers packet\n
    \   delivery services better than traditional best effort, especially\n    in
    the face of congestion, yet not as resource intensive as RSVP.\n    As a result,
    the Differentiated Service (diffserv) working group\n    in the IETF has been
    examining methods to provide simpler, less\n    resource intensive methods of
    offering differentiated services.\n    This draft provides a practical method
    to use bit values expressed\n    in the IP Type or Service (TOS) and IP precedence
    subfields of the\n    TOS byte in the IP packet header for delay indication and
    packet drop\n    preference, respectively.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
