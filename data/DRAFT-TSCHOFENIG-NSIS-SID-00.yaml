abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As one result of the analysis activities in the NSIS group it
    was \nrealized that mobility and the ability to change the flow identifier \ncauses
    problems with existing QoS reservations. To be able to \nassociate a signaling
    message with existing state an identifier \nother than the flow identifier had
    to be used. Such an abstraction \nis achieved with the session identifier which
    allows identification \nof established state independently of the flow characteristics.
