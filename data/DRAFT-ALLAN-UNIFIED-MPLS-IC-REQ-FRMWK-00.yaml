abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The definition of a transport profile for MPLS means that MPLS\n
    \  network architectures will emerge that combines both managed and\n   control
    plane driven MPLS sub-networks and requires interconnection\n   of same to achieve
    a unified MPLS architecture.\n\n   This document generalizes the problem of sub-network
    interconnect,\n   discusses issues in general and suggests ways forward.\n\n\n\n\t
