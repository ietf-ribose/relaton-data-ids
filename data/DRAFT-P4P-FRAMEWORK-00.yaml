abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>P4P is a framework that enables Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
    and\nnetwork application software distributors to work jointly and\ncooperatively
    to optimize application communications.  The goals of\nthis cooperation are to
    reduce network resource consumption and to\naccelerate network applications.  In
    this document, we specify how\nP4P allows ISPs to provide network guidance to
    applications, allowing\nclients to exchange data more effectively.  The applications
    we focus\non are those that can have a choice in connection patterns, in\nparticular
    peer-to-peer (P2P) applications.\n\t </p>\n      "
