abstract:
  content: "<p>draft-ietf-mpls-flow-ident describes the requirement for introducing
    flow identities within the MPLS architecture. This document describes a method
    of accomplishing this by using a technique called Synonymous Flow Labels in which
    labels which mimic the behaviour of other labels provide the identification service.
    These identifiers can be used to trigger per-flow operations on the on the packet
    at the receiving label switching router.</p>"
