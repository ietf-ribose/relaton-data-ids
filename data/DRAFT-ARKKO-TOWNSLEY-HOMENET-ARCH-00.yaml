abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo focuses on the evolving networking technology within
    and\n   among relatively small \"residential home\" networks.  The goal of this\n
    \  memo is to define the architecture for IPv6-based home networking\n   that
    supports the demands placed on it.  This architecture shows how\n   standard IPv6
    mechanisms and addressing can be employed in home\n   networking, and outlines
    the need for specific protocol extensions\n   for certain additional functionality.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
