abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   S/MIME uses certificates for authenticating and encrypting
    messages.\n   Users want their mail user agents to securely associate a certificate\n
    \  with the sender of an encrypted and/or signed message.  DNSSEC\n   provides
    a mechanism for a zone operator to sign DNS information\n   directly.  This way,
    bindings of certificates to users within a\n   domain are asserted not by external
    entities, but by the entities\n   that operate the DNS.  This document describes
    how to use secure DNS\n   to associate an S/MIME user's certificate with the intended
    domain\n   name.\n\n   IMPORTANT NOTE: This draft is intentionally sketchy.  It
    is meant as\n   a possible starting point for the DANE WG if it wants to consider\n
    \  making a protocol similar to TLSA, as described in\n   draft-ietf-dane-protocol,
    but that applies to S/MIME.  The WG may or\n   may not want to adopt such work,
    or if it does, may want to use a\n   very different scheme from the one described
    here.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
