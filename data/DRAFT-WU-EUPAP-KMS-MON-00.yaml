abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In view of the characteristics of multi-domain optical networks
    under\n   hierarchical PCE architecture and its key management needs, a novel\n
    \  key management scheme (KMS-KI) based on key hypergraph and in this\n   paper
    identity-based cryptography was proposed. The key relationship\n   of multi-domain
    optical networks was firstly modeled into key\n   hypergraph with two layers,
    namely the vertices was represented by\n   points and the key relation at all
    levels was described with\n   hyperedge. And the master keys, the public keys
    and private keys, the\n   session keys, the layer group keys and the inter-domain
    keys were\n   generated respectively and were dynamic managed by using hierarchical\n
    \  identity-based cryptography and improved private key generation\n   strategies.
    When the group members join or leave, the remaining group\n   members autonomously
    used the key value of the pPCE or cPCE to\n   calculate and update the group key.
    So the risk that the new group\n   key was uncovered by adversary was greatly
    reduced. KMS-KI scheme\n   possessed the security performance of forward and backward,\n
    \  confidentiality of private keys and the ability of resisting\n   collusive
    attack. Meanwhile, it not only supported the using of\n   hierarchical identity-based
    cryptography, but also had performed\n   comprehensively well in terms of numbers
    of the key storage, numbers\n   of cPCE communication, encryption and decryption
    times.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
