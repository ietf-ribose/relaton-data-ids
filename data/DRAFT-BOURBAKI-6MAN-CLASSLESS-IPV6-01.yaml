abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Over the history of IPv6, various classful address models have
    been\n   proposed, none of which has withstood the test of time.  The last\n   remnant
    of IPv6 classful addressing is a rigid network interface\n   identifier boundary
    at /64.  This document removes the fixed position\n   of that boundary for interface
    addressing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
