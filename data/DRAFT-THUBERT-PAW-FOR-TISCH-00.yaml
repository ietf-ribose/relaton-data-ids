abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document builds on the 6TiSCH architecture that defines,
    among\n   others, mechanisms to establish and maintain deterministic routing\n
    \  and scheduling in a centralized fashion.  The document details\n   dependencies
    on DetNet and PCE controller to express topologies and\n   capabilities, as well
    as abstract state that the controller must be\n   able to program into the network
    devices to enable deterministic\n   forwarding operations.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
