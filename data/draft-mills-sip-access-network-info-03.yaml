abstract:
- content: "<p>This mechanism is useful in SIP networks that provide layer 2/layer
    3 connectivity through different access technologies. This document defines the
    private SIP extension header P-Access- Network-Info. SIP User Agents may use this
    header to relay information about the access technology to serving proxies in
    their home network. The serving proxy may then use this information to optimize
    services for the UA. For example, a 3GPP terminal uses this header to pass information
    about the access network such as radio access technology and cell ID to its home
    service provider.</p>"
