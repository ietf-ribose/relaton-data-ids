abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The breadth of IoT applications implies that there will be
    many\n   diverse, administratively independent networks operating in the same\n
    \  physical location.  In many cases, these networks will use unlicensed\n   spectrum,
    due to its low cost and ease of deployment.  However, this\n   spectrum is becoming
    increasingly crowded.  IoT networks will\n   therefore be subject to wireless
    interference, both from similar\n   networks and from networks that use the wireless
    channel in very\n   different ways.\n\n   High-density, heterogeneous wireless
    environments present formidable\n   challenges for network coexistence.  The PHY
    and MAC layers are\n   primarily responsible for defining how radios use the channel.
    \ But\n   higher layer protocols are also a party to adverse interactions\n   between
    networks.  To date, there have been few performance studies\n   that fully reflect
    this aspect of the future IoT operating\n   environment, particularly with respect
    to protocol behavior and\n   network-scale interactions.\n\n   This document describes
    key challenges for coexistence and highlights\n   some recent research results
    showing the impact of protocol level\n   interactions on network performance.
    \ It identifies two opportunities\n   for the IRTF T2TRG community.  The first
    is to define best practices\n   for performance evaluation and protocol design
    in the context of\n   network coexistence.  The second is to investigate the use
    of higher\n   layer protocols to actively participate in managing network\n   coexistence.\n\n\t
