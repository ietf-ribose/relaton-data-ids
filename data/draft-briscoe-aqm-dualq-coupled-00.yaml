abstract:
- content: "<p>Data Centre TCP (DCTCP) was designed to provide predictably low queuing
    latency, near-zero loss, and throughput scalability using explicit congestion
    notification (ECN) and an extremely simple marking behaviour on switches. However,
    DCTCP does not co-exist with existing TCP traffic---throughput starves. So, until
    now, DCTCP could only be deployed where a clean-slate environment could be arranged,
    such as in private data centres. This specification defines `DualQ Coupled Active
    Queue Management (AQM)' to allow scalable congestion controls like DCTCP to safely
    co-exist with classic Internet traffic. The Coupled AQM ensures that a flow runs
    at about the same rate whether it uses DCTCP or TCP Reno/Cubic, but without inspecting
    transport layer flow identifiers. When tested in a residential broadband setting,
    DCTCP achieved sub-millisecond average queuing delay and zero congestion loss
    under a wide range of mixes of DCTCP and `Classic' broadband Internet traffic,
    without compromising the performance of the Classic traffic. The solution also
    reduces network complexity and eliminates network configuration.</p>"
