abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new BGP SAFI with a new NLRI to advertise a
    candidate path of a Segment Routing (SR) Policy. An SR Policy is a set of candidate
    paths, each consisting of one or more segment lists. The headend of an SR Policy
    may learn multiple candidate paths for an SR Policy. Candidate paths may be learned
    via several different mechanisms, e.g., CLI, NetConf, PCEP, or BGP. This document
    specifies how BGP may be used to distribute SR Policy candidate paths. New sub-TLVs
    for the Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute are defined for signaling information about
    these candidate paths. This documents updates RFC9012 with extensions to the Color
    Extended Community to support new steering modes over SR Policy.</p>"
