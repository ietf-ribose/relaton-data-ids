abstract:
- content: "<p>Numerous studies have been done to improve RSVP performance. However,
    most of this research concentrates on fixed hosts. As mobility of hosts is having
    a significant impact on the Quality of Services, it is necessary to develop a
    new mechanism having the capabilities to support terminal mobility with RSVP.</p>"
