abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the DOTS signal channel Call Home,
    which\n   enables a Call Home DOTS server to initiate a secure connection to a\n
    \  Call Home DOTS client, and to receive attack traffic information from\n   the
    Call Home DOTS client.  The Call Home DOTS server in turn uses\n   the attack
    traffic information to identify compromised devices\n   launching outgoing DDoS
    attacks and take appropriate mitigation\n   action(s).\n\n   The DOTS signal channel
    Call Home is not specific to home networks;\n   the solution targets any deployment
    in which it is required to block\n   DDoS attack traffic closer to the source(s)
    of a DDoS attack.\n\nEditorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)\n\n   Please
    update these statements within the document with the RFC\n   number to be assigned
    to this document:\n\n   o  \"This version of this YANG module is part of RFC XXXX;\"\n\n
    \  o  \"RFC XXXX: Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling\n      (DOTS)
    Signal Channel Call Home\";\n\n   o  \"| [RFCXXXX] |\"\n\n   o  reference: RFC
    XXXX\n\n   Please update this statement with the RFC number to be assigned to\n
    \  the following documents:\n\n   o  \"RFC YYYY: Distributed Denial-of-Service
    Open Threat Signaling\n      (DOTS) Signal Channel Specification\" (used to be
    I-D.ietf-dots-\n      rfc8782-bis)\n\n   Please update TBD/TBA statements with
    the assignments made by IANA to\n   DOTS Signal Channel Call Home.\n\n   Also,
    please update the \"revision\" date of the YANG module.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
