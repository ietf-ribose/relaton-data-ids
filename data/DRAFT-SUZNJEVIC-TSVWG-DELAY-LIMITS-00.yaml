abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network delay is one of the main factors which can degrade
    the\n   Quality of Experience (QoE) of the users of network services.  This\n
    \  document surveys a set of recommendations about the maximum latency\n   tolerated
    by the users of delay-constrained services.  Some\n   recommendations already
    exist for VoIP, but emerging services as e.g.\n   online gaming, have different
    requirements.  Different papers in the\n   literature reporting these constraints
    are surveyed, and a summary of\n   the latency limits for each service is finally
    provided.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
