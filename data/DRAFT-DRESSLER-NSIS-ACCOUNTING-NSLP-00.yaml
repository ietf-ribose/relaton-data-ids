abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Monitoring, metering and accounting of packets are increasingly\n
    \  important functionality that needs to be provided in the Internet.\n   This
    document proposes the definition of a new NSIS NSLP which allows\n   the dynamic
    configuration of accounting entities on the data path.  A\n   problem statement,
    scenarios for a QoS monitoring and a charging\n   application, and requirements
    presented.  Finally, the usage of NSIS\n   for this purpose is motivated.\n\t
