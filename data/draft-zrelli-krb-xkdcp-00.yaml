abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo proposes protocol extensions to the Kerberos protocolspecification.
    The extension (hereafter called XKDCP) offers a newcross-realm protocol for Kerberos.
    The XKDCP extension defines aprotocol between Kerberos Key Distribution Centers
    (KDCs) that allowsa KDC to build credentials even when the client or the requestedservice
    is not registered in the KDC's database (but registered inanother KDC's database).
    The XKDCP extension defines two protocols:XTGSP (Inter Ticket Granting Service
    Protocol) and XASP (InterAuthentication Service Protocol). The XTGSP protocol
    can be used inremote access scenarios to allow the local KDC to deliver credentialsfor
    services located in remote realms. On the other hand, the XASPprotocol can be
    used in case of cross-realm roaming scenarios toallow the visited KDC to deliver
    credentials for roaming users.</p>"
