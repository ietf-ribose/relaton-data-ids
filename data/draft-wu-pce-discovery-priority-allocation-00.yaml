abstract:
- content: "<p>Each network domain may contain multiple PCE servers. It provides redundancy
    to the PCCs in the event of a server failure. However load balance decision is
    made by PCC,it doesn't enable real load balance across the PCE servers if PCC
    still tries PCE one by one and PCE doesn't indicate the load status to the PCC.
    This document proposes new PCE discovery sub-TLV that can be announced as attribute
    in the OSPF advertisement (defined in [RFC5088 ]) to distribute priority information.</p>"
