abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification provides a mechanism for clients to send IP addresses
    in a TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) extension as part of TLS handshakes, allowing
    servers to return a certificate containing that subjectAltName. This is done by
    converting the IP address to a special-use domain name.</p>"
