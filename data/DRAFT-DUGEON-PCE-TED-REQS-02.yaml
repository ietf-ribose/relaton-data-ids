abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group (WG) has produced
    a\n   set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path Computation\n   Element
    as a tool to help MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSP tunnels placement.\n   In the PCE architecture,
    a main assumption has been done concerning\n   the information that the PCE needs
    to perform its computation.  In a\n   fist approach, the PCE embeds a Traffic
    Engineering Database (TED)\n   containing all pertinent and suitable information
    regarding the\n   network that is in the scope of a PCE.  Nevertheless, the TED\n
    \  requirements as well as the TED information have not yet been\n   formalized.
    \ In addition, some recent RFC (like the Backward\n   Recursive Path Computation
    procedure or PCE Hierarchy) or WG draft\n   (like draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce
    ...) suffer from a lack of\n   information in the TED, leading to a non optimal
    result or to some\n   difficulties to deploy them.  This memo tries to identify
    some\n   Database, at large, requirements for the PCE.  It is split in two\n   main
    sections: the identification of the specific information to be\n   stored in the
    PCE Database and how it may be populated.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
