abstract:
- content: "<p>The main goal of this document is to serve as a survey of the different
    efforts that have been taken and are currently taking place at IETF and IRTF in
    regards to network virtualization, automation and orchestration, putting them
    into context considering efforts by other SDOs, and identifying current gaps and
    challenges that can be tackled at IETF or researched at the IRTF.</p>"
