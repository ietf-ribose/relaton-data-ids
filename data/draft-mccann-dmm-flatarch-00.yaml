abstract:
- content: "<p>Today's mobility management schemes make use of a hierarchy of tunnels
    from a relatively fixed anchor point, through one or more intermediate nodes,
    to reach the MN's current point of attachment. These schemes suffer from poor
    performance, scalability, and failure modes due to the centralization and statefulness
    of the anchor point(s). The dmm (Distributed Mobility Management) working group
    is currently chartered to investigate alternative solutions that will provide
    greater performance, scalability, and robustness through the distribution of mobility
    anchors. This document is an input to the dmm discussion. It outlines a problem
    statement for the existing mobility management techniques and goes on to propose
    (high-level) solutions to two of the most vexing problems: MN authentication and
    mobility management in a fully distributed, flat (non-hierarchical) access network.
    These two aspects are often treated separately in a layered architecture, but
    we argue there are important advantages to considering how these two functions
    can work in tandem to provide a simple and robust framework for the design of
    a wireless Internet Service Provider network.</p>"
