abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) (RFC-2045, RFC-2046,\n
    \  RFC-2047, RFC-2231) and various other Internet protocols are capable\n   of
    using many different charsets.  This in turn means that the\n   ability to label
    different charsets is essential.\n\n   This draft updates the IANA Charset Registration
    Procedures\n   originally defined in [RFC2978].  Specifically, this document\n
    \  completely revises the registration procedures and the charset\n   registries.
    \ The charset registry is now divided into three parts\n   with separate registration
    procedures for each.\n\n   Note: The charset registration procedure exists solely
    to associate a\n   specific name or names with a given charset and to give an
    indication\n   of whether or not a given charset can be used in MIME text objects.\n
    \  In particular, the general applicability and appropriateness of a\n   given
    registered charset to a particular application is a protocol\n   issue, not a
    registration issue, and is not dealt with by this\n   registration procedure.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
