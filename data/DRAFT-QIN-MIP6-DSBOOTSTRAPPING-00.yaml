abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DSMIPv6 [V4TRAVERSAL] defines how the dual-stack mobile node
    roams in\n   the IPv4 network.  It assumes that home agent and mobile node support\n
    \  mipv4 and mipv6 protocol, and home agent could assign an IPv4 address\n   for
    the mobile node.  This assumption works during many scenarios.\n   However, as
    the IPv4 address is a scarce resource in many countries,\n   the mobile IPv6 home
    agent does not own Ipv4 address pools, not\n   support IPv4 protocol and mobile
    IP4 protocol.  In such scenario, a\n   temporary ipv4 home address is more useful.
    \ [Routing] Focuses on the\n   solution to such scenario.  In this solution, mobile
    nodes get\n   temporary IPv4 home addresses from the foreign home agent .  The\n
    \  scenarios and solutions defined in [Routing] are the preliminary of\n   this
    document.  This document describes the bootstrapping of the\n   dual-stack MIPv6-homed
    mobile entity in Mobile IPv4 network.\n\t </p>\n      "
