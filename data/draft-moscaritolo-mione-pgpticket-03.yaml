abstract:
  content: "\t <t>OpenPGP specifies message formats and certificate formats used forexchange
    of encrypted and/or authenticated objects. This documentdiscusses methods of extending
    OpenPGP's message formats to supportan authorization system. This system would
    use public keycryptography to authenticate a user to a server and establish theuser's
    access permissions. The concept is that the user acquires aticket signed by some
    issuer that specifies what they are entitled todo. That ticket is then submitted
    to a server. The server uses achallenge/response method to verify that the holder
    really has thematching private key. The server then allows the access specified.</p>"
