abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a mechanism under which a client can
    request\n   that an upstream recursive resolver perform DNS filtering on behalf\n
    \  of a client-requested policy.  This is may be done, for example,\n   under
    a subscription model, where the client wishes not to get\n   redirected to domains
    known to host malware or malicious content.\n   This request is sent as an EDNS0
    option with every DNS request, or\n   potentially to just the first DNS request
    in a stream when using DNS\n   over TLS, DNS over DTLS or DNS over DOH for example.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
