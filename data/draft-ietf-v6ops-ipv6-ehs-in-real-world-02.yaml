abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents real-world data regarding the extent to which
    packets with IPv6 Extension Headers (EHs) are dropped in the Internet (as originally
    measured in August 2014 and later in June 2015, with similar results) and where
    in the network such dropping occurs. The aforementioned results serve as a problem
    statement that is expected to trigger operational advice on the filtering of IPv6
    packets carrying IPv6 EHs so that the situation improves over time. This document
    also explains how the results were obtained, such that the corresponding measurements
    can be reproduced by other members of the community and repeated over time to
    observe changes in the handling of packets with IPv6 EHs.</p>"
