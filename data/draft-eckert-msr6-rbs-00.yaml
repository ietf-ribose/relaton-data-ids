abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines an encoding and corresponding packet processing
    procedures for native IPv6 multicast source routing (MSR6) using a so-called "Recursive
    Bitstring" (RBS) address structure. The RBS address structure encodes the source-routed
    multicast tree as a tree of bitstrings. Each router on the tree only needs to
    examine and perform replication for the one bitstring destined for it. The MSR6/RBS
    IPv6 extension header encoding and processing is modeled after that of unicast
    source routing headers, RFC6554 and RFC8754, and shares all elements that can
    be shared. To support the RBS structure, it is replacing the "Segments Left" pointer
    to the next segment with two fields to point to the next sub-tree to parse.</p>
