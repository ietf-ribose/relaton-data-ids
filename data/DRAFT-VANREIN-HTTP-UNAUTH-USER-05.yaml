abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many protocols support users under domain names, but HTTP does
    not.\n\n   This specification defines a header for user names, independent of\n
    \  authenticated identities, and a link to userinfo in HTTP URIs.  This\n   intergrates
    naturally with HTTP, and results in a more refined\n   resource authentication
    model, in support of advanced usage\n   scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
