abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Operators of multicast networks may apply various filters to\n
    \  multicast traffic at boundary routers or on MSDP peerings.  The aim\n   of
    this text is to discuss appropriate filtering policies, as well as\n   documenting
    existing filtering practices, with a view to generating\n   some discussion towards
    producing guidance on best filtering\n   practice.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
