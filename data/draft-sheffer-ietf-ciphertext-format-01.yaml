abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of structured headers for encrypted data.
    The main goal of this format is to enable detection of encrypted data in large
    data stores, and associating it back to the system where it was created and the
    key with which it was encrypted. This allows organizations to extend the concept
    of data governance to encrypted data, and to manage such data even when encrypted
    by multiple different systems and cloud providers.</p>"
