abstract:
- content: "<p>Increased use of encryption will impact operations for security and
    network management causing a shift in how these functions are performed. In some
    cases, new methods to both monitor and protect data will evolve. In more drastic
    circumstances, the ability to monitor may be eliminated. This draft includes a
    collection of current security and network management functions that may be impacted
    by the shift to increased use of encryption. This draft does not attempt to solve
    these problems, but rather document the current state to assist in the development
    of alternate options to achieve the intended purpose of the documented practices.</p>"
