abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This informational memo contains a description of some\nmeasurements
    from early DiffServ (DS) experiments that used a\npreliminary version of IBM's
    DiffServ implementation on an IBM\nrouter over an egress T1/E1 PPP interface.
    The service level\nspecification (SLS) may be configured on the router or optionally\ncontrolled
    by an LDAP-accessible policy repository. The\nmeasurements were intended to examine
    the behavior of a mixture\nof Expedited Forwarding (EF) traffic, Assured Forwarding
    (AF)\ntraffic and Best Effort (BE) traffic on a congested E1 link.  The\nrouter
    code includes an LDAP client that communicates with a\npolicy server to obtain
    the policies that control the amount of\nresources configured for the DiffServ
    classes.\nThe diagrams referred to in this memo are available in the\npostscript
    version of this memo.\nChanges from -00 version\nAdded the details of the buffering
    setup, a discussion of an\nanomaly in the AF delay results, added an additional
    measurement\npoint related to this anomaly,  updated author list, added\nacknowledgements,
    and miscellaneous editorial comments.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
