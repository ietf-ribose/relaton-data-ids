abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes an extension to the HTTP/1.1 state managementmechanism
    described in [Kristol]. This mechanism, 'trust-labels',associates digitally signed
    labels with Set-Cookie or Set-Cookie2headers. The labels allow additional semantics
    to attach to cookiesand cookie processing, and the digital signatures allow trust
    modelsto be associated with processing rules for labeled cookies.The intent is
    to provide a mechanism that allows user agentimplementors to implement evaluation
    of the authenticity and contentof cookie-associated labels, and to implement additional
    processingrules for cookie handling. The intended use is browser determinationof
    server privacy practices and acceptance, rejection, modificationor redirection
    of cookies based on those practices. The more generaluse of trust model scoped,
    label semantic scoped processing of HTTPstate artifacts is not precluded by this
    intended use.</p>"
