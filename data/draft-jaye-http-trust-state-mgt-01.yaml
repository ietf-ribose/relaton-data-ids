abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the HTTP/1.1 state management
    mechanism described in [Kristol]. This mechanism, 'trust-labels', associates digitally
    signed labels with Set-Cookie or Set-Cookie2 headers. The labels allow additional
    semantics to attach to cookies and cookie processing, and the digital signatures
    allow trust models to be associated with processing rules for labeled cookies.
    The intent is to provide a mechanism that allows user agent implementors to implement
    evaluation of the authenticity and content of cookie-associated labels, and to
    implement additional processing rules for cookie handling. The intended use is
    browser determination of server privacy practices and acceptance, rejection, modification
    or redirection of cookies based on those practices. The more general use of trust
    model scoped, label semantic scoped processing of HTTP state artifacts is not
    precluded by this intended use.</p>"
