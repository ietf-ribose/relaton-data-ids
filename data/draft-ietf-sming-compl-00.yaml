abstract:
- content: "<p>The memo [9], which has been approved by the IESG to be published as
    an Informational RFC, enumerates a number of objectives that the SMIng language
    is expected to fulfill. This memo describes the compliance of a proposal based
    on former IRTF NMRG [8] work and published in [10] and companion I-Ds for each
    of the strived objectives. This is done by including the whole list of objectives
    without any changes, but adding a compliance section for each of the objectives,
    so that reading is as easy as possible.</p>"
