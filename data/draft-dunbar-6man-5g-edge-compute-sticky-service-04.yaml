abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the IPv6-based solutions that can stick an application
    flow originated from a mobile device to the same ANYCAST server location when
    the mobile device moves from one 5G cell site to another. The proposed solution
    expands the Application-aware ID and Service-Para options specified by [APN6]
    by including the ANYCAST Sticky Service location information in the IPv6 Hop-by-
    Hop or Destination Optional Header.</p>"
