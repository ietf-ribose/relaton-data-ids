abstract:
  content: <p>Internet infrastructure protocols were designed at the very earlystages
    of computer networks when "cyberspace" was still perceived asa benign environment.
    As a consequence, malicious attacks were notconsidered to be a major risk when
    these protocols were designed,leaving today's Internet vulnerable. This paper
    provides an analysisof OSPF vulnerabilities that could be exploited to modify
    the normalrouting process across a single domain together with an assessment ofwhen
    internal OSPF mechanisms can or cannot be leveraged to bettersecure a domain.</p>
