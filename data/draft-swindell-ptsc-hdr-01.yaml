abstract:
  content: "<p>Anyone that has dealt at length with plain (ASCII [1]) text andsource
    code files can testify that the lack of a global definitionof the effect of the
    horizontal-tab character, all too often, causesill-formed display and printed
    output of plain text files thatutilize the horizontal-tab character for formatting.This
    document defines a common header for plain text and source code(PT/SC) files,
    whose primary purpose is to specify the tab-dependantformatting parameters to
    be used when displaying, printing, orediting such files. The defined header also
    addresses such issuesas whether to use the line-feed character or carriage-return/line-feed
    character sequence to terminate lines in the file. Widespreadadoption and support
    of the header defined in this document couldsubstantially improve the interoperability
    of text and source codefiles distributed across the Internet and other mediums.</p>"
