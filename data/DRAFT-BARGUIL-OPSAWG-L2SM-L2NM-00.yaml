abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a Yang Data model, L2NM, that can be
    used to\n   manage the provisioning of Layer 2 VPN services in a Service Provider\n
    \  Network.  The Yang module defined in this document provides\n   representation
    of the Layer 2 VPN Service and is aimed at being used\n   by a Network Controller,
    which can derive from it the configuration\n   information that will be sent to
    the network devices, as well the the\n   underlay transport network in a service
    provider environment.\n\n   RFC 8466 defines a Layer 2 VPN service model (L2SM)
    that can be used\n   in the communication between a Customer and the Network Operator.This\n
    \  document complements L2SM by creating a network-centric view of the\n   service
    to be used in the communication between the entity that\n   interacts directly
    with the customer, the service orchestrator,\n   (either fully automated or a
    human operator) and the entity in charge\n   of network orchestration and control
    (a.k.a., network controller/\n   orchestrator).\n\n   The YANG data model defined
    in this document conforms to the Network\n   Management Datastore Architecture
    defined in RFC 8342.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
