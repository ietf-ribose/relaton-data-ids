abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) is a technology to enable service\n
    \  differentiation within an IP network.  Flexible Algorithm (FA) is\n   another
    mechanism of creating a sub-topology within a topology using\n   defined topology
    constraints and computation algorithm.  In order to\n   deploy mLDP in a network
    that supports MTR and/or FA, mLDP is\n   required to become topology and FA aware.
    \ This document specifies\n   extensions to mLDP to support MTR with FA such that
    when building a\n   Multi-Point LSPs it can follow a particular topology and algorithm.\n\n\t
