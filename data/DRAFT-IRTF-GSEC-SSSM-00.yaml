abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The SSM model is appeared in order to overcome the problems of
    \ndeployment of IP multicast. However, a real commercial deployment \nof SSM have
    to offer some security services. Our work proposes an\narchitecture, called S-SSM,
    for securing the SSM model. S-SSM\ndefines two mechanisms for access control and
    content protection.\nThe first one is carried out through subscriber authentication
    and\naccess permission. As for the second, it is realized through the\nmanagement
    of a unique key, called the channel key, k_ch, shared\namong the sender and subscribers.\n\t
