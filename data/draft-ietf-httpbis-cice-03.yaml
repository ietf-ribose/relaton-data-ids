abstract:
- content: <p>In HTTP, content codings allow for payload encodings such as for compression
    or integrity checks. In particular, the "gzip" content coding is widely used for
    payload data sent in response messages. Content codings can be used in request
    messages as well; however, discoverability is not on par with response messages.
    This document extends the HTTP "Accept-Encoding" header field for use in responses,
    to indicate the content codings that are supported in requests.</p>
