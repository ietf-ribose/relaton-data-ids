abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes two methods for using Kerberos [KRB5] for
    \nauthentication and key exchange in the Secure Shell protocol.  The first \nmethod
    uses Kerberos as a means to authenticate the Diffie-Hellman \nexchange described
    in [SSH-TRANSPORT].  The second method uses Kerberos \nfor authentication and
    key-exchange.  This memo also defines a new user \nauthentication method which
    allows an authorization name and optional \ncredentials to build upon the underlying
    authenticated key exchange.\n\t </p>\n      "
