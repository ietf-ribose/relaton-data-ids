abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the rise in realtime communication applications supporting\n
    \  video, there is a need for receivers of the video to setup\n   appropriate
    expectations on their receive capacity for handling\n   various video image resolutions.
    \ Setting up the maximum supported\n   image resolution that could be handled
    by an Endpoint is important to\n   successfully decode and render the received
    video streams.  This\n   document proposes SDP format specific parameters for
    specifying the\n   maximum image width and height resolutions along with their
    behavior\n   under the [RFC3264] Offer/Answer SDP usage.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
