abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748,
    provides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication methods.
    This document specifies the use of EAP-EDHOC with Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over
    COSE (EDHOC). EDHOC provides a lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange
    with ephemeral keys, using COSE (RFC 8152) to provide security services efficiently
    encoded in CBOR (RFC 8949). This document also provides guidance on authentication
    and authorization for EAP-EDHOC.</p>"
