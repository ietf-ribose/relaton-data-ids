abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes OAuth client authentication and certificate-
    bound access and refresh tokens using mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication
    with X.509 certificates. OAuth clients are provided a mechanism for authentication
    to the authorization server using mutual TLS, based on either self-signed certificates
    or public key infrastructure (PKI). OAuth authorization servers are provided a
    mechanism for binding access tokens to a client's mutual TLS certificate, and
    OAuth protected resources are provided a method for ensuring that such an access
    token presented to it was issued to the client presenting the token.</p>"
