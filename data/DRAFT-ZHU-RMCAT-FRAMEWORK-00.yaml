abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Congestion control is an essential element in ensuring fair
    bandwidth\n   usage and preventing congestion collapse for traffic sharing the\n
    \  Internet.  For interactive real-time media traffic such as video\n   conferencing,
    design of congestion control solution also needs to\n   account for many other
    factors such as the requirement for low\n   latency packet delivery and interactions
    with live video encoder.\n   This document describes a common framework with the
    core functional\n   building blocks for a real-time media congestion solutions.\n\n\t
