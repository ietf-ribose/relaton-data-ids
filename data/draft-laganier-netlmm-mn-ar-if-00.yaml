abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specify an IP layer interface between mobile nodes (MN)and
    access routers (AR) of a network-based localized mobilitymanagement (NetLMM) domain.
    Such an interface is subject to acertain number of threats, amongst which are
    attacks on the mappingbetween the MN Identifier and IPv6 address set. A bindingenforcement
    mechanism between those two is hence required to preventmalicious nodes to carry
    on various attacks like service theft ordenial-of-service attacks. In the absence
    of link-layer specificmechanisms enforcing this binding, it is required to implement
    suchmechanism at the IP layer MN-AR interface. Moreover, it is requiredthat no
    NetLMM specific software support is present on MNs. The IPlayer MN-AR interface
    described in this document fulfills these tworequirements by using the SEND public
    key as the MN identifier, whilebeing solely based on standard track IPv6 protocols
    (DNA and SEND)implemented by non-NetLMM MNs.</p>"
