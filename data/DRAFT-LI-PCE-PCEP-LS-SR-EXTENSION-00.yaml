abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing leverages source routing.  A node steers a
    packet\n   through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by\n   prepending
    the packet with an SR header.  A segment can represent any\n   instruction, topological
    or service-based.  SR allows to enforce a\n   flow through any topological path
    and service chain while maintaining\n   per-flow state only at the ingress node
    of the SR domain.\n\n   IGP protocols have been extended to advertise the segments.
    \ Because\n   of IGP's propagation scope limitation, it is not suited for IGP
    to\n   signal paths that span across AS borders.  This document introduces\n   extensions
    of PCEP-LS to solve the problem without the similar\n   limitation.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
