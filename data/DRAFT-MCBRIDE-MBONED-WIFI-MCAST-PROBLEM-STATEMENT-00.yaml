abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There have been known issues with IP Multicast, in an 802.11\n
    \  environment, which have prevented the deployment of multicast in\n   these
    wifi environments.  The mboned working group would like to\n   gather the problems
    of wifi multicast into one problem statement\n   document so as to offer the community
    guidance on current\n   limitations.\n\t </p>\n      "
