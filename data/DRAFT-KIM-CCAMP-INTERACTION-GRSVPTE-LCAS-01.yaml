abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes interaction aspects between a signaling
    \n   protocol and the LCAS. The signaling protocol handled by IETF could \n   be
    GMPLS RSVP-TE. GMPLS CR-LDP requires further study for this draft. \n   The LCAS
    protocol handled by ITU-T is a protocol that is used to \n   change the bandwidth
    capacity of a virtual concatenated signal used \n   by transport networks (i.e.
    SDH and OTN), which should be initiated\n   only in a unidirection by EMS or NMS
    systems. However, the GMPLS \n   signaling protocol have a feature of being capable
    of controlling bi-\n   directional connections on a LSP. In current, there is
    no interaction \n   between the signaling protocol and the LCAS. In this document,
    when a \n   signaling protocol such as the GMPLS RSVP-TE and the LCAS are used
    \n   together within a single node and a bi-directional connection is \n   required
    on the same route, relevant requirements and encoding \n   methods are identified.\n\t
