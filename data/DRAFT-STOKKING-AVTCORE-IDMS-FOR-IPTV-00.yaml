abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RFC7272] describes the use of RTCP for the purpose of Inter-\n
    \  Destination Media Synchronization (IDMS) between Synchronization\n   Clients
    (SCs) and an Media Synchronization Application Server (MSAS).\n    This document
    extends that work for application in the area of IPTV.\n    First, RTCP can be
    used according to the single source multicast\n   (SSM) principles from [RFC5760]
    in the IPTV application area.  This\n   document specifies the use of a feedback
    target for collecting and\n   possibly summarizing IDMS reports.  For this, the
    document defines 2\n   new sub-report blocks for the use of IDMS according to
    the SSM\n   principles.  Alternatively, the MSAS can be co-located with the\n
    \  Feedback Target, for synchronizing small groups of receivers.\n   Secondly,
    in an IPTV environment, different viewers may receive the\n   same content, but
    in non-identical streams.  The IDMS solution\n   presented in [RFC7272] will no
    longer work in such a case.  This\n   document provides a solution for this.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
