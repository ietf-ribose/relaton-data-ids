abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A set of attacks on SignedData objects have been identified relating
    to the fact that the certificate to be used when verifying the signature in a
    SignerInfo is not cryptographically bound into the signature. This leads to a
    set of attacks where the certificate used to verify the signature is altered leading
    to possible incorrect results. This document describes these attacks and provides
    ways to deal with some of the attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
