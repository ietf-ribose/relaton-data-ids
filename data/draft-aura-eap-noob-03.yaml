abstract:
- content: "<p>Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple
    authentication methods. This document defines the EAP-NOOB authentication method
    for nimble out-of-band (OOB) authentication and key derivation. This EAP method
    is intended for bootstrapping all kinds of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that
    have a minimal user interface and no pre-configured authentication credentials.
    The method makes use of a user-assisted one-directional OOB channel between the
    peer device and authentication server.</p>"
