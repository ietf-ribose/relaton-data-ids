abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Upon link down event or link up event, each device in network\n
    \  individually schedules route calculation.  Because of different\n   hardware
    capabilities and internal/external environments, the time to\n   update forwarding
    entries on these devices are disordered which can\n   cause a transient forwarding
    loop.  This document introduces a method\n   to prevent forwarding loop by adjusting
    link metric gradually for\n   several times.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
