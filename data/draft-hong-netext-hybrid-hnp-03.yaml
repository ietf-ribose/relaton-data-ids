abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) supports multihoming where a mobile nodecan
    connect to a PMIPv6 domain through multiple interfaces forsimultaneous access
    or inter-technology handoff. However, for aninter-technology handoff, PMIPv6 does
    not allow simultaneous accesssince all the home network prefixes associated with
    one interface aredelivered to another interface of a mobile node. In addition,
    if weassume that the flow is classified by home network prefix, then thePMIPv6
    cannot support flow mobility since it requires moving justsome home network prefixes
    between interfaces. In this document, wepropose a hybrid home network prefix assignment
    (HHNPA) scheme whereboth the static prefix model and the dynamic prefix model
    are used.By using these two different home network prefix models, it cansupport
    flow mobility that some home network prefixes are moved toanother interface and
    some home network prefixes are remained atexisting interface.</p>"
