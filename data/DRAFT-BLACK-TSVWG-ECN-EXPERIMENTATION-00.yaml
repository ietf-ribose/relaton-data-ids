abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multiple protocol experiments have been proposed that involve
    changes\n   to Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) as specified in RFC 3168.\n
    \  This memo summarizes the proposed areas of experimentation to provide\n   an
    overview to the Internet community and updates RFC 3168, a\n   Proposed Standard
    RFC, to allow the experiments to proceed without\n   requiring a standards process
    exception for each Experimental RFC to\n   update RFC 3168.  This memo also makes
    related updates to the ECN\n   specification for RTP in RFC 6679 for the same
    reason.  Each\n   experiment is still required to be documented in an Experimental
    RFC.\n   This memo also records the conclusion of the ECN Nonce experiment in\n
    \  RFC 3540, obsoletes RFC 3540 and reclassifies it as Historic.\n\n\t </p>\n
