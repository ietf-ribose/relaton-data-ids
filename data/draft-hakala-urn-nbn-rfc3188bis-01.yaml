abstract:
- content: "<p>National Bibliography Numbers (NBNs) are used by the national libraries
    and other organizations in order to identify resources in their collections. NBNs
    are usually applied to resources that are not catered for by established (standard)
    identifier systems such as ISBN. A URN (Uniform Resource Names) namespace for
    NBNs was established in 2001 in RFC 3188. Since then, a number of European national
    libraries have implemented URN:NBN-based systems. This document replaces RFC 3188
    and defines how NBNs can be supported within the updated URN framework. A revised
    namespace registration (version 4) compliant to RFC 8141 is included.</p>"
