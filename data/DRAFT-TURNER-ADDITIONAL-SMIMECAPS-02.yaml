abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document lists values for the S/MIME Capabilities Attribute.
    \ \n   The attribute itself is defined in RFC TBD1, but the values for each \n
    \  are defined in separate algorithm documents and in some cases not at \n   all.
    \ The SMIME Capability values can be included in S/MIME messages \n   as a signed
    attribute and in public key certificates as an extension. \n\n   //RFC EDITOR:
    Replace TBD1 with the # assigned to draft-ietf-smime-\n   3851bis-10.txt. \n\t
    </p>\n      "
