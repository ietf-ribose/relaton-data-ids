abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes an extension of  the Quality of Service
    \ (QoS)\narchitecture to support differentiated resilience requirements of  IP\nservices.\nSeveral
    \ architectures  offering  Quality  of  Service  in   IP-based\nnetworks are defined
    by  the IETF community.  The two most  important\nof  them  are  the  Integrated
    \ Services  (IntServ)  model  with  the\nResource Reservation  Protocol (RSVP)
    \ as the  recommended  signaling\nprotocol and the Differentiated Services (DiffServ)
    model.  Recently,\nMultiprotocol Label  Switching  (MPLS) emerged  introducing
    \ extended\ntraffic engineering methods  into IP and  therefore also may  support\nQoS.\nDue
    to  the growing  commercial importance  of the  Internet and  the\ntransport of
    mission-critical services,  survivability became a  main\nservice requirement
    in addition to the traditional QoS.\n\t </p>\n      "
