abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft introduces Multicast Control Protocol (MCOP) that may
    be\nused as a tool for multicast network management.  MCOP provides\nmulticast
    network remote management with centralized information\ndatabase located at Multicast
    Control Server (MCS).  It allows\ngradual, group and network specific multicast
    network deployment.\nMCOP protocol is used between MCS and routers that have directly\nconnected
    multicast sources or receivers.  The actual control is done\nby MCOP enabled routers
    based on the information received from the\nMCS.  MCOP router can filter IGMP/MLD
    reports and multicast packets\nbefore they reach the IGMP/MLD processing layer
    or multicast routing\nstack of the router.  MCOP is independent of multicast routing\nprotocols.\n\t
