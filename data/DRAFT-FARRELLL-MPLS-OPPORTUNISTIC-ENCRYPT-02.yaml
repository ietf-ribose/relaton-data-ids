abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a way to apply opportunistic encryption\n
    \  between adjacent nodes on an MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) or\n   between
    end points of an LSP.  It explains how keys may be exchanged\n   to enable the
    encryption, and indicates how key identifiers are\n   exchanged in encrypted MPLS
    packets.  Finally, this document\n   describes the applicability of opportunistic
    encryption in MPLS\n   networks with an indication of the level of improved security
    as well\n   as the continued vulnerabilities.\n\n   This document does not describe
    security for MPLS control plane\n   protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
