abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the Extensible Authentication Protocol
    (EAP),\n   an authentication framework which supports multiple authentication\n
    \  methods.  EAP typically runs directly over data link layers such as\n   Point-to-Point
    Protocol (PPP), IEEE 802, or 3GPP 5G without requiring\n   IP.  EAP provides its
    own support for duplicate elimination and\n   retransmission, but is reliant on
    lower layer ordering guarantees.\n   Fragmentation is not supported within EAP
    itself; however, individual\n   EAP methods may support this.\n\n   This document
    obsoletes RFC 3748, which in turn obsoleted RFC 2284.\n   This document updates
    some of the security considerations, terms,\n   references, the IANA considerations,
    and few other minor updates.  A\n   summary of the changes between this document
    and RFC 3748 is in\n   Appendix A, and the changes from RFC 2284 were listed in
    RFC 3748.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
