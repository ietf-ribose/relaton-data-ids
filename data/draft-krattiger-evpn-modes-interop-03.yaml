abstract:
  content: "<p>Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides different functional modes in the area
    of Service Interface, Integrated Route and Bridge (IRB) and IRB Core connectivity.
    This document specifies how the different EVPN functional modes and types can
    interoperate with each other. This document doesn't aim to redefine the existing
    functional modes but extend them for interoperability.</p>"
