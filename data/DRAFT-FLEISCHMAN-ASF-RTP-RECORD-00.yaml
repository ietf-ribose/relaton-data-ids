abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies two approaches by which multimedia data
    (e.g.,\nMBone conferences), transmitted using the Real-Time Protocol (RTP), may\nbe
    recorded to Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) files. The first method\nrequires
    a minimum amount of buffering at the recording station but\nresults in recordings
    which identically preserve the received content\nincluding out of order packets,
    network ''jitter'', etc. The second\napproach requires buffering at the recording
    station but results in\nenhanced recordings (i.e., higher percentage of correctly
    ordered\npackets, elimination of a percentage of received jitter, potential\nrecovery
    of a percentage of lost packets). Both approaches record all\nreceived RTP content
    and the relevant subset of RTCP information. This\nrecording occurs transparently
    to the MBone conference or RTP session,\nand does not involve any alterations
    to normal RTP, RTCP, or ASF use.\n\t </p>\n      "
