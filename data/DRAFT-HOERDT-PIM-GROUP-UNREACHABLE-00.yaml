abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, PIM-SM is the most widely deployed multicast routing\n
    \  protocol in the Internet.  However in IPv6 this multicast protocol\n   lacks
    a simple connectivity debugging tool, making it difficult to\n   identify multicast
    routing problems.  When a host wants to receive a\n   multicast group or channel,
    if the corresponding PIM-Join message\n   cannot be propagated in the network,
    nothing exists to inform the\n   receiver or the network about this failure.  We
    propose a simple\n   error notification message based on ICMP/ICMP6 which is able
    to\n   indicate where and why the error happened in the network without\n   using
    a multicast traceroute mechanism.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
