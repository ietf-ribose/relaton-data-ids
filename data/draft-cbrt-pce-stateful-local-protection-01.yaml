abstract:
- content: "<p>Stateful PCE [RFC8231] can apply global concurrent optimizations to
    optimize LSP placement. In a deployment where a PCE is used to compute all the
    paths, it may be beneficial for the local protection paths to also be computed
    by the PCE. This document defines extensions needed for the setup and management
    of RSVP-TE protection paths by the PCE.</p>"
