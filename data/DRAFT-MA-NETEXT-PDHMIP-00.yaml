abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document explains how network mobility and DHCPv6-based
    Prefix\n   Delegation works with hierarchy mobile IPv6.  It is an extension of\n
    \  HMIPv6 and allows a mobile network to attach to a MAP via a mobile\n   router.
    \ It also makes use of the mechanism of DHCPv6PD to assign\n   mobile network
    prefix (es) to the mobile router which plays the role\n   of requesting router.\n\n\t
