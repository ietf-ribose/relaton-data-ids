abstract:
- content: "<p>Extension Headers (EH) carry information on in-network services and
    functions in an MPLS network. This document describes an architecture for EHs
    and what actions an EH capable Label Switching Router (LSR) takes when finding
    or not finding an EH in the packet. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a
    widely deployed forwarding technology. It uses label stack entries that are pre-pended
    to either the EH or the ACH which in turn is pre-pended to the payload. The label
    stack entries are used to identify the forwarding actions by each LSR. Actions
    may include pushing, swapping or popping the labels, and using the labels to determine
    the next hop for forwarding the packet. Labels may also be used to establish the
    context under which the packet is forwarded. The extension headers are carried
    after the MPLS Label Stack, and the presence of EHs are indicated in the label
    stack by an Extension Header Indicator (EHI).</p>"
