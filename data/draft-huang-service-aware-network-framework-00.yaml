abstract:
- content: "<p>Cloud has been migrating from concentrated center sites to edge nodes
    with responsive and agile services to the subscribers. This industry-wide trend
    would be reasonably expected to continue into the future which would enjoy geographically
    ubiquitous services. Rather than transmitting service data streams to the stable
    and limited service locations such as centered cloud sites, routing and forwarding
    network will have to adapt to the emerging scenarios where the service instances
    would be highly dynamic and distributed, and further more, demand more fine-grained
    networking policies than the current routing and forwarding scheme unaware of
    service SLA requirements. This proposal is to demonstrate a framework under which
    the above-mentioned requirements would be satisfied.</p>"
