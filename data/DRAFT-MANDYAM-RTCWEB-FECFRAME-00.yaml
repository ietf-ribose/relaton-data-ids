abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   WebRTC provides a solution for peer-to-peer streaming between
    web\n   applications by leveraging a Real-Time Protocol (RTP) stream between\n
    \  two clients.  This RTP stream is expected to be sent over an UDP\n   (Universal
    Datagram Protocol) connection, which by definition has no\n   built-in reliability.
    \ Recently the FEC FRAME Working Group of the\n   IETF has come up with a framework
    and technical recommendations for\n   applying forward error correction (FEC)
    to unreliable streams.  This\n   framework can be applied to WebRTC with minimal
    changes to the\n   specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
