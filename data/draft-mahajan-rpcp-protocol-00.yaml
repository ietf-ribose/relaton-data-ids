abstract:
  content: "\t <t>RPCP is a generic interface protocol between two entities, whereone
    entity acting as Resource Pool (RP) and other being theResource Pool Controller
    (RPC). The RP entity in turn may beacting as RPC for other RPs in a hierarchical
    manner. The resourcebeing defined can be any hardware/software, physical/virtualresource.In
    today's telecommunication world, the intelligence is beingmoved away from the
    hardware (the embedded platform) or theswitching fabric to a more generic computing
    resource (high-endservers). These computing resources controls the call logic,service
    logic and the network signalling part. This implies thatthere is a need for an
    open interface protocol by which callagents or signalling agents can control this
    rather dumb hardwareas resource pools. This helps in easy and smooth integration
    ofthese entities even if they come from different vendors.The Interworking and
    Gateway market is a very big market today.The network architecture proposed for
    these solutions carries theintelligence away from the resource pools (also called
    mediagateways) to call agents or pool controllers (also called mediagateway controllers).
    With such network architectures the needfor such a protocol is more prominent.There
    are many other needs and use of such a protocol which willbe discussed in detail
    in this white paper. This paper does nottry to define the complete protocol, however
    the basic definitionand the protocol architecture will be defined.The document
    first describes the application of Resource PoolControl protocol, followed by
    requirements from this Protocol andthen defines the Protocol Architecture with
    basic protocoldefinition. The annexure of the document gives few examples onRPCP
    usage.</p>"
