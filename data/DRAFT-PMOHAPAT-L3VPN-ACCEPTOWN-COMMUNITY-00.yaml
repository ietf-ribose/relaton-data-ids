abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Under certain conditions it is desirable for a BGP route reflector
    to\nbe able to modify the Route Target list of a VPN route that is\ndistributed
    by the route reflector, enabling the route reflector to\ncontrol how a route originated
    within one VRF is imported into other\nVRFs.  This technique works effectively
    as long as the VRF that\nexports the route is not on the same PE as the VRF(s)
    that import the\nroute. However, due to the constraints of the BGP protocol, it
    does\nnot work if the two are on the same PE.\n\nThis document describes a modification
    to the BGP protocol allowing\nthis technique to work when the VRFs are on the
    same PE, allowing the\ntechnique to be used in a standard manner throughout an
    autonomous\nsystem.\n\t </p>\n      "
