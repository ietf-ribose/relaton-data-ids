abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SIIT-DC, an extension to Stateless IP/ICMP
    Translation (SIIT) [RFC6145] that makes it ideally suited for use in IPv6 data
    centre environments. SIIT-DC simultaneously facilitates IPv6 deployment and IPv4
    address conservation. The overall SIIT-DC architecture is described, as well as
    guidelines for operators. Finally, the normative implementation requirements are
    described, as a list of additions and changes to SIIT [RFC6145].</p>"
