abstract:
- content: <p>This specification updates the requirements for adding new entries to
    the IANA Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Parameters registry. Currently, the requirement
    is generally for "IETF Review", as defined in RFC 8126, although a few portions
    of the registry require "Standards Action". This specification will change that
    former requirement to "Expert Review".</p>
