abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cable modems based on the DOCSIS(R) specification provide broadband\n
    \  Internet access to over one hundred million users worldwide.  In some\n   cases,
    the cable modem connection is the bottleneck (lowest speed)\n   link between the
    customer and the Internet.  As a result, the impact\n   of buffering and bufferbloat
    in the cable modem can have a\n   significant effect on user experience.  The
    CableLabs DOCSIS 3.1\n   specification introduces requirements for cable modems
    to support an\n   Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithm that is intended to
    alleviate\n   the impact that buffering has on latency sensitive traffic, while\n
    \  preserving bulk throughput performance.  In addition, the CableLabs\n   DOCSIS
    3.0 specifications have also been amended to contain similar\n   requirements.
    \ This document describes the requirements on Active\n   Queue Management that
    apply to DOCSIS equipment, including a\n   description of the \"DOCSIS-PIE\" algorithm
    that is required on DOCSIS\n   3.1 cable modems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
