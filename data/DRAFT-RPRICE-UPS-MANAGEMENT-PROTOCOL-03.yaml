abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This text describes the command/response protocol currently
    used in\n   the management of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units and other\n
    \  power devices often deployed in small offices, and in IT\n   installations
    subject to an erratic public power supply.  The UPS\n   units typically interface
    to an Attachment Daemon in the system they\n   protect.  This daemon is in turn
    polled by a Management Daemon which\n   notifies users and system administrators
    of power supply incidents,\n   and takes system shutdown decisions.  The commands
    and responses\n   described by this text are exchanged between the UPS Attachment\n
    \  Daemon and the Management Daemon.  Current practice leads to weak\n   security
    and this is addressed in the Security and IANA\n   Considerations.\n\n\t </p>\n
