abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a transport-layer mobility solution for
    the\nInternet termed Cellular SCTP, or cSCTP for short, based on the\nemerging
    Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). We suggested to\nuse `two primary
    addresses simultaneously' by duplicating the packet\ntransmissions (while halving
    the transmission rate) during handoff to\nprovide `soft' handover. Moreover, we
    described the inter-working of\ncSCTP with Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to
    facilitate location\nmanagement function when Correspondent Nodes (CNs) initiate
    the\nassociations and need to locate Mobile Nodes (MNs).\n\t </p>\n      "
