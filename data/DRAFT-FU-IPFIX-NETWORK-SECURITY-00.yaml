abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPFIX protocol has been used to carry Information Elements,
    which are\n   defined to measure the traffic information and information related
    to\n   the traffic observation point, traffic metering process and the\n   exporting
    process.  Network or device status are checked through\n   analysing neccessary
    observed information.  Although most of the\n   existing Information Elements
    are useful for network security\n   inspection, they are still not sufficient
    to determine the reasons\n   behind observed events such as for DDOS attack, ICMP
    attack, and\n   fragment attack.  To allow administrators making effective and
    quick\n   response to the attacks, this document extends the standard\n   Information
    Elements and describes the formats for inspecting network\n   security.\n\n\t
