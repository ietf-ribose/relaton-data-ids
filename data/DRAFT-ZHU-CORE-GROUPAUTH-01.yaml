abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The group communication is designed for the communication of
    Internet\n   of Things. A threat is identified in [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm] that\n
    \  current DTLS based approach is unicast oriented and there is no\n   supporting
    on group authentication feature. Unicast oriented\n   authentication will causing
    serious burden when a large number of\n   terminal nodes will be involved inevitably.
    In another aspect, some\n   terminals will own the same characteristics, such
    as owning same\n   features, in the same place, working in the same time, etc.
    With this\n   mechanism, all terminals can be authenticated together with little\n
    \  signaling and calculation at the same time. It will reduce the\n   network
    burden and save time. This draft describes the security of\n   group authentication
    and an group authentication implementation\n   method for the Internet of things.\n\n\t
