abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft presents the work on the framework for the ResourceManagement
    in Diffserv (RMD) designed for edge-to-edge resourcereservation in a Differentiated
    Services (Diffserv) domain. The RMDextends the Diffserv architecture with new
    resource reservationconcepts and features. Moreover, this framework enhances the
    LoadControl protocol described in [WeTu00].The RMD framework defines two architectural
    concepts:- the Per Hop Reservation (PHR)- the Per Domain Reservation (PDR)The
    PHR protocol is used within a Diffserv domain on a per-hop basisto augment the
    Diffserv Per Hop Behavior (PHB) with resourcereservation. It is implemented in
    all nodes in a Diffserv domain. Onthe other hand, the PDR protocol manages the
    resource reservation perDiffserv domain, relying on the PHR resource reservation
    status inall nodes. The PDR is only implemented at the boundary of the domain(at
    the edge nodes).The RMD framework presented in this draft describes the newreservation
    concepts and features. Furthermore it describes the:- relationship between the
    PHR and PHB- interaction between the PDR and PHR- interoperability between the
    PDR and external resourcereservation schemesThis framework is an open framework
    in the sense that it provides thebasis for interoperability with other resource
    reservation schemesand can be applied in different types of networks as long as
    they areDiffserv domains. It aims at extreme simplicity and low cost ofimplementation
    along with good scaling properties.</p>"
