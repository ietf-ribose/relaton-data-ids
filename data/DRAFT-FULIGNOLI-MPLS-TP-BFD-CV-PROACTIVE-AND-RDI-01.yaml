abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Several documents on BFD based OAM for MPLS-TP has been put \n
    \  forward and the dependencies between those drafts are not yet \n   fully sorted
    out; this document is one of these drafts. It is \n   published in now to make
    ideas, motivations and approaches \n   available. However we expect the final
    BFD based solution for \n   MPLS-TP will be a cooperation of the parties between
    the \n   existing drafts and that the BFD based OAM solution for MPLS-TP \n   will
    merge into an agreed set of drafts approved by the MEAD \n   team.  \n\n   This
    document specifies the BFD extension and behaviour to meet \n   the requirements
    for MPLS-TP proactive Continuity Check and \n   Connectivity Verification functionality
    and the RDI \n   functionality as defined in [3].\n\t </p>\n      "
