abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a new perspective for the solution design
    of\n   enhanced mobility anchoring in a distributed mobility management\n   deployment.
    Based on the definition of anchor function, location\n   management function,
    and forwarding management function in RFC7429,\n   we propose four cases of distributed
    deployment models and\n   enhanced anchoring models over them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
