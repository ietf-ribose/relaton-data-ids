abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Following the recent pervasive monitoring revelations, one
    of the\n   discussed remedies has been opportunistic encryption.  In this paper,\n
    \  we give an overview of various opportunistic and unauthenticated\n   encryption
    techniques, discuss their benefits, limits, and\n   disadvantages, and try to
    conclude how effective they are as a mean\n   to thwart pervasive monitoring.\n\n\t
