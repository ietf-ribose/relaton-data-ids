abstract:
- content: "<p>EVPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
    over an MPLS/IP network for intra-subnet connectivity among Tenant Systems and
    End Devices that can be physical or virtual. EVPN multihoming with IRB is one
    of the common deployment scenarios. There are deployments which requires capability
    to have multiple subnets designated with multiple VLAN IDs in single bridge domain.
    [RFC7432] defines three different type of service interface which serve different
    requirements but none of them address the requirement to be able to support multiple
    subnets within single bridge domain. In this draft we define new service interface
    type to support multiple subnets in single bridge domain. Service interface proposed
    in this draft will be applicable to multihoming case only.</p>"
