abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Crypto-conditions provide a mechanism to describe a signed
    message\n   such that multiple actors in a distributed system can all verify the\n
    \  same signed message and agree on whether it matches the description.\n   This
    provides a useful primitive for event-based systems that are\n   distributed on
    the Internet since we can describe events in a\n   standard deterministic manner
    (represented by signed messages) and\n   therefore define generic authenticated
    event handlers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
