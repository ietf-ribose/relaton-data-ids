abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet is suffering from severe DoS and DDoS attacks,
    and IP\n   spoofing is one common used method to do DoS and DDoS attacks.  IP\n
    \  spoofing refers to that attackers send packets with forged source IP\n   addresses.
    \ In this memo, we propose one new approach of preventing\n   IP spoofing, which
    we name PISL.  The PISL-enabled router generates\n   the incoming table for source
    addresses using link state database,\n   which exists in two most widely used
    intra-domain protocols:  OSPF\n   and IS-IS.  In this memo, we only describe PISL
    in the OSPF\n   environment.  The PISL-enabled router determines that a packet
    is\n   spoofed if the packet arrives at an invalid incoming interface.  PISL\n
    \  only uses the existing information and does not impose new control\n   messages,
    so it is easy to be deployed.  We have conducted simple\n   simulation, which
    shows the high effectiveness of PISL:  even if PISL\n   is only deployed in 10%
    of all OSPF routers in a network, 80%~99% of\n   spoofing cases in the network
    can be detected.\n\n   Requirements\n\t </p>\n      "
