abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Often with SIP a request can only be routed over an existing\n
    \  connection or flow, such as when there is a firewall or network\n   address
    translation (NAT) device in the network path.  TLS is also\n   affected when the
    user agent (UA) does not have a certificate\n   suitable for mutual TLS authentication.
    \ This draft addresses how\n   user agents and proxies need to behave to work
    in these environments.\n   This work shows how existing SIP mechanisms can be
    used to allow the\n   UA to register multiple times over different connections
    or flows and\n   the proxies can use the instance-id in the contact header to
    identify\n   that the multiple flows go to the same UA.  It can then choose which\n
    \  flow to use to route requests to this UA.\n\t </p>\n      "
