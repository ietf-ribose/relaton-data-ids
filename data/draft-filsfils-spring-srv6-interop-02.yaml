abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) can be applied to the IPv6 data plane by leveraging
    a new type of routing extension header, called Segment Routing Header (SRH). An
    SRH contains an ordered list, or sequence, of segments representing topological
    or service-based instructions, or any combination of those. This draft provides
    an overview of IPv6 Segment Routing (SRv6) implementations and interoperability.
    It makes an inventory of the various pieces of hardware and software that have
    been demonstrated to support the processing of an SRH, and details some interoperability
    scenarios that have been showcased at a public event.</p>"
