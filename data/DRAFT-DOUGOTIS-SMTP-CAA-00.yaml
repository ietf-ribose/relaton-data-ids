abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The helo/ehlo domain reported by a client at the beginning
    of an SMTP\n   [RFC2821] session has largely been ignored without reliable means
    to\n   verify this information.  To properly recognize a domain sending\n   mail,
    the domain of the client must be verifiable.  This document\n   utilizes a DNS
    SRV record that extends the definitions for fields of\n   this record as defined
    in [RFC2782] where the label becomes unique by\n   appending a label of \"__caa\"
    following the Proto field.  Server\n   verification of permitted client addresses
    becomes possible as a\n   method to confirm the domain of a client without having
    prior\n   information shared.  Cooperation between client and server domains\n
    \  utilizing this method exclude third party masquerades as originating\n   from
    within cooperative domains. Initially only a notice of Unknown\n   or Unconfirmed
    will be added to mail from uncooperative domains\n   unless the domain is determined
    to be not valid, where then the mail\n   will be refused.  This added notice provides
    assurance the server is\n   checking client domains in addition to alerting users
    to the level of\n   mail compliance on received mail.  Once use of this method
    is common\n   practice in conjunction with other means for confirming the client\n
    \  domain, mail may be refused if the client and/or domain fails these\n   confirmation
    checks.\n\t </p>\n      "
