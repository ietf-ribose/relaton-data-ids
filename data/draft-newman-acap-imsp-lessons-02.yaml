abstract:
- content: "<p>IMSP (Internet Message Support Protocol) [IMSP] was designed and implemented
    to supply the support functions necessary for a large scale IMAP4 based infrastructure
    with highly mobile users. Although the protocol was successful in its mission,
    it was realized that a slightly different approach could achieve more for the
    Internet Standards community. Thus was born the idea for ACAP (Application Configuration
    Access Protocol) [ACAP].</p>"
