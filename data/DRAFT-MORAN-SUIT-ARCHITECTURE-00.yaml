abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Vulnerabilities with IoT devices have raised the need for a
    solid and\n   secure firmware update mechanism that is also suitable for\n   constrained
    devices.  Incorporating such update mechanism to fix\n   vulnerabilities, to update
    configuration settings as well as adding\n   new functionality is recommended
    by security experts.\n\n   This document specifies requires and an architecture
    for a firmware\n   update mechanism aimed for Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
    \ The\n   architecture is agnostic to the transport of the firmware images and\n
    \  associated meta-data.\n\n   This version of the document assumes asymmetric
    cryptography and a\n   public key infrastructure.  Future versions may also describe
    a\n   symmetric key approach for very constrained devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
