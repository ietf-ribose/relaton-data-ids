abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL facilitates loop free connectivity to non TRILL legacy\n
    \  networks via choice of an Appointed Forwarder for set of VLANs.\n   Appointed
    Forwarder provides VLAN level load sharing with active-\n   standby model. Mission
    critical operations such as High Performance\n   Data Centers require active-active
    load sharing model. Active-Active\n   load sharing model can be accomplished by
    representing any given non\n   TRILL legacy network with a single virtual RBridge.
    Virtual\n   representation of the non-TRILL legacy network with a single RBridge\n
    \  poses serious challenges in multi-destination RPF calculations. This\n   document
    presents the required enhancements to build Coordinated\n   Multicast Trees (CMT)
    within the TRILL campus to solve related RPF\n   issues. CMT provides flexibility
    to RBridges to select desired path\n   of association to a given distribution
    tree.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
