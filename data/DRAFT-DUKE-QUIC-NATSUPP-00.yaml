abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Address Translators (NATs) are widely deployed to share\n
    \  scarce public IPv4 addresses among mutiple end hosts.  They overwrite\n   IP
    addresses and ports in IP packets to do so.  QUIC is a protocol on\n   top of
    UDP that provides transport-like services.  QUIC is better-\n   behaved in the
    presence of NATs than older protocols, and existing\n   UDP NATs should operate
    without incident if unmodified.  QUIC offers\n   additional features that may
    tempt NAT implementers as potential\n   optimizations.  However, in practice,
    leveraging these features will\n   lead to new connection failure modes and security
    vulnerabilities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
