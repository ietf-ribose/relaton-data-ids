abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) is a map-and-encap\n
    \  mechanism to enable communications between hosts identified with\n   their
    Endpoint IDentifier (EID) over the Internet where EIDs are not\n   routable.  To
    do so, packets toward EIDs are encapsulated in packets\n   with routing locators
    (RLOCs) to form dynamic tunnels.  An Ingress\n   Tunnel Router (ITR) that encapsulates
    EID packets determines tunnel\n   endpoints via mappings that associate EIDs to
    RLOCs.  Before\n   encapsulating a packet, the ITR queries the mapping system
    to obtain\n   the mapping associated to the EID of the packet it must encapsulate.\n
    \  Such mapping is cached by the ITR in its local EID-to-RLOC Cache for\n   any
    subsequent encapsulation for the same EID.  LISP is scalable\n   because EID-to-RLOC
    mappings are cached on ITRs.  Initially, the\n   cache is empty and is populated
    progressively according to the\n   traffic traversing the ITR.  However, after
    an ITR is restarted,\n   e.g., for maintenance reason, its cache is empty which
    means that all\n   packets that are re-routed to the freshly restarted ITR will
    cause\n   cache misses and a potentially high loss rate.  In this draft, we\n
    \  present mechanisms to reduce the negative impact on traffic caused by\n   the
    restart of an ITR in a LISP network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
