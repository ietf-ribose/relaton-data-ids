abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of
    standard\n   Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing\n
    \  communication.  The security needs for the IoT are well-recognized\n   and
    many standardization steps for providing security have been\n   taken, for example,
    the specification of Constrained Application\n   Protocol (CoAP) over Datagram
    Transport Layer Security (DTLS).\n   However, security challenges still exist
    and there are some use cases\n   that lack a suitable solution.  In this document,
    we first discuss\n   the various stages in the lifecycle of a thing.  Next, we
    document\n   the various security threats to a thing and the challenges that one\n
    \  might face to protect against these threats.  Lastly, we discuss the\n   next
    steps needed to facilitate the deployment of secure IoT systems.\n\n   This document
    is a product of the IRTF Thing-to-Thing Research Group\n   (T2TRG).\n\n\t </p>\n
