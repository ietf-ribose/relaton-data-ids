abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In some circumstances, it is useful and desirable for the sender
    ofan RTP stream to be able to deliver a subset of its RTP packetsreliably. One
    example of this is a video codec which can encode avideo stream such that decoder
    state can be maintained using just asubset of the packets encoded. However, existing
    RTP reliabilitymechanisms only define mechanisms which retransmit all the packets
    ofan RTP stream.This document describes a mechanism by which the sender of an
    RTPstream can mark a subset of the packets of an RTP stream as high-priority recoverable
    packets, and by which the receiver of the streamcan request retransmission of
    the high-priority packets.</p>"
