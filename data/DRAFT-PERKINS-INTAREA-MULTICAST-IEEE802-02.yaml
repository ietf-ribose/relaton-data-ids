abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some performance issues have been observed when multicast packet\n
    \  transmissions of IETF protocols are used over IEEE 802 wireless\n   media.
    \ Even though enhamcements for multicast transmissions have\n   been designed
    at both IETF and IEEE 802, there seems to exist a\n   disconnect between specifications,
    implementations and configuration\n   choices.\n\n   This draft describes the
    different issues that have been observed,\n   the multicast enhancement features
    that have been specified at IETF\n   and IEEE 802 for wireless media, as well
    as the operational chioces\n   that can be taken to improve the performace of
    the network.  Finally,\n   it provides some recommendations about the usage and
    combination of\n   these features and operational choices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
