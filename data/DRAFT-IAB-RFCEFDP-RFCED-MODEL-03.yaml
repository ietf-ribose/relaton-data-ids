abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes updated processes for defining and\n
    \  implementing policies regarding the RFC Series as a whole and thus\n   specifies
    version 3 of RFC Editor Model.  As specified here, the\n   model divides the responsibilities
    for the RFC Series into two high-\n   level tasks.  Policy definition is the responsibility
    of the RFC\n   Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces policy proposals that
    are\n   subject to approval by the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB).  Policy\n
    \  implementation is primarily the responsibility of the RFC Production\n   Center
    (RPC), under the ultimate authority of the IETF Administration\n   Limited Liability
    Company (IETF LLC).\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 8728.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
