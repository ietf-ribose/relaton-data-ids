abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a YANG data model for security management that
    is based on Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) by using Network Functions
    Virtualization (NFV). This document proposes a security management architecture
    based on I2NSF framework. Note that the I2NSF framework consists of I2NSF User,
    Security Management System (i.e., Security Controller and Developer's Management
    System), and the instances of Network Security Functions (NSFs) in the lowest
    layer of the framework. I2NSF User consists of Application Logic, Policy Updater,
    and Event Collector. Security Controller consists of Security Policy Manager and
    NSF Capability Manager. This document explains a data model to perform the missions
    for a security service (i.e., VoIP-VoLTE) in I2NSF security management system.</p>"
