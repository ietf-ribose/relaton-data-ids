abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This documents covers issues of spam reporting by the general
    public.\n\n   The Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) was originally developed for use
    by\n   large operators.  However, abuse reporting is also useful for medium\n
    \  and small operators.  The need to automate abuse reporting originates\n   from
    the volume of spam, not the size of the operators.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
