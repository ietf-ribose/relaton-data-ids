abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document, a convergence layer for CCNx and NDN over
    IEEE\n   802.15.4 LoWPAN networks is defined.  A new frame format is specified\n
    \  to adapt CCNx and NDN packets to the small MTU size of IEEE 802.15.4.\n   For
    that, syntactic and semantic changes to the TLV-based header\n   formats are described.
    \ To support compatibility with other LoWPAN\n   technologies that may coexist
    on a wireless medium, the dispatching\n   scheme provided by 6LoWPAN is extended
    to include new dispatch types\n   for CCNx and NDN.  Additionally, the link fragmentation
    component of\n   the 6LoWPAN dispatching framework is applied to ICN chunks.  Basic\n
    \  improvements in efficiency are advised by stateless and stateful\n   compression
    schemes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
