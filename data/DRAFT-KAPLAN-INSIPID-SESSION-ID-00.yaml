abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This RFC, which contains the text of an individual Internet
    Draft\n   that was submitted originally to the DISPATCH Working Group, is\n   being
    published now for the historical record and to provide a\n   reference for later
    RFCs.  The original Abstract follows.\n\n   There is a need for having a globally
    unique session identifier for\n   the same SIP session, which can be consistently
    maintained across\n   Proxies, B2BUAs and other SIP middle-boxes, for the purpose
    of\n   Troubleshooting.  This draft proposes a new SIP header to carry such\n
    \  a value: Session-ID.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
