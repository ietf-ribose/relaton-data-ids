abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a fault detection\n
    \  protocol that can quickly determine a communication failure between\n   devices
    and notify upper-layer applications [RFC5880].  BFD has\n   asynchronous detecting
    mode and demand detection mode to satisfy\n   different scenarios, also supports
    echo function to reduce the device\n   requirement for BFD.  One-Arm BFD this
    draft descripted supports\n   another BFD detecting function rather than the echo
    as described in\n   [RFC5880] [RFC5881], it needs nothing BFD capability to one
    of the\n   devices deployed BFD detecting.  Using One-Arm BFD function, the one\n
    \  device works on BFD detecting normally and the other device just\n   loopback
    the BFD packets like echo function.  One-Arm BFD is suitable\n   for the cloud
    virtualization network, the One-Arm BFD is deploy on\n   NFV gateways, and NFV
    virtual machine vNICs just enable the echo/\n   loopback process.\n\n\t </p>\n
