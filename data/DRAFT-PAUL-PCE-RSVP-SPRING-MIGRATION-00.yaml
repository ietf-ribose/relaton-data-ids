abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a SDN environment, path computation element protocol(PCEP)(RFC
    5440)\n   is used between a controller and the network devices, using which controller\n
    \  can setup and tear down Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) based label\n
    \  switched paths(LSPs) in the network having Path Computation Client (PCC)\n
    \  as Label Switched Router (LSR). Draft draft-sivabalan-pce-segment-routing\n
    \  extends PCEP specification in order to support setup and teardown of\n   Segment
    Routing(SR) Label Switched Path(LSR). In a mixed environment where\n   some of
    the LSPs are setup using PCEP use RSVP and some LSPs are based on\n   Segment
    routing(SR). The specifications lacks a method to advertise the\n   LSP preference
    to use one type of LSP over other when those are setup\n   using PCEP. This draft
    defines a method to advertise the preference for any\n   LSP setup by PCEP.\n\n
    \  This document proposes new optional TLV that can be used to announce\n   the
    preference of LSP which is being setup using PCEP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
