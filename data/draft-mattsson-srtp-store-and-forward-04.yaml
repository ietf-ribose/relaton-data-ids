abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) was designed to allowsimple
    and efficient protection of RTP. To provide this, encryptionand authentication
    of media and control signaling are tightly coupledto the RTP session, and the
    information in the RTP header. Hence, ingeneral, it is not possible to perform
    store-and-forward of protectedmedia using SRTP.This document gives, based on a
    use case analysis, requirements thatSRTP and new SRTP transforms need to satisfy
    in order to allow securestore-and-forward operation. A first outline on how to
    introduce theneeded new functionality and transforms in SRTP is also presented.</p>"
