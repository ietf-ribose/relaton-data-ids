abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   During IETF meetings, individual volunteers often help sessions
    run\n   more smoothly by relaying information back and forth between the\n   physical
    meeting room and an associated textual chatroom.  Such\n   volunteers, commonly
    called \"Jabber scribes\", might benefit from the\n   suggestions provided in
    this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
