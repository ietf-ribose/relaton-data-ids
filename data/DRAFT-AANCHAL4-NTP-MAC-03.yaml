abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) RFC 5905 [RFC5905] uses a message\n
    \  authentication code (MAC) to cryptographically authenticate its UDP\n   packets.
    \ Currently, NTP packets are authenticated by appending a\n   128-bit key to the
    NTP data, and hashing the result with MD5 to\n   obtain a 128-bit tag.  However,
    as discussed in [BCK] and [RFC6151],\n   this is not a secure MAC.  As such, this
    draft considers different\n   secure MAC algorithms for use with NTP, evaluates
    their performance,\n   and recommends the use of CMAC-AES [RFC4493].  We also
    suggest\n   deprecating the use of MD5 as defined in [RFC5905] for authenticating\n
    \  NTP packets.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
