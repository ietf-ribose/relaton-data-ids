abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft provides a detailed description of the Rate-Halvingalgorithm.
    As specified by RFC2581, Fast Recovery adjusts thecongestion window (cwnd) by
    transmitting new data only during thesecond half of the recovery interval. The
    Rate-Halving algorithmadjusts the congestion window by spacing transmissions at
    the rate ofone data segment per two segments acknowledged over the entirerecovery
    period, thereby sustaining the self-clocking of TCP andavoiding a burst. Since
    it is largely independent of the details ofthe data retransmission strategy, the
    Rate-Halving algorithm can beused with several standard and experimental TCP implementations:NewReno,
    SACK, and ECN.</p>"
