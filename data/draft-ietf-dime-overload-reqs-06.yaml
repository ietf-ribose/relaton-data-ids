abstract:
- content: "<p>When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be
    able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to reduce sending
    traffic for some period of time. Otherwise, it must continue to expend resources
    parsing and responding to Diameter messages, possibly resulting in congestion
    collapse. The existing Diameter mechanisms, listed in Section 3 are not sufficient
    for this purpose. This document describes the limitations of the existing mechanisms
    in Section 4. Requirements for new overload management mechanisms are provided
    in Section 7.</p>"
