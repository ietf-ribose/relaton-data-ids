abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes the format of a manifest. A manifest is
    a bundle of metadata about code/data obtained by a recipient (chiefly the firmware
    for an IoT device), where to find the that code/data, the devices to which it
    applies, and cryptographic information protecting the manifest. Software updates
    and Trusted Invocation both tend to use sequences of common operations, so the
    manifest encodes those sequences of operations, rather than declaring the metadata.</p>"
