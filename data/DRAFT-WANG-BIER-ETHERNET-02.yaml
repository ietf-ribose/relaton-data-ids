abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]
    is\n   an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a\n
    \  \"BIER domain\" without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any\n   multicast
    related per-flow state.  BIER also does not require any\n   explicit tree-building
    protocol for its operation.  When a multicast\n   data packet enters the BIER
    domain, the BFIR determines the BFERs to\n   which the packet needs to be sent.
    \ Then the BFIR encapsulates the\n   packet in a BIER header and forwards the
    packet according to the\n   BIFTs.  Currently, there is a BIER-MPLS solution to
    transmit\n   multicast traffic using MPLS label indication.  Alternatively, this\n
    \  document tries to propose a solution named BIER Ethernet to support\n   BIER
    forwarding in Ethernet network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
