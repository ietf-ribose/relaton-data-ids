abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A key concept in IPv6 is that of the site.  Unfortunately, there
    is \nno rigorous definition of a site.  Rather, a site is only loosely \nand informally
    defined as 'a region of topology that belongs to a \nsingle organization and is
    located within a single geographic \nlocation' [1].\n\t </p>\n      "
