abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>6rd is One of the most popular methods to provide both IPv4 and
    IPv6 \nconnectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-existing \nperiod.
    The DHCP 6rd option has been defined to configure 6rd CPE. \nBut in many networks,
    the configuration information may be stored in \nAAA servers while user configuration
    is mainly from Broadband Network \nGateway (BNG) through DHC protocol. This document
    defines a RADIUS \nattribute that carries 6rd configuration information from AAA
    server \nto BNG.\n\t </p>\n      "
