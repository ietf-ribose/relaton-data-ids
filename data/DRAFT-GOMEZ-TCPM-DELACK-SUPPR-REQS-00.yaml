abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Delayed Acknowledgments (ACKs) allow reducing protocol overhead
    in\n   many scenarios.  However, in some cases, Delayed ACKs may\n   significantly
    degrade network and device performance in terms of link\n   utilization, latency,
    memory usage and/or energy consumption.  This\n   document presents the problem
    statement regarding Delayed ACKs\n   suppression.  The document discusses the
    scenarios and use cases in\n   which Delayed ACKs suppression offers advantages.
    \ Then, requirements\n   for a potential solution are derived.  Finally, a number
    of potential\n   solutions are discussed, based on the requirements, and also\n
    \  considering pros and cons in each case.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
