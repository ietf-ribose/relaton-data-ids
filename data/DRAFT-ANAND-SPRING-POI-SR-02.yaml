abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document illustrates a way to integrate a new class of
    nodes and\n   links in segment routing to represent transport networks in an opaque\n
    \  way into the segment routing domain.  An instance of this class would\n   be
    optical networks that are typically transport centric.  In the IP\n   centric
    network, this will help in defining a common control protocol\n   for packet optical
    integration that will include optical paths as\n   'transport segments' or sub-paths
    as an augmentation to the defined\n   extensions of segment routing. The transport
    segment option also\n   defines a general mechanism to allow for future extensibility
    of\n   segment routing into non-packet domains.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
