abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo presents a set of TCP extensions to improve performanceover
    large bandwidth*delay product paths and to provide reliableoperation over very
    high-speed paths. It defines new TCP options forscaled windows and timestamps,
    which are designed to providecompatible interworking with TCP's that do not implement
    theextensions. The timestamps are used for two distinct mechanisms:RTTM (Round
    Trip Time Measurement) and PAWS (Protect Against WrappedSequences). Selective
    acknowledgments are not included in this memo.This memo updates and obsoletes
    RFC-1323, a Proposed Standard, withsmall clarifications and corrections.</p>"
