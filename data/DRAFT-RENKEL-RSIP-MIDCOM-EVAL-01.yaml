  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides an evaluation of the RSIP (Realm Specific\nIP)
    framework and protocol against the evaluation criteria\nprovided by the MIDCOM
    working group for the evaluation of middle\nbox control protocols. RSIP is defined
    in experimental RFCs 3102\n(Realm Specific IP: Framework) [3] and 3103 (Realm
    Specific IP:\nProtocol Specification) [4]; see also RFCs 3104 (RSIP Support for\nEnd-to-end
    IPsec) [5] and 3105 (Finding an RSIP Server with SLP)\n[6] for more information
    on RSIP.\nThe document has been updated based on comments made on the MIDCOM\nmailing
    list since the previous version of this document was\ndistributed.\n\t </p>\n
