abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a terminology for benchmarking the SIP performance
    of networking devices. The term performance in this context means the capacity
    of the device- or system-under-test to process SIP messages. Terms are included
    for test components, test setup parameters, and performance benchmark metrics
    for black-box benchmarking of SIP networking devices. The performance benchmark
    metrics are obtained for the SIP signaling plane only. The terms are intended
    for use in a companion methodology document for characterizing the performance
    of a SIP networking device under a variety of conditions. The intent of the two
    documents is to enable a comparison of the capacity of SIP networking devices.
    Test setup parameters and a methodology document are necessary because SIP allows
    a wide range of configuration and operational conditions that can influence performance
    benchmark measurements. A standard terminology and methodology will ensure that
    benchmarks have consistent definition and were obtained following the same procedures.</p>"
