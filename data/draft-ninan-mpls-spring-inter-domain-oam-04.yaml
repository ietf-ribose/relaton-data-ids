abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) architecture leverages source routing and tunneling
    paradigms and can be directly applied to the use of a Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) data plane. A network may consist of multiple IGP domains or multiple ASes
    under the control of same organization. It is useful to have the LSP Ping and
    traceroute procedures when an SR end-to-end path spans across multiple ASes or
    domains. This document describes mechanisms to facilitae LSP ping and traceroute
    in inter-AS/inter-domain SR networks in an efficient manner with simple OAM protocol
    extension which uses dataplane forwarding alone for sending echo reply.</p>"
