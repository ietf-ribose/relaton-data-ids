abstract:
- content: <p>Sometimes, it is attractive to add features to protocols or applications
    by specifying a particular structure for URIs (or parts thereof). However, publishing
    standards that mandate URI structure is inappropriate because the structure of
    a URI needs to be firmly under the control of its owner, and the IETF (as well
    as other organisations) should not usurp this ownership. This document is intended
    to prevent this practice (sometimes called "URI Squatting") in standards, but
    updating RFC3986 to indicate where it is acceptable.</p>
