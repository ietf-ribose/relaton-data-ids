abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to support use cases when two or more end-points communicate
    via one (or more) cloud service (e.g. virtualized cloud-based conferencing) that
    are not trusted to access the media content, this document describes the use of
    so called end-to-end (inner) and hop- by-hop (outer) cryptographic transforms
    within the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). One of the main aspects
    of the transforms is to make the confidentiality and message authentication independent
    of the RTP header. Another central aspect is to enable identification of the cryptographic
    contexts (keys etc.). Besides the security of the end-points, also trust assumptions
    regarding the cloud services are addressed.</p>"
