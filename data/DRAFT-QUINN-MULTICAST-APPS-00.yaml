abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document highlights the challenges of creating multicast\n
    \  applications, and describes the solutions available or under\n   development.
    \ It provides a taxonomy of multicast applications in\n   terms of their requirements,
    and discusses some existing multicast-\n   based protocols.  Many of the solutions--especially
    in the areas of\n   reliable multicast data delivery, congestion control, and
    security--\n   have not yet emerged from the research realms.  We describe the\n
    \  general state of on-going research in these areas, highlighting the\n   strategies
    under investigation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
