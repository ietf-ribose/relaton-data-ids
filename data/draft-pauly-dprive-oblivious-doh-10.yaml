abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol that allows clients to hide their
    IP addresses from DNS resolvers via proxying encrypted DNS over HTTPS (DoH) messages.
    This improves privacy of DNS operations by not allowing any one server entity
    to be aware of both the client IP address and the content of DNS queries and answers.
    This experimental protocol is developed outside the IETF and is published here
    to guide implementation, ensure interoperability among implementations, and enable
    wide-scale experimentation.</p>"
