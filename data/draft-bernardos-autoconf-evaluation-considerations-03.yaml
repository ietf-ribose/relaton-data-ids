abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This Internet Draft aims at providing general guidelines for theAUTOCONF
    solution space, through providing a set of evaluationconsiderations for IP autoconfiguration
    mechanisms in MANETs. Theseevaluation considerations conform to the AUTOCONF problem
    statementdraft and the MANET architecture draft. The main objective of thisdraft
    is to illustrate some key features and highlight some importantbehaviours for
    the different autoconf mechanisms, and thus aiming tohelp solution developers
    during mechanisms' design and to helpimplementers in the choice of the autoconf
    mechanism that fits bettertheir particular requirements, taking into consideration
    a number ofimportant factors that are discussed in this draft.</p>"
