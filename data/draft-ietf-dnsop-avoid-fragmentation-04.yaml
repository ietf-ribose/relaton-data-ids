abstract:
- content: "<p>EDNS0 enables a DNS server to send large responses using UDP and is
    widely deployed. Path MTU discovery remains widely undeployed due to security
    issues, and IP fragmentation has exposed weaknesses in application protocols.
    Currently, DNS is known to be the largest user of IP fragmentation. It is possible
    to avoid IP fragmentation in DNS by limiting response size where possible, and
    signaling the need to upgrade from UDP to TCP transport where necessary. This
    document proposes to avoid IP fragmentation in DNS.</p>"
