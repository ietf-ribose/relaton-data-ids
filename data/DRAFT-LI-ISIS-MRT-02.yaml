abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes necessary extensions to IS-IS to support
    the\n   distributed computation of Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT).  Some\n   example
    uses of the MRTs include IP/LDP Fast-Reroute and global\n   protection or live-live
    for multicast traffic.  The extensions\n   indicate what MRT profile(s) each router
    supports.  Different MRT\n   profiles can be defined to support different uses
    and to allow\n   transition of capabilities.  An extension is introduced to flood
    MRT-\n   Ineligible links, due to administrative policy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
