abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Fast re-route (FRR) is a technique that allows productive forwarding\n
    \  to continue in a network after a failure has occurred, but before the\n   network
    has has time to re-converge.  This is achieved by forwarding\n   a packet on an
    alternate path that will not result in the packet\n   looping.  Preferred Path
    Routing (PPR) provides a method of injecting\n   explicit paths into the routing
    protocol.  The use of PPR to support\n   FRR has a number of advantages.  This
    document describes the\n   advantages of using PPR to provide a loop-free alternate
    FRR path,\n   and provides a framework for its use in this application.\n\n\t
