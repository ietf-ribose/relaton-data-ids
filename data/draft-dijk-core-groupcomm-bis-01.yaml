abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the use of the Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP) for group communication, using UDP/IP multicast as the underlying data
    transport. The target application area is any group communication use cases in
    resource-constrained networks. Both unsecured and secured CoAP group communication
    are specified. Security is achieved by use of the Group Object Security for Constrained
    RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE) protocol. Aspects of operation of using multicast
    CoAP in combination with CoAP block-wise transfers and CoAP observe are also specified.</p>"
