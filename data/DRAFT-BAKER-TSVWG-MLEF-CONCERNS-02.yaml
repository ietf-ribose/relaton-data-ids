    of Defense, with is contractors, has proposed a service\narchitecture for military

    in Voice\nover IP' and 'Requirements for Assured Service Capabilities in Voice\nover

    to account for  Preemption Events',\n'Communications Resource Priority for the
    Session Initiation\nProtocol', and the 'Multi-Level Expedited Forwarding Per Hop\nBehavior'
    (MLEF PHB). MLEF, as currently defined, has serious\nproblems, which this draft
