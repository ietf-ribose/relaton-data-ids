abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes an IP Multicast Shortcut Service (IMSS)
    over a\n   large ATM cloud. The service enables cut-through routing between\n
    \  routers serving different Logical IP Subnets (LISs). The presented\n   solution
    is complementary to MARS [2], adopted as the IETF standard\n   solution for IP
    multicast over ATM.\n \n   IMSS consists of two orthogonal components: CONnection-oriented
    Group\n   address RESolution Service (CONGRESS) and IP multicast SErvice for\n
    \  Non-broadcast Access Networking TEchnology (IP-SENATE). An IP class D\n   address
    is resolved into a set of addresses of multicast routers that\n   should receive
    the multicast traffic targeted to this class D\n   address. This task is accomplished
    using CONGRESS. The cut-through\n   routing decisions and actual data transmission
    are performed by IP-\n   SENATE.\n \n   IMSS preserves the classical LIS model
    [8]. The scope of IMSS is to\n   facilitate inter-LIS cut-through routing, while
    MARS provides tools\n   for the intra-LIS IP multicast.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
