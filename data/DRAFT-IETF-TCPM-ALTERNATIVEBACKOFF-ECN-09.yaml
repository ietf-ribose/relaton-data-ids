abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms allow for burst tolerance\n
    \  while enforcing short queues to minimise the time that packets spend\n   enqueued
    at a bottleneck.  This can cause noticeable performance\n   degradation for TCP
    connections traversing such a bottleneck,\n   especially if there are only a few
    flows or their bandwidth-delay-\n   product is large.  The reception of a Congestion
    Experienced (CE) ECN\n   mark indicates that an AQM mechanism is used at the bottleneck,
    and\n   therefore the bottleneck network queue is likely to be short.\n   Feedback
    of this signal allows the TCP sender-side ECN reaction in\n   congestion avoidance
    to reduce the Congestion Window (cwnd) by a\n   smaller amount than the congestion
    control algorithm's reaction to\n   inferred packet loss.  This specification
    therefore defines an\n   experimental change to the TCP reaction specified in
    RFC3168, as\n   permitted by RFC 8311.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
