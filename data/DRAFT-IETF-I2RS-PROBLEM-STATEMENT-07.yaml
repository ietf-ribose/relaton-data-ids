abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traditionally, routing systems have implemented routing and
    signaling\n   (e.g.  MPLS) to control traffic forwarding in a network.  Route\n
    \  computation has been controlled by relatively static policies that\n   define
    link cost, route cost, or import and export routing policies.\n   With the advent
    of highly dynamic data center networking, on-demand\n   WAN services, dynamic
    policy-driven traffic steering and service\n   chaining, the need for real-time
    security threat responsiveness via\n   traffic control, and a paradigm of separating
    policy-based decision-\n   making from the router itself, the need has emerged
    to more\n   dynamicaly manage and program routing systems in order to control\n
    \  routing information and traffic paths and to extract network topology\n   information,
    traffic statistics, and other network analytics from\n   routing systems.\n\n
    \  This document proposes meeting this need via an Interface to the\n   Routing
    System (I2RS).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
