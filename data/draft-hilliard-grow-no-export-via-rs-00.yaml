abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a BGP Well-known Community called NO_EXPORT_VIA_RS.
    This community allows BGP route server clients to instruct an Internet Exchange
    BGP Route Server to tag prefixes destined for other route server clients with
    the NO_EXPORT Well-Known Community. This mechanism allows route server clients
    to transitively control distribution of their prefixes in other Autonomous Systems
    connected to the Internet Exchange Route Server.</p>"
