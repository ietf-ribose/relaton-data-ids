abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a problem statement and requirements with respect
    to the presence of a single packetization time (ptime/ maxptime) attribute in
    SDP media descriptions that contain several media formats (audio codecs). Furthermore,
    a best common practice solution for the use of 'ptime/maxptime' is proposed based
    on 'static', 'dynamic' and 'indicated' values. Some methods already proposed as
    ad-hoc solutions and background information is included in an appendix.</p>"
