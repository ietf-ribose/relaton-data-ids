abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a ForCES [ForCES] Transport Mapping
    layer\n   (TML) based on the Transparent Inter Process Communication service\n
    \  [TIPC].  It is intended to be used when the ForCES protocol is\n   transported
    over L2 carriers such as Ethernet, RapidIO or PCI-\n   Express.  TIPC has been
    specially designed for efficient and easy-to-\n   use communication over L2 carriers,
    and is typically used to define\n   clusters of loosely coupled nodes in such
    environments.\n\t </p>\n      "
