abstract:
- content: "<p>The group communication is designed for the communication of Internet
    of Things. A threat is identified in [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm] that current DTLS
    based approach is unicast oriented and there is no supporting on group authentication
    feature. Unicast oriented authentication will causing serious burden when a large
    number of terminal nodes will be involved inevitably. In another aspect, some
    terminals will own the same characteristics, such as owning same features, in
    the same place, working in the same time, etc. With this mechanism, all terminals
    can be authenticated together with little signaling and calculation at the same
    time. It will reduce the network burden and save time. This draft describes the
    security of group authentication and an group authentication implementation method
    for the Internet of things.</p>"
