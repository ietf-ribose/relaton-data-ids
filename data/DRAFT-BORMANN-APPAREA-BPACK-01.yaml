abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   JSON (RFC 4627) is an extremely successful format for the\n
    \  representation of structured information, supporting Boolean values,\n   numbers,
    strings, arrays, and tables.  Recently, a number of\n   applications have started
    to look for binary representation formats\n   that solve a similar problem.  In
    particular, constrained node\n   networks can benefit from such a binary representation
    format.\n\n   A very successful binary representation that is otherwise comparable\n
    \  to JSON is MessagePack.  Recently, a number of implementations have\n   modified
    or extended MessagePack such that it allows for\n   distinguishing UTF-8 strings
    from binary data.  Further discussion on\n   the MessagePack repository has resulted
    in proposals how to integrate\n   such an addition back into the MessagePack community.\n\n
    \  This draft, as an independent effort, documents one such format,\n   tentatively
    calling it BinaryPack1pre2 while the MessagePack\n   extension proposals make
    their way through the MessagePack community.\n\n   The current version -01 of
    this document is a snapshot that\n   demonstrates a general direction.  The details
    may change in future\n   versions based on the development of the MessagePack
    specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
