abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support
    for\nmultiple authentication methods.  One such method is Generic Token\nCard
    (EAP-GTC) which, despite its name, is commonly used to support\nauthentication
    using cleartext passwords in tunneled EAP methods.\nEAP-GTC does not provide the
    ability to change a password (for\nexample, an expired password), however.  This
    document defines the\nPassWord Change EAP method (EAP-PWC) in order to fill that
    void in\nfunctionality.\n\t </p>\n      "
