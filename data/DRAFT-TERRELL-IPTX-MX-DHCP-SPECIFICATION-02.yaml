abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n  This document defines the IPtX Specification for the 'Dynamic
    Host\n  Configuration Protocol'; IPtX / IPtX-MX DHCP (DHCPvIPtX-MX), which\n  provides
    Backwards Compatibility with the IPv4 Specification without\n  compromise or change
    to current DHCP Server and Client Configuration\n  and / or Operational Requirements.
    And more importantly, because the\n  IPtX / IPtX-MX Specification represents a
    3 State Binary IP Addressing\n  Specification, there are 2 IP Address Band Specifications;
    Mobile IP\n  Address Pool and a Stationary IP Address Pool, with a 3 Dimensional\n
    \ Locator, which represents a 3 IP Address Coordinate System that uses\n  an EMERGENCY
    Broadcast [e911] to establish a Synchronized LINK with\n  3 different [KNOWN]
    Router Locations and the MAC Address, to\n  Triangulate the Location of any Node
    Connected to the Network -\n \n  [Given that - The 3 IP Address Coordinate System
    uses the CIDR\n   Network Descriptors, '/0000:00', '+/0000:00', '-/0000:00' to\n
    \  differentiate the IP Address Broadcasting Node's Location to\n   the 3 different
    [KNOWN] Router Locations, the differentiated\n   IP Addresses however, must use
    the same IPtX-MX MAC Address\n   to identify the Node's Hardware.]  \n\t </p>\n
