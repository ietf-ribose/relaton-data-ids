abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Internet engineering ecosystem, there is increasingly a need
    for specifications that evolve over time, and which are encoded directly in structured
    formats (e.g., YANG models). Internet-Drafts are a poor fit for working groups
    that want to produce structured specifications, and publishing versions of an
    evolving specification as RFC makes it difficult to track the specification over
    time. This document outlines recommendations for how working groups can provide
    consistent, meaningful versions for specifications over time and work directly
    on structured documents while still fitting within established IETF processes.</p>"
