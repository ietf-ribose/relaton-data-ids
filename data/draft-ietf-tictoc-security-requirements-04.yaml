abstract:
  content: "<p>As time synchronization protocols are becoming increasingly common
    and widely deployed, concern about their exposure to various security threats
    is increasing. This document defines a set of security requirements for time synchronization
    protocols, focusing on the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and the Network Time
    Protocol (NTP). This document also discusses the security impacts of time synchronization
    protocol practices, the time synchronization performance implications of external
    security practices, the dependencies between other security services and time
    synchronization.</p>"
