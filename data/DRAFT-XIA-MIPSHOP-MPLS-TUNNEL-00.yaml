abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node's IPv4 and IPv6 traffic\nbetween
    a Local Mobility Anchor(LMA) and a Mobile Access Gateway\n(MAG) to be tunneled
    using IPv6, IPv4 or IPv4-UDP encapsulation\nheaders.  In this document, Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS)\ntunneling is proposed as an alternative tunnel technology
    which is\nused between a MAG and a LMA.  MPLS is now become more and more\npopular,
    and MPLS support is an important function for edge and core\nrouters.  Integrating
    MPLS and Proxy IP Mobility can leverage Proxy\nIP Mobility deployment in the industry.\n\t
