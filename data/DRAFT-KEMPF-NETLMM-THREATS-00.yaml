abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses security threats to NETLMM-based mobility\nmanagement
    with a focus on threats on the interface between mobile\nnodes and access routers.
    \ Threats to the NETLMM protocol itself,\nwhich runs between the access routers
    and mobility anchor points, are\nsimilar to those faced by other protocols between
    network entities\nlike routers.  These threats are handled in the NETLMM protocol\nspecification.
    \ In contrast, threats on the interface between mobile\nnodes and access routers
    are different, because the access routers\nare presenting the NETLMM domain as
    a single subnet, in order to\nallow mobile nodes to continue using the same IP
    address as they move\nfrom one access router to another.\n\t </p>\n      "
