abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There is a pragmatic need for a packet-level translation mechanism\nbetween
    IPv4 and IPv6, for scenarios where no other mode of IPv4 to\nIPv6 interworking
    is possible.  The mechanism defined here uses a\nshim in both the translator and
    the IPv6 host to mitigate the\nproblems introduced by stateless translation.\n\t
