abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a solution to the Internet address
    depletion\n   issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part
    of\n   the original IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for\n   Easy
    IPv4), outlines the IPv4 public address pool expansion and the\n   Internet system
    architecture enhancement considerations. The EzIP may\n   expand an IPv4 address
    by a factor of 256M without affecting the\n   existing IPv4 based Internet, nor
    the current private networks. The\n   EzIP is in full conformance with the IPv4
    protocol, and supports not\n   only both direct and private network connectivities,
    but also their\n   interoperability. The EzIP deployment may coexist with the
    current\n   Internet traffic and the IoT (Internet of Things) operations without\n
    \  perturbing their setups, while offering end-users the freedom to\n   choose
    either. If the IPv4 public pool allocations were allowed to be\n   reorganized,
    the assignable pool could be multiplied by 512M times or\n   even more. The EzIP
    may be implemented as a software / firmware\n   enhancement to the Internet edge
    routers or private network routing\n   gateways wherever needed, or simply installed
    as an inline adjunct\n   hardware module between the two, enabling a seamless
    introduction.\n   The 256M case detailed herein establishes a complete layer of
    routers\n   for interfacing between the Internet core fabic and the end user\n
    \  premises. Incorporating the caching proxy technology in the gateway,\n   a
    fairly large geographical area may deploy an EzIP based sub-\n   Internet operating
    from as few as one ordinary IPv4 public address.\n   This will immediately resolve
    the IPv4 address shortage anywhere,\n   while transparent to the current Internet
    operation. Under the Dual-\n   Stack environment, these proposed interim facilities
    will relieve the\n   IPv4 address shortage issue, while affording the IPv6 more
    time to\n   orderly reach the maturity and the availability levels required for\n
    \  delivering a long-term general service.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
