abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to to provide guidance in the use of
    RPL to provide the features required in building or home environments, two application
    spaces which share a substantial number of requirements. Note that this document
    refers to a specific revision of the RPL draft, and thus, a new revision of the
    RPL draft will likely necessitate a new revision of this document.</p>"
