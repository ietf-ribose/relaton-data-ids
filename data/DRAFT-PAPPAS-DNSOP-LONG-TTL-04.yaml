abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Due to the hierarchical tree structure of the Domain Name System\n
    \  [RFC1034][RFC1035], losing all of the authoritative servers that\n   serve
    a zone can disrupt services to not only that zone but all of\n   its descendants.
    \ This problem is particularly severe if all the\n   authoritative servers of
    the root zone, or of a top level domain's\n   zone, fail.  Although proper placement
    of secondary servers, as\n   discussed in [RFC2182], can be an effective means
    against isolated\n   failures, it is insufficient to protect the DNS service against
    a\n   Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.  This document proposes\n   to
    reduce the impact of DDoS attacks against top level DNS servers by\n   setting
    long TTL values for NS records and their associated A and\n   AAAA records.  Our
    proposed changes are purely operational and can be\n   deployed incrementally.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
