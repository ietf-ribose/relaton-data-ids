abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IP [1] agents are being deployed in enterprise networks,
    \nto enable mobile users with network mobility across wired and \nwireless LANs
    while roaming inside the enterprise firewall.  \nWith the growing deployment of
    multi-subnetted IEEE 802.11 \nnetworks (referred as hot spots) in public places
    such as \nhotels, airports, and convention centers, and wireless WAN data \nnetworks
    such as GPRS, the need for enabling mobile users to \nmaintain their transport
    connections and constant reachability \nwhile connecting back to their target
    'home' networks protected \nby VPNs is increasing.  This draft identifies example
    usage \nscenarios for enterprise users roaming outside the firewall, \nand defines
    a problem statement based on the scenarios.\n\t </p>\n      "
