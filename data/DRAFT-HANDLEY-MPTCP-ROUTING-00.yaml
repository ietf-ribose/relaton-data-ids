abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multipath TCP extends the TCP protocol to allow multiple paths
    to be\nused simultaneously for the same TCP connection.  The different paths\nare
    typically provided using multiple IP addresses for the same end\nsystem, each
    address taken from a subnet that is routed differently.\nIn this document we describe
    a set of conventions for how to ensure\nthat outgoing packets are routed in a
    manner consistent with the\nnetwork topology and constraints on use of that topology
    such as\nthose imposed by ingress filtering on IP address prefixes.\n\t </p>\n
