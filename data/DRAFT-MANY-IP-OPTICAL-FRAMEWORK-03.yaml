abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Internet transport infrastructure is moving towards a model
    of \nhigh-speed routers interconnected by optical core networks. A \nconsensus
    is emerging in the industry on utilizing IP-centric \nprotocols for the optical
    control plane [9, 10], as well as for \ndynamic bandwidth provisioning for IP
    services. Also, there has \nrecently been significant activity in defining models
    for IP \ntransport over optical networks, specifically, the routing and \nsignaling
    aspects [2,6,7]. This draft attempts to define a framework \nfor IP over Optical
    networks, considering both the IP control plane \nfor optical networks as well
    as IP transport over optical networks \n(together referred to as 'IP over optical
    networks'). Within this \nframework, we develop a common set of terms and concepts
    which allows \nto discuss these IP over optical technologies in a consistent fashion.
    \ \nAdditionally, this draft surveys some architectural frameworks that \nmight
    be useful and appropriate for the deployment of IP over hybrid \noptical networks
    that contain IP routers, WDM multiplexers, and \noptical cross-connects (OXCs).
    This document is complementary to the \nframework of Multiprotocol Lambda Switching
    proposed in [2].\n\t </p>\n      "
