abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) naming syntax provides no meta-data for
    indicating administrative transitions through the hierarchy. For example, it does
    not distinguish the higher-level portions that operate as public registries, versus
    those that operate as private organizations. This specification creates a basic
    overlay mechanism for defining a logical Perimeter between administrative entities
    through the naming hierarchy. The mechanism can then be applied for a variety
    of independent administrative indications.</p>"
