abstract:
- content: <p>When security vulnerabilities are discovered by independent security
    researchers, they often lack the channels to report them properly. As a result,
    security vulnerabilities may be left unreported. This document defines a format
    ("security.txt") to help organizations describe the process for security researchers
    to follow in order to report security vulnerabilities.</p>
