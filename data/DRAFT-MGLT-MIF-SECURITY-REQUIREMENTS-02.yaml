abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multiple Interface Nodes (MIF Nodes) may use their Multiple\n
    \  Interfaces to perform Mobility, Multihoming.  Then, these MIF Nodes\n   may
    also manage traffic between these Multiple Interfaces.  Because\n   IPsec has
    not been designed for Multiple Interfaces, MIF Nodes have\n   difficulties to
    benefit from MIF features with IPsec protected\n   communications.\n\n   This
    document provides use cases where IPsec protected communications\n   would take
    advantage of MIF features.  From these uses cases, we\n   identify the different
    IPsec features MIF Nodes would require.  Then,\n   we expose the limitations of
    the IPsec related protocols IKEv2 and\n   MOBIKE regarding to these MIF features
    before listing the MIF IPsec\n   Security Requirements that should be address
    by a extension of IKEv2\n   or MOBIKE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
