abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an extension of OSPF for IPv6 to support\nmobile
    ad hoc networks (MANETs).  The extension, called OSPF-MDR, is\ndesigned as a new
    OSPF interface type for MANETs.  OSPF-MDR is based\non the selection of a subset
    of MANET routers, consisting of MANET\nDesignated Routers (MDRs) and Backup MDRs.
    The MDRs form a connected\ndominating set (CDS), and the MDRs and Backup MDRs
    together form a\nbiconnected CDS for robustness.  This CDS is exploited in two
    ways.\nFirst, to reduce flooding overhead, an optimized flooding procedure\nis
    used in which only (Backup) MDRs flood new LSAs back out the\nreceiving interface;
    reliable flooding is ensured by retransmitting\nLSAs along adjacencies.  Second,
    adjacencies are formed only between\n(Backup) MDRs and a subset of their neighbors,
    allowing for much\nbetter scaling in dense networks.  The CDS is constructed using
    2-hop\nneighbor information provided in a Hello protocol extension.  The\nHello
    protocol is further optimized by allowing differential Hellos\nthat report only
    changes in neighbor states.  Options are specified\nfor originating router-LSAs
    that provide full or partial topology\ninformation, allowing overhead to be reduced
    by advertising less\ntopology information.\n\t </p>\n      "
