abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Much discussion has resulted over the last few years regarding\nL2
    triggers in wired and wireless scenarios. Recent wireless goals \nhave been to
    collect requirements from various IETF related working \ngroups for L2 triggers
    in wireless environments.  For example, the\nMobile IP and SeaMoby working groups
    require such L2 information\nto optimize handoff. It was the hope that the output
    of such an \neffort would be used to design an API or protocol if desired.  \nA
    requirements draft [REQ] discusses requirements from the following \nFMIPv6, low
    latency MIPv4, and SeaMoby context transfer work.  \nDiscussion over the last
    several months in the PILC working group \nraises concerns about a generic L2
    trigger framework independent if the \nit is for wired-line or wireless application.
    \ The goal of this document \nis to provide a clear problem statement of L2 triggers.
    Discussion has \nalso been documented in this problem statement regarding special
    needs \nof the wireless application.  For example, the method for communicating\nL2
    information to L3 may be better suited for the wire-lined case (e.g.,\nMIB) but
    not for the wireless scenario. Finally, recommendations on \nwhere to go with
    the L2 trigger area in IETF has been provided. This\ndraft is preliminary.\n\n\t
