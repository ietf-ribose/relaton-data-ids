abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a technology
    that enjoys widespread deployment in the instant messaging application domain.
    While many features for XMPP had been standardized in the IETF as well as in the
    XMPP Standards Foundation emergency services functionality was not part of it.
    This document aims to initiate a discussion about the necessary emergency services
    functionality for XMPP.</p>"
