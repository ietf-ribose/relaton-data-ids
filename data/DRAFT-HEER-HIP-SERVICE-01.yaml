abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Host Identity Protocol [RFC5201] is a signaling protocol
    for\n   secure communication, mobility, and multihoming that introduces a\n   cryptographic
    namespace.  This document specifies an extension for\n   HIP that enables HIP
    end-hosts and HIP-aware middleboxes to announce\n   services to HIP hosts during
    a HIP Base EXchange (BEX) or HIP update.\n   Service providers are able to specify
    the type and requirements of a\n   service; clients can then decide to agree on
    the terms of service.\n   This allows the service provider to verify the accordance
    of the\n   client with the service conditions while the client is able to verify\n
    \  the authenticity of the used service.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
