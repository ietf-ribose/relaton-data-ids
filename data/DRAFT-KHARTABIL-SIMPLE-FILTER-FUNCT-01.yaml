abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The SIP event notification framework describes the usage of the\nSession
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications\nof changes to a
    state of a resource. The document does not describe a\nmechanism of how filtering
    of event notification information can be\nachieved.\nThis document describes the
    operations a subscriber performs in order\nto define filtering rules, how to handle
    responses to subscriptions\ncarrying filtering rules, and how to handle notifications
    with\nfiltering rules applied to them. The document also describes how the\nnotifier
    behaves when receiving such filtering rules and how a\nnotification is constructed.\nThe
    format of the filter is outside the scope of this document.\n\t </p>\n      "
