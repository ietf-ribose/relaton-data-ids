abstract:
- content: "<p>Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow for setting up networks
    so that traffic is distributed in an optimal way and does not rely on centralized
    deployed anchors to provide IP mobility support. There are many different approaches
    to address Distributed Mobility Management, as for example extending network-based
    mobility protocols (like Proxy Mobile IPv6), or client-based mobility protocols
    (as Mobile IPv6), among others. This document follows the former approach, and
    proposes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 in which mobility sessions are
    anchored at the last IP hop router (called distributed gateway). The distributed
    gateway is an enhanced access router which is also able to operate as local mobility
    anchor or mobility access gateway, on a per prefix basis. The draft focuses on
    the required extensions to effectively support simultaneously anchoring several
    flows at different distributed gateways. This draft introduces the concept of
    distributed logical interface (at the distributed gateway), which is a software
    construct that allows to easily hide the change of anchor from the mobile node.
    Additionally, the draft describes how to provide session continuity in inter-domain
    scenarios in which dynamic tunneling or signaling between distributed gateways
    from different operators is not allowed.</p>"
