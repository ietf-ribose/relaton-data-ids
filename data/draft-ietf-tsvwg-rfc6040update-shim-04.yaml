abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 6040 on "Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion Notification" made the
    rules for propagation of ECN consistent for all forms of IP in IP tunnel. This
    specification updates RFC 6040 to clarify that its scope includes tunnels where
    two IP headers are separated by at least one shim header that is not sufficient
    on its own for wide area packet forwarding. It surveys widely deployed IP tunnelling
    protocols separated by such shim header(s) and updates the specifications of those
    that do not mention ECN propagation (L2TPv2, L2TPv3, GRE and Teredo). This specification
    also updates RFC 6040 with configuration requirements needed to make any legacy
    tunnel ingress safe.</p>
