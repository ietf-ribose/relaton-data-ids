abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IASA 2.0 changes will have an impact on the IETF Trust
    because\n   members of the IET Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) IAOC,\n
    \  which is being phased out, have served as Trustees of the IETF Trust.\n   This
    discussion document provides background on the current IETF\n   Trust arrangements,
    explains the effect of the rules in the founding\n   documents during a transition
    to a new arrangement, and provides a\n   rationale for the update.\n\n\t </p>\n
