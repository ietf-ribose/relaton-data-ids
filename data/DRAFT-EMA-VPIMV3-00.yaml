abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>General electronic mail (email) provides a facility for exchanging\n
    \    messages of seemingly arbitrary content.  In common email usage, text\n     is
    the primary media with one or more attachments.\n\n     A class of special-purpose
    computers has evolved to provide voice\n     messaging services.  These machines
    generally interface to a telephone\n     switch and provide call answering and
    voice messaging services.\n     Message exchange between these voice-mail only
    systems can best be\n     achieved using VPIM Version 2.\n\n     Fax messaging
    is another special purpose messaging system which\n     interface to a telephone
    switch and provide the ability to send and\n     receive images over the PSTN.
    \ When sending these messages over the\n     Internet rather than the PSTN, the
    simple mode fax profile defined in\n     RFC ABCD should be used.\n\n     Other
    electronic messaging systems include paging, and short message\n     service.
    \ It is expected that other messaging systems developed for\n     specific environments
    will continue to be developed.\n\n     This profile defines a new version of the
    VPIM specification for the\n     interchange of voice messages between a voice
    messaging system as\n     defined in [VPIM] and a unified messaging system.  In
    this sense, a\n     unified messaging system is capable of sending and receiving
    each of\n     several different message types.  Typical unified messaging systems\n
    \    today consolidate fax messages, voice messages, and email messages\n     into
    a single system and permit the forwarding a received message of\n     one type
    as an attachment to a message of another type.\n\n     Further, this profile will
    define the interactions between a media\n     agnostic (multi-media) messaging
    system with unified messaging and\n     voice messaging systems.  A media agnostic
    system may combine several\n     media into a single message.  Such a message
    may not have primary a\n     media but rely upon several components to\n\t </p>\n
