abstract:
- content: <p>There is a noticeable trend towards network requirements, behaviours
    and semantics that are specific to a particular set of requirements applied within
    a limited region of the Internet. Policies, default parameters, the options supported,
    the style of network management and security requirements may vary between such
    limited regions. This document reviews examples of such limited domains (also
    known as controlled environments), notes emerging solutions, and includes a related
    taxonomy. It then briefly discusses the standardization of protocols for limited
    domains. Finally, it shows the needs for a precise definition of "limited domain
    membership" and for mechanisms to allow nodes to join a domain securely and to
    find other members, including boundary nodes. This document is the product of
    the research of the authors. It has been produced through discussions and consultation
    within the IETF, but is not the product of IETF conensus.</p>
