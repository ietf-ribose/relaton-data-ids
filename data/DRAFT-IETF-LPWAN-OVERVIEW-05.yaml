abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies
    with\n   characteristics such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth, possibly\n
    \  very small packet and application layer data sizes and long battery\n   life
    operation.  This memo is an informational overview of the set of\n   LPWAN technologies
    being considered in the IETF and of the gaps that\n   exist between the needs
    of those technologies and the goal of running\n   IP in LPWANs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
