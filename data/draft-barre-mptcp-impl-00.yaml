abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Multipath TCP is a major extension to TCP that allows improving
    theresource usage in the current Internet by transmitting data overseveral TCP
    subflows, while still showing one single regular TCPsocket to the application.
    This document describes our experience inwriting a MultiPath TCP implementation
    in the Linux kernel anddiscusses implementation guidelines that could be useful
    for otherdevelopers who are planning to add MultiPath TCP to their networkingstack.</p>"
