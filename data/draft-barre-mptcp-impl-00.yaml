abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP is a major extension to TCP that allows improving the
    resource usage in the current Internet by transmitting data over several TCP subflows,
    while still showing one single regular TCP socket to the application. This document
    describes our experience in writing a MultiPath TCP implementation in the Linux
    kernel and discusses implementation guidelines that could be useful for other
    developers who are planning to add MultiPath TCP to their networking stack.</p>"
