abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) working group has started looking
    \ninto signaling for QoS in various cases. In this draft, we show the \nsimilarities
    and differences of signaling for QoS versus signaling \nfor NAT and firewall traversal.
    It seams that there are quite a \nnumber of similarities, which might make sense
    to use a potential \nNSIS protocol for NAT and firewall traversal as well.  \n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
