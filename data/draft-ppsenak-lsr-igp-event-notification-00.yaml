abstract:
- content: "<p>Link-state protocols like IS-IS and OSPF have been designed to distribute
    state information - state of the local adjacencies, state of the local prefix
    reachability, etc. Each state can have additional attributes associated with it,
    but all the attributes are only meaningful while the state exists. This document
    extends link-state IGPs to distribute event notifications. An event notification
    has a very limited lifetime. It is rapidly propagated across the network and leaves
    no state after its lifetime.</p>"
