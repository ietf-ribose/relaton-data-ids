abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When a packet is sent from one host to the other, one normally
    expects that exactly one copy of the packet that was sent arrives at the destination.
    It is, however, possible that a packet is either lost or that multiple copies
    arrive.\n\n In earlier work, a metric for packet loss was defined. This metric
    quantifies the case where a packet that is sent does not arrive at its destination
    within a reasonable time. In this memo, a metric for another case is defined:
    a packet is sent, but multiple copies arrive. The document also discusses streams
    and methods to summarize the results of streams. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t </p>\n
