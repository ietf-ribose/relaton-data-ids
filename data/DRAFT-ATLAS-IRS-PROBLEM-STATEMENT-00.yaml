abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the need for
    rapid\n   and dynamic control increases.  With scale, the need to automate even\n
    \  the simplest operations is important, but even more critical is the\n   ability
    to quickly interact with more complex operations such as\n   policy-based controls.\n\n
    \  In order to enable applications to have access to and control over\n   information
    in the Internet's routing system, we need a publically\n   documented interface
    specification.  The interface needs to support\n   real-time, transaction-based
    interactions using efficient data models\n   and encodings.  Furthermore, the
    interface must support a variety of\n   use cases including those where verified
    control feed-back loops are\n   needed.\n\n   This document expands upon these
    statements of requirements to\n   provide a problem statement for an interface
    to the Internet routing\n   system.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
