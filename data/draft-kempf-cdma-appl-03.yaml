abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Recently, there have been a variety of proposals submitted to theMobile
    IP Working Group and to other IETF working groups for IPmobility solutions that
    seek to enhance or replace mobile IP. Theseproposals, often characterized as micromobility
    or fast handoff, areaddressed primarily at the perceived need of multimedia sessions
    suchas video or voice over IP for faster handoff between radio basestations, and
    are primarily directed at real time multimedia trafficin 3rd generation cellular
    access networks. In this paper, we discussthe design of CDMA radio access networks
    (RANs) and the applicabilityof IP mobility to soft handoff in a CDMA RAN. We attempt
    to show thatgiven current IP routing algorithms and the constraints on a CDMARAN,
    IP mobility solutions have little, if any, role to play inhandoff within the RAN.
    In contrast, an IP mobility solution islikely to play a big role in fast handoff
    between RANs, also calledhard handoff. While future developments in IP networking
    may changethis situation, IP mobility in CDMA networks currently seems to applyonly
    when the mobile node roams between disconnected RANs rather thanbetween base stations
    within a RAN or between connected RANs.</p>"
