abstract:
- content: "<p>An increasing diversity of connected device form factors and software
    capabilities has created a need to deliver varying, or optimized content for each
    device. Client Hints can be used as input to proactive content negotiation; just
    as the Accept header allowed clients to indicate what formats they prefer, Client
    Hints allow clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences.</p>"
