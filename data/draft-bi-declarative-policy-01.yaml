abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a declarative (also called intent based) policy
    model to describe the user's intent on network policy. The intent policy model
    is a specific data model specifies the desired state of the network system. It
    helps the service management in Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) to
    model the policy (a set of states described by constraints) that defines the final
    results of a VPN service without specifying how it is monitored and managed during
    its lifecycle. One application for Distributed Data Center (DDC) scenarios with
    policy enforcement is provided with details of how to convert high level intent
    policy into lower level configurations.</p>"
