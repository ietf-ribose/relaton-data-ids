abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use case where IP packets are\n
    \  disseminated to geographical areas, based on geographical location\n   information.
    A source node, which may be located anywhere, sends\n   packets to an access router
    through the Internet.\n   Those access routers are selected based on geographical
    location\n   information, and traffic is routed to them using the IP address of\n
    \  the router and conventional IP routing. Each of the destination\n   access
    routers then copies and broadcasts the received packets to\n   listeners within
    its (1) radio coverage for wireless access routers\n   or (2) IP subnet for wired
    access routers.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
