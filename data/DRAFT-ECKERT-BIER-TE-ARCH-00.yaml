abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an architecture for BIER-TE: Traffic\n
    \  Engineering for Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER).\n\n   BIER-TE shares
    part of its architecture with BIER as described in\n   [I-D.wijnands-bier-architecture].
    \ It also proposes to share the\n   packet format with BIER.\n\n   BIER-TE forwards
    and replicates packets like BIER based on a\n   BitString in the packet header
    but it does not require an IGP.  It\n   does support traffic engineering by explicit
    hop-by-hop forwarding\n   and loose hop forwarding of packets.  It does support
    Fast ReRoute\n   (FRR) for link and node protection and incremental deployment.\n
    \  Because BIER-TE like BIER operates without explicit in-network tree-\n   building
    but also supports traffic engineering, it is more similar to\n   SR than RSVP-TE.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
