abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo presents a technique for a NETCONF server to initiate
    a SSH\n   connection to a NETCONF client.  This is accomplished by the NETCONF\n
    \  client listening on IANA-assigned TCP port XXX and starting the SSH\n   client
    protocol immediately after accepting a TCP connection on it.\n   This role-reversal
    is necessary as the NETCONF server must also be\n   the SSH Server, in order for
    the NETCONF client to open the IANA-\n   assigned SSH subsystem \"netconf\".\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
