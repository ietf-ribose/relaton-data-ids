abstract:
- content: <p>The Information Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm, shifts the focus
    of networking from providing connections between hosts to efficiently providing
    content to the users. The work on ICN has traditionally been performed looking
    at "clean-slate" solutions which aims to replace IP with a new paradigm. On the
    other hand, in this memo we propose an "integration" approach to Information Centric
    Networking, i.e. we extend the IP protocol using a new IP Option (both for IPv4
    and IPv6). The new IP option is used by routers to support networking based on
    content rather than (or better in addition to) end-point addresses.</p>
