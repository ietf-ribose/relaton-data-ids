abstract:
- content: <p>In 2018, the IETF began the transition to a new administrative structure
    and updated its IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) to a new "IASA 2.0"
    structure. In addition to more substantive changes that are described in other
    documents, the transition to the 2018 IETF Administrative Support structure changes
    several position titles and organizational relationships that are referenced elsewhere.
    Rather than reissue those referencing documents individually, this specification
    provides updates to them and deprecates some now-obsolete documents to ensure
    that there is no confusion due to these changes.</p>
