abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Source-specific routing (also known as Source-Address Dependent\n
    \  Routing, SADR) is an extension to traditional next-hop routing where\n   packets
    are forwarded according to both their destination and their\n   source address.
    \ This document describes an extension for source-\n   specific routing to the
    Babel routing protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
