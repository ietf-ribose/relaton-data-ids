abstract:
- content: "<p>This note specifies using packets' source addresses in route lookups
    as additional qualifier to be used in hop-by-hop routing decisions. This applies
    to IPv6 [RFC2460] in general with specific considerations for routing protocol
    left for separate documents. There is nothing precluding similar operation in
    IPv4, but this is not in scope of this document. Note that destination/source
    routing, source/destination routing, SADR, source-specific routing, source-sensitive
    routing, S/D routing and D/S routing are all used synonymously.</p>"
