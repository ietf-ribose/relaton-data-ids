abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some implementations of Mobile IP home agents have been observed
    to\n   supply zero authentication data when sending a Registration Reply to\n
    \  the mobile node that contains rejection code 131 (Mobile Node Failed\n   Authentication).
    \ This creates a vulnerability whereby a mobile node\n   could be denied service
    from its home agent, and thus lose\n   connectivity to the Internet even though
    mobile node and home agent\n   were otherwise functioning properly.\n\t </p>\n
