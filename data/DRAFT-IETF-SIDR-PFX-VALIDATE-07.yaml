abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To help reduce well-known threats against BGP including prefix
    mis-\n   announcing and monkey-in-the-middle attacks, one of the security\n   requirements
    is the ability to validate the origination AS of BGP\n   routes.  More specifically,
    one needs to validate that the AS number\n   claiming to originate an address
    prefix (as derived from the AS_PATH\n   attribute of the BGP route) is in fact
    authorized by the prefix\n   holder to do so.  This document describes a simple
    validation\n   mechanism to partially satisfy this requirement.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
