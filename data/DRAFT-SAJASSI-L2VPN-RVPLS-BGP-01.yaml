abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>VPLS, as currently defined, has challenges pertaining to the areas
    \nof redundancy and multicast optimization. In particular, multi-\nhoming with
    all-active forwarding cannot be supported and there's no \nknown solution to date
    for leveraging MP2MP MDTs for optimizing the \ndelivery of multi-destination frames.
    This document defines an \nevolution of the current VPLS solution, referred to
    as Routed VPLS \n(R-VPLS), to address these shortcomings. In addition, this solution
    \noffers several benefits over current VPLS such as: ease of \nprovisioning, per-flow
    load-balancing of traffic from/to multi-homed \nsites, optimum traffic forwarding
    to PEs with both single-homed and \nmulti-homed sites, support for flexible multi-homing
    groups and fast \nconvergence upon failures. \n \n \nConventions \n \nThe key
    words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119\n\t </p>\n      "
