abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many stringent requirements are imposed on today's network,
    such as\n   low latency, high availability and reliability in order to support\n
    \  several use cases such as IoT, Gaming, Content distribution, Robotics\n   etc.
    \ Adoption of cloud and fog technology at the edge of the network\n   allows operator
    to deploy a single \"Service Function\" to multiple\n   \"Execution locations\".
    \ The decision to steer traffic to a specific\n   location may change frequently
    based on load, proximity etc.  Under\n   the current SFC framework, steering traffic
    dynamically to the\n   different execution end points require a specific 're-chaining',\n
    \  i.e., a change in the service function path reflecting the different\n   IP
    endpoints to be used for the new execution points.  This procedure\n   may be
    complex and take time.  In order to simplify re-chaining and\n   reduce the time
    to complete the procedure, we discuss separating the\n   logical Service Function
    Path from the specific execution end points.\n   This can be done by identifying
    the Service Functions using a name\n   rather than a routable IP endpoint (or
    Layer 2 address).  This draft\n   describes the necessary extensions, additional
    functions and protocol\n   details in SFF (Service Function Forwarder) to handle
    name based\n   relationships.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
