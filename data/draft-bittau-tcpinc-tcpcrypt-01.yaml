abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents tcpcrypt, a TCP extension for cryptographically
    protecting TCP segments. Tcpcrypt maintains the confidentiality of data transmitted
    in TCP segments against a passive eavesdropper. It protects connections against
    denial-of-service attacks involving desynchronizing of sequence numbers, and when
    enabled, against forged RST segments. Finally, applications that perform authentication
    can obtain end-to-end confidentiality and integrity guarantees by tying authentication
    to tcpcrypt Session ID values. The extension defines two new TCP options, CRYPT
    and MAC, which are designed to provide compatible interworking with TCPs that
    do not implement tcpcrypt. The CRYPT option allows hosts to negotiate the use
    of tcpcrypt and establish shared secret encryption keys. The MAC option carries
    a message authentication code with which hosts can verify the integrity of transmitted
    TCP segments. Tcpcrypt is designed to require relatively low overhead, particularly
    at servers, so as to be useful even in the case of servers accepting many TCP
    connections per second.</p>"
