abstract:
- content: "<p>In the decade since [RFC6125] was published, the subjectAlternativeName
    extension (SAN), as defined in [RFC5280] has become ubiquitous. This document
    updates [RFC6125] to specify that the fall-back techniques of using the commonName
    attribute to identify the service must not be used. This document also places
    some limitations on the use of wildcards in SAN fields. The original context of
    [RFC6125], using X.509 certificates for server identity with Transport Layer Security
    (TLS), is not changed.</p>"
