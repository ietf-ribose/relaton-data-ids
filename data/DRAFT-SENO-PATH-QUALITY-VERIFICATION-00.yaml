abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes a framework for path quality verification
    over an \nall-optical network. Because it will be difficult to ensure quality
    of \na dynamically established path over an all-optical network, it may be \nuseful
    for network providers to have means to verify quality of a path \nbefore it is
    served to the subscribers. This draft proposes a framework \nfor such means, including
    requirements behind them and a path continuity \ncheck mechanism to verify optical-level
    path quality upon a path's \nestablishment by the GMPLS signaling. \n\n\t </p>\n
