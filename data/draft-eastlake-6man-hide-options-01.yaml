abstract:
- content: "<p>There are increasing requests for a variety IPv6 hop-by-hop options
    but such IPv6 options and all IPv4 options, are poorly handled, particularly by
    high-speed routers in the core Internet where packets having options are commonly
    discarded. This document proposes a simple method of transiently hiding such options
    for part of a packet's path to protect the packet from discard.</p>"
