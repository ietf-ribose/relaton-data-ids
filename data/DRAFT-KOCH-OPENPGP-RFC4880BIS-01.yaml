abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   { Work in progress to update OpenPGP }\n\n   This document
    is maintained in order to publish all necessary\n   information needed to develop
    interoperable applications based on the\n   OpenPGP format.  It is not a step-by-step
    cookbook for writing an\n   application.  It describes only the format and methods
    needed to\n   read, check, generate, and write conforming packets crossing any\n
    \  network.  It does not deal with storage and implementation questions.\n   It
    does, however, discuss implementation issues necessary to avoid\n   security flaws.\n\n
    \  OpenPGP software uses a combination of strong public-key and\n   symmetric
    cryptography to provide security services for electronic\n   communications and
    data storage.  These services include\n   confidentiality, key management, authentication,
    and digital\n   signatures.  This document specifies the message formats used
    in\n   OpenPGP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
