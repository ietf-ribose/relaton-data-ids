abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the pre-SPIRITS Implementation of theSPIRITS-like
    services in the Lucent Technologies OnlineCommunications Center (OCC). To this
    end, this document is acontribution to the future Informational RFC, which is
    to bepublished by the SPIRITS WG as indicated in its charter.On the PSTN side,
    the OCC platform systematically uses theIntelligent Network (IN) solutions, which
    were industry-proven to bereliable, scalable, and compatible with the existing
    PSTNinfrastructure and services, yet easily adaptable to the Internetrequirements.
    Other essential elements of the platform include theuse of1) Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) messaging services2) Point-to-Point (PPP) Protocol3) Interactions
    with the Voice-over-IP (VoIP) Gateway and Gatekeeperfor establishing the combined
    voice path through PSTN and Internet4) Microsoft NetMeeting (tm) software at the
    end-users' PCs (orInternet appliances)5) Java (tm) Run-Time Environment (JRE),
    and6) 1.2 Java Native Interface (JNI) for certain security capabilities</p>"
