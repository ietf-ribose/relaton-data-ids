abstract:
  content: "<p>There are on-going activities in the networking community to developsolutions
    that aid in IP handover mechanisms between heterogeneouswired and wireless access
    systems including, but not limited to, IEEE802.21. Intelligent access selection,
    taking into account link layerattributes, requires the delivery of a variety of
    differentinformation types to the terminal from different sources within thenetwork
    and vice-versa. The protocol requirements for thissignalling have both transport
    and security issues that must beconsidered. The signalling must not be constrained
    to specific linktypes, so there is at least a common component to the signallingproblem
    which is within the scope of the IETF. This draft presents aproblem statement
    for this core problem.</p>"
