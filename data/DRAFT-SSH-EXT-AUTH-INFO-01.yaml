abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  This memo defines a way for SSH server applications to send
    additional\n  information to clients as part of authentication failure. A mechanism\n
    \ to relay such information can reduce the need for end user support in\n  situations
    where a client would successfully authenticate, but cannot\n  log in for a policy
    reason, such as password age or public key size.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
