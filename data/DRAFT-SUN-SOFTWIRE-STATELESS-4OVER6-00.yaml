abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a stateless 4over6 mechanism which
    moves the\n   translation function from tunnel concentrator (AFTR) to initiators\n
    \  (B4s).  It is used for service providers offering residual deployment\n   of
    the IPv4 service across IPv6-only domains.  The concentrator will\n   record the
    full set of prefix mapping rules independent of the number\n   of subscribers,
    while the initiator will only keep a single rule of\n   its own sub-domain.  The
    BNG devices can learn the rule set further,\n   to achieve traffic optimization
    between initiators.  In this way, it\n   not only achieve scalability and simplicity
    feature benefits from\n   stateless address mapping, but also keep CPE functions
    simple.\n   Besides, flexible addressing and scattered IPv4 address blocks can
    be\n   supported as well.  Traffic optimization can be deployed\n   incrementally
    when necessary.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
