abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers
    which\n   then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks.\n
    \  The requesting router then acts as a router between the downstream-\n   attached
    hosts and the upstream provider network.  The router could\n   also act as a host
    under the weak end system model, and otherwise\n   behaves as a standard router.
    \ This document considers the case when\n   the \"requesting router\" is actually
    a host, and receives a prefix\n   that it can use for multi-addressing purposes.
    \ The host does not\n   connect any downstream-attached networks, and uses the
    prefix solely\n   for its own multi-addressing purposes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
