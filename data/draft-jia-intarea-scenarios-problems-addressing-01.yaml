abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological success
    in information technology of the last half century. As the Internet becomes pervasive,
    IP has been replacing communication technology for many domain-specific solutions.
    However, domains with specific requirements as well as communication behaviors
    and semantics still exist and represent what [RFC8799] recognizes as "limited
    domains". This document describes well-recognized scenarios that showcase possibly
    different addressing requirements, which are challenging to be accommodated in
    the IP addressing model. These scenarios highlight issues related to the Internet
    addressing model and call for starting a discussion on a way to re-think/evolve
    the addressing model so to better accommodate different domain-specific requirements.
    The issues identified in this document are complemented and deepened by a detailed
    gap analysis in a separate companion document [GAP_ANALYSIS].</p>
