abstract:
- content: "<p>In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, node self-generated addresses
    are notionally conflicted with the network managed address architecture. These
    addresses need to be registered in the networking management plate for the purposes
    of central address administration. This document discusses the requirements of
    address registration and analyzes the possible solutions.</p>"
