    to be used when communicating with it. The Data CertificationServer is a Trusted
    Third Party (TTP) that can be used as one componentin building reliable non-repudiation
    services (see [ISONR]). UsefulData Certification Server responsibilities in a
    PKI are to validatesignatures and to provide up-to-date information regarding
    the status ofpublic key certificates. We give examples of how to use the DataCertification
    Server to extend the lifetime of a signature beyond keyexpiry or revocation and
    to query the Data Certification Serverregarding the status of a public key certificate.
    The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD',
    'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be
