abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a general data certification service and the
    protocols to be used when communicating with it. The Data Certification Server
    is a Trusted Third Party (TTP) that can be used as one component in building reliable
    non-repudiation services (see [ISONR]). Useful Data Certification Server responsibilities
    in a PKI are to validate signatures and to provide up-to-date information regarding
    the status of public key certificates. We give examples of how to use the Data
    Certification Server to extend the lifetime of a signature beyond key expiry or
    revocation and to query the Data Certification Server regarding the status of
    a public key certificate. The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL',
    'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</p>"
