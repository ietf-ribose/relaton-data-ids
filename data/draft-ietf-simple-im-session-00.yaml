abstract:
  content: "<p>The current specification for the SIP MESSAGE request methodindicates
    that SIP instant messages according to a model similar tothat of a text pager,
    in that each message stands alone. There is noconcept of a chat session or a text
    conference where there is astream of messages that are grouped into a session.
    This memoproposes a method of describing MESSAGE sessions by treating themessage
    session just like any other media session described in anSDP body in an INVITE
    request.</p>"
