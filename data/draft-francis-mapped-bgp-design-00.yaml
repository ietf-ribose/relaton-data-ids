abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft introduces Mapped-BGP, a routing protocol that uses BGP
    todistributed tunnel endpoint-to-prefix mappings. The goal of thisdraft are to
    present preliminary concepts and get feedback. It isnot meant to be a fully-formed
    proposal. The goals of Mapped-BGPare: 1) to reduce the processing required to
    run BGP, 2) to speed upinter-domain convergence, 3) to improve the cross-ISP load
    balancingcapabilities of BGP, and where possible, 4) to enable forms ofaddress
    aggregation like geographical addressing (i.e. for IPv6).Improved address aggregation
    is unlikely to be very useful for IPv4,because most addresses have already been
    assigned. This design takesthe position that Mapped BGP is useful even without
    betteraggregation, because 1) FIB size can be reduced through FIBsuppression with
    Virtual Aggregation, and 2) RIB size per se is notthe growth bottleneck.</p>"
