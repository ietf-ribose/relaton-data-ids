abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected in
    the \n   last ten years. As IPv4 address exhaustion gets closer, the IPv4/IPv6
    \n   transition issues become more critical and complicated. Host-based \n   transition
    mechanisms are not able to meet the requirements while \n   most end users are
    not sufficiently expert to configure or maintain \n   these transition mechanisms.
    Carrier Grade NAT with integrated \n   transition mechanisms can simplify the
    operation of end users during \n   the IPv4/IPv6 migration or coexistence period.
    This document proposes \n   an incremental Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) approach for
    IPv6 transition. \n   It can provide IPv6 access services for IPv6-enabled end
    hosts and \n   IPv4 access services for IPv4 end hosts while remaining most of
    \n   legacy IPv4 ISP networks unchanged. It is suitable for the initial \n   stage
    of IPv4/IPv6 migration. Unlike CGN alone, it also supports and \n   encourages
    transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
