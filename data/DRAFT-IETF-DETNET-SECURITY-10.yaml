abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance\n
    \  guarantees to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates\n   and
    bounded latency.  As a result, securing a DetNet implies that in\n   addition
    to the best practice security measures taken for any\n   mission-critical network,
    additional security measures may be needed\n   whose purpose is exclusively to
    secure the intended operation of\n   these novel service properties.\n\n   Designers
    of DetNet components (such as routers) that provide these\n   unique DetNet properties
    have the responsibility to uphold certain\n   security-related properties that
    can be assumed by DetNet system-\n   level designers.  For example, the assumption
    that network traffic\n   associated with a given flow can never affect traffic
    associated with\n   a different flow is only true if the underlying components
    make it\n   so.\n\n   This document addresses DetNet-specific security considerations
    from\n   the perspective of both the DetNet component designer and the DetNet\n
    \  system-level designer.  It is assumed that both classes of reader are\n   already
    familiar with network security best practices for the data\n   plane technologies
    underlying a given DetNet implementation.\n   Component-level considerations include
    isolation of data flows from\n   each other, ingress filtering, and detection
    and reporting of packet\n   arrival time violations.  System-level considerations
    include a\n   threat model and a taxonomy of relevant attacks, including their\n
    \  potential impacts and mitigations.\n\n   A given DetNet may require securing
    only certain aspects of DetNet\n   performance, for example extremely low data
    loss rates but not\n   necessarily bounded latency.  Therefore this document provides
    an\n   association of threats against various use cases by industry, and\n   also
    against the individual service properties as defined in the\n   DetNet Use Cases.\n\n
    \  This document also addresses common DetNet security considerations\n   related
    to the IP and MPLS data plane technologies (the first to be\n   identified as
    supported by DetNet), thereby complementing the\n   Security Considerations sections
    of the various DetNet Data Plane\n   (and other) DetNet documents.\n\n\t </p>\n
