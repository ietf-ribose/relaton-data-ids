abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a limited common set of Diffserv PHBs
    and\n   codepoints (DSCPs) to be applied at (inter)connections of two\n   separately
    administered and operated networks, and explains how this\n   approach can simplify
    network configuration and operation.  Many\n   network providers operate MPLS
    using Treatment Aggregates for traffic\n   marked with different Diffserv Per
    Hop Behaviors, and use MPLS for\n   interconnection with other networks.  This
    document offers a simple\n   interconnection approach that may simplify operation
    of Diffserv for\n   network interconnection among providers that use MPLS and
    apply the\n   Short-Pipe tunnel mode.  While motivated by the requirements of
    MPLS\n   network operators that use Short-Pipe tunnels, this document is\n   applicable
    to other networks, both MPLS and non-MPLS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
