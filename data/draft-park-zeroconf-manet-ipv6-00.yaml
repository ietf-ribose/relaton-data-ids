abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The concept of IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration (SAA) lendsitself
    easily to a mobile ad hoc network where no administrativeconfigurations are available.
    However, the SAA designed to operateon a single link is not directly applicable
    to the mobile ad hocnetwork with multi-hop paths. In this document, we extend
    thecurrent SAA to overcome this limitation by using the IPv6 site-local address.</p>"
