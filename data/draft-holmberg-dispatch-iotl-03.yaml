abstract:
- content: "<p>In 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) networks, the signalling
    path between a calling user and a called user can be partioned into segments,
    referred to as traffic legs. Each traffic leg may span networks belonging to different
    operators, and will have its own characteristics that can be different from other
    traffic legs in the same call. The directionality in traffic legs relates to a
    SIP request creating a dialogue and stand-alone SIP request. A traffic leg might
    be associated with multiple SIP dialogs, e.g. in case a B2BUA which modifies the
    SIP dialog identifier is located within the traffic leg. This document defines
    a new SIP URI parameter, 'iotl'. The parameter can be used in a SIP URI to indicate
    that the entity associated with the address, or an entity responsible for the
    host part of the address, represents the end of a specific traffic leg (or multiple
    traffic legs). The SIP URI 'iotl' parameter defined in this document is only applicable
    to 3GPP networks. The usage of the parameter within other types of networks is
    undefined.</p>"
