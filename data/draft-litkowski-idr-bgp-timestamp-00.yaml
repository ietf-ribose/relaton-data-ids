abstract:
- content: '<p>BGP is more and more used to transport routing information for critical
    services. Some BGP updates may be critical to be received as fast as possible
    : for example, in a layer 3 VPN scenario where a dual-attached site is loosing
    primary connection, the BGP withdraw message should be propagated as fast as possible
    to restore the service. The same criticity exists for other address-families like
    multicast VPNs where "join" messages should also be propagated very fast. Experience
    of service providers shows that BGP path propagation time may vary depending on
    network conditions (especially load of BGP speaker on the path) and too long propagation
    time are affecting customer service. It is important for service providers to
    keep track of BGP updates propagation time to monitor quality of service for the
    customers. It is also important to be able to identify BGP Speakers that are slowing
    down the propagation. This document presents a solution to transport timestamps
    of a BGP path.</p>'
