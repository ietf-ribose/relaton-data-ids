abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the problem of distributed data discovery in
    edge computing, and in particular for computing-in-the-network (COIN), which may
    require both the marshalling of data at the outset of a computation and the persistence
    of the resultant data after the computation. Although the data might originate
    at the network edge, as more and more distributed data is created, processed,
    and stored, it becomes increasingly dispersed throughout the network. There needs
    to be a standard way to find it. New and existing protocols will need to be developed
    to support distributed data discovery at the network edge and beyond.</p>"
