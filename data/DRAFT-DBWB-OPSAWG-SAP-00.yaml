abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a YANG data model for representing an
    abstract\n   view of the provider network topology containing the points from\n
    \  which its services can be attached (e.g., basic connectivity, VPN,\n   network
    slices).  The data model augments the 'ietf-network' data\n   model by adding
    the concept of service attachment points (SAPs).  The\n   service attachment points
    are the points to which network services\n   (such as L3VPN or L2VPN) can be attached.
    \ The customer endpoint of\n   an attachment circuits are not covered in the SAP
    network topology.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
