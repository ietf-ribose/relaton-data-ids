abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a one-way measurement of an IPsec packet
    edge-to-\n   edge delay.  Delay detection is enabled by a sender of an IPsec\n
    \  packet that includes a timestamp declaring the time at which it was\n   sent.
    \ The receiver of the datagram can then judge how recently it\n   was sent and
    choose a policy action, which could include discarding\n   packets deemed to be
    'too old' (having a timestamp too far into the\n   past) or 'too new' (having
    a timestamp that is too far into the\n   future).  This provides a freshness policy
    check, which can be\n   valuable irrespective of whether the IPsec policy also
    includes\n   replay protection.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
