  content: "<p>Ethernet, standardized as IEEE802.3, is a family of frame-basednetworking
    technologies for local area networks. It's the mostwidespread wired LAN technology.This
    document proposes a variation of the original frame's structureto perform a frame's
    classification and a switching optimization(fundamental steps for QoS mechanism).</p>"
