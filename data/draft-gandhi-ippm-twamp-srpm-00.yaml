abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. SR is applicable
    to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This
    document describes RFC 5357 (Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) Light)
    extensions for Delay and Loss Measurement in Segment Routing networks, for both
    SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes.</p>"
