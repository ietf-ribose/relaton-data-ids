abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document we propose a mechanism and routing setup that would
    avoid persistent route oscillations and yield consistent route selection in a
    network using one-level Route Reflection, or using Confederation where routers
    that participate in inter-member-AS peering are fully meshed.</p>"
