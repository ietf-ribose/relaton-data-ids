abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the protocol used in the internet
    to\n   exchange routing information between network domains.  This protocol\n
    \  does not directly include mechanisms that control that routes\n   exchanged
    conform to the various rules defined by the Internet\n   community.  This document
    intends to summarize most common existing\n   rules and help network administrators
    applying simply coherent BGP\n   policies.  First it recalls mechanisms that administrators
    can use to\n   protect the BGP sessions, with TTL and MD5.  Then the document\n
    \  describes the prefix filters that can be used, how some of them can\n   be
    automated, and where they apply in the BGP network.  Afterwards,\n   applicability
    of other methods including BGP route flap dampening,\n   limiting maximum prefixes
    per peering, AS-path filtering and\n   community scrubbing is analyzed.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
