abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF has provided some tools for remote participation in
    its\n   activities for many years, and some IETF participants have also used\n
    \  their own tools when they felt the need arise.  The IETF now wishes\n   to
    support enhanced remote participation that is as seamless as\n   possible, approaching
    the quality of direct physical attendance for\n   the various roles, including
    chair, presenter and simple attendee.\n   Before deploying the new tools and services
    needed for this enhanced\n   remote participation, the requirements for such tools
    and services\n   must be defined.  This document is meant to be that definition.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
