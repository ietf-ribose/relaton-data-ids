abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification provides a framework for the use of assertions with
    OAuth 2.0 in the form of a new client authentication mechanism and a new authorization
    grant type. Mechanisms are specified for transporting assertions during interactions
    with a token endpoint; general processing rules are also specified. The intent
    of this specification is to provide a common framework for OAuth 2.0 to interwork
    with other identity systems using assertions and to provide alternative client
    authentication mechanisms. Note that this specification only defines abstract
    message flows and processing rules. In order to be implementable, companion specifications
    are necessary to provide the corresponding concrete instantiations.</p>"
