abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DCCP communication is currently restricted to a single path
    per\n   connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The\n   simultaneous
    use of these multiple paths for a DCCP session could\n   improve resource usage
    within the network and, thus, improve user\n   experience through higher throughput
    and improved resilience to\n   network failures.  Use cases for a Multipath DCCP
    (MP-DCCP) are\n   mobile devices (handsets, vehicles) and residential home gateways\n
    \  simultaneously connected to distinct paths as, e.g., a cellular link\n   and
    a WiFi link or to a mobile radio station and a fixed access\n   network.  Compared
    to existing multipath protocols such as MPTCP, MP-\n   DCCP provides specific
    support for non-TCP user traffic as UDP or\n   plain IP.  More details on potential
    use cases are provided in\n   [website], [slide], and [paper].  All these use
    cases profit from an\n   Open Source Linux reference implementation provided under
    [website].\n\n   This document presents a set of extensions to traditional DCCP
    to\n   support multipath operation.  Multipath DCCP provides the ability to\n
    \  simultaneously use multiple paths between peers.  The protocol offers\n   the
    same type of service to applications as DCCP and it provides the\n   components
    necessary to establish and use multiple DCCP flows across\n   potentially disjoint
    paths.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
