abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ALTO (Application Layer-Traffic Optimization) Protocol\n
    \  ([RFC7285]) defines several services that return various metrics\n   describing
    the costs between network endpoints.  An ALTO Server may\n   offer a variety of
    cost metrics, based on latency,bandwidth, hop\n   count, jitter, or whatever else
    the ALTO Server deems useful.  For\n   example, when downloading a file that is
    mirrored on several sites, a\n   user application may consider more than one metric,
    perhaps trading\n   bandwidth for latency to determine the most efficient mirror
    site.\n\n   While the base ALTO Protocol allows an ALTO Client to use more than\n
    \  one cost metric, to do so, the Client must request each metric\n   separately.
    \ This document defines a new service that allows a Client\n   to retrieve several
    cost metrics with one request, which is\n   considerably more efficient.  In addition,
    this document extends the\n   ALTO constraint tests to allow a user to specify
    an arbitrary logical\n   combination of tests on several cost metrics.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
