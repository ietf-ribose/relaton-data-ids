abstract:
  content: "<p>One of the key proposals in the PACT [PACT] draft is a limit on theduration
    of Working Groups. The authors believe that limitations ofthat type are too constraining
    on IESG ability to manage working groupsand areas and that they will not be effective
    in practice. We proposean alternate restriction -- on the total number of working
    groups in anArea -- that we believe will have a number of desirable effects (asuperset
    of those suggested with the PACT model) and that it is morelikely to operate as
    intended.</p>"
