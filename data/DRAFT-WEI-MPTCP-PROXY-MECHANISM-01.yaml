abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple\n
    \  paths between peers for a TCP/IP session, and it could improve\n   resource
    usage within the network and, thus, improve user experience\n   through higher
    throughput and improved resilience to network failure.\n   This document discusses
    the mechanism of a new network entity, named\n   MPTCP proxy, which is aimed to
    assist MPTCP capable peer to use MPTCP\n   session in case of one of the peers
    not being MPTCP capable or to act\n   as an aggregation point for sublfows.\n\n\n\t
