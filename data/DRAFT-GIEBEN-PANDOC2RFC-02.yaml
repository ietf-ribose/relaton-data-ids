abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a technique for using a Markdown syntax\n
    \  variant, called Pandoc, and a (bit) of XML [RFC2629] as a source\n   format
    for documents in the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and Request for\n   Comments (RFC)
    series.\n\n   The goal of this technique is to let an author of an I-D focus on
    the\n   main body of text without being distracted too much by XML tags, it\n
    \  does however not alleviate the need to typeset some files in XML.\n\n\t </p>\n
