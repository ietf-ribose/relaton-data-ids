abstract:
- content: "<p>Strings of text appear in many fields in PKIX certificates. Some applications
    need to compare the values in these fields to strings from other certificates,
    or to values obtained in other manners. For many string encodings, this can be
    done in an octet-by-octet fashion. Other encodings, however, require preparation
    before the strings can be compared. This document describes that preparation and
    when it needs to be applied.</p>"
