abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Strings of text appear in many fields in PKIX certificates. Someapplications
    need to compare the values in these fields to stringsfrom other certificates,
    or to values obtained in other manners.For many string encodings, this can be
    done in an octet-by-octetfashion. Other encodings, however, require preparation
    before thestrings can be compared. This document describes that preparationand
    when it needs to be applied.</p>"
