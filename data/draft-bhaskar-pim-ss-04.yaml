abstract:
  content: "<p>Source-Specific PIM (PIM-SS) is a variant of PIM Sparse-Mode that onlybuilds
    source specific shortest path trees. These trees are builtdirectly on receiving
    group membership reports that request a givensource. PIM-SS precludes the building
    of shared trees, effectively par-titioning the different source trees from one
    another. For this reasonit is specifically suited for existing multicast applications
    for whichthere is expected and intended to be exactly one source.Source-Specific
    PIM can co-exist with PIM-SM. It uses a subset of PIM-SMmessages and lends itself
    to incremental deployment.</p>"
