abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As the DNS Security (DNSSEC) specifications have evolved, the\nsyntax
    and semantics of the DNSSEC resource records (RRs) have\nchanged.  Many deployed
    nameservers understand variants of these\nsemantics.  Dangerous interactions can
    occur when a resolver that\nunderstands an earlier version of these semantics
    queries an\nauthoritative server that understands the new delegation signer\nsemantics,
    including at least one failure scenario that will cause\nan unsecured zone to
    be unresolvable.  This document proposes that\nthese interactions be avoided by
    changing the type codes and\nmnemonics of the DNSSEC RRs (SIG, KEY, and NXT).\n\n\t
