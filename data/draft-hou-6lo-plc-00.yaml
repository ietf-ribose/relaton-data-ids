abstract:
- content: "<p>Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using the electric-power lines
    for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to support Advanced
    Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially the smart meters for electricity. With
    the inherent advantage of existing electricity infrastructure, PLC is expanding
    deployments all over the world, indicating the potential demand of IPv6 for future
    applications. As part of this technology, Narrowband PLC (NBPLC) is focused on
    the low-bandwidth and low-power scenarios, including current standards such as
    IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T G.9903. This document describes how IPv6 packets are transported
    over constrained PLC networks.</p>"
