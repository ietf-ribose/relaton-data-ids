abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP-based multimedia applications dynamically negotiate parameters
    for the related media streams, such as UDP port numbers. Therefore, firewalls
    that want to inspect these streams have to interact with the session signaling.
    Several architectures and protocols have been developed for the dynamic control
    of firewalls on the media path, e. g., MIDCOM, SIMCO, and the NSIS NAT/FW NSLP.
    This document investigates problems with the interaction of standard SIP (as of
    RFC 3261) and these firewall control protocols, especially with respect to error
    handling. It will be pointed out how existing SIP extensions can be used for improving
    the interaction, and which additional mechanisms need to be specified. While the
    actual specification of such additional mechanisms is out of the scope of this
    document, it solicits feedback and discussion.</p>"
