abstract:
  content: "<p>SIP-based multimedia applications dynamically negotiate parametersfor
    the related media streams, such as UDP port numbers. Therefore,firewalls that
    want to inspect these streams have to interact withthe session signaling. Several
    architectures and protocols have beendeveloped for the dynamic control of firewalls
    on the media path, e.g., MIDCOM, SIMCO, and the NSIS NAT/FW NSLP. This documentinvestigates
    problems with the interaction of standard SIP (as of RFC3261) and these firewall
    control protocols, especially with respectto error handling. It will be pointed
    out how existing SIPextensions can be used for improving the interaction, and
    whichadditional mechanisms need to be specified. While the actualspecification
    of such additional mechanisms is out of the scope ofthis document, it solicits
    feedback and discussion.</p>"
