abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the requirements for the transmission
    of \nnetwork timing and synchronization across packet-switched networks \nusing
    pseudo-wires.  Such services enable the function of real-time, \nsynchronous applications
    across the asynchronous packet switched \nnetwork.  In particular, it complements
    the emulation of TDM bit \nstreams over the packet switched network.\n\t </p>\n
