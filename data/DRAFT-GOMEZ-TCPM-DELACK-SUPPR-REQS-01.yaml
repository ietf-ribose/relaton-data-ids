abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TCP Delayed Acknowledgments (ACKs) allow reducing protocol
    overhead\n   in many scenarios.  However, in some cases, Delayed ACKs may\n   significantly
    degrade network and device performance in terms of link\n   utilization, latency,
    memory usage and/or energy consumption.  This\n   document presents the problem
    statement regarding sender control of\n   Delayed ACKs in TCP.  The document discusses
    the scenarios and use\n   cases in which sender control of Delayed ACKs offers
    advantages.\n   Then, requirements for a potential solution are derived.  Finally,
    a\n   number of potential solutions are discussed, based on the\n   requirements,
    and also considering pros and cons in each case.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
