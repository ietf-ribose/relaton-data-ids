abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a particular network environment where MPLS-SPRING-enabled
    routers\n   are partially deployed, it needs to transport MPLS traffic through
    an\n   IP-based tunnel between two MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers so as to\n   traverse
    non-MPLS routers.  The ingress of the IP-based tunnel must\n   know which encapsulation
    type is supported by the egress of that IP-\n   based tunnel.This document describes
    how to advertise the\n   encapsulation capability of MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers
    using IS-IS.\n   Note that this encapsulation capablity advertisment could be\n
    \  applicalbe to other use cases besides that as mentioned above as\n   well.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
