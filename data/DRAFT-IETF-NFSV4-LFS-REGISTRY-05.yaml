abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the past Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have used
    very\n   rigid policies which were implemented in particular protocols and\n   platforms.
    \ As MAC systems became more widely deployed, additional\n   flexibility in mechanism
    and policy will be required.  While\n   traditional trusted systems implemented
    Multi-Level Security (MLS)\n   and integrity models, modern systems have expanded
    to include\n   technologies such as type enforcement.  Due to the wide range of\n
    \  policies and mechanisms which need to be accommodated, it is unlikely\n   that
    use of a single security label format and model will be viable.\n\n   To allow
    multiple MAC mechanisms and label formats to co-exist in a\n   network, this document
    proposes a registry of label format\n   specifications.  This registry would contain
    label format identifiers\n   and would provide for the association of each such
    identifier with a\n   corresponding extensive document document outlining the
    exact syntax\n   and use of the particular label format.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
