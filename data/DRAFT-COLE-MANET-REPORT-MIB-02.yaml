abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB)\nfor use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\nIn
    particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous report\ngeneration
    on any device that supports MIBs containing counter and\ngauge objects for performance
    monitoring.  This allows a management\nstation to instruct a device to build off-line
    reports to be\ncollected asynchronously by the management station.\n\t </p>\n
