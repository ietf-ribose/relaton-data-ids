abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A number of protocols have been defined at the IETF to handle
    IP\nmobility and multi-homing - each of the defined protocols satisfies a\ndifferent
    set of requirements - however, there is an overlap on some\nof the requirements
    and features among many of these protocols.  In\npractice, a combination of the
    protocols are likely to be deployed in\na system.  There are various such combinations
    plausible, but some\ncombinations are more realistic than others.  This document
    analyzes\nthe overall mobility and multi-homing architecture and highlights\nsome
    key points to consider while deploying an architecture\nconsisting of one or more
    of these protocols.  The protocols\nconsidered in scope for this document include
    Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4),\nMobile IPv6 (MIPv6), Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6),
    Fast Mobile\nIPv6 (FMIPv6), Network-based Local Mobility Management (NetLMM),\nMOBIKE,
    Host Identity Protocol (HIP), and Shim6.\n\t </p>\n      "
