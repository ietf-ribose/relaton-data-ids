abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a collection of mechanisms that allow HTTP
    servers to cryptographically bind authentication tokens (such as cookies and OAuth
    tokens) to TLS [RFC5246] connections. We describe both _first-party_ and _federated_
    scenarios. In a first-party scenario, an HTTP server is able to cryptographically
    bind the security tokens it issues to a client, and which the client subsequently
    returns to the server, to the TLS connection between the client and server. Such
    bound security tokens are protected from misuse since the server can generally
    detect if they are replayed inappropriately, e.g., over other TLS connections.
    Federated token bindings, on the other hand, allow servers to cryptographically
    bind security tokens to a TLS connection that the client has with a _different_
    server than the one issuing the token. This Internet-Draft is a companion document
    to The Token Binding Protocol [I-D.ietf-tokbind-protocol]</p>"
