abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes IPv6 neighbor cache update methods
    from\n   external nodes. In current communication environments, using status\n
    \  of IP addresses is frequently changed by several operations, such\n   as disconnecting
    / connecting nodes to networks at mobile\n   environments, suspending / hibernating
    / resuming nodes, and\n   consuming large number of IP addresses dynamically when
    ephemeral\n   address [Ephemeral] function is enabled.\n\n   When using status
    of an IP address is changed from \"Used\" to \"Not\n   Used\", its related used
    resources such as neighbor cache entry\n   should be deleted cooperatively from
    security enhancement viewpoint\n   and efficient resource management viewpoint.\n\n
    \  [RFC4861] defines neighbor discovery methods and describes how to\n   manage
    neighbor cache entries by neighbor discovery messages.\n   However, [RFC4861]
    does not define quick and clear neighbor cache\n   update (delete) functions.\n\n
    \  In order to meet above request, this document proposes two types of\n   IPv6
    neighbor cache update (delete) methods from external nodes.\n   One is a heuristic
    type method that does NOT require neighbor\n   discovery message extensions. The
    other is an explicit type method\n   that requires small neighbor discovery message
    extensions.\n\t </p>\n      "
