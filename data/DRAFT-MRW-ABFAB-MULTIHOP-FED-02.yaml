abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for establishing trust
    across a\n   multihop federation within the Application Bridging for Federation\n
    \  Beyond the Web (ABFAB) framework.\n\n   This document introduces a new entity,
    the Trust Router.  Trust\n   Routers exchange information about the availability
    of Trust Paths\n   across a multihop federation.  They can be queried by a Relying
    Party\n   to obtain the best Trust Path to reach an Identity Provider.  They\n
    \  also provide temporary identities that can be used by a Relying Party\n   to
    traverse a Trust Path.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
