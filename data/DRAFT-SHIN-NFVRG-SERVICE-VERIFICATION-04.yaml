abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NFV relocates network functions from dedicated hardware appliances
    to\n   generic servers, so they can run in software. However, incomplete or\n
    \  inconsistent configuration of virtualized network functions (VNF) and\n   forwarding
    graph (FG, aka service chain) could cause break-down of\n   the supporting infrastructure.
    In this sense, verification is\n   critical for network operators to check their
    requirements and\n   network properties are correctly enforced in the supporting\n
    \  infrastructures. Recognizing these problems, we discuss key\n   properties
    to be checked on NFV-enabled services. Also, we present\n   challenging issues
    related to verification in NFV environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
