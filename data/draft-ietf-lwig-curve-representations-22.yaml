abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how to represent Montgomery curves and (twisted)
    Edwards curves as curves in short-Weierstrass form and illustrates how this can
    be used to carry out elliptic curve computations using existing implementations
    of, e.g., ECDSA and ECDH using NIST prime curves. We also provide extensive background
    material that may be useful for implementers of elliptic curve cryptography.</p>"
