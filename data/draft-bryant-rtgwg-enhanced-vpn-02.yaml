abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a number of enhancements that need to be made
    to virtual private networks (VPNs) to support the needs of new applications, particularly
    applications that are associated with 5G services. A network enhanced with these
    properties may form the underpin of network slicing, but will also be of use in
    its own right.</p>"
