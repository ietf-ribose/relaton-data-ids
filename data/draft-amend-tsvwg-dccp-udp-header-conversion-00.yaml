abstract:
- content: "<p>The Datagram Congestion Control protocol (DCCP) is a non-widely deployed
    transport protocol in the Internet. The reason for that is a typical chicken-egg
    problem. Even if there would be a use for application developer to rely on DCCP,
    middle-boxes like firewalls and NATs will prevent DCCP end-to-end since they lack
    support for DCCP. However, as long as the protocol penetration of DCCP will not
    increase, middle-boxes will not handle DCCP properly. To overcome this challenge
    NAT/NATP traversal and UDP encapsulation for DCCP is already defined. However
    the first requires special middle-box support and the latter introduces overhead.
    The proposal of a multipath extension for DCCP further stresses the question of
    efficient middle-box passing as its main goal is to be applied over the Internet,
    traversing numerous uncontrolled middle-boxes. This document introduces a new
    approach, disguising DCCP during transmission as UDP without requiring middle-box
    modification nor introducing any overhead.</p>"
