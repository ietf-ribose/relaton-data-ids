abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an extension to IPv6 Stateless Address\n
    \  Autoconfiguration that causes nodes to generate global scope\n   addresses
    with randomized interface identifiers that change over\n   time.  Changing global
    scope addresses over time limits the window of\n   time during which eavesdroppers
    and other information collectors may\n   trivially perform address-based network
    activity correlation when the\n   same address is employed for multiple transactions
    by the same node.\n   Additionally, it reduces the window of exposure of a node
    via an\n   address that becomes revealed as a result of active communication.\n
    \  This document obsoletes RFC4941.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
