abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an OPTIONAL feature extending the NFSv4\n
    \  protocol which allows extended attributes (hereinafter also referred\n   to
    as xattrs) to be interrogated and manipulated using NFSv4 clients.\n    Xattrs
    are provided by a file system to associate opaque metadata,\n   not interpreted
    by the file system, with files and directories.  Such\n   support is present in
    many modern local file systems.  New file\n   attributes are provided to allow
    clients to query the server for\n   xattr support, with that support consisting
    of new operations to get\n   and set xattrs on file system objects.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
