abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document seeks to establish a standard for the utilization
    of the \n\tClass of Service Field and the us of the Flow Label Field within the
    IPv6 \n\tHeader and establish a methodology of switching packets through routers
    \n\tusing the first 32-bits of the IPv6 header using Flow Label Switching on \n\tpackets
    rather than\tfull routing of packets. Within the first 32-bits \n\tof an IPv6
    header exists the requisite information to allow for the \n\timmediate “switching”
    on an ingress packet of a router, allowing for \n\t“Label Switching” of a native
    IPv6 packet. This allows the establishment \n\tof VPN circuits in a dynamic manner
    across transit networks. The \n\testablishment of “Flows” based upon the 20-bit
    “Flow Label” value can be \n\tdone dynamically with minimal effort and configuration
    of the end-point \n\trouters of the flow. The flows can be managed or open, encrypted
    or in the \n\tclear, and will allow for greater scalability, security, and agility
    in \n\tthe management and operation of networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
