abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies mechanisms of NSA (Native Short Address) that
    enables IP packet transmission over links where the transmission of a full length
    address may not be desirable. This document focuses on carrying IP packets across
    a LLN (Low power and Lossy Network), in which the nodes' location is fixed and
    changes in the logical topology are caused only by unstable radio connectivity
    (not physical mobility). The specifications include NSA allocation, routing mechanisms,
    header format design including length-variable fields, and IPv6 interconnection
    support.</p>"
