abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol that enables tunneling of Internet
    Protocol traffic over a Content Centric Network (CCN) or a Named Data Network
    (NDN). The target use case for such a protocol is to provide an IP mobility plane
    for mobile networks that might otherwise use IP- over-IP tunneling, such as the
    GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) used by the Evolved Packet Core in LTE networks
    (LTE-EPC). By leveraging the elegant, built-in support for mobility provided by
    CCN or NDN, this protocol achieves performance on par with LTE-EPC, equivalent
    efficiency, and substantially lower implementation and protocol complexity [Shannigrahi].
    Furthermore, the use of CCN/NDN for this purpose paves the way for the deployment
    of ICN native applications on the mobile network.</p>"
