abstract:
- content: "<p>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general term
    that refers to a toolset for fault detection and isolation, and for performance
    measurement. Over the years various OAM tools have been defined for various layers
    in the protocol stack. This document summarizes some of the OAM tools defined
    in the IETF in the context of IP unicast, MPLS, MPLS for the transport profile
    (MPLS-TP), pseudowires, and TRILL. This document focuses on tools for detecting
    and isolating failures in networks and for performance monitoring. Control and
    management aspects of OAM are outside the scope of this document. Network repair
    functions such as Fast Reroute (FRR) and protection switching, which are often
    triggered by OAM protocols, are also out of the scope of this document. The target
    audience of this document includes network equipment vendors, network operators
    and standard development organizations, and can be used as an index to some of
    the main OAM tools defined in the IETF. This document provides a brief description
    of each of the OAM tools in the IETF. At the end of the document a list of the
    OAM toolsets and a list of the OAM functions are presented as a summary.</p>"
