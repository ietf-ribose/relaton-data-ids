abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The performance measurements of service flow are becoming significant\n
    \  important for administrators monitoring the fitness of the network.\n   This
    memo defines an end-to-end application-based performance\n   measurement method,
    which is achieved by generating synthetic\n   measurement packets, injecting them
    to the network and analyzing the\n   statistics carried in the measurement packets.\n\n\t
