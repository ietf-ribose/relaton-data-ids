abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO method defines a means
    for\ntransporting mid-dialog application layer data between user agents.\nIts
    initial use was to support the transport of ISUP mid-call\nmessages which could
    not be mapped to any other SIP request method.\nHowever, since its initial usage
    for that purpose, INFO has seen\nwidespread abuse as a means for introducing non-standard
    and\nnon-interoperable extensions to SIP.  For this reason, we now believe\nINFO
    should be considered harmful, and therefore, deprecated in its\ncurrent form.\n\t
