abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines the Peer-to-Peer Protocol (P2PP), anapplication-layer
    binary protocol, for creating and maintaining anoverlay of participant nodes.
    The overlay can be created usingvarious structured and unstructured peer-to-peer
    protocols such asBamboo, Chord, Pastry, Kademlia, Gnutella, and Gia. P2PP uses
    asecure transport, supports an application API, has mechanisms for NATand firewall
    traversal, exchanging node capabilities, and diagnosticinformation. P2PP is designed
    to support a P2P Session InitiationProtocol (SIP) network, but it can be used
    for other applications aswell.</p>"
