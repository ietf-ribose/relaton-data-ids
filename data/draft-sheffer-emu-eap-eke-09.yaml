abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) describes a framework
    that allows the use of multiple authentication mechanisms. This document defines
    an authentication mechanism for EAP called EAP-EKE, based on the Encrypted Key
    Exchange (EKE) protocol. This method provides mutual authentication through the
    use of a short, easy to remember password. Compared with other common authentication
    methods, EAP-EKE is not susceptible to dictionary attacks. Neither does it require
    the availability of public-key certificates. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
