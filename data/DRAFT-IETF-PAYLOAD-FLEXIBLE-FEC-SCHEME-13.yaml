abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward
    Error\n   Correction (FEC) packets that are generated by the non-interleaved\n
    \  and interleaved parity codes from source media encapsulated in RTP.\n   These
    parity codes are systematic codes, where a number of FEC repair\n   packets are
    generated from a set of source packets from one or more\n   source RTP streams.
    \ These FEC repair packets are sent in a\n   redundancy RTP stream separate from
    the source RTP stream(s) that\n   carries the source packets.  RTP source packets
    that were lost in\n   transmission can be reconstructed using the source and repair
    packets\n   that were received.  The non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes\n
    \  which are defined in this specification offer a good protection\n   against
    random and bursty packet losses, respectively, at a cost of\n   decent complexity.
    \ The RTP payload formats that are defined in this\n   document address scalability
    issues experienced with the earlier\n   specifications, and offer several improvements.
    \ Due to these\n   changes, the new payload formats are not backward compatible
    with\n   earlier specifications, but endpoints that do not implement this\n   specification
    can still work by simply ignoring the FEC repair\n   packets.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
