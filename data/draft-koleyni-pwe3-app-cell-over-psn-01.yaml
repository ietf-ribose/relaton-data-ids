abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft provides an applicability statement for the basic cell mode
    encapsulation in draft-fischer [18]. Draft-fischer describes methods to carry
    ATM services over IP, L2TP or MPLS. The PSN (e.g., MPLS) is used to transport
    ATM layer services such as those defined by ITU-T as ATM transfer capabilities
    [17] and ATM Forum as ATM service categories [15]. The basic requirement is to
    transparently transport the ATM VCC or VPC service related information (e.g.,
    traffic parameters, QoS, OAM, etc.) over the Pseudo Wire (PW), over the packet
    network.</p>"
