abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Internet applications have a need for object-based security mechanisms
    in addition to security mechanisms at the network layer or transport layer. For
    many years, the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) has provided a binary secure
    object format based on ASN.1. Over time, binary object encodings such as ASN.1
    have become less common than text-based encodings, such as the JavaScript Object
    Notation (JSON). This document defines a set of use cases and requirements for
    a secure object format encoded using JSON, drawn from a variety of application
    security mechanisms currently in development.</p>"
