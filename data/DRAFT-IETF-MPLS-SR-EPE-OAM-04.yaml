abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Egress Peer Engineering (EPE) is an application of Segment
    Routing to\n   Solve the problem of egress peer selection.  The Segment Routing\n
    \  based BGP-EPE solution allows a centralized controller, e.g. a\n   Software
    Defined Network (SDN) controller to program any egress peer.\n   The EPE solution
    requires a node to program the PeerNode Segment\n   Identifier(SID) describing
    a session between two nodes, the PeerAdj\n   SID describing the link (one or more)
    that is used by sessions\n   between peer nodes, and the PeerSet SID describing
    an arbitrary set\n   of sessions or links between a local node and its peers.
    \ This\n   document provides new sub-TLVs for EPE Segment Identifiers (SID) that\n
    \  would be used in the MPLS Target stack TLV (Type 1), in MPLS Ping and\n   Traceroute
    procedures.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
