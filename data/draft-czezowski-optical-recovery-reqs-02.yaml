abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes requirements for control plane-based recovery
    from data plane failures in pre-OTN networks. pre-OTN networks are transport networks
    that have a GMPLS-based control plane and various transport plane technologies
    (such as Optical Cross Connects and Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers, etc.) An important
    feature of these networks is recovery from failures - using either a protection
    or restoration scheme. Achieving recovery under strict time constraints is a difficult
    problem. Shared mesh-based recovery is especially desirable for reducing spare
    capacity ratios and achieving flexible recovery scenarios. Following a brief overview
    and consideration of the requirements, they are presented in an itemized list
    in section 3.4 of this document.</p>"
