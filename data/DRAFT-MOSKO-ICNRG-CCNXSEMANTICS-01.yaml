abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the core concepts of the CCNx architecture\n
    \  and presents a minimum network protocol based on two messages:\n   Interest
    and Content Object.  It specifies the set of mandatory and\n   optional fields
    within those messages and describes their behavior\n   and interpretation.  This
    architecture and protocol specification is\n   independent of a specific wire
    encoding.\n\n   The protocol also uses a Control message called an InterestReturn,\n
    \  whereby one system can return an Interest message to the previous hop\n   due
    to an error condition.  It indicates to the previous hop that the\n   current
    system will not respond to the Interest.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
