- content: "<p>The subjectAltName X.509 extension described in [KEYM] provides a mechanism
    where information regarding the entity that signed and/or encrypted some data
    can be identified. However, there is a case where the subject may not be a concrete
    entity, but may be a 'role' within an organization or network. This document will
    specify a set of these roles and their definitions.</p>"
