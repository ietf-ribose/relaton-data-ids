abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The disclosure process for intellectual property rights (IPR)
    in IETF\n   stream documents is essential to the accurate development of\n   community
    consensus.  However, this process is not always followed by\n   participants during
    IETF standardization.  Regardless of the cause or\n   motivation, noncompliance
    with IPR disclosure rules can derail or\n   delay completion of standards documents.
    \ This document describes\n   strategies for promoting compliance with the IPR
    disclosure rules.\n   The strategies are primarily intended for area directors,
    working\n   group chairs, and working group secretaries.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
