abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a framework and mapping from slices
    in 5G\n   mobile systems to transport slices in IP and Layer 2 transport\n   networks.
    \ Slices in 5G systems are characterized by latency bounds,\n   reservation guarantees,
    jitter, data rates, availability, mobility\n   speed, usage density, criticality
    and priority should be mapped to\n   transport slice characteristics that include
    bandwidth, latency and\n   criteria such as isolation, directionality and disjoint
    routes.\n   Mobile slice criteria need to be mapped to the appropriate transport\n
    \  slice and capabilities offered in backhaul, midhaul and fronthaul\n   connectivity
    segments between radio side network functions and user\n   plane function (gateway).\n\n
    \  This document describes how mobile network functions map its slice\n   criteria
    to identifiers in IP packets that transport segments use to\n   grant transport
    layer services.  This is based on mapping between\n   mobile and IP transport
    underlays (IPv6, MPLS, IPv4, Segment\n   Routing).  Applicability of this framework
    and a new transport\n   network underlay routing mechanism, Preferred Path Routing
    (PPR),\n   which brings slice properties and works with any underlying transport\n
    \  (L2, IPv4, SR and MPLS) is also discussed.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
