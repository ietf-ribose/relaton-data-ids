abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In Allied Communications Publication (ACP) 133 [1], an X.500 \ndirectory
    user schema, called Common Content, is specified for the \nAllied Directory.  In
    order to enable Lightweight Directory Access \nProtocol (LDAP) access to the Allied
    Directory and to enable the \ngeneral use by others of elements from the Common
    Content, this \ndocument specifies the encoding of the Common Content using the
    \nLDAP notation from Request for Comments (RFC) 2252 [2].\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
