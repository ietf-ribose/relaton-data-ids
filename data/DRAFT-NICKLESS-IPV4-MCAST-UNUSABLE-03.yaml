abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Some IPv4 multicast datagrams should not be routed, either within
    an\nadministrative domain or between administrative domains.  A list of\nthose
    restrictions is supplied here.  These restrictions SHOULD be\nrespected by IPv4
    multicast applications and included in network\ndevice access control lists.  IANA
    should permanently reserve\ncertain address ranges.\n\t </p>\n      "
