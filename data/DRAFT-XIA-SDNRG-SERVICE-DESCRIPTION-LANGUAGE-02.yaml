  content: "\n\t <p>   The more and more complicated IP networks require a new interaction\n
    \  mechanism between their customers and their networks.  A service\n   description
    language is needed to enable customers to easily describe\n   their diverse intent.
    \ SDN controller would compile the user intent\n   into device configurations.
    \ This document analyzes requirements for\n   such service description language
    and gives considerations for\n   designing such service description language.\n\n\t
