abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With WiFi beginning to establishing itself as a trusted access\n
    \  network for service providers, it has become important to provide\n   functions
    commonly available in 3G and 4G networks in WiFi access\n   networks.  Such functions
    include Access Point Name (APN) Selection,\n   multiple Packet Data Network (PDN)
    connections and seamless mobility\n   between WiFi and 3G/4G networks.\n\n   EAP/AKA
    (and EAP/AKA') is standardized by 3GPP as the access\n   authentication protocol
    for trusted access networks.  This IETF\n   specification is required for mobile
    devices to access the 3GPP\n   Evolved Packet Core (EPC) networks.  This document
    defines a few new\n   EAP attributes and procedures to provide the above-mentioned\n
    \  functions in trusted WiFi access networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
