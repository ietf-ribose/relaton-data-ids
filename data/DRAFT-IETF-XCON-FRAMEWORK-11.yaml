abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines the framework for Centralized Conferencing.
    \ The framework allows participants using various call signaling protocols, such
    as SIP, H.323, Jabber, Q.931 or ISDN User Part (ISUP), to exchange media in a
    centralized unicast conference.  The Centralized Conferencing Framework defines
    logical entities and naming conventions.  The framework also outlines a set of
    conferencing protocols, which are complementary to the call signaling protocols,
    for building advanced conferencing applications.  The framework binds all the
    defined components together for the benefit of builders of conferencing systems.
