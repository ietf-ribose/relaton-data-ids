abstract:
  content: "<p>In some networks such as xDSL networks with WiFi extension, theperiodical
    transmission of Agent Advertisements (AA) by mobility agents is used by Mobile
    Nodes (MN) to detect movement. To allow fastmovement detection, the interval at
    which AAs are sent should not belong. In the early deployment of Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4),
    mobility agentsare deployed in the edge network. For example, in xDSL networks,
    HomeAgents (HA) and Foreign Agents (FA) are located on or beside EdgeRouters (ER)
    that usually serves thousands of MNs (typically between2000 and 5000 in xDSL networks).
    The periodical transmission ofmulticast AA to MNs in such a large network consumes
    a significantamount of the aggregation network bandwidth and CPU resources of
    ERs.This is a practical problem in xDSL networks with WiFi extension. This is
    also a common problem for others access networks in which a large layer-2 network
    is served by one router. Hence a Mobility Agent Discovery proxy (MADP) can be
    set in access nodes to make the MNs detect movement fast meanwhile avoiding CPU
    and network bandwidthconsumption in the aggregation network. The MADP acts as
    a proxy toMNs as far as agent discovery is concerned allowing for AS issued byMNs
    to be locally replied according to AA issued by HA/FA on theaccess network. MADP
    is a logical function that can be placed on asuitable node location depending
    on access network technology andarchitecture (i.e. WiMAX) to reduce network resource
    cost related toagent discovery.</p>"
