abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>One advantage that MPLS provides is that it allows traffic to
    be\n   directed through an explicit path that deviates from IP routing.\n   Such
    ability is widely used in traffic-engineering and fast-reroute.\n   Currently
    signaling protocols such as RSVP is needed to establish and\n   maintain such
    an explicit Label Switched Path. When there are a large\n   number of such signaled
    LSPs in the network, the aggregated signaling\n   and maintenance overhead can
    be significant.\n\n   In this paper, we propose a way to establish a source routed
    explicit\n   path with zero signaling overhead. The scheme uses a stack of labels\n
    \  and requires domain wide LDP FEC to label bindings.\n\t </p>\n      "
