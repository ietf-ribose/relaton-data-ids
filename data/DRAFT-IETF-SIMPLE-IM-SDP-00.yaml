abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SIP instant messages currently follow a pager model, where there
    is\nno concept of a message session. It has been proposed that we also\nneed a
    session based model, where the user experience would be more\nlike a text conference
    or chat room. This draft proposes an\nextension to SDP that could be used to describe
    message sessions\n\t </p>\n      "
