abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies proactive, in-band network layer OAM\n
    \  mechanisms to detect loss of continuity and miss-connection faults\n   that
    affect unicast and multi-destination paths (used by Broadcast,\n   Unknown Unicast,
    and Multicast traffic) in an Ethernet VPN (EVPN)\n   network.  The mechanisms
    specified in the draft are based on the\n   widely adopted Bidirectional Forwarding
    Detection (BFD) protocol.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
