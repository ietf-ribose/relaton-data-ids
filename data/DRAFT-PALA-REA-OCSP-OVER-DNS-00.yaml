abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the most strategic problems for Internet Certification\n
    \  Authorities (ICAs) is the provisioning of revocation information in\n   an
    efficient way.  Current approaches for the distribution of OCSP\n   responses
    over HTTP do not provide efficient solutions for the high\n   volume of traffic
    that Internet CAs face when providing services for\n   highly utilized websites.
    \ This document describes a new transport\n   protocol for OCSP responses to efficiently
    provide revocation\n   information about digital certificates.\n\n   In particular,
    this specification defines how to distribute OCSP\n   responses over DNS and how
    to define OCSP-over-DNS URLs in\n   certificates.  The use of the DNS system to
    distribute such\n   information is meant to lower the costs of providing revocation\n
    \  services and increase the availability of revocation information by\n   using
    the distributed nature of the DNS infrastructure.\n\t </p>\n      "
