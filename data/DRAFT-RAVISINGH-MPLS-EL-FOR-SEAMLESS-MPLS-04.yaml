abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes certain optimizations to how entropy
    labels\n   can be used for load balancing in a seamless MPLS architecture, as\n
    \  enabled by LSP concatenation and LSP hierarchies.\n\n   The definition of the
    control plane and data plane behavior at LSP\n   concatenation points; and at
    the ingress of an LSP in a hierarchy of\n   LSPs, as described in this document,
    brings the benefits of entropy\n   labels to certain deployment scenarios that
    may not have had such\n   benefits as specified in [EL-RFC].\n\n   This document,
    if approved, updates RFC 6790.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
