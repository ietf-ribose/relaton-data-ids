abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies the "SVCB" and "HTTPS" DNS resource record
    (RR) types to facilitate the lookup of information needed to make connections
    to network services, such as for HTTP origins. SVCB records allow a service to
    be provided from multiple alternative endpoints, each with associated parameters
    (such as transport protocol configuration and keys for encrypting the TLS ClientHello).
    They also enable aliasing of apex domains, which is not possible with CNAME. The
    HTTPS RR is a variation of SVCB for use with HTTP [HTTP]. By providing more information
    to the client before it attempts to establish a connection, these records offer
    potential benefits to both performance and privacy. TO BE REMOVED: This document
    is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/MikeBishop/dns-alt-svc
    (https://github.com/MikeBishop/dns-alt-svc). The most recent working version of
    the document, open issues, etc. should all be available there. The authors (gratefully)
    accept pull requests.</p>'
