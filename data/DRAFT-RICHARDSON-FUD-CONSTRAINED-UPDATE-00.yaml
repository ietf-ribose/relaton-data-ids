abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document details the problems of upgrading small devices
    that\n   need complete firmware replacements, but which do not have enough\n   storage
    to keep an entire copy of the replacement image.  In addition\n   to detailing
    the specific challenge, a conceptual architecture for a\n   solution is posited
    involving use of DTLS session resumption tickets\n   with CoAP Block Transfer
    mode.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
