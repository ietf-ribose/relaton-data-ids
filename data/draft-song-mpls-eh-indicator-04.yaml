abstract:
- content: "<p>The intention of this document is to enumerate and describe the candidate
    schemes that can be used to indicate the presence of the MPLS extension header(s)
    following the MPLS label stack. After a careful evaluation of these options by
    comparing their pros and cons, it is expected that one should be chosen as the
    final standard scheme for MPLS extension header indicator.</p>"
