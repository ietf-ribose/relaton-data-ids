abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the Dynamic Virtual Network Engine (DVNE)protocol.
    The DVNE protocol is a signaling protocol between avirtual network node (the DVNE
    Client) and a configuration server(the DVNE Mediator). The DVNE protocol is used
    to authenticate thenodes in a Virtual Network and assist them to setup and release
    VPNconnections directly among themselves.A DVNE clients can be located anywhere
    in a private or publicnetwork, directly connected or behind one or more levels
    of NAT. TheDVNE protocol performs client authentication, peer discovery, virtualnetwork
    address management, and provides all parameters necessary toenable the clients
    setup a secure VPN connection. The protocol doesnot explicitly setup the VPN connection
    itself. It only enables theclients to be able to directly setup the VPN connection
    themselves.</p>"
