abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent targeted LDP (tLDP) applications such as remote loop-free alternate
    (LFA) and BGP auto discovered pseudowire may automatically establish a tLDP session
    to any LSR in a network. The initiating LSR has information about the targeted
    applications to administratively control initiation of the session. However, the
    responding LSR has no such information to control acceptance of this session.
    This document defines a mechanism to advertise and negotiate Targeted Applications
    Capability (TAC) during LDP session initialization. As the responding LSR becomes
    aware of targeted applications, it may establish a limited number of tLDP sessions
    for certain applications. In addition, each targeted application is mapped to
    LDP Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) Elements to advertise only necessary LDP
    FEC- label bindings over the session. This document updates RFC 7473.</p>"
