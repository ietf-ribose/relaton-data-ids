    applications with information about the network to optimizetheir traffic. Peer-to-peer
    (P2P) live streaming is one of such applications which can benefit from ALTO.
    We have recently designed anew scheme to minimize inter-domain traffic in P2P
    live streamingapplications without impacting video quality. In this draft webriefly
    describe our solution, and we discuss the implications of thetype of information
