abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines two document formats and respective
    media\n   types for representing sets of links as stand-alone resources.  One\n
    \  format is JSON-based, the other aligned with the format for\n   representing
    links in the HTTP \"Link\" header field.  This\n   specification also introduces
    a link relation type to support\n   discovery of sets of links.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
