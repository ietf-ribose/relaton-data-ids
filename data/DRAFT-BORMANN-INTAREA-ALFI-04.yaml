abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 defines a minimum MTU of 1280 bytes.  Many link layers
    are more\n   limited in the maximum size of packets they can communicate.  In\n
    \  order to enable the transport of IP packets that are too large for\n   these
    link layers, typically their IP adaptation layers define a\n   segmentation or
    fragmentation scheme to transport an IP packet in a\n   sequence of multiple link
    layer packets.\n\n   Often, adaption layer fragmentation schemes reduce some performance\n
    \  metric, such as the packet delivery probability.  Application or\n   transport
    protocols may be able to reduce the maximum size of packets\n   they send, e.g.
    \ by transport layer segmentation or choice of\n   application layer data object
    size, which may have less of a\n   performance impact.  It would therefore be
    desirable for them to know\n   about any adaptation layer fragmentation that is
    going on, so they\n   can choose packet sizes that minimize adaptation layer fragmentation.\n\n
    \  At the IP layer, fragmentation can be detected using a number of\n   mechanisms
    used in Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery [RFC4821].\n   However, adaptation
    layer fragmentation schemes are often designed to\n   be \"transparent\", i.e.
    \ there is no way at higher layers to find out\n   whether they had to be employed
    (except maybe by elaborate\n   measurement schemes targeting one of the impacted
    performance\n   metrics; this approach does not appear to be viable) [WEI].\n\n
    \  The present specification defines two alternative mechanisms for IPv6\n   adaptation
    layers to indicate the presence of adaptation layer\n   fragmentation on one or
    more hops on the path from an IP sender to an\n   IP receiver, and to provide
    an indication of preferred (smaller)\n   packet sizes on these hops.\n\n   One
    design is based on the the IPv6 design and probably doesn't work\n   on the Internet.
    \ The other design goes strictly against the IPv6\n   design and probably works
    well on the Internet.\n\n   Comments are appreciated and should go to the intarea@ietf.org\n
    \  mailing list.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
