abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines distributed mobility anchoring in terms of the
    different configurations and functions to provide IP mobility support. A network
    may be configured with distributed mobility anchoring functions for both network-based
    or host-based mobility support according to the needs of mobility support. In
    the distributed mobility anchoring environment, multiple anchors are available
    for mid-session switching of an IP prefix anchor. To start a new flow or to handle
    a flow not requiring IP session continuity as a mobile node moves to a new network,
    the flow can be started or re- started using a new IP address configured from
    the new IP prefix which is anchored to the new network. The mobility functions
    and their operations and parameters are general for different configurations.</p>"
