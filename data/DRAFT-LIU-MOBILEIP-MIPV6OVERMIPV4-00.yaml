abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a mechanism for Mobile IPv6 nodes of a
    6to4  \nsite [4] to continue utilizing Mobile IPv6 [5] services when they  \nroam
    into IPv4 domains. The mechanism is based on Mobile IPv6 and  \nMobile IPv4 [7]
    glued together naturally by the 6to4 protocol [4] for  \ndelivering IPv6 packets
    between the Mobile IPv6 nodes and their  \nMobile IPv6 home agents. To support
    the mechanism specified in this  \ndraft, the Mobile IPv6 nodes MUST be Mobile
    IPv4 capable and MUST NOT  \nutilize Mobile IPv6 route optimization. The 6to4
    border router(s) at  \nthe 6to4 site MUST also be capable to act as Mobile IPv4
    home  \nagent(s).  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
