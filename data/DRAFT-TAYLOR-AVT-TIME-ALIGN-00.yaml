abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes the use of RTCP-based feedback to reduce
    end-to-\n   end delay through the use of time alignment between the source and\n
    \  receiver.\n\n   Time alignment is useful, for example, in certain gateway-to-gateway\n
    \  scenarios and certain gateway-to-VoIP-terminal scenarios.  It is the\n   ability
    for a receiver to request that the sender shift the time\n   reference for packetization
    by a specified amount.  When a receiver\n   with strict packet timing limitations,
    e.g., due to a 3G UMTS Iu\n   interface, is connected to an sender at a peer endpoint
    capable of\n   responding to time alignment requests, e.g., with an AMR encoder\n
    \  associated with a PCM interface to the PSTN, this allows the\n   endpoints
    to reduce delay in the speech path by as much as the 20 ms\n   frame-block duration,
    depending on the degree of misalignment in the\n   time reference.\n\n\t </p>\n
