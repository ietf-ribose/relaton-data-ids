abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OAuth enables a third-party application to obtain limited access
    to a\n   protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by\n   orchestrating
    an approval interaction, or by allowing the third-party\n   application to obtain
    access on its own behalf.\n\n   This document defines how an application client
    uses credentials\n   obtained via OAuth over the Simple Authentication and Security
    Layer\n   (SASL) or the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface\n
    \  (GSS-API) to access a protected resource at a resource serve.\n   Thereby,
    it enables schemes defined within the OAuth framework for\n   non-HTTP-based application
    protocols.\n\n   Clients typically store the user's long term credential.  This
    does,\n   however, lead to significant security vulnerabilities, for example,\n
    \  when such a credential leaks.  A significant benefit of OAuth for\n   usage
    in those clients is that the password is replaced by a token.\n   Tokens typically
    provided limited access rights and can be managed\n   and revoked separately from
    the user's long-term credential\n   (password).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
