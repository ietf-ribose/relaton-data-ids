abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This is a list of things that often delay processing of RFCs by\nIESG
    and/or the RFC Editor, and which are often preventable by RFC\nauthors.  The purpose
    of this document is to list in one place the most\nfrequent causes of unnecessary
    delay, and thereby help RFC authors mini-\nmize such delays when possible.\n \n
    \    This document is emphatically NOT an expression of IESG policy, nor\nthat
    of the RFC Editor, and is provided merely for informational pur-\nposes.  When
    appropriate, this document attempts to provide references\nto other documents,
    some of which are expressions of IESG, IETF, and/or\nRFC Editor policy and others
    which are merely informational.  Readers\nare advised to check the official status
    of each reference.\n \n     The RFC Editor's instructions to RFC Authors are in
    [rfc-instruc-\ntions].\n\t </p>\n      "
