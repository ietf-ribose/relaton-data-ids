abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Global IPv6 deployment is inevitable. There are many solutions
    have \n   been specified in order to provide IPv6 connectivity services. In \n
    \  order to provide IPv6 connectivity services to all kinds of \n   host/client
    devices, ISP networks need to support as many as possible \n   IPv6 connectivity
    solutions. This document proposes a hybrid ISP \n   platform that supports the
    coexistence of variable IPv6 connectivity \n   solutions and analyses the configuration
    requirements raised by this \n   platform. Additionally, the applicability of
    different configuration \n   mechanisms for performing this configuration is discussed.
