abstract:
- content: "<p>Anonymity is less discussed in the IETF than for instance security
    [RFC3552] or privacy [RFC6973]. This can be attributed to the fact anonymity is
    a hard technical problem or that anonymizing user data is not of specific market
    interest. It remains a fact that 'most internet users would like to be anonymous
    online at least occasionally' [Pew]. This document aims to break down the different
    meanings and implications of anonymity on a mediated computer network.</p>"
