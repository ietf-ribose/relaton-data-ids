abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies Circuit Breaker Assisted Congestion
    Control\n   (CBACC), which provides bandwidth information from senders to\n   intermediate
    network nodes to enable good decisions for fast-trip\n   Network Transport Circuit
    Breaker activity\n   ([I-D.ietf-tsvwg-circuit-breaker]) when necessary for network
    health.\n   CBACC is specifically designed to support protocols using IP\n   multicast,
    particularly as a supplement to receiver-driven congestion\n   control protocols
    such as WEBRC [RFC3738], to help affected networks\n   rapidly detect and mitigate
    the impact of scenarios in which a\n   network is oversubscribed to flows which
    are not responsive to\n   congestion.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
