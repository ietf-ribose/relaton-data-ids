abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an experimental implementation for
    connecting\n   home networks via a social network.  The social network is used
    to\n   extend the boundary of a single home network to include other home\n   networks.
    \ In this way, access to devices or services within a home\n   can be granted
    among home networks based on their relation to one\n   another within the social
    network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
