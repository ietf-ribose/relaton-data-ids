abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol is an XML-based\n
    \  protocol for mapping service identifiers and geodetic or civic\n   location
    information to service URIs and service boundaries.  In\n   particular, it can
    be used to determine the location-appropriate\n   Public Safety Answering Point
    (PSAP) for emergency services.\n\n   The main data structure, the &lt;mapping&gt;
    element, used for\n   encapsulating information about service boundaries is defined
    in the\n   LoST protocol specification and circumscribes the region within which\n
    \  all locations map to the same service Uniform Resource Identifier\n   (URI)
    or set of URIs for a given service.\n\n   This document defines an XML protocol
    to exchange these mappings\n   between two nodes.  This mechanism is designed
    for the exchange of\n   authoritative &lt;mapping&gt; elements between two entities.
    \ Exchanging\n   cached &lt;mapping&gt; elements, i.e. non-authoritative elements,
    is\n   possible but not envisioned.  In any case, this document can also be\n
    \  used without the LoST protocol even though the format of the\n   &lt;mapping&gt;
    element is re-used from the LoST specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
