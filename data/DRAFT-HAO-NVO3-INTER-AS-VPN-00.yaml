abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes the solution of vanilla inter-as option-B\n
    \  connection between NVO3 network and MPLS/IP VPN network through\n   centralized
    NVE-NVA architecture. The ASBR located in NVO3 network\n   is called ASBR-d, NVO3
    tunnel and MPLS tunnel stitching should be\n   performed on the ASBR-d. No distributed
    BGP VPN protocol (RFC4364)\n   is running between NVEs and ASBR-d in NVO3 network,
    NVEs and ASBR-d\n   are controlled by centralized NVA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
