abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a format for encapsulating RDMA (remote
    direct \nmemory access) information within a TCP data stream.  No changes or \nmodification
    to TCP of any sort are required.  This is not intended to \nbe a protocol, but
    rather a common format that may be shared by \nmultiple client protocols, for
    instance VI/TCP and iSCSI.  By using a \ncommon format it is hoped that design
    of NICs supporting these multiple \nprotocols can be simplified.\nSufficient information
    is included in the RDMA message format to allow \ndetermination of the protocol
    message units, as will as the ability to \nprocess an incoming RDMA request even
    if previous packets are missing \nand awaiting retransmission.  In addition a
    CRC-32 is included in each \nsegment to enhance the checksum coverage included
    in TCP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
