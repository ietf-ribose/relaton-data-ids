abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF cannot ordain which standards or protocols are to
    be used on\n   network, but the standards developing process in the IETF has a\n
    \  normative effect.  Among other things the standardisation work at the\n   IETF
    has implications on what is perceived as technologically\n   possible and useful
    where networking technologies are being deployed,\n   and its standards output
    reflect was is considered by the technical\n   community as feasible and good
    practice.  Because it mediates many\n   aspects of modern life, and therefore
    contributes to the ordering of\n   societies and communities, the consideration
    of the politics and\n   (potential) impact of protocols should be part of the
    standardization\n   and development process.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
