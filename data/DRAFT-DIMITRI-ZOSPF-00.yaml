abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo documents our thinking to date regarding the use of
    version \n3 of the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol as a mechanism for
    \nthe autoconfiguration of IP routers within an OSPF area. \nSpecifically, a method
    for the allocation and distribution of IPv4 \nand IPv6 subnet addresses without
    explicit configuration is \ndescribed. Such a mechanism would be useful in an
    environment where \nrouting is desirable, but the network administration skills
    necessary \nto configure IP routers are not available. This draft presents zOSPF
    \n(zeroconfigutaion OSPF), a protocol based on OSFPv3 that will allow \nrouters
    to self configure and forward IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. \n\t </p>\n      "
