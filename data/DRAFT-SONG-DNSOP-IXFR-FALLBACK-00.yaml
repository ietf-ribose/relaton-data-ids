abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo introduces an IXFR issue observed during a multiple
    signers\n   experiment conducted in Yeti DNS project.  In the experiment IXFR\n
    \  client is designed to pull the zone from three IXFR servers who used\n   their
    own key to sign the zone and produce different RRSIG records\n   intentionally.
    \ The configuration of multiple signers cause the\n   failure of IXFR in client
    side.\n\n   REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: The source of the document is currently\n
    \  placed at GitHub [xml-file].  Comments and pull request are welcome.\n\n\t
