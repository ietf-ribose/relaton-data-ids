abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose extensions to the Service Location Protocol (SLP), which
    allow for registration and discovery of services scattered across the wide area
    network. We make use of scalable wide area multicast to allow agents within an
    administrative domain to learn about services within other domains. We also describe
    a new agent, the Brokering Agent (BA), which is responsible for providing information
    about a particular set of services types.</p>"
