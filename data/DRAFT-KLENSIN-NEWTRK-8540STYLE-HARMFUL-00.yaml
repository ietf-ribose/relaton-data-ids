abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There appear to be some recent trends in the IETF, involving
    both\n   published documents and proposals, to use Informational Documents to\n
    \  effectively update Standards Track ones, presenting documents as\n   normative
    while avoiding the requirements for a higher level of\n   community review and
    consensus and relationship tracking that would\n   be required, in practice, for
    Standards Track updates RFC 4460,\n   titled \"Stream Control Transmission Protocol
    (SCTP) Specification\n   Errata and Issues\" and RFC 8540, titled \"Stream Control
    Transmission\n   Protocol: Errata and Issues in RFC 4960\", were published as\n
    \  Informational documents although their clear intent is to update, or\n   posit
    alternatives to some of the provisions of, RFcs 2960 and 4960\n   respectively.
    \ This critique suggests that it is undesirable for the\n   IETF to publish documents
    of that type and form, explains the\n   reasons, and identifies several alternatives.\n\n\t
