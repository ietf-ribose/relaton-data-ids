abstract:
  content: "<p>Routers in 5G Local Data Network (LDN) can use additional site-costs,
    preference, and other application related metrics on top of the network condition
    to compute constraint-based SPF within the 5G LDN to enhance performance for selected
    services. This draft describes those application server related metrics to be
    used in Flexible Algorithms.</p>"
