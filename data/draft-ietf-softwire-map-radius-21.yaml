abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv4-over-IPv6 transition mechanisms provide IPv4 connectivity services
    over IPv6 native networks during the IPv4/IPv6 co-existence period. DHCPv6 options
    have been defined for configuring clients for Lightweight 4over6, Mapping of Address
    and Port with Encapsulation, and Mapping of Address and Port using Translation
    unicast softwire mechanisms, and also multicast softwires. However, in many networks,
    configuration information is stored in an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
    server which utilizes the RADIUS protocol to provide centralized management for
    users. When a new transition mechanism is developed, new RADIUS attributes need
    to be defined correspondingly. This document defines new RADIUS attributes to
    carry Address plus Port based softwire configuration parameters from an Authentication,
    Authorization, and Accounting server to a Broadband Network Gateway. Both unicast
    and multicast attributes are covered.</p>"
