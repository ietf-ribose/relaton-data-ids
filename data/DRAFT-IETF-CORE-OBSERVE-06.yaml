abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes
    and\n   networks.  The state of a resource on a CoAP server can change over\n
    \  time.  This document specifies a simple protocol extension for CoAP\n   that
    enables a server to replicate a resource state to interested\n   clients.  The
    protocol follows a best-effort approach when\n   transmitting new resource states
    to a client, and provides eventual\n   consistency between the state observed
    by the client and the actual\n   resource state.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
