abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes three gossiping mechanisms for Certificate\n
    \  Transparency (CT) [RFC6962]: SCT Feedback, STH Pollination and\n   Trusted
    Auditor Relationship.\n\n   SCT Feedback enables HTTPS clients to share Signed
    Certificate\n   Timestamps (SCTs) (Section 3.2 of [RFC6962]) with CT auditors
    in a\n   privacy-preserving manner by sending SCTs to originating HTTPS\n   servers
    which in turn share them with CT auditors.\n\n   In STH Pollination, HTTPS clients
    use HTTPS servers as pools sharing\n   Signed Tree Heads (STHs) (Section 3.5 of
    [RFC6962]) with other\n   connecting clients in the hope that STHs will find their
    way to\n   auditors and monitors.\n\n   HTTPS clients in a Trusted Auditor Relationship
    share SCTs and STHs\n   with trusted auditors or monitors directly, with expectations
    of\n   privacy sensitive data being handled according to whatever privacy\n   policy
    is agreed on between client and trusted party.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
