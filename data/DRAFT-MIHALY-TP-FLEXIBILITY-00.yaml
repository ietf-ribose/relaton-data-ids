abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document argues for increasing the flexibility of the
    transport\n   layer protocols to be possible to tailor the transport protocols
    to\n   different needs (today and tomorrow) of different applications and\n   access
    networks. We discuss various use cases to show that there is\n   a need for transport
    protocol flexibility.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
