abstract:
  content: "<p>The Mobile IP Working Group has been working on defining its AAArequirements,
    which currently supports a Key Distribution Center(KDC) model that issues temporary
    session keys for use between themobility nodes. In order to support real-time
    traffic, the Mobile IParchitecture also requires that hand-off be done in a quick
    andefficient manner, and has provisions to allow new foreign agents toretrieve
    the session keys from the AAA infrastructure.Although the AAA infrastructure can
    assist in the hand-off process,this is largely a mobility problem, and should
    be dealt with in themobility protocol. This draft describes how the mobile node
    canassist in the hand-off process by carrying the foreign agent's keyinginformation,
    providing the keys to new foreign agents (within thesame administrative domain)
    while registering. This proposal isintended to decrease the latency involved in
    the hand-off process,thereby enabling seamless real time traffic over Mobile IP
    networks.This draft still allows the foreign agents to get keying informationfrom
    the AAA infrastructure should that be necessary.At present, authentication in
    Mobile IP uses shared key cryptography.However, this proposal is general enough
    to be able to accommodateauthentication based on public key digital signatures
    if and when itbecomes feasible.</p>"
