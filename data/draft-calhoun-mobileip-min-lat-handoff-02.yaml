abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mobile IP Working Group has been working on defining its AAA requirements,
    which currently supports a Key Distribution Center (KDC) model that issues temporary
    session keys for use between the mobility nodes. In order to support real-time
    traffic, the Mobile IP architecture also requires that hand-off be done in a quick
    and efficient manner, and has provisions to allow new foreign agents to retrieve
    the session keys from the AAA infrastructure. Although the AAA infrastructure
    can assist in the hand-off process, this is largely a mobility problem, and should
    be dealt with in the mobility protocol. This draft describes how the mobile node
    can assist in the hand-off process by carrying the foreign agent's keying information,
    providing the keys to new foreign agents (within the same administrative domain)
    while registering. This proposal is intended to decrease the latency involved
    in the hand-off process, thereby enabling seamless real time traffic over Mobile
    IP networks. This draft still allows the foreign agents to get keying information
    from the AAA infrastructure should that be necessary. At present, authentication
    in Mobile IP uses shared key cryptography. However, this proposal is general enough
    to be able to accommodate authentication based on public key digital signatures
    if and when it becomes feasible.</p>"
