abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction
    with the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) in to provide a variety of short-term
    and long-term reception statistics. The available reporting may include aggregate
    information across longer periods of time as well as individual packet reporting.
    This document specifies a per-packet report metric capturing individual packets
    discarded from the jitter buffer after successful reception.</p>"
