abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes new hybrid key exchange schemes for the Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which are based on combining Elliptic Curve Diffie
    Hellman (ECDH) with one of the Bit Flipping Key Exchange (BIKE) or the Supersingular
    Isogeny Key Exchange (SIKE) schemes. In particular, this document specifies the
    use of BIKE or SIKE in combination with ECDHE as a hybrid key agreement in a TLS
    1.2 handshake, together with the use of ECDSA or RSA for authentication. Hybrid
    key exchange refers to executing two separate key exchanges and subsequently feeding
    the two resulting shared secrets into the existing TLS Pseudo Random Function
    (PRF), in order to derive a master secret.</p>"
