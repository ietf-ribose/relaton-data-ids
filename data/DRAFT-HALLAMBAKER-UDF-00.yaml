abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes means of generating Uniform Data Fingerprint\n
    \  (UDF) values and their presentation as text sequences and as URIs.\n\n   Cryptographic
    digests provide a means of uniquely identifying static\n   data without the need
    for a registration authority. A fingerprint is\n   a form of presenting a cryptographic
    digest that makes it suitable\n   for use in applications where human readability
    is required. The UDF\n   fingerprint format improves over existing formats through
    the\n   introduction of a compact algorithm identifier affording an\n   intentionally
    limited choice of digest algorithm and the inclusion of\n   an IANA registered
    Content-Type identifier within the scope of the\n   digest input to allow the
    use of a single fingerprint format in\n   multiple application domains.\n\n   Alternative
    means of rendering fingerprint values are considered\n   including machine readable
    codes, word and image lists.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
