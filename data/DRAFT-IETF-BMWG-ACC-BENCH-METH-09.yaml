abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Routers in an operational network are configured with multiple
    \nprotocols and security policies while simultaneously forwarding \ntraffic and
    being managed.  To accurately benchmark a router for \ndeployment it is necessary
    to test the router in a lab environment\nunder accelerated conditions, which is
    known as Stress Testing.  \nThis document provides the Methodology Guidelines
    for performing \nAccelerated Stress Benchmarking of networking devices.  \nThe
    methodology is to be used with the companion terminology \ndocument [4].  These
    guidelines can be used as the basis for \nadditional methodology documents that
    benchmark stress conditions \nfor specific network technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
    for Accelerated Stress Benchmarking\n\t </p>\n      "
