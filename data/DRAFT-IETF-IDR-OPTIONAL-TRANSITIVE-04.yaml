abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   According to the base BGP specification, a BGP speaker that
    receives\n   an UPDATE message containing a malformed attribute is required to\n
    \  reset the session over which the offending attribute was received.\n   This
    behavior is undesirable as a session reset would impact not only\n   routes with
    the offending attribute, but also other valid routes\n   exchanged over the session.
    \ This document partially revises the\n   error handling for UPDATE messages,
    and provides guidelines for the\n   authors of documents defining new optional
    attributes.  Finally, it\n   revises the error handling procedures for several
    existing\n   attributes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
