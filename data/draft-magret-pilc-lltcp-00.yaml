abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies a protocol enhancement allowing TCP connec-tions
    to switch from an active state to an idle state during a wire-less link's outage.
    Within such state all timers are cancelled andpackets' transmission is suspended.
    The protocol defines a mechanismby which the mobile station may detect a link
    failure and changes TCPconnections' state to idle. This same mechanism allows
    the mobilehost to detect connectivity regain. All TCP connections are thenresumed.The
    protocol defines how the supervisor host, which can monitor thewireless link quality,
    can alert the fixed host of a failure of thewireless link. The fixed host can
    suspend the outgoing activity withthe unreachable mobile node. When the fixed
    hosts start receivingpackets from the mobile node, the activity can be resumed.This
    protocol increases the capacity of both parties involved in acommunication that
    is carried via a wireless link to handled connec-tivity disruption without impacting
    the overall performance of theTCP connections.</p>"
