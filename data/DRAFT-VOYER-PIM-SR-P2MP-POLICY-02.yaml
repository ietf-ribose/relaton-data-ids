abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an architecture to construct a Point-to-\n
    \  Multipoint (P2MP) tree to deliver Multi-point services in a Segment\n   Routing
    domain.  A SR P2MP tree is constructed by stitching a set of\n   Replication segments
    together.  A SR Point-to-Multipoint (SR P2MP)\n   Policy is used to define and
    instantiate a P2MP tree which is\n   computed by a PCE.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
