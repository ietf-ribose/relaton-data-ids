abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In DiffServ, preferential dropping of packets in AF PHB groups
    has\n   long been considered beneficial, typically for video flows with\n   discardable
    packets.  Unfortunately, the ecosystem of bandwidth\n   contention at congestion
    is very likely to discourage those video\n   endpoints from generating packets
    with lower precedence markings,\n   i.e. they would lose more packets if doing
    so.  Thus, to offer an\n   incentive for more collaborative and mutually beneficial
    behaviors of\n   video endpoints in AF PHB groups, we propose a Normalization
    Marker\n   (NM) for traffic conditioning at network edges.  Deployment of NM\n
    \  will encourage the video endpoints to generate finer layers of intra-\n   flow
    precedence (IFP) with discardable packets in more balanced\n   distributions.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
