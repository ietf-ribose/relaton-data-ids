abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document contains a risk assessment of IP paging. The \ndescribed
    risks are probably independent of any underlying \nfunctional architecture and
    mobility protocol.\nAccordingly, several security requirements are defined. These
    \nrequirements are to be supported by an IP paging protocol in \norder to completely
    defeat or not to encourage the relevant \nattacks.\n\t </p>\n      "
