abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To evolve towards automated network OAM (Operations, administration\n
    \  and management), the monitoring of control plane protocols is a\n   fundamental
    necessity.  In this document, a network monitoring\n   protocol (NMP) is proposed
    to provision the running status\n   information of control plane protocols, e.g.,
    IGP (Interior Gateway\n   Protocol) and other protocols.  By collecting the protocol
    monitoring\n   data and reporting it to the NMP monitoring server in real-time,
    NMP\n   can facilitate network troubleshooting.  In this document, NMP for\n   IGP
    troubleshooting are illustrated to showcase the necessity of NMP.\n   IS-IS is
    used as the demonstration protocol, and the case of OSPF\n   (Open Shortest Path
    First) and other control protocols will be\n   elaborated in the future versions.
    \ The operations of NMP are\n   described, and the NMP message types and message
    formats are defined\n   in the document.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
