abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Delegated CoAP Authorization Framework (DCAF) defines how\n
    \  constrained devices can securely obtain security associations and\n   authorization
    information from their respective less constrained\n   devices, the Authorization
    Managers.  In DCAF a constrained client\n   requests an authorization ticket from
    the Server Authorization\n   Manager (SAM) by contacting its own Client Authorization
    Manager\n   (CAM).  However, there may be cases where this approach is not\n   applicable,
    e.g., because the client is not able to reach\n   Authorization Managers in the
    Internet.\n\n   Specifically for these situations, this document defines the Server-\n
    \  Initiated Ticket Request (SITR) that specifies how a constrained\n   server
    can request authorization tokens and securely obtain security\n   associations
    and authorization information for mutual authenticated\n   authorization with
    the client.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
