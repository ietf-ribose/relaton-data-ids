abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The APN work in IETF is focused on developing a framework and
    set of\n   mechanisms to derive, convey and use an attribute to allow for the\n
    \  implementation of fine-grain user group-level and application group-\n   level
    requirements at the network layer.  APN aims to apply various\n   policies in
    different nodes along a network path onto a traffic flow\n   altogether, for example,
    at the headend to steer into corresponding\n   path, at the midpoint to collect
    corresponding performance\n   measurement data, and at the service function to
    execute particular\n   policies.  Currently there is still no way to realize this
    composite\n   network service provisioning along the path very efficiently.  This\n
    \  document further clarifies the scope of the APN work and describes\n   the
    solution gap analysis.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
