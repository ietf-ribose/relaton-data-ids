abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol is specified in RFC8484.
    \ This\n   document considers Centralized DoH deployment, which seems one likely\n
    \  way that DoH may be implemented, based on recent industry discussions\n   and
    testing.  This describes that implementation model, as well the\n   potential
    associated risks and issues.  The document also makes\n   recommendations pertaining
    to the implementation of DoH, as well as\n   recommendations for further study
    prior to widespread adoption.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
