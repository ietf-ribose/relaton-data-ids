abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In TSCH mode of IEEE802.15.4, as described by [RFC8180],\n
    \  opportunities for broadcasts are limited to specific times and\n   specific
    channels.  Nodes in a TSCH network typically frequently send\n   Enhanced Beacon
    (EB) frames to announce the presence of the network.\n   This document provides
    a mechanism by which small details critical\n   for new nodes (pledges) and long
    sleeping nodes may be carried within\n   the Enhanced Beacon.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
