abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SIP REFER request, as defined by RFC3515, triggers an implicit\n
    \  SIP-Specific Event Notification framework subscription.  Conflating\n   the
    start of the subscription with handling the REFER request makes\n   negotiating
    SUBSCRIBE extensions impossible, and complicates avoiding\n   SIP dialog sharing.
    \ This document defines an extension to REFER to\n   remove the implicit subscription
    and replace it with an explicit one.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
