abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies how to use Constrained Application
    Protocol\n   (CoAP) as a Transport Medium for the Certificate management protocol\n
    \  version 2 (CMPv2) and Lightweight CMP Profile\n   [Lightweight-CMP-Profile]
    which is a subset of CMPv2 defined for\n   Constrained devices.  The CMPv2 defines
    the interaction between\n   various PKI entities for the purpose of certificate
    creation and\n   management.  The CoAP is a HTTP like client-server protocol used
    by\n   various constrained devices in the IoT and industrial scenarios.\n   Constrained
    devices are devices that have low memory or CPU or power\n   constraints and avoid
    the use of complex protocols like TCP to save\n   resources.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
