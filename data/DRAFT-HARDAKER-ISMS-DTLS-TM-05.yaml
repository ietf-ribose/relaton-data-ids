abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a Transport Model for the Simple Network\nManagement
    Protocol (SNMP), that uses either the Transport Layer\nSecurity protocol or the
    Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)\nprotocol.  The TLS and DTLS protocols
    provide authentication and\nprivacy services for SNMP applications.  This document
    describes how\nthe TLS Transport Model (TLSTM) implements the needed features
    of a\nSNMP Transport Subsystem to make this protection possible in an\ninteroperable
    way.\n\nThis transport model is designed to meet the security and operational\nneeds
    of network administrators.  The TLS mode can make use of TCP's\nimproved support
    for larger packet sizes and the DTLS mode provides\npotentially superior operation
    in environments where a connectionless\n(e.g.  UDP or SCTP) transport is preferred.
    \ Both TLS and DTLS\nintegrate well into existing public keying infrastructures.\n\nThis
    document also defines a portion of the Management Information\nBase (MIB) for
    monitoring and managing the TLS Transport Model for\nSNMP.\n\t </p>\n      "
