abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a general mechanism to use the header- extension
    feature of RTP (the Real Time Protocol). It provides the option to use a small
    number of small extensions in each RTP packet, where the universe of possible
    extensions is large and unregistered. The actual extensions in use in a session
    are signaled in the setup information for that session.</p>"
