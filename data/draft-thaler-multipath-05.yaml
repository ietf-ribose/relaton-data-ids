abstract:
- content: "<p>The effect of multipath routing on a forwarder is that the forwarder
    potentially has several next-hops for any given destination and must use some
    method to choose which next-hop should be used for a given data packet. This memo
    summarizes current practices, problems, and solutions. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
