abstract:
  content: "\t <t>RFC 2003 specifies a method by which an IP datagram may beencapsulated
    (carried as payload) within an IP datagram. This is ameans to alter the normal
    IP routing for datagrams, by deliveringthem to an intermediate destination that
    would otherwise not beselected by the (network part of the) IP Destination Address
    field inthe original IP header.This draft allows to extend this encapsulation
    mechanism also forprivate IP addresses.</p>"
