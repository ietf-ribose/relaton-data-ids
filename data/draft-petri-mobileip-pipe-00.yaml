abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2003 specifies a method by which an IP datagram may be encapsulated
    (carried as payload) within an IP datagram. This is a means to alter the normal
    IP routing for datagrams, by delivering them to an intermediate destination that
    would otherwise not be selected by the (network part of the) IP Destination Address
    field in the original IP header. This draft allows to extend this encapsulation
    mechanism also for private IP addresses.</p>"
