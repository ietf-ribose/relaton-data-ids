abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IP spoofing is a critical breach regard to Internet security.
    With\n   rapid development of the IPv6-based next generation Internet, this\n
    \  issue is more prominent since IPv6 Internet owns more spoofable IP\n   address
    space. Existing IP anti-spoofing proposals, including SAVI\n   (Source Address
    Validation Improvement) which was advocated by IETF,\n   only focused on single-stack
    or simple network scenarios. To the best\n   of our knowledge, none of them has
    paid attention to the IPv4/IPv6\n   transition scenarios. However, since IPv4/IPv6
    transition schemes are\n   plenty and various, one solution cannot meet all requirements
    of them.\n   In this draft, we present a SAVI-based general framework for IP\n
    \  source address validation and traceback in the IPv4/IPv6 transition\n   scenarios,
    which achieve this by extracting out essential and mutual\n   properties from
    these schemes, and forming sub-solutions for each\n   property. When one transition
    scheme is composed from various\n   properties, its IP source address validation
    and traceback solution\n   is directly comprised by the corresponding sub-solutions.
    Thus, the\n   most exciting advantage of this framework is that it is a once-and-\n
    \  for-all solution no matter how transition schemes change.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
