abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Section 1.1.1 of RFC 3986 defines URI syntax as \"a federated
    and\n   extensible naming system wherein each scheme's specification may\n   further
    restrict the syntax and semantics of identifiers using that\n   scheme.\"  In
    other words, the structure of a URI is defined by its\n   scheme.  While it is
    common for schemes to further delegate their\n   substructure to the URI's owner,
    publishing independent standards\n   that mandate particular forms of substructure
    in URIs is often\n   problematic.\n\n   This document provides guidance on the
    specification of URI\n   substructure in standards.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
