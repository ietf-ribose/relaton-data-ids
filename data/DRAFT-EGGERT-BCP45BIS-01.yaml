abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing
    list\n   furthers the development and specification of Internet technology\n   through
    the general discussion of topics for which no dedicated\n   mailing lists exists.
    \ As this is the most general IETF mailing list,\n   considerable latitude is
    allowed.  Advertising, whether to solicit\n   business or promote employment opportunities,
    falls well outside the\n   range of acceptable topics, as do discussions of a
    personal nature.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC3005.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
