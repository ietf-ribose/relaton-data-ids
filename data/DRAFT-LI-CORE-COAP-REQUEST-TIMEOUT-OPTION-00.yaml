abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes
    and\n   networks.  This specification provides a simple extension for CoAP,\n
    \  to inform a CoAP server of the maximum time that a CoAP client will\n   wait
    a response to its request.  A CoAP server can use this header to\n   ensure that
    a timely response is generated.\n\nNote\n\n   Discussion and suggestions for improvement
    are requested, and should\n   be sent to core@ietf.org.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
