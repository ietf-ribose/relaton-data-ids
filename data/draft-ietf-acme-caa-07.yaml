abstract:
- content: "<p>The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS record allows a
    domain to communicate issuance policy to Certification Authorities (CAs), but
    only allows a domain to define policy with CA-level granularity. However, the
    CAA specification also provides facilities for extension to admit more granular,
    CA-specific policy. This specification defines two such parameters, one allowing
    specific accounts of a CA to be identified by URI and one allowing specific methods
    of domain control validation as defined by the ACME protocol to be required.</p>"
