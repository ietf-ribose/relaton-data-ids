abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a framework and mapping from slices
    in 5G\n   mobile systems to transport slices in IP and Layer 2 transport\n   networks.
    \ Slices in 5G systems are characterized by latency bounds,\n   reservation guarantees,
    jitter, data rates, availability, mobility\n   speed, usage density, criticality
    and priority.  These\n   characteristics should be mapped to the transport network
    slice\n   characteristics that include bandwidth, latency and criteria such as\n
    \  isolation, directionality and disjoint routes.  Mobile slice criteria\n   need
    to be mapped to the appropriate transport slice and capabilities\n   offered in
    backhaul, midhaul and fronthaul connectivity segments\n   between radio side network
    functions and user plane function\n   (gateway).\n\n   This document describes
    how mobile network functions map its slice\n   criteria to identifiers in IP packets
    that transport network segments\n   use to grant transport layer services during
    UE mobility scenarios.\n   Applicability of this framework and underlying transport
    networks,\n   which can enable different slice properties is also discussed.  This\n
    \  is based on mapping between mobile and transport underlays (L2,\n   Segment
    Routing, IPv6, MPLS and IPv4).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
