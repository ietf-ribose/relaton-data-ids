abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Efficient QoS resource management is needed for a host of existing
    andever-increasing new services. For service performance, flexibility, andreduced
    cost it is preferable to provide integration of these services on ashared network.
    Such integration and sharing is facilitated by QoS resourcemanagement techniques
    described in the draft which are applicable toMPLS-based networks. Such QoS resource
    management techniques are used inPSTNs to standardize service classification,
    bandwidth allocation, bandwidthprotection, and priority routing treatment for
    all network services. In thedraft we illustrate the principles of QoS resource
    management and describetheir application to MPLS-based networks. In the proposed
    QoS resourcemanagement method, bandwidth is allocated in discrete changes to each
    ofthree virtual networks (VNs) corresponding to high-priority key services,normal
    priority services, and best-effort lower priority services.Bandwidth changes in
    VN bandwidth capacity are determined by edgeswitch/routers based on an overall
    aggregated bandwidth demand for VNcapacity (not on a per-connection demand basis).
    Based on the aggregatedbandwidth demand, these edge switch/routers make periodic
    discrete changesin bandwidth allocation, that is, either increase or decrease
    bandwidth onthe constraint-based routing label switched paths (CRLSPs) constituting
    theVN bandwidth capacity. We propose to add optional parameters in theconstraint-based
    routing label distribution protocol (CRLDP) for QoSresource management. In particular,
    we propose an optional depth-of-search(DoS) type/length/value (TLV) parameter
    in the CRLDP label request messageto control the bandwidth allocation on individual
    links in a CRLSP. Inaddition, we propose an optional modify-TLV parameter in the
    CRLDP labelrequest message to allow modification of the assigned traffic parameters(such
    as peak data rate, committed data rate, etc.) of an already existingCRL</p>"
