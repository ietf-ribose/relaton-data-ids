abstract:
  content: "<p>This document initiates the discussion on enhanced mobility anchoring
    solutions in the context of a distributed mobility management deployment. Such
    solutions consider the problem of assigning a mobility anchor and a gateway at
    the initiation of a session. In addition, the mid-session switching of the mobility
    anchor in a distributed mobility management environment is considered.</p>"
