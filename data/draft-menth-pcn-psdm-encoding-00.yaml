abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes how PCN marks can be encoded into the IPheader.
    The presented encoding reuses the ECN field of the Voice-Admit DSCP in a single
    PCN domain. The encoding of unmarked PCNpackets indicates whether they are subject
    to either excess- orexhaustive-marking. This is useful, e.g., when data and probepackets
    require different marking mechanisms.StatusThis memo is posted as an Internet-Draft
    with an intent to eventuallybe published as an experimental RFC.</p>"
