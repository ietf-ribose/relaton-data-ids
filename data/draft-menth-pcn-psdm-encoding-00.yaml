abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes how PCN marks can be encoded into the IP header.
    The presented encoding reuses the ECN field of the Voice- Admit DSCP in a single
    PCN domain. The encoding of unmarked PCN packets indicates whether they are subject
    to either excess- or exhaustive-marking. This is useful, e.g., when data and probe
    packets require different marking mechanisms. Status This memo is posted as an
    Internet-Draft with an intent to eventually be published as an experimental RFC.</p>"
