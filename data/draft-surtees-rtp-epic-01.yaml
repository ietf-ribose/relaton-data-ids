abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a profile for compressing RTP/UDP/IP using the
    Efficient Protocol Independent Compression (EPIC) [2] scheme. The RObust Header
    Compression [1] scheme is designed to compress packet headers over error prone
    channels. It is built around an extensible core framework that can be tailored
    to compress new protocol stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles. This profile
    gives behaviours similar to (a subset of) the functionality of [1] and is useful
    to show how EPIC would work on a protocol stack about which much is already known.</p>"
