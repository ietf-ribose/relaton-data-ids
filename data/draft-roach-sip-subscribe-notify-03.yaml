abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) [1] . The purpose of this extension is to provide a generic and extensible
    framework by which SIP nodes can request notification from remote nodes indicating
    that certain events have occured. Concrete uses of the mechanism described in
    this document may be standardized in the future.</p>"
