abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) introduced a mechanism whereby
    a\n   mail operator can affix a signature to a message that validates at\n   the
    level of the signer's domain name.  It specified two possible\n   ways of converting
    the message body to a canonical form, one\n   intolerant of changes and the other
    tolerant of simple changes to\n   whitespace within the message body.\n\n   The
    provided canonicalization schemes do not tolerate changes in a\n   structured
    message such as conversion between transfer encodings or\n   addition of new message
    parts.  It is useful to have these\n   capabilities to allow for transport through
    gateways, and also for\n   transport through handlers (such as mailing list services)
    that might\n   add content that would invalidate a signature generated using the\n
    \  existing canonicalization schemes.\n\n   This document presents a mechanism
    for generating a canonicalization\n   that can allows easy detection of modified
    content while still being\n   valid for the content it originally signed.  It
    also presents a use\n   profile of DKIM that takes advantage of this capability.\n\n\t
