abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the use of OAuth to obtain and validate ephemeral
    tokens that can be used for TURN authentication. The usage of ephemeral tokens
    ensure that access to a TURN server can be controlled even if the tokens are compromised,
    as is the case in WebRTC where TURN credentials must be specified in Javascript.</p>"
