- content: "<p>This document specifies the architectural framework for constructing
    secure and privacy-preserving instantiations of the Privacy Pass protocol (as

    ecosystem of Privacy Pass clients and servers. This document makes recommendations
    on how this ecosystem should be constructed to ensure the privacy of clients and
    the security of all participating entities.</p>"
