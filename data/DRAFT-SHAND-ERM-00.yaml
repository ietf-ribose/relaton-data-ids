abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Conventional multicast builds a tree structure from the source
    of a\nmulticast stream to the destinations of that stream. Multicast\npackets
    are forwarded from the sources down the tree by each\nintervening router. Each
    router contains state information to\ndetermine the next hop forwarding destination(s)
    for a packet. Where\nthere are a large number of groups, this gives rise to a
    scaling\nproblem. The amount of state to be stored in the routers becomes\nimpossibly
    large.\nIt is attractive to consider the use of multicast to provide\napplications
    such as n-way voice and video conferencing, which would\nrequire a very large
    number (perhaps millions) of relatively small\n(between 3 and 10 members) multicast
    groups.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
