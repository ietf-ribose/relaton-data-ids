abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of QUIC to provide transport
    privacy\n   for DNS.  The encryption provided by QUIC has similar properties to\n
    \  that provided by TLS, while QUIC transport eliminates the head-of-\n   line
    blocking issues inherent with TCP and provides more efficient\n   error corrections
    than UDP.  DNS over QUIC (DNS/QUIC) has privacy\n   properties similar to DNS
    over TLS specified in RFC7858, and\n   performance similar to classic DNS over
    UDP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
