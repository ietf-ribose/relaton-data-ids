abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network nodes may discard packets if they are unable to process\n
    \  protocol headers of packets due to processing constraints or limits.\n   When
    such packets are dropped, the sender receives no indication so\n   it cannot take
    action to address the cause of discarded packets. This\n   document defines ICMP
    errors that can be sent by a node that discards\n   packets because it is unable
    to process the protocol headers. A node\n   that receives such an ICMP error may
    be able to modify what it sends\n   in future packets to avoid subsequent packet
    discards.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
