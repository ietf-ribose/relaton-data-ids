abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the relationships between the Internet architecture
    and the ability of people to exercise their right to peaceful assembly and the
    right to association online. The Internet increasingly mediates our lives, our
    relationships, and our ability to exercise our human rights. As a global assemblage,
    the Internet provides a public space, yet it is predominantly built on private
    infrastructure. Since Internet protocols and architecture play a central role
    in the management, development, and use of the Internet, we analyze the relation
    between protocols, architecture, and the rights to assemble and associate to mitigate
    infringements on those rights.</p>"
