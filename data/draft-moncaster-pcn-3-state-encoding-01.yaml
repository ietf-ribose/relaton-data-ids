abstract:
  content: "<p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a mechanism designed to protectthe
    Quality of Service of inelastic flows. It does this by markingpackets when traffic
    load on a link is approaching or has exceeded athreshold below the physical link
    rate. This baseline encodingspecified how two encoding states could be encoded
    into the IPheader. This document specified an extension to the baselineencoding
    that enables three encoding states to be carried in the IPheader as well as enabling
    limited support for end-to-end ECN.Status (to be removed by RFC Editor)This memo
    is posted as an Internet-Draft with an intent to eventuallybe published as an
    experimental RFC. The PCN Working Group will beasked to adopt this memo as a Working
    Group document describing oneof several possible experimental PCN encoding schemes.
    The intentionis that the title of this document will change to avoid confusionwith
    the three state marking scheme.Changes from previous draftsFrom 00 to 01:o Checked
    terminology for consistency with[I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding]o Minor editorial
    changes.</p>"
