abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Certificate Authorities (CAs) managing CA certificates and
    End-Entity\n   (EE) certificates within the Resource Public Key Infrastructure\n
    \  (RPKI) will also manage BGPsec router certificates.  But the rollover\n   of
    CA and EE certificates BGPsec router certificates have additional\n   considerations
    for Normal and emergency rollover processes.  The\n   rollover must be carefully
    managed in order to synchronize\n   distribution of router public keys and BGPsec
    routers creating BGPsec\n   Update messages verified with those router public
    keys.  This\n   document provides general recommendations for the rollover process,\n
    \  as well as describing reasons why the rollover of BGPsec router\n   certificates
    might be necessary.  When this rollover process is\n   followed the rollover should
    be accomplished without routing\n   information being lost.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
