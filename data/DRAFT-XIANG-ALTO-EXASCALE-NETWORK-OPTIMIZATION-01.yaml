abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Massive datasets continue to be acquired, simulated, processed
    and\n   analyzed by globally distributed scientific collaborations, and the\n
    \  volume of this data is growing exponentially.  These datasets need to\n   be
    exchanged through a global network infrastructure.  Applications\n   that manage
    and analyze such massive data volumes can benefit\n   substantially from the information
    about networking, computing and\n   storage resources from each member sites,
    and more directly from\n   network-resident services that optimize and load balance
    resource\n   usage among multiple data transfer and analytic requests, and achieve\n
    \  a better utilization of multi-resources in clusters.\n\n   The Application-Layer
    Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol can\n   provide via extensions the network
    information about different\n   clusters/sites, to both users and proactive network
    management\n   services where applicable, with the goal of improving both\n   application
    performance and network resource utilization.  However,\n   it has been verified
    in both science networks and commercial data\n   center networks that network
    resource in many cases is not the\n   bottleneck preventing the efficiency of
    large dataset transfer and\n   data-intensive analytics.  To achieve a greater
    overall efficiency of\n   the science programs' workflows information about different\n
    \  resources, such as computing, storage and networking, should be\n   provided
    to data intensive applications simultaneously.\n\n   In this document, we propose
    that it is feasible to use existing ALTO\n   services to provides not only network
    information, but also\n   information about other resources in science networks
    including\n   computing and storage.  We introduce an Exascale Science Application\n
    \  Orchestrator (ExaO), which achieves an efficient multi-resource\n   allocation
    to support low-latency dataset transfer and data intensive\n   analytics in exascale
    science networks.  ExaO provides simple APIs\n   for users to submit and manage
    dataset transfer and analytic requests\n   and to monitor the status of each request,
    along with fine-grained\n   local and global network and site state information
    in real-time.  It\n   collects cluster information from multiple ALTO services
    utilizing\n   topology extensions and leverages emerging SDN control capabilities\n
    \  to orchestrate the resource allocation for dataset transfers and\n   analytic
    tasks, leading to improved transfer and analytic latency as\n   well as more efficient
    utilization of multi-resources in clusters/\n   sites.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
