abstract:
- content: "<p>The base IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
    protocol has a TRILL campus-wide MTU feature, specified in RFCs 6325 and 7177,
    that assures that link-state changes can be successfully flooded throughout the
    campus while being able to take advantage of a campus-wide capability to support
    jumbo packets. This document specifies recommended updates to that MTU feature
    to take advantage, for appropriate link-local packets, of link-local MTUs that
    exceed the TRILL campus MTU. In addition, it specifies an efficient algorithm
    for local MTU testing. This document updates RFCs 6325, 7177, and 7780.</p>"
