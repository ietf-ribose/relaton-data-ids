abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>While IKEv2 supports public key based authentication (PKI), the
    \ncorresponding use of in-band CRLs is problematic due to unbounded CRL \nsize.
    \ The size of an OCSP response is however well-bounded and small.  \nThis document
    defines two extensions to IKEv2 which enable the use of \nOCSP for in-band signaling
    of certificate revocation status.  Two new \ncontent encodings are defined for
    use in the CERTREQ and CERT payloads:  \nOCSP Responder Hash and OCSP Response.
    \ An OCSP Responder Hash CERTREQ \npayload triggers transmission of an OCSP Response
    CERT payload.\n\t </p>\n      "
