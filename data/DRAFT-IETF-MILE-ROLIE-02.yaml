abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a resource-oriented approach to cyber
    security\n   information sharing.  Using this approach, operators may share and\n
    \  exchange representations of cyber security incidents, attack\n   indicators,
    software vulnerabilities, and other related information\n   as Web-addressable
    resources.  Furthermore, consumers and other\n   stakeholders may access and search
    this security content as needed,\n   establishing a rapid and on-demand information
    exchange network for\n   restricted internal use or public access repositories.
    \ This\n   specification builds on and extends the Atom Publishing Protocol and\n
    \  Atom Syndication Format to transport and share cyber security\n   resource
    representations.  This document leverages the existing\n   representations IODEF
    and RID where appropriate, and supports related\n   cyber security representation
    standards.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
