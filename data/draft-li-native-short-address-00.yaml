abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies mechanisms of NSA (Native Short Address) that
    enables IP packet transmission over links where the transmission of a full length
    address may be wasteful. All descriptions will focus on carrying IP packets across
    LLN (Low power and Lossy Networks), those LLNs positioned as limited domains.
    The specifications include NSA allocation, routing with NSA, header format design
    including length- variable fields, and how to access full IPv6 networks.</p>"
