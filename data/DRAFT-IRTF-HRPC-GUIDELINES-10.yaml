abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document sets guidelines for human rights considerations
    for\n   developers working on network protocols and architectures, similar to\n
    \  the work done on the guidelines for privacy considerations [RFC6973].\n   This
    is an updated version of the guidelines for human rights\n   considerations in
    [RFC8280].\n\n   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is\n   published for informational purposes.\n\n   This informational document
    has consensus for publication from the\n   Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)
    Human Right Protocol\n   Considerations Research Group.  It has been reviewed,
    tried, and\n   tested by both by the research group as well as by researchers
    and\n   practitioners from outside the research group.  The research group\n   acknowledges
    that the understanding of the impact of internet\n   protocols and architecture
    on society is a developing practice and is\n   a body of research that is still
    in development.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
