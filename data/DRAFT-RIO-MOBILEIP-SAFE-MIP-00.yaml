abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To date, a number of authentication protocols have been proposed
    for\nMobile-IP. Among these incompatible protocols, it is not clear\nuntil now
    which one will be the preferred one for global deployment\nof Mobile-IP. Based
    on the policy of allowing various protocols\nto co-exist, this draft specifies
    an authentication framework that\nallows Mobile-IP entities to negotiate for a
    protocol to be employed.\nThe framework also outlines the utilization of message
    extension\nfor carrying all information required by the authentication protocol\nbeing
    used.\nBased on the proposed framework, this draft then proposes a 'Minimal\nPublic
    Key Based Authentication' which addresses the need for\nscalable but lightweight
    authentication protocol. The proposed\nprotocol secures the registration process,
    and requires a number of\nmessage rounds that is fully compatible with the base
    Mobile-IP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
