abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Most distributed (client/server) applications require an authenti-cation
    process between the client and the server before the serverwill grant access to
    its managed resources. Many applications pro-vide varying levels of access to
    server resources based on a combi-nation of authentication credentials and access
    control rules.The collection of information used to control access to resourcesis
    called 'authorization information'.The authorization identifer datasets contain
    lists of users andgroups of users that can be used by applications for authorizationpurposes.
    Access control mechanisms can be abstracted from under-lying authentication mechanisms
    and credential formats. They canbe extended to include group memberships in dynamic
    calculationsfor access rights to resources or in definition of one time autho-rization
    certificates.The Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) supports theremote
    storage and access of many types of structured configurationinformation. The authorization
    identifier datasets specificationdescribes the 'userid' and 'groupid' datasets
    which contain theauthorization information. It also describes ACAP server capabili-ties
    that advertise a server's support for authorization user andgroup semantics.</p>"
