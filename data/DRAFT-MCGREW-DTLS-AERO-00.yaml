abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is a communication
    security\n   protocol that is attractive for use in constrained environments,
    in\n   which it is important to minimize the data expansion added by the\n   security
    protocol, and to support multicast security .  Authenticated\n   Encryption with
    Replay prOtection (AERO) is a cryptographic technique\n   that is well suited
    for use in DTLS, especially in these scenarios:\n   it has minimal data expansion,
    avoids the need to manage implicit\n   state, works well with multiple receivers
    and multiple senders, and\n   provides strong misuse resistance.  This document
    describes how AERO\n   can be used in DTLS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
