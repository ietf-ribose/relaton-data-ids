abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a broadcast-friendly, many-to-many Defined-
    trust Transport (DeftT) that makes it simple to express and enforce application
    and deployment specific integrity, authentication, access control and behavior
    constraints directly in the protocol stack. DeftT combined with IPv6 multicast
    and modern hardware-based methods for securing keys and code provides an easy
    to use foundation for secure and efficient communications in Limited Domains (RFC8799),
    in particular for Operational Technology (OT) networks.</p>"
