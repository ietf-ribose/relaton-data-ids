abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile DTLS (Mobi-D) is an extension to DTLS that provides host\nmobility
    support.  After obtaining a new IP address or port, a DTLS\nclient mobile host
    can continue sending to its DTLS server\ncorrespondent host.  The mobile host
    continues to use the existing\nset of security parameters, from the new address,
    without re-\nnegotiation.  The correspondent host accepts packets from the new
    IP\naddress or port, also without re-negotiation.  After receiving any\nvalid
    DTLS packet from the mobile host's new address or port, the\ncorrespondent host
    uses the new address or port to send to the mobile\nhost.\n\t </p>\n      "
