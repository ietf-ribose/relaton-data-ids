abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>One basic model for IETF operations is that the IESG is given
    general\nguidance in specific procedural documents but sufficient discretion\nand
    flexibility to adapt the rules and make new ones in order to make\nthe IETF work
    smoothly.  This model underlies a number of reform\nproposals, including recent
    ones from this author.  However, there\nhas been an undercurrent of suspicion
    from some members of the\ncommunity -- suspicion that the IESG is abusive of that
    discretion\nand cannot be trusted.  Those suspicions have, to some extent, been\nreinforced
    by questions about IESG-adopted procedures that seem to\ncontradict procedures
    approved by the community and documented in\nBCPs.  The community cannot move
    forward with models based on both\ntrust and distrust in the IESG's ability, and
    level of\nresponsibility, to do its job.  In an attempt to focus this part of\nthe
    debate, this document proposes to dramatically narrow IESG's\nscope of authority
    and discretion.\n\nIn particular, it proposes to move the IESG, procedurally,
    onto an 'anything not explicitly required is forbidden' model, and, indeed, a\nvery
    narrow and punitive member of that family.  While the author\nbelieves this would
    be a terrible idea, it appears to be time that\nthe community either focuses on
    it and moves in this direction or\nstops wasting time hinting about it.\n\t </p>\n
