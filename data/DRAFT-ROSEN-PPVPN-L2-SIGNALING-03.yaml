abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>[PWE3-CONTROL] specifies a 'signaling protocol' which uses extensions\nof
    LDP [RFC 3036] to set up and maintain pseudowires [PWE3-FR, PWE3-\nARCH].  Like
    any protocol which sets up connections, the signaling\nprotocol provides a method
    by which each endpoint can identify the\nother.  [L2VPN-FW] describes a number
    of different ways in which sets\nof pseudowires may be combined together into
    'Provider Provisioned\nLayer 2 VPNs' (L2 PPVPNs, or L2VPNs), resulting in a number
    of\ndifferent kinds of L2VPN.  Different kinds of L2VPN may have\ndifferent 'provisioning
    models', i.e., different models for what\ninformation needs to be configured in
    what entities. Once configured,\nthe provisioning information is distributed by
    a 'discovery process',\nand once the information is discovered, the signaling
    protocol is\nautomatically invoked to set up the required pseudowires.  The\nsemantics
    of the endpoint identifiers which the signaling protocol\nuses for a particular
    type of L2VPN are determined by the\nprovisioning model.  This document specifies
    a number of PPVPN\nprovisioning models, and specifies the semantic structure of
    the\nendpoint identifiers required. It further specifies how the endpoint\nidentifiers
    are carried in the 'Generalized Identifier FEC' of\n[PWE3-CONTROL].  It is believed
    that the specified identifiers can\nalso be carried within the L2TP signaling
    protocol, though this is\ncurrently not specified.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
