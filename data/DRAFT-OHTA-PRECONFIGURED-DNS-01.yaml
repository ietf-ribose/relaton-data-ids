abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes how to make addresses of DNS servers\n
    \  preconfigured in clients.  Well known anycast addresses, which are\n   assigned
    to DNS servers, should be preconfigured to resolvers of\n   clients. It is also
    explained why anycast does not offer redundancy.\n\t </p>\n      "
