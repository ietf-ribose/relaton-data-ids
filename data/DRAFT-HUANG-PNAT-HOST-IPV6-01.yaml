abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPv4 migrating to IPv6 is a network layer issue, it is not easy
    to\nmandate the application in the host to change in the first place, the\nnetwork
    layer may have to have a solution to support conventional\nIPv4 appliations in
    the IPv6 only network, especially when there are\nmultiple applications need to
    be supported.  This document describes\na mechanism for providing a host-based
    IPv6 translation technology\nwhich could guarantee IPv4 application backward compatibility.
    \ A new\nwell known IPv6 prefix is used for the destination address\ntranslation
    and network assigned prefix will be used for source\naddress translation.\n\t
