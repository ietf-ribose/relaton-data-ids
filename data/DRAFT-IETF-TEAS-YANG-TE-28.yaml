abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a YANG data model for the provisioning
    and\n   management of Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels, Label Switched Paths\n
    \  (LSPs), and interfaces.  The model is divided into YANG modules that\n   classify
    data into generic, device-specific, technology agnostic, and\n   technology-specific
    elements.\n\n   This model covers data for configuration, operational state, remote\n
    \  procedural calls, and event notifications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
