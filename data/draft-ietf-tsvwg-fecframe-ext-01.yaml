abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6363 describes a framework for using Forward Error Correction (FEC)
    codes with applications in public and private IP networks to provide protection
    against packet loss. The framework supports applying FEC to arbitrary packet flows
    over unreliable transport and is primarily intended for real-time, or streaming,
    media. However FECFRAME as per RFC 6363 is restricted to block FEC codes. The
    present document extends FECFRAME to support FEC Codes based on a sliding encoding
    window, in addition to Block FEC Codes, in a backward compatible way. During multicast/broadcast
    real-time content delivery, the use of sliding window codes significantly improves
    robustness in harsh environments, with less repair traffic and lower FEC-related
    added latency.</p>"
