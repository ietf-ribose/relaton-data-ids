abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Urban Air Mobility concerns the introduction of manned and
    unmanned\n   aircraft within urban environments, while Intelligent Transportation\n
    \  Systems have traditionally considered only terrestrial vehicles\n   operating
    on city streets and highways.  This document considers the\n   implications for
    introduction of low-altitude aircraft within urban\n   environments operating
    in harmony with ground transportation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
