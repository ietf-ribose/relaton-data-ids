abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of Random Linear Network Coding\n
    \  (RLNC) schemes for erasure correction in data transfer, with an\n   emphasis
    on RLNC encoded symbol representations in data packets.\n   Both block and sliding
    window RLNC code implementations are\n   described.  By providing erasure correction
    using randomly generated\n   repair symbols, such RLNC-based schemes offer advantages
    in\n   accommodating varying frame sizes and dynamically changing\n   connections,
    reducing the need for feedback, and lowering the amount\n   of state information
    needed at the sender and receiver.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
