abstract:
- content: "<p>Routing and routing functions in enterprise and carrier networks are
    typically performed by network devices (routers and switches) using a routing
    information base (RIB). Protocols and configuration push data into the RIB and
    the RIB manager installs state into the hardware for packet forwarding. This draft
    specifies an information model for the RIB to enable defining a standardized data
    model, and it was used by the IETF's I2RS WG to design the I2RS RIB data model.
    It is being published to record the higher-level informational model decisions
    for RIBs so that other developers of RIBs may benefit from the design concepts.</p>"
