abstract:
- content: "<p>IEEE 802.1 has developed standards as part of its Data Center Bridging
    (DCB) activity to (1) efficiently minimize data loss due to queue overflow for
    selected classes of traffic within Local Area Networks (LANs) meeting certain
    conditions and (2) provide means to allocate the available bandwidth on links
    to different classes of traffic. These standards are now in IEEE Std 802.1Qbb-2011,
    IEEE Std 802.1Qaz-2011, and the Congestion Notificaiton freature in IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011.
    This document briefly explains these standards and discusses the support of these
    IEEE 802 standards in TRILL switches (devices that implement the IETF TRILL protocol
    standard).</p>"
