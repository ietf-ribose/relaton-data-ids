abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet Calendar Access Protocol  (ICAP) allows a client
    to\naccess, manipulate and store Calendar information on a server. ICAP\nemploys
    the iCalendar format [ICAL] for interchange of calendaring\ninformation.\n \nICAP
    includes operations for creating Calendar stores on a server,\nopening them and
    retrieving information about them. When a\nCalendar Store has been opened, it
    can be bounded by start and end\ntimes so that the client can act on a smaller
    subset of Calendar\ninformation for more efficient operation. ICAP allows users
    to store\nnew Calendar Objects into their own Calendar store and Calendar\nstores
    owned by other users with a single operation.\n \nICAP supports searching iCalendar
    objects within a Calendar Store.\nSearches can be based on any iCalendar property
    and filtered by\niCalendar Component type.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
