abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines generalized primitives for use in establishing
    end-to-end confidentiality in multiparty communications. These primitives address
    three essential elements of group privacy: authentication, group membership, and
    secure key exchange. A core objective of this specification is to define these
    primitives as common constructs for private group communications and in a manner
    that allows for flexibility in how they are integrated and deployed as part of
    new and existing group communications applications.</p>"
