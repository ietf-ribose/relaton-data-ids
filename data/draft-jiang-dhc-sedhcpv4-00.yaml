abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) enables DHCPv4
    servers to pass configuration parameters. It offers configuration flexibility.
    If not being secured, DHCPv4 is vulnerable to various attacks, particularly spoofing
    attacks. This document analyzes the security issues of DHCPv4 and specifies a
    Secure DHCPv4 mechanism for communications between DHCPv4 clients and servers.
    This document provides a DHCPv4 client/server authentication mechanism based on
    server's public/private key pairs and client's certificates. The DHCPv4 message
    exchanges are protected by the signature option and the timestamp option newly
    defined in this document.</p>"
