abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an IANA registry in order to assign non-\n
    \  transitive extended communities from.  These are similar to the\n   existing
    well-known BGP communities defined in RFC 1997 but provide a\n   control over
    inter-AS community advertisement as, per RFC RFC 4360,\n   they are not transitive
    across Autonomous System boundaries.\n\n   For that purpose, this document defines
    the use of the reserved\n   Autonomous System number 0.65535 in the non-transitive
    generic four-\n   octet AS specific extended community type.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
