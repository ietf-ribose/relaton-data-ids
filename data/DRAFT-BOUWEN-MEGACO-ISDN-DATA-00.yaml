abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In ISDN interfaces the D-channel is used to transport the Q.931\nsignalling
    messages. In addition, the D-channel can transport packet\ndata for user-to-user
    communication. The Megaco protocol\nspecification has to be extended to support
    data in an ISDN D-\nchannel. More specifically, ephemeral terminations on top
    of\nphysical ISDN terminations have to be allowed, and support for the\nISDN addressing
    scheme has to be added to refer to the data streams\nin the D-channel. This draft
    defines the required additional\nfunctionality, that could be part of the second
    version of the\nMegaco protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
