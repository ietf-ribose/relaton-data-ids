abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this draft, a mechanism for available capacity estimation of
    an \nend-to-end path is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy \ncompared
    with the existing IGI(Initial Gap Increasing)/PTR(Packet \nTransmission Rate)
    mechanism. The proposed mechanism defines three \ncases of the difference between
    the average output gap and the input \ngap, and then reflects fully them, while
    the existing mechanism \nreflected only two cases. Since three cases are handled
    respectively \nby appropriate corresponding manners, the proposed mechanism can
    be \nexpected to reduce the detection error for the turning point. \nTherefore,
    the end-to-end available capacity can be estimated more \naccurate than the existing
    mechanism.\n\t </p>\n      "
