abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies additions and amendments to RFC4462. It defines
    a new key exchange method that uses GSS-API in a way to provide key exchange method
    that is resistant to attacks by quantum computers. The purpose of this specification
    is to provide an easy- to-implement upgrade to environments that require resistance
    against quantum computers before widely accepted post-quantum cryptography algorithms
    are established.</p>"
