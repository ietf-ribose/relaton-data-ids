abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends PASSporT, a token for conveying\n   cryptographically-signed
    call information about personal\n   communications, to include rich meta-data
    about a call and caller\n   that can be signed and integrity protected, transmitted,
    and\n   subsequently rendered to the intended called party.  This framework\n
    \  is intended to include and extend caller and call specific\n   information
    beyond human-readable display name comparable to the\n   \"Caller ID\" function
    common on the telephone network.  The JSON\n   element defined for this purpose,
    Rich Call Data (RCD), is an\n   extensible object defined to either be used as
    part of STIR or with\n   SIP Call-Info to include related information about calls
    that helps\n   people decide whether to pick up the phone.  This signing of the
    RCD\n   information is also enhanced with a integrity mechanism that is\n   designed
    to protect the authoring and transport of this information\n   between authoritative
    and non-authoritative parties generating and\n   signing the Rich Call Data for
    support of different usage and content\n   policies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
