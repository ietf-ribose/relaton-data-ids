abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a way to apply opportunistic security\n
    \  between adjacent nodes on an MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) or\n   between
    end points of an LSP.  It explains how keys may be agreed\n   to enable encryption,
    and how key identifiers are exchanged in\n   encrypted MPLS packets.  Finally,
    this document describes the\n   applicability of this approach to opportunistic
    security in MPLS\n   networks with an indication of the level of improved security
    as\n   well as the continued vulnerabilities.\n\n   This document does not describe
    security for MPLS control plane\n   protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
