abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are times when a user has a pair protected resources
    that would\n   like to request access to each other.  While OAuth flows typically\n
    \  enable the user to grant a client access to a protected resource,\n   granting
    the inverse access requires an additional flow.  Mutual\n   OAuth enables a more
    seemless experience for the user to grant access\n   to a pair of protected resources.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
