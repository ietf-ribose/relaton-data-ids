abstract:
  content: "<p>The Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocolestablishes
    core-base tree to forward multicast datagrams in anetwork. In PIM-SM, the core
    or Rendezvous Point (RP) of a group isdetermined at each multicast router by hashing
    a group address, i.e.,a class-D IP address, to one of the candidate RPs. The hash
    functionis characterized by its ability to evenly and uniquely choose thecore
    for a group and remains insensitive to the geographicdistribution of the group
    members and the sources. However, it mayresult in a multicast tree with high cost.This
    draft presents a relocation mechanism which is extension to PIM-SM, in which RP
    could be relocated periodically. When a new RP isfound, the original RP informs
    all members to re-join to the new RP.</p>"
