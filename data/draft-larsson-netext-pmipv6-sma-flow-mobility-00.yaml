abstract:
  content: <p>This document specifies how flow mobility can be realized for amobile
    node with multiple network interfaces, for which the networkprovides mobility
    support by means of Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). Byintroducing a "Primary Prefix",
    the mobile node is able to maintainIP data sessions when moving between different
    network interfaces.This document introduces a new set of ICMP and Mobility Headermessages.
    It requires modifications of the mobile node. However,since support for simultaneous
    multi-access and flow mobilityrequires modifications of the mobile node anyway,
    the modificationssuggested in this document are considered to be modest.The suggested
    enhancement is fully backwards compatible with the baseProxy Mobile IPv6 specification.
    The mobile node may be an IPv4-onlynode, IPv6-only node, or a dual-stack node.</p>
