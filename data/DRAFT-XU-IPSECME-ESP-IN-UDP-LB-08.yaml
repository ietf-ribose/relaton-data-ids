abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPsec Virtual Private Network (VPN) is widely used by enterprises
    to\n   interconnect their geographical dispersed branch office locations\n   across
    the Wide Area Network (WAN) or the Internet, especially in the\n   Software-Defined-WAN
    (SD-WAN) era.  In addition, IPsec is also\n   increasingly used by cloud providers
    to encrypt IP traffic traversing\n   data center networks and data center interconnect
    WANs so as to meet\n   the security and compliance requirements, especially in
    financial\n   cloud and governmental cloud environments.  To fully utilize the\n
    \  bandwidth available in the data center network, the data center\n   interconnect
    WAN or the Internet, load balancing of IPsec traffic\n   over Equal Cost Multi-Path
    (ECMP) and/or Link Aggregation Group (LAG)\n   is much attractive to those enterprises
    and cloud providers.  This\n   document defines a method to encapsulate IPsec
    Encapsulating Security\n   Payload (ESP) packets over UDP tunnels for improving
    load-balancing\n   of IPsec ESP traffic.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
