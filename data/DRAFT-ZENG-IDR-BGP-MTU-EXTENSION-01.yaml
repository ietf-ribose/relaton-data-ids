abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proper functioning of path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
    discovery\n   [RFC1191] requires that IP routers have knowledge of the MTU for
    each\n   link to which they are connected.  As MPLS progresses, [RFC3988]\n   specifies
    extensions to LDP in support of LDP LSP MTU discovery.  For\n   the LSP created
    using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC3107], it\n   does not have the ability
    to signal the path MTU to the ingress Label\n   Switching Router (LSR).  In the
    absence of this functionality, the\n   MTU for the BGP LSP must be statically
    configured by network\n   operators or by equivalent off-line mechanisms.\n\n
    \  This document defines the MTU Extended Community for BGP in support\n   of
    BGP LSP MTU discovery.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
