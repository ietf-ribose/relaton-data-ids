abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component
    capable\n   of selecting paths through a traffic engineered network.  These paths\n
    \  may be supplied in response to requests for computation, or may be\n   unsolicited
    instructions issued by the PCE to network elements.  Both\n   approaches use the
    PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) to convey the\n   details of the computed path.\n\n
    \  Traffic flows may be categorized and described using \"Flow\n   Specifications\".
    \ RFC 5575 defines the Flow Specification and\n   describes how Flow Specification
    Components are used to describe\n   traffic flows.  RFC 5575 also defines how
    Flow Specifications may be\n   distributed in BGP to allow specific traffic flows
    to be associated\n   with routes.\n\n   This document specifies a set of extensions
    to PCEP to support\n   dissemination of Flow Specifications.  This allows a PCE
    to indicate\n   what traffic should be placed on each path that it is aware of.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
