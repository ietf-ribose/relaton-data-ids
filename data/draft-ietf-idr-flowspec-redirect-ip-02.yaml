abstract:
- content: "<p>Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination
    of traffic flow specification rules. This has many possible applications but the
    primary one for many network operators is the distribution of traffic filtering
    actions for DDoS mitigation. The flow-spec standard [RFC 5575] defines a redirect-to-VRF
    action for policy-based forwarding but this mechanism can be difficult to use,
    particularly in networks without L3 VPN infrastructure. This draft defines a new
    redirect-to-IP flow-spec action that provides a simpler method of policy-based
    forwarding. The details of the action, including the IPv4 or IPv6 target address,
    are encoded in newly defined BGP extended communities.</p>"
