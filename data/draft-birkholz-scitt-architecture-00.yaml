abstract:
- content: "<p>Traceability of physical and digital artifacts in supply chains is
    a long-standing, but increasingly serious security concern. The rise in popularity
    of verifiable data structures as a mechanism to make actors more accountable for
    breaching their compliance promises has found some successful applications to
    specific use cases (such as the supply chain for digital certificates), but lacks
    a generic and scalable architecture that can address a wider range of use cases.
    This memo defines a generic and scalable architecture to enable transparency across
    any supply chain with minimum adoption barriers for producers (who can register
    their claims on any TS, with the guarantee that all consumers will be able to
    verify them) and enough flexibility to allow different implementations of Transparency
    Services with various auditing and compliance requirements.</p>"
