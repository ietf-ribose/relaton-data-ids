abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents different deployment models of PCN-based\nadmission
    control (AC) and flow termination (FT) using packet-\nspecific dual marking (PSDM)
    for encoding.  Their major is that they\nrequire only a single DSCP for packet
    marking and that they work\nreliably in the presence of ingress-egress aggregates
    (IEAs) with\nonly a very small average number of flows.  Moreover, an advanced\nmodel
    even works with multipath routing.\n\t </p>\n      "
