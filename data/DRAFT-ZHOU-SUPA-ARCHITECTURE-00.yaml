abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, there are network services that impose specific
    demands\n   on a communication network. SUPA considers two types of network\n
    \  services, the inter Data Center (DC) communication and Virtual\n   Private
    Networks (VPN). This document describes the SUPA basic\n   architecture, its elements
    and interfaces.  The main SUPA\n   architecture entities are the Network Service
    Agent (NSA) and the\n   Application-based Policy Decision (ABPD). NSA is a functional
    entity\n   that creates and runs network services/ ABPD is a functional\n   entity,
    which 1) enables the generation, maintenance and release of\n   i) actual/detailed
    network topologies and ii) VPN and inter DC\n   service specific abstractions
    and 2) mapping between the VPN and\n   inter DC service service specific abstractions
    and the network\n   topology and configuration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
