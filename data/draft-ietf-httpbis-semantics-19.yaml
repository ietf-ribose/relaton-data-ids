abstract:
- content: <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application- level
    protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document
    describes the overall architecture of HTTP, establishes common terminology, and
    defines aspects of the protocol that are shared by all versions. In this definition
    are core protocol elements, extensibility mechanisms, and the "http" and "https"
    Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes. This document updates RFC 3864 and
    obsoletes RFC 2818, RFC 7231, RFC 7232, RFC 7233, RFC 7235, RFC 7538, RFC 7615,
    RFC 7694, and portions of RFC 7230.</p>
