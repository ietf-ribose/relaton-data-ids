abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When there are too many customer-MACs (C-MACs), the RRs and/or
    ASBRs\n   will be overloaded by the RT-2 routes for these MACs according to\n
    \  [I-D.dawra-bess-srv6-services].  This issue can be simply solved by\n   making
    the remote C-MAC entries learnt via data-plane MAC learning\n   (like what PBB
    VPLS have been done since [RFC7041]) rather than\n   received from RT-2 routes.
    \ This simplified solution will works as\n   well as PBB VPLS.  But this simplified
    solution will lose many\n   important features that based on the ESI concept.
    \ Because the\n   ingress-ESI can't be learnt via data-plane MAC learning at the
    egress\n   PE.  So when the data packets is forwarded following these MAC\n   entries,
    they can't benefit from the EAD/EVI routes as per RFC7432.\n   So the All-Active
    Redundancy mode for ES can't be supported.  This\n   make the simplified solution
    can't work as well as PBB EVPN\n   ([RFC7623]).\n\n   This document proposes a
    new SRv6 function type and an extension to\n   [I-D.dawra-bess-srv6-services]
    to achieve all-active mode ES\n   redundancy on TPEs and reduce the C-MAC loads
    for RRs and ASBRs.  The\n   new solution will work even more better than PBB EVPN
    under the help\n   of these extensions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
