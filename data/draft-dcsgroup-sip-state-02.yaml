abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes an extension to the Session InitiationProtocol
    (SIP) that enables proxies to distribute call state to useragents. The state information
    can be returned to the proxy when theuser agent requests a change in the characteristics
    of the activecall. By providing the ability to distribute state to the useragents
    where it can be securely stored, proxy servers can remainstateless for the duration
    of the call. This mechanism allows aproxy server to provide services that depend
    on call state, whilestill being stateless.</p>"
