abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many communication protocols operated over the modern Internet
    use\n   host names.  These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of\n   which
    may have different performance and connectivity\n   characteristics.  Since specific
    addresses or address families (IPv4\n   or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal
    on a network, clients\n   that attempt multiple connections in parallel have a
    higher chance of\n   establishing a connection sooner.  This document specifies\n
    \  requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and\n   provides
    an example algorithm.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
