abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>OAM functions are essential to ensure that the desired service
    level\nof traffic engineered connections are met.  In certain technologies\nOAM
    entities are inherently established once the connection is set\nup.  However other
    technologies, especially OAM for packet switched\nnetworks, require an extra configuration
    step after connection\nestablishment to setup OAM entities.  This document specifies\nextensions
    to RSVP-TE to support the establishment and configuration\nof OAM entities along
    with LSP signalling.Requirements Language\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described
