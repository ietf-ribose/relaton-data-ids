abstract:
- content: "<p>The Open Caching working group of the Streaming Video Alliance is focused
    on the delegation of video delivery requests from commercial CDNs to a caching
    layer at the ISP. In that aspect, Open Caching is a specific use case of CDNI,
    where the commercial CDN is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer
    is the downstream CDN (dCDN). The extensions specified in this document to the
    CDNI Metadata and FCI interfaces are derived from requirements raised by Open
    Caching but are applicable to CDNI use cases in general.</p>"
