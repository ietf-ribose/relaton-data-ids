abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The text currently present in section 6.3 from RFC 3280 is
    dedicated\n   to CRL validation. This text needs to be more detailed to explain
    \n   exactly how it can made be sure that a CRL is issued by the right \n   entity.
    \ In addition, a text dedicated to the characteristics that\n   conforming applications
    MUST support needs to be provided: the \n   current text covers the most complex
    case and is too complicated to \n   be easily simplified.  Text is proposed to
    be included in 3280bis \n   and to partially replace section 6.3 .\n\t </p>\n
