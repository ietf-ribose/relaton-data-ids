abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines three YANG modules: the first defines groupings
    for a generic TLS client, the second defines groupings for a generic TLS server,
    and the third defines common identities and groupings used by both the client
    and the server. It is intended that these groupings will be used by applications
    using the TLS protocol. Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor) This draft
    contains placeholder values that need to be replaced with finalized values at
