  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes a local QoS model, denoted as Resource\n
    \  Management in Diffserv (RMD) QoS model, for NSIS that extends the\n   IETF
    Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture with a scalable\n   admission
    control and resource reservation concept. The specification\n   of this QoS model
    includes a description of its QoS parameter\n   information, as well as how that
    information should be treated or\n   interpreted in the network.\n\t </p>\n      "
