abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 facilitates network routing over an incredibly vast address\n
    \  space, but abuse mitigation resolving to underlying structures of\n   routes
    or blocks of prefixes would be highly disruptive due to\n   collateral effects.
    \ Use of domains minimizes unintended coincidental\n   blocking while offering
    the consolidation necessary to facilitate\n   connection management.  Currently,
    email lacks conventions ensuring\n   SMTP clients can be identified by an authenticated
    domain.\n\n   DKIM is independent of intended recipients and domains accountable\n
    \  for having sent email.  SPF normally requires several text based\n   responses
    imposing high overhead to query various locations.  These\n   locations can be
    constructed by email-address local-part macros which\n   can flood caches or leverage
    DNS name compression to further increase\n   network DDoS amplifications when
    receivers' attempt to verify message\n   sources which may then only offer authorization,
    not authentication\n   of accountable domains.  Most email abuse, including what
    might be\n   imposed by SPF, is prevented with comprehensive mapping of the\n
    \  address space, but such mapping is impractical with IPv6.\n\n   An effective
    authenticated domain name alternative is needed to\n   provide a basis for assessing
    and reacting to abusive behavior.  For\n   most high scale protocols, this involves
    cryptography.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
