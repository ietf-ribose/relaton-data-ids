abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>STUN provides an easy way to traverse some types of NATs and it
    will\nwork satisfactorily in many NAT deployments.  To overcome STUN's\nlimitations,
    one solution is to accept the idea that NATs can change\ntoo (and they've been
    proven to change, an example being the\nproliferation of IPsec pass-thru NAT devices)
    and to colocate STUN\nserver functionality on the NAT box itself.  Upon receipt
    of a STUN\nrequest, the server colocated within the NAT device allocates\naddresses
    and ports, and installs bindings.  This allows hosts\nrunning the STUN client
    software to transparently achieve symmetric\nNAT traversal and to make themselves
    addressable from the Global\nInternet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
