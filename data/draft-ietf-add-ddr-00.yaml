abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR), a mechanism
    for DNS clients to use DNS records to discover a resolver's encrypted DNS configuration.
    This mechanism can be used to move from unencrypted DNS to encrypted DNS when
    only the IP address of an encrypted resolver is known. It can also be used to
    discover support for encrypted DNS protocols when the name of an encrypted resolver
    is known. This mechanism is designed to be limited to cases where unencrypted
    resolvers and their designated resolvers are operated by the same entity.</p>"
