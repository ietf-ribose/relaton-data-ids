abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines the metadata schema used to define the route
    exchange policies of an IP VPN network. Information elements conforming to this
    schema can be distributed using the IF-MAP [if- map] specification. The schema
    is applicable both to the standard BGP IP VPN [RFC4364] deployments within service
    provider environments as well as end-system [I-D.marques-l3vpn-end-system] based
    deployments.</p>"
