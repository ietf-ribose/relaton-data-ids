abstract:
  content: "<p>This document discusses interaction of transition mechanisms thatcan
    be involved in a communication between two end-points. Varioustransition mechanisms
    are defined to solve single transition issues.They are supposed to be used once
    along the path of a singlecommunication. During the transition phase disparate
    networkarchitecture will introduce multiple transition mechanisms indifferent
    ways. It will not be possible to predict the number andthe nature of the transition
    mechanisms that can be encounteredalong the path of a communication. This memo
    aims to identify caseswhere multiple transition mechanisms can be involved, and
    what canbe the interaction effects between them.</p>"
