abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
    paths within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths,
    called "segments". These segments are advertised by the link-state routing protocols
    (IS-IS and OSPF). And a segment is identified by a Segment Routing ID (SID). This
    document proposes a method to calculate SID forwarding entry within SR topology
    in a SR domain, and to guarantee the consistency of SR encapsulation forwarding.</p>
