abstract:
- content: "<p>Original uses of an underscore character as a domain node name prefix,
    which creates a space for constrained interpretation of resource records, were
    specified without the benefit of an IANA registry. This produced an entirely uncoordinated
    set of name- creation activities, all drawing from the same namespace. A registry
    now has been defined. However the existing specifications that use underscore
    naming need to be modified, to be in line with the new registry. This document
    specifies those changes. The changes preserve existing software and operational
    practice, while adapting the specifications for those practices to the newer underscore
    registry model.</p>"
