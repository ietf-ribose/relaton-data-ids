abstract:
  content: "<p>Astract: In this draft, we propose two efficient and practical mechanisms
    to enable the anti-replay service in the multiple sender SA. As IPSec is still
    under its development, this draft is mainly based on the existing RFCs. The two
    solutions require only minor change to the current standards and are back compatible.
    The security of new proposals and the impacts of possible future standards will
    be analyzed and discussed.</p>"
