abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines an alternate protocol for Internet name resolution,
    designed as a prototype to facilitate conversation about the evolution or replacement
    of the Domain Name System protocol. It attempts to answer the question: "how would
    we design DNS knowing what we do now," on the background of a set of properties
    of an idealized Internet naming service.</p>'
