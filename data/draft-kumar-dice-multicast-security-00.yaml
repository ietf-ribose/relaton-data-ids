abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP and 6LoWPAN are fast emerging as the de-facto protocol standards
    in the area of resource-constrained devices forming Low-power and Lossy Networks
    (LLNs). Unicast communication in such networks are secured at the transport layer
    using DTLS, as mandated by CoAP. For various applications, IP multicast-based
    group communications in such networks provide clear advantages. However, at this
    point, CoAP does not specify how to secure group communications in an interoperable
    way. This draft specifies two methods for securing CoAP-based group communication
    at the transport layer and targets deployment scenarios that may require group
    authentication, respectively source authentication. The specification leverages
    the fact that DTLS is already used as the mechanism of choice to secure unicast
    communications and allows group communications security to be implemented as an
    extension of DTLS record layer processing, thereby minimizing incremental implementation
    cost.</p>"
