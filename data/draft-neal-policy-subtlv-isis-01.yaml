abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an extension to Integrated IS-IS, which can be
    used to pass additional information among routers within an IS-IS domain that
    can aid in policy administration. This extension is roughly similar in operation
    to the BGP communities attribute; in that it provides a mechanism to associate
    a routed prefix with some administrative group, such that an administrator may
    define a routing policy for that group.</p>"
