abstract:
- content: <p>This document performs an analysis of the security and privacy implications
    of different types of "numeric identifiers" used in IETF protocols, and tries
    to categorize them based on their interoperability requirements and the associated
    failure severity when such requirements are not met. It describes a number of
    algorithms that have been employed in real implementations to meet such requirements
    and analyzes their security and privacy properties. Additionally, it provides
    advice on possible algorithms that could be employed to satisfy the interoperability
    requirements of each identifier type, while minimizing the security and privacy
    implications, thus providing guidance to protocol designers and protocol implementers.
    Finally, it provides recommendations for future protocol specifications regarding
    the specification of the aforementioned numeric identifiers.</p>
