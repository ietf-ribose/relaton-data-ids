abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the years since DHCPv4 gained widespread popularity, one
    of the\n   uses to which organizations have put it is inventory tracking:\n   associating
    identifiers scanned from packaging with records in an\n   inventory database.
    \ This document describes various means for\n   accomplishing the same purpose
    using DHCPv6.  This document also\n   updates RFC3315 by clarifying the meaning
    of some normative language\n   regarding the DUID-LL and DUID-LLT DUID types.\n\n\t
