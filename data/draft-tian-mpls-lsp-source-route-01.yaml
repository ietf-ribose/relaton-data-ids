abstract:
- content: "<p>One advantage that MPLS provides is that it allows traffic to be directed
    through an explicit path that deviates from IP routing. Such ability is widely
    used in traffic-engineering and fast-reroute. Currently signaling protocols such
    as RSVP is needed to establish and maintain such an explicit Label Switched Path.
    When there are a large number of such signaled LSPs in the network, the aggregated
    signaling and maintenance overhead can be significant. In this paper, we propose
    a way to establish a source routed explicit path with zero signaling overhead.
    The scheme uses a stack of labels and requires domain wide LDP FEC to label bindings.</p>"
