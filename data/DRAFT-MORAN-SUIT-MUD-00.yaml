abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) specification describes
    the\n   access and network functionality required a device to properly\n   function.
    \ The MUD description has to reflect the software running on\n   the device and
    its configuration.  Because of this, the most\n   appropriate entity for describing
    device network access requirements\n   is the same as the entity developing the
    software and its\n   configuration.\n\n   A network presented with a MUD file
    by a device allows detection of\n   misbehavior by the device software and configuration
    of access\n   control.\n\n   This document defines a way to link a SUIT manifest
    to a MUD file\n   offering a stronger binding between the two.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
