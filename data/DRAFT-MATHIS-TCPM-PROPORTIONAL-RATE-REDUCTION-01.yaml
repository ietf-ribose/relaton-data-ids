abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an experimental algorithm, Proportional
    Rate\n   Reduction (PPR) and related algorithms to improve the accuracy of the\n
    \  amount of data sent by TCP during loss recovery.  Standard Congestion\n   Control
    requires that TCP and other protocols reduce their congestion\n   window in response
    to losses.  This window reduction naturally occurs\n   in the same round trip
    as the data retransmissions to repair the\n   losses, and is implemented by choosing
    not to transmit any data in\n   response to some ACKs arriving from the receiver.
    \ Two widely\n   deployed algorithms are used to implement this window reduction:
    Fast\n   Recovery and Rate Halving.  Both algorithms are needlessly fragile\n
    \  under a number of conditions, particularly when there is a burst of\n   losses
    that such that the number of ACKs returning to the sender is\n   so small that
    the effective window falls below the target congestion\n   window chosen by the
    congestion control algorithm.  Proportional Rate\n   Reduction avoids these excess
    window reductions such that at the end\n   of recovery the actual window size
    will be as close as possible to\n   the window size determined by the congestion
    control algorithm.  It\n   is patterned after rate halving, but using the fraction
    that is\n   appropriate for target window chosen by the congestion control\n   algorithm.
    \ In addition we propose two slightly different algorithms\n   to bound the total
    window reduction due to all mechanisms, including\n   application stalls, the
    losses themselves and inhibit further window\n   reductions when possible.\n\n\t
