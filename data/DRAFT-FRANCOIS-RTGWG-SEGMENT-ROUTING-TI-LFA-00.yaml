abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents Topology Independent Loop-free Alternate
    Fast\n   Re-route (TI-LFA), aimed at providing link and node protection of\n   node
    and adjacency segments within the Segment Routing (SR)\n   framework.  This Fast
    Re-route (FRR) behavior builds on proven IP-FRR\n   concepts being LFAs, remote
    LFAs (RLFA), and remote LFAs with\n   directed forwarding (DLFA).  It extends
    these concepts to provide\n   guaranteed coverage in any IGP network.  We accommodate
    the FRR\n   discovery and selection approaches in order to establish protection\n
    \  over post-convergence paths from the point of local repair,\n   dramatically
    reducing the operational need to control the tie-breaks\n   among various FRR
    options.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
