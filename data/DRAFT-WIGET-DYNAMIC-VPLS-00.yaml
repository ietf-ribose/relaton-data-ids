abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an experimental serverless solution to
    build\nVirtual Private LAN Segments (VPLS) for TCP/IP over a multicast\nenabled
    IP backbone.  IP traffic is encapsulated in IPsec [RFC2401]\ntunnel mode. IP broadcast
    and multicast traffic is sent, after\nencapsulation in IPSec tunnel mode, to the
    VPN assigned IP multicast\naddress. IP unicast traffic, after encapsulation,  is
    sent directly\nto the dynamically learned IP tunnel endpoint address.  Multicast\nEnabled
    ARP (ME-ARP) as defined in this document is used to\ndynamically build the mapping
    between IP addresses and remote tunnel\nendpoints. The tunnel endpoint information
    is hidden in the hardware\naddress given to IP devices in the ARP reply. Therefore
    IP devices\nparticipating in a VPLS keep track of the remote locations of other\nVPLS
    members through their own ARP table without 'knowledge'.\n\t </p>\n      "
