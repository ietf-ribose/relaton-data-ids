abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Since publication of the TRILL (Transparent Interconnection
    of Lots\n   of Links) base protocol in 2011, active development of TRILL has\n
    \  revealed errata in RFC 6325 and areas that could use clarifications\n   or
    updates. RFCs 7177, 7357, and [rfc6439bis] provide clarifications\n   and updates
    with respect to Adjacency, the TRILL ESADI (End Station\n   Address Distribution
    Information) protocol, and Appointed Forwarders\n   respectively.  This document
    provides other known clarifications,\n   corrections, and updates. It obsoletes
    RFC 7180 (the previous TRILL\n   clarifications, corrections), updates RFC 7177,
    updates RFC 7179, and\n   updates RFC 6325.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
