abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE Std 802.15.4,
    opportunities for broadcasts are limited to specific times and specific channels.
    Routers in a TSCH network transmit Enhanced Beacon (EB) frames to announce the
    presence of the network. This document provides a mechanism by which additional
    information critical for new nodes (pledges) and long-sleeping nodes may be carried
    within the EB in order to conserve use of broadcast opportunities.</p>"
