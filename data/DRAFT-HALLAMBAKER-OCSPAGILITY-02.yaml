abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The OSCP specification defined in RFC 2560 requires server responses\nto
    be signed but does not specify a mechanism for selecting the\nsignature algorithm
    to be used leading to possible interoperability\nfailures in contexts where multiple
    signature algorithms are in use.\nThis document specifies an algorithm for server
    signature algorithm\nselection and an extension that allows a client to advise
    a server\nthat specific signature algorithms are supported.\n\t </p>\n      "
