abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>For many reasons, remote participation in IETF meetings has increased.\nAs
    the Internet grows, so does the participation by engineers worldwide.\nRemote
    participation with more than one person is considered a hub.\n\nThree types of
    remote hubs are defined.   Each has its own\ncharacteristics.\n\n   - Remote Participation
    Hubs\n   - Remote Viewing Hubs\n   - Enduring Local Meetups\n\nThis document defines
    a Remote Participation Hub (RPH).  Other documents\ndefine the other types of
    hubs.  A common structure of sections will be\nused as far as possible for all
    hub types.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
