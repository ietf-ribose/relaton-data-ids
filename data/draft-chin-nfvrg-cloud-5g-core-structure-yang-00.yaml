abstract:
  content: "<p>In 5G core network, all network functions are componentized,virtualized
    and grouped into VNF. Network management system will managethe functions based
    on VNF. This document presents YANG model proposalon overall structure of cloud
    native 5G core network. The structure isitself represented as an example YANG
    model, with all of the relatedcomponent models logically organized in a way that
    is operationallyintuitive, but this model is not expected to be implemented. Theidentified
    component modules are expected to be defined andimplemented.</p>"
