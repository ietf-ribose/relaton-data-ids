abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an SNMP Usage for REsource LOcation And\n
    \  Discovery(RELOAD).  The objective of SNMP Usage is to provide the\n   functionality
    of managing the RELOAD network.  In particular, the\n   SNMP Usage provides the
    following functions: (a) defining the method\n   that allow the registrations
    to map a network manager's name to a\n   host node reachable in the overlay, and
    (b) providing lookup service\n   for the node hosts the network manager in the
    overlay.  Then the\n   AppAttach method is used to exchange addresses between
    nodes to\n   establish a direct connection through which SNMP messages are\n   exchanged.\n\n\t
