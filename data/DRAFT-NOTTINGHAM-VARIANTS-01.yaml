abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification introduces the HTTP \"Variants\" response
    header\n   field to communicate what representations are available for a given\n
    \  resource, and the companion \"Variant-Key\" response header field to\n   indicate
    which representation was selected.  It is an augmentation of\n   the \"Vary\"
    mechanism in HTTP caching.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
