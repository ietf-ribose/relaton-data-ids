abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service Function Chain (SFC) defines an ordered set of service\n
    \  functions (SFs) to be applied to packets and/or frames and/or flows\n   selected
    due to classification.  SFC Operation, Administration and\n   Maintenance can
    monitor the continuity of the SFC, i.e., that all SFC\n   elements are reachable
    to each other in the downstream direction.\n   But SFC OAM must support verification
    that the order of traversing\n   these SFs corresponds to the state defined by
    the SFC control plane\n   or orchestrator, the metric referred to in this document
    as the path\n   consistency of the SFC.  This document defines a new SFC active
    OAM\n   method to support SFC consistency check, i.e., verification that all\n
    \  elements of the given SFC are being traversed in the expected order.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
