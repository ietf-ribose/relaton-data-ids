abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It can be useful for applications to provide flow metadata\n
    \  information to on-path devices to influence flow treatment in the\n   network.
    \ Provided that the network is able to provide useful\n   feedback, this can also
    influence path selection if an application\n   have multiple flow paths to choose
    from.\n\n   This draft describes how this can be achieved by adding metadata to\n
    \  the STUN packets sent during the ICE connectivity checks or a\n   slightly
    modified version of the keep-alive mechanism.  Devices on\n   the media path can
    use the metadata information to prioritize the\n   flow, perform traffic engineering,
    or provide network analytics and\n   notifications as requested by the endpoints.
    \ On-path devices can\n   append or modify the existing metadata information in
    the STUN/ICE\n   messages to enable feedback to other on-path devices or the\n
    \  applications in both ends of the media session.\n\n   This document describes
    a framework mechanism for how such metadata\n   can be transported by STUN when
    ICE is in use and it covers the\n   endpoint and on path device processing.  The
    functionality described\n   here is referred to as MALICE.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
