- content: "<p>This document describes Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) operation on shared
    links such as IEEE 802.11. Two solutions of providing point- to-point link operation
    on the shared links are compared. Advantages and disadvantages of each solution
    are identified. Issues related to the placement of Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)
    in fixed broadband network are also discussed.</p>"
