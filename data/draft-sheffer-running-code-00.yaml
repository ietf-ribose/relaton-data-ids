abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a simple-to-implement solution to the problem
    of rewarding Internet protocols that have been implemented over those that have
    not. Rather than establishing an explicit process, we allow authors to publicize
    their implementation, which should enable working groups to treat relevant drafts
    preferentially. This solution is suggested for consideration as a process experiment.</p>"
