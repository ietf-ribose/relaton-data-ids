abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Low delay feedback in RTP has gained a lot of interest recently
    in\norder to enhance the performance in RTP sessions with two or only a\nsmall
    number of participants. A recent document describes rules that\nenhance the functionality
    of the existing RTP timing and allow low\ndelay feedback. While that document
    describes when it is allowed to\nsend data, we describe here what kind of low
    delay feedback may be\nsent. Therefore we define three general RTCP feedback message
    types\nas well as some recommendations how the sender SHOULD react to\ncertain
    feedback. The message types can either be used as is or they\ncan be extended
    in payload or application specific ways.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
