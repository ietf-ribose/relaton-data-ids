abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for fast detection of MPLS LSPfailure
    when a link fails and scales to all LSPs affected by thefailure. Fast detection
    enables ingress LERs to quickly recoveronto backup LSPs. A performance improvement
    in the reliability ofLSPs is expected. The mechanism described relies on a node
    andnetwork architecture that integrates L1/L2/L3 technology.</p>"
