abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a model for the lightweight use of
    SDP Offer/\n   Answer in WebRTC.  The goal is to minimize reliance on Offer/Answer\n
    \  exchanges in a WebRTC session and provide applications with the tools\n   necessary
    to implement the signalling that they may need in a way\n   that best fits their
    custom requirements and topologies.  This\n   simplifies signalling of multiple
    media sources or providing RTP\n   Synchronisation source (SSRC) identification
    in multi-party sessions.\n   Another important goal of this model is to remove
    from clients\n   topological constraints such as the requirement to know in advance\n
    \  all SSRC identifiers that they could potentially introduce in a\n   particular
    session.\n\n   This document does not question the use of SDP and the Offer/Answer\n
    \  model or the value they have in terms of interoperability with legacy\n   or
    other non-WebRTC devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
