abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a model of information needed by the
    routing\n   and wavelength assignment (RWA) process in wavelength switched\n   optical
    networks (WSONs).  The purpose of the information described\n   in this model
    is to facilitate constrained lightpath computation in\n   WSONs. This model takes
    into account compatibility constraints\n   between WSON signal attributes and
    network elements but does not\n   include constraints due to optical impairments.
    Aspects of this\n   information that may be of use to other technologies utilizing
    a\n   GMPLS control plane are discussed.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
