abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a transfer protocol
    that was designed to meet the special requirements of constrained environments.
    This document introduces a common framework for conveying authorization information
    between the actors in the ACE architecture by defining classes of message types.
    It thus specifys a common authorization extension for CoAP.</p>"
