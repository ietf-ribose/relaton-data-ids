abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes an extension to the IS-IS protocol to addoperational
    capabilities that allow for ease of management andcontrol over IP prefix distribution
    within an IS-IS domain. The IS-IS protocol is specified in [1], with extensions
    for supporting IPv4specified in [2] and further enhancements for Traffic Engineering
    [4]in [3] and [6].This document enhances the IS-IS protocol by extending theinformation
    that a Intermediate System (IS) [router] can place inLink State Protocol Data
    Units (LSPs) as specified in [2]. Thisextension will provide operators with a
    mechanism to control IPprefix distribution throughout multi-level IS-IS domains.Additionally,
    the information can be placed in LSPs that have TLVs asyet undefined, if this
    information is used to convey the same meaningin such future TLVs as it is used
    in the currently defined TLVs.</p>"
