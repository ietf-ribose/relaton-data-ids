abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The problems in active-active connection to TRILL campus was\n
    \  introduced in [TRILL-Active-PS]. Frame duplication was a well\n   recognized
    issue in that scenario. This draft proposes a Designated\n   Forwarder (DF) mechanism
    to solve the issue of frame duplications.\n   The basic idea is to elect one RBridge
    per VLAN from an edge group\n   to be responsible for egressing the multicast
    frames. An edge group\n   is a group of edge RBridges that a CE is multi-homed
    to in active-\n   active mode. TRILL protocol extension for DF election is described\n
    \  in this draft.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
