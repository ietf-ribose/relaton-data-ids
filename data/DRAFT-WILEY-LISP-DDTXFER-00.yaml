abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes the means for transferring a LISP Delegated\n
    \  Database Tree (LISP-DDT) between DDT nodes and for notifying DDT\n   nodes
    that the database has changed since it was last transferred.\n   The LISP-DDT
    is a hierarchical, distributed database that provides\n   delegation of authority
    for mappings from LISP EIDs to RLOCs.  A DDT\n   node may be delegated authority
    for an Extended EID-prefix and\n   maintains RLOCs for Map Servers and other DDT
    nodes to which\n   authority has been delegated for more specific EID-prefixes
    of the\n   that prefix.  This document does not describe the use of DDT as part\n
    \  of the LISP mapping service.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
