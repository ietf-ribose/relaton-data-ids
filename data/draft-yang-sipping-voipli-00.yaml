abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Recently broadband Voice over IP (VoIP) has a clear trend tosubstitute
    for traditional telephone services such as wire telephone,wireless telephone and
    mobile telephone service, it has becomeincreasingly clear that VoIP services will
    be expected to provideLawful Intercept to the same level experienced in the Public
    SwitchedTelephone Network(PSTN)[7]. In an effort to provide lawfulinterception
    for broadband VoIP, an architecture using session bordercontroller was proposed,
    and a prototype implementation of thebroadband VoIP lawful interception was created
    and basic performanceevaluation was conducted on this prototype system. This documentreports
    on the prototype implementation and the test results.</p>"
