abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transport Layer Security (TLS) is commonly used to protect
    HTTP and\n   other protocols.  HTTP is often proxied, for instance, to allow an\n
    \  application-layer firewall to inspect the HTTP traffic between the\n   client
    and the server.  A TLS session cannot protect traffic between\n   the client and
    server when an HTTP proxy is present.  Separate TLS\n   sessions can be run between
    the client and the proxy, on one side,\n   and the proxy and the server on the
    other side.  This provides the\n   needed security, as long as the client, server,
    and proxy device use\n   appropriate and consistent security policies.  However,
    this last\n   part is problematic; how can a proxy know if a client trusts a\n
    \  server?  At present, TLS provides no mechanism to coordinate\n   policies.\n\n
    \  This note defines a TLS extension that allows a TLS proxy to provide\n   a
    TLS client with all of information about the TLS server that the\n   client needs
    to make a well-informed access control decision.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
