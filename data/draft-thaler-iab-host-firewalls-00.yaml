abstract:
- content: "<p>In today's Internet, the need for firewalls is generally accepted in
    the industry and indeed firewalls are widely deployed in practice. Often the result
    is that software may be running and potentially consuming resources, but then
    communication is blocked by a firewall. It's taken for granted that this end state
    is either desirable or the best that can be achieved in practice, rather than
    (for example) an end state where the relevant software is not running or is running
    in a way that would not result in unwanted communication. In this document, we
    explore the issues behind these assumptions and provide suggestions on improving
    the architecture going forward.</p>"
