abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the DNS Resolver Discovery Protocol (RDP) that
    enables a DNS client to discover various available DNS resolving services instantiated
    as resolvers. These resolvers can be local and global. The discovery is primarily
    initiated by a DNS client, but a resolver may also inform the DNS client with
    other resolver services.</p>"
