abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a modification to the validation procedure
    defined for the dissemination of BGP Flow Specifications. The dissemination of
    BGP Flow Specifications requires that the originator of the Flow Specification
    matches the originator of the best-match unicast route for the destination prefix
    embedded in the Flow Specification. For an iBGP received route, the originator
    is typically a border router within the same autonomous system. The objective
    is to allow only BGP speakers within the data forwarding path to originate BGP
    Flow Specifications. Sometimes it is desirable to originate the BGP Flow Specification
    any place within the autonomous system itself, for example, from a centralized
    BGP route controller. However, the validation procedure will fail in this scenario.
    The modification proposed herein relaxes the validation rule to enable Flow Specifications
    to be originated within the same autonomous system as the BGP speaker performing
    the validation. Additionally, this document revises AS_PATH validation rules so
    Flow Specifications received from an eBGP peer can be validated when such peer
    is a BGP route server. This document updates the validation procedure in RFC8955.</p>"
