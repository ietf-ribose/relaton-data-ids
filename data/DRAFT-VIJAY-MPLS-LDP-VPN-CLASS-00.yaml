abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the use of LDP in establishing VPNs for
    \ntransporting traffic that needs to be classified based on \napplication flows.
    \nThis document proposes extensions to existing LDP for establishing \nend-to-end
    VPN LSPs for transporting traffic meant for specific \ndestination addresses and
    applications from specific applications. \nThis document proposes to use a Flow
    FEC element, which contains the \nLayer 3 and transport information which is used
    for identifying the \nflow. The flow is mapped onto the appropriate VPN LSP.  \n\t
