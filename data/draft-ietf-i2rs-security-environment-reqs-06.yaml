abstract:
  content: "<p>This document provides environment security requirements for the I2RS
    architecture. Environment security requirements are independent of the protocol
    used for I2RS. The security environment requirements are the good security practices
    to be used during implementation and deployment of the code related to the new
    interface to routing system (I2RS) so that I2RS implementations can be securely
    deployed and operated. Environmental security requirements do not specify the
    I2RS protocol seecurity requirements. This is done in another document (draft-
    ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements).</p>"
