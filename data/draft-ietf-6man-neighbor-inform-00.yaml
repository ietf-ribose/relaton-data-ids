abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes an optional mechanism as part of IPv6Stateless
    Address Autoconfiguration for distribution of uniqueinterface identifiers to IPv6
    hosts on a link. Hosts can then usethese unique interface identifiers to generate
    unique autoconfiguredlink local and global unicast addresses.This mechanism is
    intended for use in networks where link layeridentifiers are used for generating
    interface identifiers and wherenon unique link layer identifiers will result in
    duplicate link localaddresses. An example of such network is Ethernet Broadband
    accessnetworks.</p>"
