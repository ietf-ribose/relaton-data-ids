abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proposal for the SPEECHSC protocol and aims
    to meet the requirements specified in the SPEECHSC working group requirements
    document. It is based on the Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) developed
    jointly by Cisco Systems, Inc., Nuance Communications, and Speechworks Inc. The
    SPEECHSC protocol will control media service resources like speech synthesizers,
    recognizers, signal generators, signal detectors, fax servers etc. over a network.
    This protocol depends on a session management protocol such as the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) to establish a separate SPEECHSC control session between the client
    and the media server. It also depends on SIP to establish the media pipe and associated
    parameters between the media source or sink and the media server. Once this is
    done, the SPEECHSC protocol exchange can happen over the control session established
    above allowing the client to command and control the media processing resources
    that may exist on the media server.</p>"
