abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
    called RRVS, and a header field called Require-Recipient- Valid-Since, to provide
    a method for senders to indicate to receivers the point in time when the sender
    last confirmed the ownership of the target mailbox. This can be used to detect
    changes of mailbox ownership, and thus prevent mail from being delivered to the
    wrong party. The intended use of these facilities is on automatically generated
    messages that might contain sensitive information, though it may also be useful
    in other applications.</p>"
