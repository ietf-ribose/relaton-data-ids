abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an extension to the Time Zone Data Distribution\n
    \  Service (RFC 7808) to allow a mobile device to retrieve the time\n   zones
    associated with a geographic location as specified by a 'geo'\n   URI (RFC 5870).\n\nOpen
    Issues\n\n   o  Determine which, if any, GEOPRIV requirements we need to follow\n
    \     and how they impact Security/Privacy considerations.\n\n   o  Need a new
    field(s) in the response to indicate which time zone(s)\n      contain the point
    location vs those which are nearby (intersect\n      the radius of uncertainty).\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
