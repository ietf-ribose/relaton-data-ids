abstract:
- content: "<p>The organization that manages a subtree in the DNS is often different
    from the one that manages the tree above it. We describe an architecture to publish
    in the DNS the boundaries between organizations that can be adapted to various
    policy models and can be queried with a small number of DNS lookups.</p>"
