abstract:
  content: "\t <t>On demand Internet services with guaranteed throughput are the majordriver
    behind QoS signaling architectures. Guaranteeing throughputbetween two defined
    points of a DiffServ network requires acombination of flow information and Per
    Hop Behaviour. Handlingaggregates instead of flows as specified by the DiffServarchitecture
    is the most reasonable attempt to do so. This documentdescribes an architecture
    using DiffServ mechanisms to provideon demand throughput guarantees between two
    points of a DiffServnetwork.</p>"
