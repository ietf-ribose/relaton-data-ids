abstract:
- content: "<p>On demand Internet services with guaranteed throughput are the major
    driver behind QoS signaling architectures. Guaranteeing throughput between two
    defined points of a DiffServ network requires a combination of flow information
    and Per Hop Behaviour. Handling aggregates instead of flows as specified by the
    DiffServ architecture is the most reasonable attempt to do so. This document describes
    an architecture using DiffServ mechanisms to provide on demand throughput guarantees
    between two points of a DiffServ network.</p>"
