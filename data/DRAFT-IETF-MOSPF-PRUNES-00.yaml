abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    MOSPF is a link-state multicast routing protocol, based on
    OSPF.\n    Inside a single OSPF area, the delivery of multicast datagrams is\n
    \   restricted to group members only, by propagating the location of\n    group
    members through group-membership-LSAs. However, group\n    membership is not propagated
    across area and/or AS boundaries,\n    relying instead on so-called wild-card
    multicast receivers. This\n    means that in some cases multicast datagrams are
    transmitted further\n    than necessary, wasting link and processor resources
    in the process.\n \n    This document defines a way to prune these excess branches
    off the\n    MOSPF delivery tree, using a new Prune-LSA. In concept these are\n
    \   similar to the prunes employed by the DVMRP protocol. However, to\n    reuse
    the reliability mechanisms present in the base OSPF protocol,\n    MOSPF prunes
    are implemented as local-scope Opaque-LSAs. As a\n    result, inter-area and inter-AS
    multicast datagrams are forwarded by\n    MOSPF using the broadcast-and-prune
    strategy employed by DVMRP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
