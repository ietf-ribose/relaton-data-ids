abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some Internet Service Providers and enterprises require detailed\n
    \  information about the payload of traffic, so that packets can be\n   treated
    differently and efficiently.  Packet-level differentiation\n   can also enable
    flow-level and user-level differentiation.\n\n   With its large address space,
    IPv6 allows semantics to be embedded\n   into addresses by assigning additional
    significance to specific bits\n   within the prefix.  Using these semantics, routers
    and other\n   intermediary devices can easily apply relevant policies as required.\n
    \  This document describes a framework for such an approach.  It also\n   analyses
    the technical advantages and limitations associated with\n   such an approach.\n\n
    \  This informational document only discusses the usage of semantics\n   within
    a single network, or group of interconnected networks which\n   share a common
    addressing policy, referred to as a Semantic Prefix\n   Domain.\n\n   The document
    is NOT intended to suggest the standardization of any\n   common global semantics.\n\n\n\t
