abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes behavior of signalling intermediaries in RTC
    deployments, sometimes referred to as Session Border Controllers (SBCs), when
    performing Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT). HNT is a set of mechanisms, such as media
    relaying and latching, that such intermediaries use to enable other RTC devices
    behind NATs to communicate with each other. This document is non-normative, and
    is only written to explain HNT in order to provide a reference to the IETF community,
    as well as an informative description to manufacturers, and users.</p>"
