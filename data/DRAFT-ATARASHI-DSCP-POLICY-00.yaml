abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In reviewing the specific use of the Differentiated Services\n\nArchitecture
    for supporting the Internet Emergency Preparedness\n\nSystem, we found what we
    believe is a general issue.  This is that\n\neven though a client or peer can
    connect to a server or peer with a\n\npredictable DSCP value, the response does
    not have a predictable DSCP\n\nvalue.  We consider the issues, and recommend an
    approach to\n\napplication policy regarding the DSCP.\n\t </p>\n      "
