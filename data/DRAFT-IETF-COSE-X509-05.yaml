abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CBOR Signing And Encrypted Message (COSE) structure uses\n
    \  references to keys in general.  For some algorithms, additional\n   properties
    are defined which carry parts of keys as needed.  The COSE\n   Key structure is
    used for transporting keys outside of COSE messages.\n   This document extends
    the way that keys can be identified and\n   transported by providing attributes
    that refer to or contain X.509\n   certificates.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
