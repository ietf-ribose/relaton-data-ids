abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The existing Domain Name System (DNS) specifications lack some\n
    \  clarity in their description of the process by which individual\n   sections
    of a DNS message are constructed.\n\n   This document updates RFC 1034 and RFC
    1035 to provide a clearer\n   specification, consistent with deployed implementations.\n\n\t
