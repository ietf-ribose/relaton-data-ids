abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This document addresses the problem of delivering IPv6 multicast
    \n    traffic to MN (Mobile Node). An approach named Mobile IPv6 Multicast \n
    \   with Dynamic Multicast Agent is proposed  which combines Movement \n    Based
    Method [2] and Distance Based Method [3], Such a design allows \n    MN to optimize
    multicast route, and meanwhile reduce the handoff \n    frequency by selecting
    new multicast agent dynamically. In addition to \n    weakening the triangle route
    problem and diminishing the influence of \n    handoff to multicast, this approach
    provides global mobility in \n    Internet without limitations on network topology.
    This draft is the \n    same as the earlier version, it is just an update of it.
