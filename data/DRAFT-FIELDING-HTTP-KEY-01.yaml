abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The 'Key' header field for HTTP responses allows an origin
    server to\n   describe the cache key for a negotiated response: a short algorithm\n
    \  that can be used upon later requests to determine if the same\n   response
    is reusable.\n\n   Key has the advantage of avoiding an additional round trip
    for\n   validation whenever a new request differs slightly, but not\n   significantly,
    from prior requests.\n\n   Key also informs user agents of the request characteristics
    that\n   might result in different content, which can be useful if the user\n
    \  agent is not sending Accept* fields in order to reduce the risk of\n   fingerprinting.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
