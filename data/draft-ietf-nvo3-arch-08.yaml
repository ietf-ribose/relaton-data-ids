abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a high-level overview architecture for building
    data-center Network Virtualization over Layer 3 (NVO3) networks. The architecture
    is given at a high level, showing the major components of an overall system. An
    important goal is to divide the space into individual smaller components that
    can be implemented independently with clear inter-component interfaces and interactions.
    It should be possible to build and implement individual components in isolation
    and have them interoperate with other independently implemented components. That
    way, implementers have flexibility in implementing individual components and can
    optimize and innovate within their respective components without requiring changes
    to other components.</p>"
