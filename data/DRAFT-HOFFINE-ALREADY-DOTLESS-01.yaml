abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board and
    ICANN's\n   Security and Stability Advisory Committee have discussed the problems\n
    \  that the DNS is likely to experience with top-level domains that have\n   address
    records in them (so-called \"dotless domains\").  However,\n   these statements
    spoke of the problem mostly as theoretical, when in\n   fact there are such TLDs
    today.  This document lists the current\n   dotless TLDs, and gives a script for
    finding them.  This document\n   lists data about dotless TLDs, but does not address
    the policy and\n   technology issues other than to point to the statements of
    others.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
