abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPv4/IPv6 co-existence and transition is topic or great discussion\nand
    interest.  In order to deal with IPv4 depletion ISPs have some\ntechniques at
    their disposal such as Carrier Grade NAT , DS-Lite and\n6rd.\n\nAs this techniques
    get deployed, they change the topology of the\nnetwork by creating gateways or
    overlays which in the end affect how\nALTO might work.  This draft discusses such
    impacts and possible\nsolutions.\n\t </p>\n      "
