abstract:
- content: "<p>Some Wireless Ad hoc Networks (WANETs) like LLNs often have different
    devices capabilities, with large scale deployment at different regions or environment
    conditions. In that network context, nodes may not be able to participate in certain
    time periods because of determined conditions. The Node Ability of Participation
    (NAP) protocol enhances the network use of its activities and capabilities. Routers
    and actuators in such networks can be adaptive and efficient for different unpredicted
    situations.</p>"
