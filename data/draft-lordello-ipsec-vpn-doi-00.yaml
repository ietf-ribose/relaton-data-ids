abstract:
  content: "<p>The IPSec DOI for ISAKMP defines identities for phase 2 exchangesthat
    are suitable for a flat, unique address space. On the otherhand, different VPN's
    cannot guarantee a non-overlapping addressspace among them. Therefore when security
    gateways on an ISP networknegotiate IPSec SA's in the context of multiple VPN's,
    identifyingtraffic flows for this multiplicity of VPN's become an issue. Ofcourse,
    an alternative would be to have multiple contexts ofsecurity gateways, one for
    each VPN. Unfortunately that would imposesevere administrative challenges to an
    ISP, some of which aredescribed later. Another alternative and a more appealing
    one wouldbe to have a single security gateway with a single tunnel endpointaddress,
    a single X.509 certificate, etc., that exists in a commoncontext and is able to
    negotiate IPSec tunnels for any VPN with apresence in the security gateway. For
    the later to be possiblehowever, it is required for this common security gateway
    to be ableto negotiate phase 2 SA's on behalf of each one of these VPN's withoverlapping
    address spaces. A second motivation for the laterapproach would be to simply negotiate
    IPSec tunnels for each VPN asa whole without implying any specific traffic flow.
    Thisspecification describes an extended DOI for ISAKMP which, whileinheriting
    the existing IPSec DOI in its entirety, defines extratypes of phase 2 identities
    which include a VPN-ID field as an extrapiece of tunnel identity, i.e., a qualifier
    for the IP addressesselectors. The VPN-ID is defined in RFC 2685.</p>"
