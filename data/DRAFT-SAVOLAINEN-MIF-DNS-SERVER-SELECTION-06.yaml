abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A multi-homed node can be connected to multiple networks that
    may\nutilize different DNS namespaces.  The node often receives DNS server\nconfiguration
    information from all connected networks.  Some of the\nDNS servers may have information
    about namespaces other servers do\nnot have.  When the multi-homed node needs
    to utilize DNS, it has to\nchoose which of the servers to contact to.  This document
    describes a\npolicy based method for helping on selection of DNS server for both\nforward
    and reverse DNS lookup procedures with help of DNS suffix and\nIPv6 prefix information
    received via DHCPv6.\n\t </p>\n      "
