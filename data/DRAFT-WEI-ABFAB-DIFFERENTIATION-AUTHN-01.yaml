abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to implement the differentiation\n
    \  authentication with Level of Assurance (LOA). In order to achieve\n   the goal,
    we define a new authentication context class schema for\n   SAML V2.0 which is
    used to specify the LOA requirement of Relying\n   Provider (RP), a function which
    is used by Identity Provider (IdP)\n   to transform the required LOA to specific
    authentication method(s),\n   and a profile which describes the application of
    this new\n   authentication context.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
