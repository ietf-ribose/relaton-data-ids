abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Domain Name System (DNS) has provided some means, such
    as CNAME\n   or DNAME, where a query can be redirected to a different name.  The\n
    \  zone operator should be careful about this redirection, which may\n   forms
    a loop.  The detail analysis of xNAME loop detection and its\n   impacts are not
    specified in the RFC 1035 and RFC 2672.  This\n   document gives a detail analysis
    of xNAME loop and its impacts.  It\n   also gives some advices for using xNAME.\n\n\t
