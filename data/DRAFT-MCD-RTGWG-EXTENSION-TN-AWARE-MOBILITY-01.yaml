abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The existing Transport Network Aware Mobility for 5G [TN-AWARE-\n
    \  MOBILITY] draft specifies a framework for mapping the 5G mobile\n   systems
    Slice and Service Types (SSTs) to corresponding underlying\n   network paths in
    IP and Layer 2 Transport networks.The focus of that\n   work is limited to the
    mobility domain and transport network\n   characteristics till the UPF and doesn't
    go beyond the UPF to the\n   Data Network.\n\n   To maintain E2E transport network
    characteristics the framework\n   needs to be extended beyond UPF. This document
    describes a framework\n   for extending the mobility aware transport network characteristics\n
    \  from the UPF through the Data Network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
