abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the procedures a client can follow to assess
    the trust on an external NSF platform and its client-defined configuration through
    the I2NSF Security Controller. The procedure to assess trustworthiness is based
    on a remote attestation of the platform and the NSFs running on it performed through
    a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) invoked by the Security Controller.</p>"
