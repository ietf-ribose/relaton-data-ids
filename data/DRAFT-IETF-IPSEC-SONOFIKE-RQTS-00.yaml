abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Various proposals have been made for updating the IKE protocol.
    This \neffort has been known as 'Son of IKE (SOI)'. \nOne thing that is missing
    from the discussion is an evaluation of the \nscope of SOI, identifying which
    problems it should solve. Sections of \nthis document discuss various scenarios
    that are considered important \nfor SOI. \nOnce this scoping is done, it becomes
    easier to specify the \nrequirements of the protocol. This document also discusses
    protocol, \npolicy and security requirements for SOI, along with recommendations
    \nfor protocol improvement in such areas as modularity, extensibility, \nprotocol
    convergence and simplicity, which are important regardless \nof the scope of SOI.
    \n    \n\n\t </p>\n      "
