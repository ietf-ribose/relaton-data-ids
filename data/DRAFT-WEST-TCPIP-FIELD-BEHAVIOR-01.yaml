abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes TCP/IP field behavior in the context of header
    \ncompression. \nHeader compression is possible thanks to the fact that most header
    \nfields do not vary randomly from packet to packet. Many of the \nfields exhibit
    static behavior or change in a more or less \npredictable way. When designing
    a header compression scheme, it is \nof fundamental importance to understand the
    behavior of the fields \nin detail.\n\t </p>\n      "
