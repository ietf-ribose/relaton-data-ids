abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes base requirements for protecting control
    \nchannels(CCs) for GMPLS. It provides guidelines needed in order to \nswitchover
    an active CC to one of standby CCs when a failure occurs \nabout the active CC.
    It defines terminology, base concepts, \nnecessities, and considerations that
    should be noted primarily in \norder to complete the mechanism of CC protection.
    This document \ndescribes requirements for providing resilience capabilities of
    \ncontrol plane in GMPLS whose control channel can be separated from \nthe data
    channel. This contribution, as a document that proposes the\nnecessity about resilience
    of control plane like that of transport \nplane, handles related terminologies,
    base concepts, possible \nconfigurations, necessities and requirements, additional
    \nconsiderations including the relationship with other protocol such as \nLMP.\n\t
