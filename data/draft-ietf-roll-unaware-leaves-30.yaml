abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification provides a mechanism for a host that implements
    a routing-agnostic interface based on IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area
    Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery to obtain reachability services across a
    network that leverages RFC 6550 for its routing operations. It updates RFCs 6550,
    6775, and 8505.</p>"
