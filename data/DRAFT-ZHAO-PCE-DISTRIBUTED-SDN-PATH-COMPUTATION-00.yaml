abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Path computation in a large-scale SDN indeed requires a significant\n
    \  amount of computation load. The SDN controller can easily suffer\n   from performance
    degradation resulting from the centralized design\n   of control plane.\n\n   In
    this document, we argue the necessity in building a distributed\n   model to speed
    up the path computation in SDN control plane. With\n   proper consistency model,
    path computation can be implemented among\n   multiple controllers.\n\n\t </p>\n
