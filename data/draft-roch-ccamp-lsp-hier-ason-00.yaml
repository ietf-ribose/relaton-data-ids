abstract:
- content: "<p>A set of requirements and a proposed solution for the control of hierarchical
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) is found in [HIER]. However, support of address separation
    as allowed by the Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) architecture [G.8080]
    is not covered by [HIER]. This internet draft describes additional requirements
    to consider for the use of LSP hierarchy in ASON networks and proposes extensions
    to address those requirements.</p>"
