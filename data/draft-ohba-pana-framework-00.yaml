abstract:
- content: "<p>PANA design provides support for various types of deployments. Access
    networks can differ based on the availability of lower-layer security, placement
    of PANA entities, choice of client IP configuration and authentication methods,
    etc. This I-D defines a general framework for describing how these various deployment
    choices are handled by PANA and the access network architectures. Additionally,
    two possible deployments are described in detail: using PANA over DSL networks
    and WLAN networks.</p>"
