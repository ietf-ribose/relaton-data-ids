abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines an initial application of IP and ARP in an
    MCNS\n   Community Access Television (CATV) Residential Access Network\n   environment
    where the cable system is used for bi-directional data\n   transfer. The MCNS
    network provides a traditional Ethernet or 802.2\n   link layer service between
    a cable system head end and the customer\n   premises using the cable television
    system infrastructure.  This\n   interface is available via IEEE 802.1D layer
    services to support IP\n   residential access networking services.\n \n   In this
    memo, the term Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS) is defined to\n   apply to traditional
    IP over Ethernet operating over MCNS services.\n \n   The recommendations in this
    draft rely on existing IETF standards for\n   IP and ARP over Broadcast Ethernet
    networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
