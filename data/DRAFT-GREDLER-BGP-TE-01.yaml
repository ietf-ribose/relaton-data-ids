abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new Border Gateway Protocol Network
    Layer\n   Reachability Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be used\n
    \  to distribute a network topologies' link and node information.  Links\n   can
    be either physical links connecting physical nodes, or virtual\n   paths between
    physical or abstract nodes.  The network topology\n   information is carried via
    the BGP, thereby reusing protocol\n   algorithms, operational experience, and
    administrative processes,\n   such as inter-provider peering agreements.\n\n   The
    BGP protocol carrying Link State information would provide a\n   well-defined,
    uniform, policy-controlled interface from the network\n   to outside servers that
    need to learn the network topology in real-\n   time, for example an ALTO Server
    or a Path Computation Server.\n   Having Traffic Engineering (TE) information
    from remote areas and/or\n   Autonomous Systems would allow path computation for
    inter-area and/or\n   inter-AS source-routed unicast and multicast tunnels.\n\n\n\t
