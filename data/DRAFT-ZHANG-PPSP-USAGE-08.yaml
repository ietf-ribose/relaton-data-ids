  content: "\n\t <p>   This document concerns several significant operation issues
    of Peer-\n   to-Peer Streaming Protocol (PPSP) usage, focusing on two basic modes:\n
    \  Leech mode and Seed mode. The related parameters setting for default\n   PPSP
    scenario reference to tracker protocol and peer protocol\n   respectively. Besides,
    the limitations and gaps of current PPSP\n   system are identified at with the
    standpoint of satisfying PPSP\n   requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
