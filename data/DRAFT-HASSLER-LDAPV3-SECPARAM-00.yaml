abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Two security services that are required in many applications
    but have\n   not been addressed by LDAPv3 [ldapv3] in a satisfactory manner yet\n
    \  are integrity and non-repudiation. According to the latest LDAPv3\n   security
    draft [ldapv3-auth] integrity can be achieved within a\n   secure association
    only. Non-repudiation, and by this we mean digital\n   signing of operations,
    is mentioned in [ldapv3] as an example of the\n   use of the LDAPv3 extended operation
    mechanism.\n   A disadvantage of this approach is that it would be necessary\n
    \  to define a new Extended Request/Response pair for\n   each basic operation
    that should be signed.\n \n   This document defines an LDAP control called LDAPSecurityParameters\n
    \  for transferring security parameters with LDAP operations.\n   With this control
    it is possible to append digital signature\n   to LDAP operations and in this
    way provide for message\n   authenticity, message integrity, non-repudiation of
    message\n   origin and message freshness.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
