abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo describes 8+8 address format, which is an IPv6 addressformat
    with locator/ID separation useful for end to end multihoming.A 16 byte address
    of an end is separated into two 8 byte fields:locator, which is used to route
    packets to a link to which the end isattached, and ID, which is used to globally
    identify the end.Locators are assigned from (top level) ISPs to sites (and lower
    levelISPs) in hierarchical and aggregatable manner that a multihomed site(and
    ISPs) receive multiple locators from upstream ISPs.A usual host in a multihomed
    site (or a singly homed site under amultihomed ISP) is expected to have an ID
    and multiple locators andtransport layer protocols are expected to handle multiple
    locators ofthe host and its peer.</p>"
