abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines a means of remotely initiating MultiprocalLabel
    Switched Protocol Pings on Label Switched Paths. A proxyping request is sent to
    any Label Switching Routers along a LabelSwitched Path. The primary motivations
    for this facility arefirst to limit the number of messages and related processing
    whenusing LSP Ping in large Point-to-Multipoint LSPs, and second toenable leaf
    to root tracing.Contents</p>"
