abstract:
- content: "<p>IGP protocols traditionally compute best paths over the network based
    on the IGP metric assigned to the links. Many network deployments use RSVP-TE
    based or Segment Routing based Traffic Engineering to enforce traffic over a path
    that is computed using different metrics or constraints than the shortest IGP
    path. Various mechanisms are used to steer the traffic towards such traffic engineered
    paths. This document proposes a solution that allows IGPs themselves to compute
    constraint based paths over the network without the use of the above mentioned
    traffic engineering technologies.</p>"
