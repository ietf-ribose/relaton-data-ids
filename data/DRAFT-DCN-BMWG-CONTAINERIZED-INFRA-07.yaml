abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes considerations for benchmarking network\n
    \  performance in containerized infrastructures.  In the containerized\n   infrastructure,
    Virtualized Network Functions(VNFs) are deployed on\n   an operating-system-level
    virtualization platform by abstracting the\n   user namespace as opposed to virtualization
    using a hypervisor.\n   Leveraging this, the system configurations and networking
    scenarios\n   for benchmarking will be partially changed by the way in which the\n
    \  resource allocation and network technologies are specified for\n   containerized
    VNFs.  In this draft, we compare the state of the art\n   in a container networking
    architecture with networking on VM-based\n   virtualized systems and provide several
    test scenarios for\n   benchmarking network performance in containerized infrastructures.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
