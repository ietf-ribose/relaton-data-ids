abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. SR is applicable
    to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This
    document describes procedures for Performance Measurement in SR networks using
    the mechanisms defined in RFC 8762 (Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol
    (STAMP)) and its optional extensions defined in RFC 8972 and further augmented
    in draft-ietf-ippm-stamp-srpm. The procedure described is applicable to SR-MPLS
    and SRv6 data planes and is used for both links and end-to- end SR paths including
    SR Policies.</p>"
