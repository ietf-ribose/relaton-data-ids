abstract:
- content: "<p>Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are an important technique in attack
    defence (often called cyber defence). This document outlines the different types
    of IoC, their associated benefits and limitations, and discusses their effective
    use. It also contextualises the role of IoCs in defending against attacks through
    describing a recent case study. This draft does not pre-suppose where IoCs can
    be found or should be detected - as they can be discovered and deployed in networks,
    endpoints or elsewhere - rather, engineers should be aware that they need to be
    detectable (either by endpoint security appliances or network-based defences,
    or ideally both) to be effective.</p>"
