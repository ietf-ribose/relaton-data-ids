abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies algorithms for authenticated encryption withadditional
    authenticated data (AEAD) that are based on thecomposition of the Advanced Encryption
    Standard (AES) in the CipherBlock Chaining (CBC) mode of operation for encryption,
    and the HMAC-SHA1 message authentication code (MAC). It also separately defines
    ageneric composition method that can be used with other MACs andrandomized ciphers
    (that is, ciphers that use random initializationvectors).These algorithms are
    randomized, and thus are suitable for use withapplications that cannot provide
    distinct nonces to each invocationof the AEAD encrypt operation.</p>"
