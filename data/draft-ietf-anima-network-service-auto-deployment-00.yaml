abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an autonomic mechanism for resource-based network
    services deployment through the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) in a network. This
    mechanism uses the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) in [RFC8990] to
    exchange the information among the autonomic nodes so that the resource along
    the service path can be coordinated.</p>"
