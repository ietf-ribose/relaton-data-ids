abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   WebRTC applications collect ICE candidates as part of the process
    of\n   creating peer-to-peer connections.  To maximize the probability of a\n
    \  direct peer-to-peer connection, client private IP addresses are\n   included
    in this candidate collection.  However, disclosure of these\n   addresses has
    privacy implications.  This document describes a way to\n   share local IP addresses
    with other clients while preserving client\n   privacy.  This is achieved by concealing
    IP addresses with\n   dynamically generated Multicast DNS (mDNS) names.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
