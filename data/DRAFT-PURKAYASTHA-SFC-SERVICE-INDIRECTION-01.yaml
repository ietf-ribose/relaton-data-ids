abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many stringent requirements are imposed on today's network,
    such as\n   low latency, high availability and reliability in order to support\n
    \  several use cases such as IoT, Gaming, Content distribution, Robotics\n   etc.
    \ Networks need to be flexible and dynamic in terms of allocation\n   of services
    and resources.  Network Operators should be able to\n   reconfigure the composition
    of a service and steer users towards new\n   service end points as users move
    or resource availability changes.\n   SFC allows network operators to easily create
    and reconfigure service\n   function chains dynamically in response to changing
    network\n   requirements.  We discuss a use case where Service Function Chain
    can\n   adapt or self-organize as demanded by the network condition without\n
    \  requiring SPI re-classification.  This can be achieved, for example,\n   by
    decoupling the service consumer and service endpoint by a new\n   service function
    proposed in this draft.  We describe few\n   requirements for this service function
    to enable dynamic switching\n   between consumer and end point.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
