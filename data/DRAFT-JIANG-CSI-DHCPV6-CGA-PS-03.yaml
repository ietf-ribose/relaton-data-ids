abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes potential issues in the interaction between
    \nDHCPv6 and Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs). Firstly, the \nscenario
    of using CGAs in DHCPv6 environments is discussed.\nSome \noperations are clarified
    for the interaction of DHCPv6 servers and \nCGA-associated hosts. We then also
    discuss how CGAs and DHCPv6 may \nhave mutual benefits for each other, including
    using CGAs in DHCPv6 \noperations to enhance its security features and using DHCPv6
    to \nprovide the CGA generation function.\n\t </p>\n      "
