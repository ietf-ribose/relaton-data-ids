abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   A new Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP), EF-ADMIT,
    has been \n   recommended for a class of real-time traffic conforming to the \n
    \  Expedited Forwarding (EF) Per Hop Behavior (PHB) and admitted using a \n   strong
    Call Admission Control (CAC) procedure incorporating capacity \n   assurance,
    as compared to a class of real-time traffic conforming to \n   the EF PHB but
    not subject to strong CAC.  This document presents \n   modeling results demonstrating
    that EF-ADMIT traffic will experience \n   low packet drop rates even when lack
    of strong CAC results in EF \n   traffic experiencing high packet drop rates.
    \ The modeling shows the\n   performance benefit is material at low to medium
    network access \n   speeds (e.g., 256 Kb/s to 1.5 Mb/s), but relatively inconsequential
    \n   at high access speeds (e.g., 45 Mb/s) and, by inference, backbone \n   speeds
    (100Mb/s and higher) where more bandwidth headroom is assumed.  \n   Furthermore,
    mixing relatively long packets (e.g., 1500 byte video \n   packets) with relatively
    short packets (e.g., 200 byte voice packets) \n   in EF PHB causes significant
    degradation to short packet performance\n   at low to medium access speeds.  Finally,
    the results show that \n   implementation can be effective utilizing either one
    queue with \n   combined EF and EF-ADMIT flows, or two queues with one forEF-ADMIT
    \n   flows and one for EF flows, with the choice of approach mostly a \n   matter
    of policy.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
