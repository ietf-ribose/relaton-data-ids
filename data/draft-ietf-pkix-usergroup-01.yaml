abstract:
  content: "<p>A number of systems which understand X.509 client certificates havedeveloped
    various ad hoc mechanisms to map a certificate to a'userid'/'group(s)' value which
    can then be used for access control.The mechanisms include idiosyncratic name
    forms for the SubjectNamefield such as encoding the userid as a CommonName and
    the group as anOrganizationalUnit, or mapping the certificate against an entry
    in adirectory system. This document describes an otherName extension ofthe GeneralName
    type which can be used in the SubjectAltNameextension or IssuerAltName extension
    to directly encode userid andgroup information.</p>"
