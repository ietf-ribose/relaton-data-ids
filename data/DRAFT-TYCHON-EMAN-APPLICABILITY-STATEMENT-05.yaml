abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        The objective of Energy Management (EMAN)is to provide
    an energy\n        management framework for networked devices. This document\n
    \       presents the applicability of the EMAN framework for a variety\n        of
    scenarios. This document lists use cases and target devices\n        that can
    potentially implement the EMAN framework and associated\n        SNMP MIB modules.
    These use cases are useful for identifying\n        monitoring requirements that
    need to be considered. Further, we\n        describe the relationship of the EMAN
    framework to relevant\n        other energy monitoring standards and architectures.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
