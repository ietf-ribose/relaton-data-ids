abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Conventional telephony signalling commonly uses E.164 addresses
    to \nroute calls to their destination.  However, selection of the \nsignalling
    and media paths can be influenced by other \nconsiderations.  Some such considerations
    may be user specified,  \nand may differ from that which the network operator
    would normally \nchoose.  In some cases, support for such user-specified options
    may \nbe required by national regulation.  The choice of Transit Network \n(e.g.
    selection of long distance carrier) is such a case. \n \n   This draft describes
    three ways that a Transit Network Selection (or \n   TNS) mechanism can be added
    to the TRIP protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
