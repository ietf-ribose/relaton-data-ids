abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo suggests a new procedure for assigning subnet numbers.
    \ Use of this assignment technique within a network would be a purely local matter,
    and would not effect other networks.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.\n\t </p>\n      "
