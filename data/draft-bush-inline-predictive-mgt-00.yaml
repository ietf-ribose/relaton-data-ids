abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In-line network management prediction exploits fine-grained models
    ofnetwork components, injected into the communication network, toenhance network
    performance. Accurate and fast prediction of localnetwork state enables more intelligent
    network control resulting ingreater performance and fault tolerance. Accurate
    and fastprediction requires algorithmic capability. Active and ProgrammableNetworking
    have enabled algorithmic information to be dynamicallyinjected into the network
    allowing enhanced capability andflexibility. One of the new capabilities is enhanced
    networkmanagement via in-line management code, that is, managementalgorithms embedded
    within intermediate network devices. In-linenetwork management prediction utilizes
    low-level algorithmictransport capability to implement low-overhead predictive
    management.A secondary purpose of this document is to provide generalinteroperability
    information for the injection of general purposealgorithmic information into network
    devices. This document may helpin some manner to serve as a temporary bridge between
    InternetProtocol and Active and Programmable Network applications. Thismay stimulate
    some thought as to the content and format of'standards' information potentially
    required for Active Networking.Management of the Internet Protocol and Active
    and ProgrammableNetworking is vital. In particular, coexistence and interoperabilityof
    active networking and Internet Protocol management is specifiedin order to implement
    the injection of algorithmic information into anetwork.</p>"
