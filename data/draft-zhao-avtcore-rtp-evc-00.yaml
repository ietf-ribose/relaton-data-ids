abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding standard
    ISO/IEC International Standard 23094-1, also known as Essential Video Coding (EVC)
    and developed by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11. The RTP payload format allows for packetization
    of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload
    as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets. The payload
    format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming,
    and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among others.</p>"
