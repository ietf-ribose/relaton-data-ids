abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS queries and responses can contain information that reveals important
    information about the person who caused the queries, and it would be better if
    eavesdroppers were unable to see DNS traffic. This document describes how to use
    TLS for encrypting DNS traffic between a system acting as a DNS stub resolver
    and a system acting as a DNS recursive resolver. It defines how to easily wrap
    DNS queries in HTTP requests and interpret DNS responses in the HTTP respones;
    the HTTP here is always run under TLS on port 443. Discussion of this draft should
    take place in the DPRIVE WG.</p>"
