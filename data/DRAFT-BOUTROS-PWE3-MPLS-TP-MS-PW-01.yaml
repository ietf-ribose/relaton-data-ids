abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The existing procedures for concatenating static and dynamic \npseudowires
    (PWs) do not take into account the PW status Operation, \nAdministration, and
    Maintenance (OAM) messages defined for static PW. \nAlso, these procedures do
    not take into account operator functions \nsuch Lock Instruct and Loopback introduced
    as part of MPLS Transport \nProfile (MPLS-TP). This informational document reiterates
    stitching \nprocedures for static PW taking into account all the new proposed
    \nextensions.  \n\nThis document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering
    Task \nForce(IETF) / International Telecommunication Union \nTelecommunication
    Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include \nan MPLS Transport Profile within
    the IETF MPLS and PWE3 \narchitectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
    of a \npacket transport network.\n\t </p>\n      "
