abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a simple and yet time-proven strategy
    for\n   handling long lines in inclusions in internet drafts and RFCs using a\n
    \  backslash ('\\') character to indicate where line-folding has\n   occurred.
    \ The strategy works on any text-based content, but is\n   primarily intended
    for a structured sequence of lines rather than for\n   two-dimensional imagery.
    \ The approach produces consistent results,\n   regardless of the content, that
    is both self-documenting and enables\n   automated reconstitution of the original
    content.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
