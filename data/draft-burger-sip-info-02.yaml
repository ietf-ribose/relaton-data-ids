abstract:
  content: <p>The purpose of the INFO request for the Session Initiation Protocol(SIP),
    as described by RFC 2976, is to provide mid-session SIP UserAgent (UA)-to-SIP
    UA application data transport. In the years sincethe introduction of the INFO
    request, experience with the use of theINFO request indicates a number of problems.
    This document explainswhy there are INFO-based, proprietary protocols in the wild;
    theflaws of using INFO; and explains why it is not possible to create aframework
    to rescue INFO for general purpose use. Since SIP hasevolved considerably since
    the introduction of INFO, this documenthighlights some of the new, robust mechanisms
    for achieving the workthat previously led people to use INFO. As these mechanisms
    are nowavailable, this document formally deprecates the use of INFO for newusages
    beyond the existing standardized ones, namely RFC 3372 (SIP-T)and RFC 4497 (QSIG).Conventions
    Used in this DocumentThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].</p>
