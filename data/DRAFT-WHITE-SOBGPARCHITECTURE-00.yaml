abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a great deal of concern over the security of the Border\n
    \  Gateway Protocol, which is used to provide routing information to the\n   Internet
    and other large internetworks. This draft provides an\n   architecture for a secure
    distributed registry of routing information\n   to address these concerns. The
    draft begins with an overview of the\n   operation of this system, and then follows
    with various deployment\n   scenerios, starting with what we believe will be the
    most common\n   deployment option.\n\t </p>\n      "
