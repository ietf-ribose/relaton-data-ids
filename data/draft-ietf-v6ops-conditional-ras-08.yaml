abstract:
- content: '<p>This document discusses the most common scenarios of connecting an
    enterprise network to multiple ISPs using an address space assigned by an ISP
    and how the approach proposed in "Enterprise Multihoming using Provider-Assigned
    Addresses without Network Prefix Translation: Requirements and Solution" could
    be applied in those scenarios. The problem of enterprise multihoming without address
    translation of any form has not been solved yet as it requires both the network
    to select the correct egress ISP based on the packet source address and hosts
    to select the correct source address based on the desired egress ISP for that
    traffic. The aforementioned document proposes a solution to this problem by introducing
    a new routing functionality (Source Address Dependent Routing) to solve the uplink
    selection issue. It also proposes using Router Advertisements to influence the
    host source address selection. It focuses on solving the general problem and covering
    various complex use cases, and this document adopts its proposed approach to provide
    a solution for a limited number of common use cases. In particular, the focus
    of this document is on scenarios in which an enterprise network has two Internet
    uplinks used either in primary/backup mode or simultaneously and hosts in that
    network might not yet properly support multihoming as described in RFC 8028.</p>'
