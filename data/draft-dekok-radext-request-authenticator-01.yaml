abstract:
- content: "<p>RADIUS contains a one-octet Identifier field which is used to correlate
    requests and replies. This field limits the number of outstanding requests to
    256. Experience shows that this limitation is problematic for high load systems.
    This document proposes to use the Request Authenticator field as an additional
    unique identifier. The replies can then be correlated to requests by copying the
    Request Authenticator from the request to a new attribute in the response, called
    the Original-Request-Authenticator.</p>"
