abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some services provided by intermediaries depend on their ability
    to\n   inspect a message body in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\n   When
    sensitive information is included in the message body, a SIP\n   User Agent (UA)
    needs to protect it from other intermediaries than\n   those that the UA agreed
    to disclose it to.  This document proposes a\n   mechanism for securing information
    passed between an end user and\n   intermediaries using S/MIME.  It also proposes
    mechanisms for a UA to\n   discover intermediaries which need to inspect an S/MIME-secured\n
    \  message body, or to receive the message body with data integrity\n\n   This
    specification is approved at the proposed standards level due to\n   the IANA
    registration requirements.  Is is of sufficient quality for\n   that level, however,
    the use of this mechanism in this specification\n   are considered experimental.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
