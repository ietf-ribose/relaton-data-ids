abstract:
- content: "<p>Some functionalities (e.g., fragmentation/reassembly and Encapsulating
    Security Payload) provided by IPv6 can be viewed as delivery functions independent
    of IPv6 or even IP entirely. This document proposes to provide those functionalities
    at different layers (e.g., MPLS, BIER or even Ethernet) independent of IP.</p>"
