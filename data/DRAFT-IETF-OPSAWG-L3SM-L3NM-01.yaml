abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC8299 defines a L3VPN Service YANG data Model (L3SM) that
    can be\n   used for communication between customers and VPN service providers.\n
    \  That data model plays the role of a Customer Service Model, according\n   to
    the terminology defined in RFC8309, and is as such adequate for\n   service negotiation
    and order handling matters.\n\n   There is a need for a more network-centric YANG
    data model to be used\n   in the communication between the entity that interacts
    directly with\n   the customer, the service orchestrator, (either fully automated
    or a\n   human operator) and the entity in charge of network orchestration and\n
    \  control (a.k.a., network controller/orchestrator).\n\n   This document specifies
    a L3VPN Network YANG Model (L3NM) to\n   facilitate communication between a service
    orchestrator and a network\n   controller/orchestrator.  Such data model provides
    a network-centric\n   view of the L3VPN services.  The Yang model proposed is
    limited to\n   BGP PE-based VPNs as described in RFCs 4026, 4110, and 4364.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
