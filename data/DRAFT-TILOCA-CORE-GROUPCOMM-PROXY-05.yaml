abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operations performed by a proxy,
    when\n   using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) in group\n   communication
    scenarios.  Such a proxy processes a single request\n   sent by a client over
    unicast, and distributes the request over IP\n   multicast to a group of servers.
    \ Then, the proxy collects the\n   individual responses from those servers and
    relays those responses\n   back to the client, in a way that allows the client
    to distinguish\n   the responses and their origin servers through embedded addressing\n
    \  information.  This document updates RFC7252 with respect to caching\n   of
    response messages at proxies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
