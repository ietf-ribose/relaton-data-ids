abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document analyzes actions by or against a CA or independent\n
    \  repository manager in the RPKI that can adversely affect the Internet\n   Number
    Resources (INRs) associated with that CA or its subordinate\n   CAs.  The analysis
    is based on examination of the data items in the\n   RPKI repository, as controlled
    by a CA (or independent repository\n   manager) and fetched by Relying Parties
    (RPs).  The analysis is\n   performed from the perspective of an affected INR
    holder.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
