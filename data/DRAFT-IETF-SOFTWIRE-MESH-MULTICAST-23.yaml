abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   During the transition to IPv6, there will be scenarios where
    a\n   backbone network internally running one IP address family (referred\n   to
    as the internal IP or I-IP family), connects client networks\n   running another
    IP address family (referred to as the external IP or\n   E-IP family).  In such
    cases, the I-IP backbone needs to offer both\n   unicast and multicast transit
    services to the client E-IP networks.\n\n   This document describes a mechanism
    for supporting multicast across\n   backbone networks where the I-IP and E-IP
    protocol families differ.\n   The document focuses on IPv4-over-IPv6 scenario,
    due to lack of real-\n   world use cases for IPv6-over-IPv4 scenario.\n\n\t </p>\n
