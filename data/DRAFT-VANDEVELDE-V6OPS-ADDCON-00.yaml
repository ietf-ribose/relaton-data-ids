abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>One fundamental aspect of any IP communications infrastructure
    is its\naddressing plan.  With its new address architecture and allocation\npolicies,
    the introduction of IPv6 into a network means that network\ndesigners and operators
    need to reconsider their existing approaches\nto network addressing.  Lack of
    guideliness on handling this aspect\nof network design could slow down the integration
    of IPv6.  This\ndraft aims to provide the information and recommendations relevant
    to\nplanning the addressing aspects of IPv6 deployments.  The draft also\nprovides
    IPv6 addressing case studies for both an enterprise and an\nISP network.  In this
    first version of the draft we aim to provoke\ndiscussion on this important topic;
    more detailed case study texts\nwill follow.\n\t </p>\n      "
