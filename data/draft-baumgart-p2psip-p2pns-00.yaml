abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes P2PNS, a secure distributed name service
    forP2PSIP. P2PNS can be used to resolve SIP AoRs to Contact URIswithout using
    DNS or central SIP servers. P2PNS provides severalsecurity mechanisms to efficiently
    prevent identity theft and toensure the uniqueness of SIP AoRs in a completely
    decentralized anduntrusted network without login servers. The proposed proxyarchitecture
    allows a seamless integration of legacy SIP UAs, avoidsmodifications to the complex
    SIP protocol stack and facilitates thedeployment of P2PSIP networks. Because P2PNS
    provides a generic nameservice it is not limited to P2PSIP but can also be used
    e.g. tobuild a distributed DNS system.</p>"
