abstract:
- content: "<p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new multicast forwarding
    paradigm which doesn't require an explicit tree-building protocol nor intermediate
    routers to maintain any multicast state. BIER has two types of encapsulation formats:
    one is MPLS-BIER encapsulation, the other is non-MPLS-BIER encapsulation. This
    document proposes a mechanism of encapsulating non-MPLS-BIER packets over UDP
    tunnels.</p>"
