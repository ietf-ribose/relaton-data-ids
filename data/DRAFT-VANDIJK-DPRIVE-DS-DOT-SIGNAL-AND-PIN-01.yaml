abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a way to signal the usage of DoT, and
    the\n   pinned keys for that DoT usage, in authoritative servers.  This\n   signal
    lives on the parent side of delegations, in DS records.  To\n   ensure easy deployment,
    the signal is defined in terms of (C)DNSKEY.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
