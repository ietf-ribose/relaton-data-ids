abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial\n
    \  information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network\n   performance
    criteria (e.g. latency) are becoming as critical to data\n   path selection as
    other metrics and constraints.  These metrics are\n   associated with the Service
    Level Agreement (SLA) between customers\n   and service providers.  The link bandwidth
    utilization (the total\n   bandwidth of a link in current use for the forwarding)
    is another\n   important factor to consider during path computation.\n\n   IGP
    Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric extensions describe mechanisms\n   with which
    network performance information is distributed via OSPF\n   and IS-IS respectively.
    \ The Path Computation Element Communication\n   Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms
    for Path Computation Elements\n   (PCEs) to perform path computations in response
    to Path Computation\n   Clients (PCCs) requests.  This document describes the
    extension to\n   PCEP to carry latency, delay variation, packet loss and link\n
    \  bandwidth utilization as constraints for end to end path computation.\n\n\t
