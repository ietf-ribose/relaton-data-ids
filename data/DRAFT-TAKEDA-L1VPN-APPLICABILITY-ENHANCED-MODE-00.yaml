abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides an applicability analysis on the use of
    \n   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and \n   mechanisms
    to satisfy the requirements of the Layer 1 Virtual Private \n   Network (L1VPN)
    Enhanced Mode. \n    \n   L1VPNs provide customer services and connectivity at
    layer 1 over \n   layer 1 networks. The operation of L1VPNs is divided into the
    Basic \n   Mode and the Enhanced Mode, where the Enhanced Mode of operation \n
    \  features exchange of routing information between the layer 1 network \n   and
    the customer domain.\n\n    In addition, this document identifies areas where
    additional protocol \n   extensions or procedures are needed to satisfy the requirements
    of \n   the L1VPN Enhanced Mode, and provides guidelines for potential \n   extensions.\n\t
