abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Available bandwidth along a path is an important metric that can
    be\nuseful to provide insight into the state and performance of the\nnetwork.
    Some methods have been proposed in literature for\nmeasurement of available bandwidth
    but they face the problems of\nscalability and high intrusiveness.  In this draft,
    we propose a\nmethod to measure path available bandwidth using an active approach\nthat
    probes the path. The probing mechanism used is based on TCP\nNew Reno. Once the
    samples for the available bandwidth measurement\nare obtained, more accurate results
    are calculated using a\nprediction filter.\n\t </p>\n      "
