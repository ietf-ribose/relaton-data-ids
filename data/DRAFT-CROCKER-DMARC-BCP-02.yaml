abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Email abuse often relies on unauthorized use of a domain name,
    such\n   as one belonging to a well-known company (brand).  SPF and DKIM\n   provide
    basic domain name authentication methods for email.  A recent\n   industry effort
    built an additional authentication-based layer,\n   called Domain-based Message
    Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance\n   (DMARC).  It allows a sender to
    indicate that their emails are\n   protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and tells a receiver
    what to do if\n   neither of those authentication methods passes; it also provides
    a\n   reporting mechanism, from receivers back to domain owners.  Such\n   capabilities
    over the public Internet are unusual and their use is\n   not yet well-understood.
    \ This document formulates a set of best\n   practices for the use of DMARC.\n\n\t
