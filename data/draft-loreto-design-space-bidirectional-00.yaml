abstract:
  content: "<p>As technologies that enable bidirectional communication over HTTPhave
    become more pervasive, interest has grown in (1) definingimproved mechanisms for
    support of existing technologies (short-termsolutions such as new HTTP headers)
    and (2) laying the foundation fordevelopment of new bidirectional protocols (long-term
    solutions suchas WebSocket, Bidirectional Web Transfer Protocol, and Reverse HTTP).In
    order to provide context for such work, this document provides afirst tentative
    map of the design space for bidirectional HTTP, withspecial attention to deployed
    infrastructure (e.g. web clients,intermediaries, firewalls, NATs, web servers)
    and programmingenvironments.</p>"
