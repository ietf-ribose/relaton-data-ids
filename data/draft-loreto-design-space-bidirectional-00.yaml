abstract:
- content: "<p>As technologies that enable bidirectional communication over HTTP have
    become more pervasive, interest has grown in (1) defining improved mechanisms
    for support of existing technologies (short-term solutions such as new HTTP headers)
    and (2) laying the foundation for development of new bidirectional protocols (long-term
    solutions such as WebSocket, Bidirectional Web Transfer Protocol, and Reverse
    HTTP). In order to provide context for such work, this document provides a first
    tentative map of the design space for bidirectional HTTP, with special attention
    to deployed infrastructure (e.g. web clients, intermediaries, firewalls, NATs,
    web servers) and programming environments.</p>"
