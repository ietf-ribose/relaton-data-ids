abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the framework for passive measurement.
    \ In\n   particular, the differences between passive and active measurements\n
    \  are analyzed, general considerations for both metric definition and\n   measurement
    methodology are discussed, and requirements for various\n   entities performing
    a given passive measurement task are described\n   according to a reference model.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
