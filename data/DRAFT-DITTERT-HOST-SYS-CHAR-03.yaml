abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The interoperability of configuration services based on the Dynamic
    Host\n   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [1] in an environment of heterogeneous\n
    \  clients depends on clients accurately identifying themselves and their\n   relevant
    characteristics to configuration servers.  The class identifier\n   provided through
    DHCP option 60 [2] helps in this regard, but such\n   identifiers essentially
    only enable clients and servers that are 'good\n   friends' to find each other.
    This draft proposes the definition of three\n   options that convey particular,
    generally useful information about the\n   client system.  This enables all servers
    to recognize this information,\n   and is a step toward a richer form of interoperability
    for configuration\n   services.\n \n   The options in question are\n             Option
    93 - Client System Architecture\n             Option 94 - Client Network Device
    Interface\n             Option 97 - UUID/GUID-based Client Identifier\n \n   Subsequent
    to IANA issuing the above DHCP option numbers, the DHCP Working\n   Group has
    determined that use of these options is not appropriate. As a\n   result, it was
    agreed in the August 1998 IETF DHCP WG meeting that use of\n   Options 93, 94,
    and 97 as described in this draft would be allowed until\n   August of 2004 (six
    years), after which time the option numbers would be\n   made available for new
    options.\n \n   In the interim, it is expected that systems using Options 93,
    94, and 97\n   will be redefined to use Options 60 and 61.  It is allowable that
    systems\n   may use both methods during the 6 year interim period as a means of\n
    \  migrating to exclusive use of Options 60 and 61 for this functionality by\n
    \  the end of the interim period.\n \n   The DHCP Working Group has agreed that
    this draft will be published as\n   an Informational RFC to document the expected
    term of use for Options 93,\n   94, and 97 as defined in this ID.\n\t </p>\n      "
