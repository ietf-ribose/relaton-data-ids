abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The unpredictability of consumers, routers, copyholders, and\n
    \  publishers for the in-network data retrievals in Content-Centric\n   Networking
    (CCN) / Named Data Networking (NDN) poses a challenge to\n   design an authentication
    mechanism to inhibit the malicious consumers\n   to flood data requests and prevent
    the fake data from being provided.\n   Signature is adopted as the fundamental
    function in CCN / NDN, which\n   however can only provide publisher authentication
    with additional\n   certificate acquisition.  This document describes the Hop-by-Hop\n
    \  Authentication mechanism (HopAuth) integrating certificate collection\n   and
    packet forwarding potentially with the assistance from\n   certificate authority
    to provide consumer authentication, copyholder\n   authentication and path authentication
    to enable the in-network data\n   retrieval to be trustworthy, besides the publisher
    authentication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
