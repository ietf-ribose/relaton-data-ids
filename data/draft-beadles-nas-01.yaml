abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Access Server is the initial entry point to a network for
    the majority of users of network services. It is the first device in the network
    to provide services to an end user, and acts as a gateway for all further services.
    As such, its importance to users and ser- vice providers alike is paramount. However,
    the concept of a Network Access Server has grown up over the years without being
    formally defined or analyzed. This document offers a framework for the defini-
    tion and analysis of a modern Network Access Server.</p>"
