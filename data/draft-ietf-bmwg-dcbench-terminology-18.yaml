abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this informational document is to establish definitions
    and describe measurement techniques for data center benchmarking, as well as it
    is to introduce new terminologies applicable to performance evaluations of data
    center network equipment. This document establishes the important concepts for
    benchmarking network switches and routers in the data center and, is a pre-requisite
    to the test methodology publication [draft-ietf-bmwg-dcbench-methodology]. Many
    of these terms and methods may be applicable to network equipment beyond this
    publication's scope as the technologies originally applied in the data center
    are deployed elsewhere.</p>"
