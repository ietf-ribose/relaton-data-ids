abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HTTP defines proactive content negotiation to allow servers
    to select\n   the appropriate response for a given request, based upon the user\n
    \  agent's characteristics, as expressed in request headers.  In\n   practice,
    clients are often unwilling to send those request headers,\n   because it is not
    clear whether they will be used, and sending them\n   impacts both performance
    and privacy.\n\n   This document defines two response headers, Accept-CH and Accept-CH-\n
    \  Lifetime, that servers can use to advertise their use of request\n   headers
    for proactive content negotiation, along with a set of\n   guidelines for the
    creation of such headers, colloquially known as\n   \"Client Hints.\"\n\n   It
    also defines an initial set of Client Hints.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
