abstract:
  content: "<p>MIPv6 defines the concept of Home Network for a MN, in opposition tothe
    foreign network where this entity may find itself. A ``Home LinkDetection'' mechanism
    is also specified to allow the MN to detectwhen it is at home.MIPv6 specification
    mandates the use of IPsec for protecting mainsignaling traffic and also defines
    how IPsec can be used to protectdata traffic between the MN and its HA. Even if
    optional, it isexpected that many deployments of MIPv6 will use it by default
    for MNwhich may roam outside a trusted infrastructure (e.g. outside amobile operator
    network).When a MN detects it is at home, it is expected to stop IPsecprotection
    for data traffic exchanged with its Home Agent. Thatevent is the result of the
    Home Return procedure, triggered by theHome Link Detection mechanism.This document
    discusses the possible threats and security impactsassociated with the use of
    this insecure NDP-based mechanism as atrigger to drop IPsec protection of data
    traffic for the MN. It alsoprovides some results on the implementation of the
    attacks against anexisting MIPv6 module. Possible solutions are suggested.</p>"
