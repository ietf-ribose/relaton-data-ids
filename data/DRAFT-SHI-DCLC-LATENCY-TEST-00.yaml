abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We test the influence of the queue length, packet size and
    so on to\n   the forwarding latency of the typical access switch, which is meant\n
    \  to set off our efforts in studying the relationship between the\n   queuing
    length and the transport performance of some latency-\n   sensitive applications
    in a DC network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
