abstract:
- content: "<p>Large-scale Deterministic Network (LDN) [ldn] aims to achieve bounded
    latency forwarding on layer-3 networks that contain long-distance links, large
    number of nodes and flows. LDN requires a data plane mechanism to indicate different
    forwarding cycles in the upstream node. This document proposes to use multiple
    MPLS labels to indicate this kind of information, for MPLS-LSP data plane.</p>"
