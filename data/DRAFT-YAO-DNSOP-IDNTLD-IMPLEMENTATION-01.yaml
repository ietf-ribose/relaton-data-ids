abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>ICANN is pushing the IDN TLD into the root server.  Some IDN TLD
    has\nthe variants.  Currently, there are two proposals to implement the\nIDN TLD
    variants in the root servers:1, implement it with the DNAME\nrecord; 2, implement
    it with NS record.  The IDN TLD variants may be\nreserved or activated.  If the
    IDN TLD variants are activated, these\nvariants will be allocated to the same
    TLD manager in order to avoid\nthe possible phishing problems.  How to deal with
    the IDN TLD variant\nissue is a big challenge ahead of us.  This document discusses
    the\nIDN TLD variants implementation issues related with DNAME and NS\nresource
    record way.  This memo also gives a proposal about how to\navoid the possible
    phishing problem after putting the IDN TLD\nvariants into the root.\n\t </p>\n
