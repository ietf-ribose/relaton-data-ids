abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet Draft describes an enhanced format for encoding
    prefix\ninformation, to permit multiple copies of a prefix with different\npaths
    to be announced and withdrawn.\n\nPrefix instances using the new format include
    both unique\nidentifiers, and ordinals to control path selection.\n\nWithdrawal
    of prefixes requires a slight modification to disambiguate\nprefix instances.Author's
    Note\n\nThis Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related\ndraft(s)
    being placed on the Standards Track for idr.\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST
    NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in [4].\n\t </p>\n      "
