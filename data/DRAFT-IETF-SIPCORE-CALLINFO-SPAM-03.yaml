abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Called parties often wish to decide whether to accept, reject
    or\n   redirect calls based on the likely nature of the call.  For example,\n
    \  they may want to reject unwanted telemarketing or fraudulent calls,\n   but
    accept emergency alerts from numbers not in their address book.\n   This document
    describes SIP Call-Info parameters and a feature tag\n   that allow originating,
    intermediate and terminating SIP entities to\n   label calls as to their type,
    confidence and references to additional\n   information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
