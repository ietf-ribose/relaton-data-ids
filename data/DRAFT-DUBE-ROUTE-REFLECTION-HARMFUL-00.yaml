abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Route reflection as defined by [2] is a popular way of reducing
    the\n   full-mesh IBGP peering required by routers running the Border Gateway\n
    \  Protocol [1]. There are cases where a topology built using route\n   reflectors
    produces persistent loops or does not produce the same\n   results as what one
    would expect with a full IBGP mesh. This document\n   describes these problems.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
