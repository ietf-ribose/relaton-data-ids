abstract:
- content: "<p>In SDN networks, applications need to discover the location of the
    local or specific SDN Orchestrator before requesting service. Other SDN Orchestrator
    may also need to know its nearby SDN Orchestrators. This is called SDN Discovery.
    This document introduces a discovery scheme which employs the U-NAPTR mechanism
    to determine the URI of the SDN Orchestrator.</p>"
