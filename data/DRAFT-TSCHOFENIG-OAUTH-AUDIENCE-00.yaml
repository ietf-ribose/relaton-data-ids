abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token specification allows any party in\n
    \  possession of a bearer token to get access to the associated\n   resources
    (without demonstrating possession of a cryptographic key).\n   To prevent misuse,
    two important security assumptions must hold:\n   bearer tokens must be protected
    from disclosure in storage and in\n   transport and the access token must only
    be valid for use with a\n   specific resource server (the audience) and with a
    specific scope.\n\n   This document defines a new header that is used by the client
    to\n   indicate what resource server, as the intended recipient, it wants to\n
    \  access.  This information is subsequently also communicated by the\n   authorization
    server securely to the resource server, for example\n   within the audience field
    of the access token.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
