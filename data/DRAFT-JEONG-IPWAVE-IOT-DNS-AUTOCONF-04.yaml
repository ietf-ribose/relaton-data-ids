abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for device\n
    \  discovery and service discovery.  Through the device discovery, this\n   document
    supports the global (or local) DNS naming of Internet of\n   Things (IoT) devices,
    such as sensors, actuators, and in-vehicle\n   units.  By this scheme, the DNS
    name of an IoT device can be\n   autoconfigured with the device's model information
    in wired and\n   wireless target networks (e.g., vehicle, road network, home,
    office,\n   shopping mall, and smart grid).  Through the service discovery, IoT\n
    \  users (e.g., drivers, passengers, home residents, and customers) in\n   the
    Internet (or local network) can easily identify each device for\n   monitoring
    and remote-controlling it in a target network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
