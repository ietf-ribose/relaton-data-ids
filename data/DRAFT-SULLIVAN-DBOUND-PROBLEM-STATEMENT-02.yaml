abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some Internet client entities on the Internet make inferences
    about\n   the administrative relationships among services on the Internet based\n
    \  on the domain names at which they are offered.  At present, it is not\n   possible
    to ascertain organizational administrative boundaries in the\n   DNS, therefore
    such inferences can be erroneous in various ways.\n   Mitigation strategies deployed
    so far will not scale.  This memo\n   outlines what issues are to be addressed.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
