abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how Message Disposition Notifications [MDN]
    are used to indicate the supported features of a user's Mail User Agent (MUA).
    Knowing the supported features of a recipient or the recipient's MUA allows a
    sender to generate messages which take advantage of those features. Features indicate
    the MIME content-types are supported by the Mail User Agent, or finer gradations
    of features such as resolution, maximum image size, or software version number.
    The representation of features is still under discussion in the CONNEG working
    group. Features are registered using the framework described in [FEATURES].</p>"
