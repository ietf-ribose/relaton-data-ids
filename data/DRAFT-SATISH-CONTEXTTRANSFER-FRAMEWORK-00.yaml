abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile nodes enhance their connections across wireless media by\nestablishing
    specific parameters at the FA/AR/AP in order to\nfacilitate optimal usage of the
    resources as well as enhance the QoS\nas seen by a MN. During handover from one
    access router to another, a\nbandwidth-constrained mobile node MAY need to have
    state information\npassed from the previous router to the new one.  This document\nproposes
    a context transfer framework that makes use of existing fast\nhandoff signaling
    for context transfer as well as provide a mechanism\nfor QoS negotiation and renegotiations.
    We also cover CT under CAR\ndiscovery. The suggested mechanism provides for context
    transfer so\nthat the applications running on the mobile node could operate with\nminimal
    disruption.\n\t </p>\n      "
