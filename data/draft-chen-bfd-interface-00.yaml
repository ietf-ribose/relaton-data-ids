abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how application clients can request IP-based
    Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) sessions while either being IP agnostic
    themselves or while dealing with IP unnumbered interfaces. A dedicated well-known
    multicast IP address 224.XXX.XXX.XXX is used as the destination IP address of
    the BFD packets when running BFD for interface. It allows for BFD sessions on
    interfaces that may have no IP addresses, either because the interface is unnumbered
    or because the layer 3 protocol status of the interfaces is not up yet. One application
    of BFD for interface is to run BFD over LAG/Bundle component links. An example
    will be given in this document.</p>"
