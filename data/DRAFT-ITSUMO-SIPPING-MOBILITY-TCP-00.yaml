abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes an approach for using SIP to support mobility\nfor
    TCP-based applications in a mobile Internet. The proposed\napproach utilizes a
    TCP tracking agent, dubbed as SIP_EYE, in mobile\nstations as well as SIP INFO
    method to spoof constant endpoints for\nmobile TCP connections and supports mobile
    TCP applications in a SIP\nenvironment without any changes to TCP.\n\t </p>\n
