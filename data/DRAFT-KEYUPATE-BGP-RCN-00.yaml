abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Whenever a prefix is withdrawn using BGP withdrawal mechanism,
    it\ntriggers a number of updates in certain scenarios before the prefix\nis completly
    withdrawn from the entire BGP network.  This phenomenon\nis popularly known as
    _path exploration_ or _path hunting_ and occurs\nbecause of path vector property
    of BGP.  It results in a series of\nunwanted or redundant transitions that overloads
    the BGP network.\n\nThis document describes a mechanism to help limit the amount
    of such\npath exploration by defining two optional transitive path attributes\nfor
    BGP: SPEAKERID_PATH and ROOT_CAUSE.\n\t </p>\n      "
