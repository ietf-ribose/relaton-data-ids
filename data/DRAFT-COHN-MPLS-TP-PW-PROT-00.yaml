abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the requirements of the MPLS transport profile [RFC
    5654] is\n   to provide linear protection for transport paths, which include both\n
    \  LSPs and PWs. The functional architecture described in [SurvivFwk]\n   is applicable
    to both LSP and PWs, however [LinearProt] does not\n   explicitly describe mechanisms
    for PW protection in MPLS-TP.\n\n   This document extends the applicability of
    the linear protection\n   mechanism described in [LinearProt] to MPLS-TP segmented
    PWs\n   (MS-PWs) as defined in [RFC 6073].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
