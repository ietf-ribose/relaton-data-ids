abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two fully specified Forward Erasure Correction
    (FEC) Schemes for Sliding Window Random Linear Codes (RLC), one for RLC over the
    Galois Field (a.k.a., Finite Field) GF(2), a second one for RLC over the Galois
    Field GF(2), each time with the possibility of controlling the code density. They
    can protect arbitrary media streams along the lines defined by FECFRAME extended
    to Sliding Window FEC Codes. These Sliding Window FEC Codes rely on an encoding
    window that slides over the source symbols, generating new repair symbols whenever
    needed. Compared to block FEC codes, these Sliding Window FEC Codes offer key
    advantages with real-time flows in terms of reduced FEC-related latency while
    often providing improved packet erasure recovery capabilities.</p>"
