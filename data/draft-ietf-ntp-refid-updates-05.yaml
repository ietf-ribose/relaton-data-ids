abstract:
- content: '<p>RFC 5905 [RFC5905], section 7.3, "Packet Header Variables", defines
    the value of the REFID, the system peer for the responding host. In the past,
    for IPv4 associations the IPv4 address is used, and for IPv6 associations the
    first four octets of the MD5 hash of the IPv6 are used. There are two recognized
    shortcomings to this approach, and this proposal addresses them. One is that knowledge
    of the system peer is "abusable" information and should not be generally available.
    The second is that the four octet hash of the IPv6 address looks very much like
    an IPv4 address, and this is confusing. RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING
