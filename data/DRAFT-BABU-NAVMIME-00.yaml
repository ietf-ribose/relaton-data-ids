abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Typically an NAV (network-based anti-virus) system stores the
    \n   entire HTTP response from the server, scan the response for \n   malware
    and then transmits it to the client. This extension \n   attempts to better response
    time for Web traffic by letting the\n   NAV (network-based anti-virus) system
    save the time required for\n   the NAV system for transmission of data from the
    NAV system to \n   the client. In addition, this extension also helps in reporting
    \n   download progress and avoiding client connection timeout.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
