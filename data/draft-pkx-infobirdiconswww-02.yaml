- content: "<p>The document proposes a WWW as an intelligent being that delivers information
    to users. This can be combined with a Single SignON solution for the WWW seen
    as one Giant computer. Imagine having a handy device and you travel to Bangkok
    and in the morning when you authenticate to WWW, your WWW navigation screen shows
    you very useful Icons that can create a better experience for you.</p>"
