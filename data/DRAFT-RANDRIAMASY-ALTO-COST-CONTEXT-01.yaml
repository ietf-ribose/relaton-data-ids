abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service has
    defined\n   network and cost maps to provide basic network information, where
    the\n   cost maps allow only one JSON value for a requested metric.\n\n   This
    document introduces several protocol extensions to allow ALTO\n   clients to support
    use cases such as context based connection\n   selection in cellular networks
    and calendaring for unattended data.\n   This document refers to other extension
    proposals posted in the ALTO\n   WG that can support the present use cases as
    well.  Likewise, some of\n   the proposed extensions may serve other ALTO use
    cases.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
