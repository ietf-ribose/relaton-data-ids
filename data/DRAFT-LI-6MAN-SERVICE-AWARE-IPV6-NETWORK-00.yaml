abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A multitude of applications are carried over the network, which
    have\n   varying needs for network bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet\n   loss,
    etc.  Some applications such as online gaming and live video\n   streaming have
    very demanding network requirements thereof require\n   special treatments in
    the network.  However, since the current\n   network is lack of enough information
    of service requirements of such\n   applications it is difficult to guarantee
    the SLA or it may take long\n   time to provide such guarantee.  This document
    proposes the solution\n   to make use of IPv6 extensions header to convey the
    service\n   requirement information along with the packet to the network to\n
    \  facilitate the service deployment and network resource adjustment to\n   guarantee
    SLA for applications.  Then it defines the service-aware\n   options which can
    be used in the different IPv6 extension headers for\n   the purpose.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
