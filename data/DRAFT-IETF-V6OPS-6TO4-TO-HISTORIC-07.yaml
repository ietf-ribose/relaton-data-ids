abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Experience with the \"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds\n
    \  (6to4)\" IPv6 transition mechanism has shown that the mechanism is\n   unsuitable
    for widespread deployment and use in the Internet,\n   especially in its anycast
    mode.  This document requests that RFC\n   3068, \"An Anycast Prefix for 6to4
    Relay Routers\", be made obsolete\n   and moved to historic status.  It also recommends
    that future\n   products should not support 6to4 anycast and that existing\n   deployments
    should be reviewed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
