abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a symbol representation for Random
    Linear\n   Network Coding (RLNC) schemes used for reliable data transfer.\n   Specifically,
    the following features are discussed and incorporated:\n   both block RLNC and
    a sliding window RLNC, varying data frame sizes,\n   and one or multiple symbols
    associated with a single symbol\n   representation header.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
