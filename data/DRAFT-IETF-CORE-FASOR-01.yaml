abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an alternative retransmission timeout
    and\n   congestion control back off algorithm for the CoAP protocol, called\n
    \  Fast-Slow RTO (FASOR).\n\n   The algorithm specified in this document employs
    an appropriate and\n   large enough back off of Retransmission Timeout (RTO) as
    the major\n   congestion control mechanism to allow acquiring unambiguous RTT\n
    \  samples with high probability and to prevent building a persistent\n   queue
    when retransmitting.  The algorithm also aims to retransmit\n   quickly using
    an accurately managed retransmission timeout when link-\n   errors are occuring,
    basing RTO calculation on unambiguous round-trip\n   time (RTT) samples.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
