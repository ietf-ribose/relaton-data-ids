abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Disaggregated media refers to the ability for a user to create
    a\nmultimedia session combining different media streams, coming from\ndifferent
    devices under his or her control, so that they are treated\nby the far end of
    the session as a single media session.  This\ndocument lists several use cases
    that involve disaggregated media in\nSIP.  Additionally, this document analyzes
    what types of\ndisaggregated media can be implemented using existing protocol\nmechanisms,
    and the pros and cons of using each of those mechanisms.\nFinally, this document
    describes scenarios that are not covered by\ncurrent mechanisms and proposes new
    IETF work to cover them.\n\t </p>\n      "
