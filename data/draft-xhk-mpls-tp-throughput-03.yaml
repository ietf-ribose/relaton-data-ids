abstract:
- content: "<p>An important Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) requirement
    of the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the ability to measure the throughput
    (i.e. bandwidth) of an MPLS-TP connection which could be an MPLS-TP PseudoWire
    (PW), Label Switched Path (LSP) or Section. This document specifies the OAM packet
    formats and procedures for both one-way and two-way throughput measurement in
    MPLS-TP.</p>"
