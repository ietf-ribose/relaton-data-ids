abstract:
  content: "<p>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide numerous benefits: reduceddelivery
    cost for cacheable content, improved quality of experiencefor End Users and increased
    robustness of delivery. For thesereasons they are frequently used for large-scale
    content delivery.As a result, existing CDN providers are scaling up theirinfrastructure
    and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) aredeploying their own CDNs. It is generally
    desirable that a givencontent item can be delivered to an end user regardless
    of that enduser's location or attachment network. This creates a requirementfor
    interconnecting standalone CDNs so they can interoperate as anopen content delivery
    infrastructure for the end-to-end delivery ofcontent from Content Service Providers
    (CSPs) to end users. However,no standards or open specifications currently exist
    to facilitatesuch CDN interconnection.The goal of this document is to outline
    the problem area for the IETFwith a view towards creating a working group. This
    working groupwould work on interoperable and scalable solutions for CDNinterconnection.</p>"
