abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IPv6 network mobility (NEMO) configuration relies on a prefix\ndelegation
    service to fulfill its task.  Such service has already\nbeen described in two
    different proposals, one is based on DHCPv6 and\nthe other extends NEMO signaling.\n\nHowever,
    both failed to gather consensus.  This memo describes how\nDHCPv6 Relay Agents
    can be used in order to provide the missing\nflexibility and pave the way for
    a solution.\n\t </p>\n      "
