abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath TCP (MPTCP) adds the capability of using multiple
    paths to\n   a regular TCP session.  Even though it is designed to be totally\n
    \  backward compatible to applications, the data transport differs\n   compared
    to regular TCP, and there are several additional degrees of\n   freedom that applications
    may wish to exploit.  This document\n   summarizes the impact that MPTCP may have
    on applications, such as\n   changes in performance.  Furthermore, it discusses
    compatibility\n   issues of MPTCP in combination with non-MPTCP-aware applications.\n
    \  Finally, the document describes a basic application interface which\n   is
    a simple extension of TCP's interface for MPTCP-aware\n   applications.\n\n\t
