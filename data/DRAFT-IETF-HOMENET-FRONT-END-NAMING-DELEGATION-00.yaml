abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CPEs are designed to provide IP connectivity to home networks.
    \ Most\n   CPEs assign IP addresses to the nodes of the home network which makes\n
    \  it a good candidate for hosting the naming service.  With IPv6, the\n   naming
    service makes nodes reachable from the home network as well as\n   from the Internet.\n\n
    \  However, CPEs have not been designed to host such a naming service\n   exposed
    on the Internet.  This may expose the CPEs to resource\n   exhaustion which would
    make the home network unreachable, and most\n   probably would also affect the
    home network inner communications.\n\n   In addition, DNSSEC management and configuration
    may not be well\n   understood or mastered by regular end users.  Misconfiguration
    may\n   also results in naming service disruption, thus these end users may\n
    \  prefer to rely on third party naming providers.\n\n   This document describes
    a homenet naming architecture where the CPEs\n   manage the DNS zone associates
    to its home network, and outsources\n   the naming service and eventually the
    DNSSEC management on the\n   Internet to a third party designated as the Public
    Authoritative\n   Servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
