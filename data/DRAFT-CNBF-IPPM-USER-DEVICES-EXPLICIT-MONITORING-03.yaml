abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a methodology to monitor network performance\n
    \  exploiting user devices.  This can be achieved using the Explicit\n   Flow
    Measurement Techniques, protocol independent methods that employ\n   few marking
    bits, inside the header of each packet, for loss and\n   delay measurement.  User
    devices and servers, marking the traffic,\n   signal these metrics to intermediate
    network observers allowing them\n   to measure connection performance, and to
    locate the network segment\n   where impairments happen.  In addition or in alternative
    to network\n   observers, a probe can be installed on the user device with\n   remarkable
    benefits in terms of hardware deployment and measurement\n   scalability.\n\n\t
