abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPsec, when used with IKE [RFC2409],  provides for authentication
    of\nendpoints from the device level to the user level. However, there has\nbeen
    movement within the IPsec development community to provide\nadditional support
    for legacy user-level authentication mechanisms\nsuch as those supported by RADIUS
    [RFC2138]. At least 2 approaches to\nthis problem have been proposed thus far,
    \ both using the same basic\nunderlying framework, but that underlying framework
    relies upon\nextending IKE in ways that may not be prudent.  This document\nproposes
    an alternative approach which provides much of the same\nfunctionality without
    requiring any modification to the existing\nIPsec framework.\n\t </p>\n      "
