abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a protocol for certificate Enrollment
    over\n   Secure Transport (EST).  EST is a certificate enrollment protocol\n   that
    operates over HTTPS, and thus should be trivially accessible by\n   modern clients.
    \ The Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) \"Simple\n   PKI Request\" and \"Simple
    PKI Response\" messages are leveraged.  EST\n   is designed to be easily implemented
    by clients and servers running\n   other common enrollment mechanisms such as
    Simple Certificate\n   Enrollment Protocol (SCEP).  Renewal and rekey mechanisms
    are\n   described consistent with Certificate Management Protocol (CMP).\n\n\t
