abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC8287] defines the extensions to MPLS LSP Ping and Traceroute for
    Segment Routing IGP-Prefix and IGP-Adjacency Segment Identifier (SIDs) with an
    MPLS data plane. The machinery defined in [RFC8287] works well in single topology,
    single algorithm deployments where each Prefix SID is only associated with a single
    IP prefix. In multi-topology networks, or networks deploying multiple algorithms
    for the same IP Prefix, MPLS echo request needs to carry additional information
    in the Target FEC Stack sub-TLVs to properly validate IGP Prefix SID. This document
    updates [RFC8287] by modifying IPv4 and IPv6 IGP-Prefix Segment ID FEC sub-TLVs
    to also include algorithm identification while maintaining backwards compatibility.
    This document also introduces new Target FEC Stack sub-TLVs for Prefix SID validation
    in multi-topology networks.</p>"
