abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The breadth of IoT applications implies that there will be
    many\n   diverse, administratively independent networks operating in the same\n
    \  physical location.  In many cases, these networks will use unlicensed\n   spectrum,
    due to its low cost and ease of deployment.  However, this\n   spectrum is becoming
    increasingly crowded.  IoT networks will\n   therefore be subject to wireless
    interference, both from similar\n   networks and from networks that use the wireless
    channel in very\n   different ways.\n\n   High-density, heterogeneous wireless
    environments present formidable\n   challenges for network coexistence.  The PHY
    and MAC layers are\n   primarily responsible for managing how radios use the channel.
    \ But\n   higher layer protocols are also a key factor in inter-network\n   interaction.
    \ To date, there have been few performance studies of\n   coexistence in future
    IoT operating environments, particularly with\n   respect to protocol behavior
    and network-scale interactions.\n\n   This document describes key challenges for
    coexistence and highlights\n   some recent research results that demonstrate the
    impact of protocol\n   level interactions on network performance.  It identifies
    both\n   concrete and speculative opportunities for the IRTF T2TRG community.\n
    \  The former include developing and documenting best practices for\n   performance
    evaluation and contributing IoT-related protocols being\n   developed within IETF.
    \ The latter include speculative research into\n   the design of high-layer protocols
    that allow networks to actively\n   coordinate their access to the shared channel.\n\n\t
