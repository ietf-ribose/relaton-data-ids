abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends NFSv4 to allow clients to directly
    access \n   file data on the storage used by the NFSv4 server.  This ability to
    \n   bypass the server for data access can increase both performance and \n   parallelism,
    but requires additional client functionality for data \n   access, some of which
    is dependent on the class of storage used.  The \n   main pNFS operations draft
    specifies storage-class-independent \n   extensions to NFS; this draft specifies
    the additional extensions \n   (primarily data structures) for use of pNFS with
    block and volume \n   based storage. \n\t </p>\n      "
