abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Slicing is one of the core features in 5G.  End-to-end\n
    \  network slice consists of 3 major types of network segments: Access\n   Network
    (AN), Mobile Core Network (CN) and Transport Network (TN).\n   This draft describes
    the procedure of mapping 5G end-to-end network\n   slice to transport network
    slice defined in IETF.  This draft also\n   intends to expose some gaps in the
    existing network management plane\n   and data plane technologies to support inter-domain
    network slice\n   mapping.  Further work may require collaboration between IETF
    and\n   3GPP (or other standard organizations).  Data model specification,\n   signaling
    protocol extension and new encapsulation definition are out\n   of the scope of
    this draft.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
