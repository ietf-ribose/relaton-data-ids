abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides a problem statement for simultaneous mobility\nin
    an infrastructure-based mobility environment.  It considers what\nthe simultaneous
    mobility problem is and describes the conditions\nunder which it may occur.  It
    also illustrates the occurrence of the\nsimultaneous mobility problem in the context
    of different mobility\nprotocols such as Mobile IPv6.  The simultaneous mobility
    problem\ndefined here is strictly applied to scenarios when the intermediary\nnodes
    in the core are not mobile.\n\t </p>\n      "
