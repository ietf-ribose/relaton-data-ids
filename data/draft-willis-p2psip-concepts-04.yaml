abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines concepts and terminology for use of the Session
    Initiation Protocol in a peer-to-peer environment where the traditional proxy-registrar
    function is replaced by a distributed mechanism that might be implemented using
    a distributed hash table or other distributed data mechanism with similar external
    properties. This document includes a high-level view of the functional relationships
    between the network elements defined herein, a conceptual model of operations,
    and an outline of the related open problems that might be addressed by an IETF
    working group.</p>"
