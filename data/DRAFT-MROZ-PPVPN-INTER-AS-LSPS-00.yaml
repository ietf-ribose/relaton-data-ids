abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the usage of the Border Gateway Protocol
    \n(BGP)  to establish Transparent LAN Services (TLS) tunnels across \nAutonomous
    System (AS) boundaries. TLS is described in [MARTINI-\nSIG] and [LASSERRE-TLS].
    The focus of this document is to explain \nhow to achieve the tunnel LSP between
    Provider Edge (PE) routers in \ndifferent ASes. The method described herein may
    also be used in \n[BGP-VPN] implementations.\n\t </p>\n      "
