abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the architecture of a successor to BGP4. The
    problems surrounding inter-domain routing and the BGP protocol have been studied
    within the IETF, the IRTF and elsewhere, but what's required to actually solve
    some of these issues hasn't been explored much. That's what this document tries
    to accomplish.</p>"
