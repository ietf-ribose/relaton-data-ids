abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath TCP currently relies on the exchange of keys in clear\n
    \  during the initial handshake to authenticate the establishment of\n   additional
    subflows.  This document proposes a variant of the\n   Multipath TCP handshake
    that allows Multipath TCP to reuse keys\n   negotiated by the Application layer
    protocol above it such as SSL/TLS\n   to authenticate the establishment of additional
    subflows.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
