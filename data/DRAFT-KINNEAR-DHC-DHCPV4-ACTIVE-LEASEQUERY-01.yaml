abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has
    been\nextended with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to request\ninformation
    about DHCPv4 bindings.  That mechanism is limited to\nqueries for individual bindings.
    \ In some situations individual\nbinding queries may not be efficient, or even
    possible.  In addition,\ncontinuous update of an external client with Leasequery
    data is\nsometimes desired. This document expands on the DHCPv4 Leasequery\nprotocol,
    and allows for active transfer of real-time DHCPv4 address\nbinding information
    data via TCP.\n\t </p>\n      "
