abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of IP-
    based vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The main
    scenarios of vehicular communications are vehicle- to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I), and vehicle-to- everything (V2X) communications. First, this document explains
    use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking. Next, it makes a problem statement
    about key aspects in IP-based vehicular networking, such as IPv6 Neighbor Discovery,
    Mobility Management, and Security &amp; Privacy. For each key aspect, this document
    specifies requirements in IP-based vehicular networking, and suggests the direction
    of solutions satisfying those requirements.</p>"
