abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document identifies foundational use cases, derived functional\n
    \  capabilities and requirements, architectural components, and the\n   supporting
    standards needed to define an interoperable,\n   automation\\infrastructure required
    to support timely, accurate and\n   actionable situational awareness over an organization's
    IT systems.\n   Automation tools implementing a continuous monitoring approach
    will\n   utilize this infrastructure together with existing and emerging\n   event,
    incident and network management standards to provide\n   visibility into the state
    of assets, user activities and network\n   \\behavior.  Stakeholders will be able
    to use these tools to aggregate\n   and analyze relevant security and operational
    data to understand the\n   organizations security posture, quantify business risk,
    and make\n   informed decisions that support organizational objectives while\n
    \  protecting critical information.  Organizations will be able to use\n   these
    tools to augment and automate information sharing activities to\n   collaborate
    with partners to identify and mitigate threats.  Other\n   automation tools will
    be able to integrate with these capabilities to\n   enforce policies based on
    human decisions to harden systems, prevent\n   misuse and reduce the overall attack
    surface.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
