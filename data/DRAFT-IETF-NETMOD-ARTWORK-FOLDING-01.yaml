abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a simple and yet time-proven strategy
    for\n   handling long lines in inclusions in drafts using a backslash ('\\')\n
    \  character where line-folding has occurred.  The strategy works on any\n   text-based
    content, but is primarily intended for a structured\n   sequence of lines, such
    as would be referenced by the &lt;sourcecode&gt;\n   element defined in Section
    2.48 of RFC 7991, rather than for two-\n   dimensional imagery, such as would
    be referenced by the &lt;artwork&gt;\n   element defined in Section 2.5 of RFC
    7991.  The approach produces\n   consistent results, regardless of the content,
    that is both self-\n   documenting and enables automated reconstitution of the
    original\n   content.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
