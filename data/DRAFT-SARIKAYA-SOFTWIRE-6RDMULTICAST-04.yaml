abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies 6rd's multicast component so that IPv6
    hosts can\n   receive multicast data from IPv6 servers.  In 6rd encapsulation\n
    \  solution, multicast communication is completely integrated into 6rd\n   tunnel.
    6rd Customer Edge router is extended with Multicast Listener\n   Discovery (MLD)
    protocol Proxy entity.  MLD Proxy receives join\n   requests from 6rd IPv6 hosts
    and sends them upstream in 6rd's IPv4 in\n   IPv6 tunnel to 6rd Border Relay (BR).
    \ This tunnel is used to\n   exchange MLD messages to establish multicast state
    at 6rd BR so that\n   6rd BR can use 6rd's IPv4 in IPv6 tunnel to send IPv6 multicast
    data\n   to 6rd CEs.  At the CEs, multicast data is decapsulated and MLD Proxy\n
    \  delivers it to IPv6 hosts based on MLD group membership state.  In\n   6rd
    Translation Multicast based solution, the protocol is based on\n   proxying MLD
    at the 6rd Customer Edge router and then translating MLD\n   messages to IGMP
    messages and sending them upstream to a network\n   which supports IPv4 multicast.
    6rd Border Relay is multicast router\n   and IGMP-MLD translator.  It translates
    IGMP join back to MLD join\n   message and sends it to multicast source.  IPv6
    Multicast data\n   received at 6rd Border Relay is translated into IPv4 multicast
    data\n   and then sent to IPv4 multicast tree downstream to 6rd Customer Edge\n
    \  which translates back to IPv6 multicast data then delivers to the\n   hosts.\n\n\t
