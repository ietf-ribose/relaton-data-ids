abstract:
  content: "<p>This document clarifies the semantics associated with the Content-RangeHTTP
    header and associated Partial Content (206) response code.It specifically allows
    a server to produce a Content-Range responsewhose range is a subrange of the corresponding
    range requested using aprevious Range request. The HTTP protocol syntax is not
    modified.Instead, this document clarifies that a server responding to a clientrequesting
    a range (x-y) may respond with a range ((x+e)-(y-f)) fornonzero integers e,f such
    that (x+e) &lt; (y-f). In addition, it clarifiesthe semantics of Request ranges
    which contain only a starting value.</p>"
