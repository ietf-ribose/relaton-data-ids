abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. RFC 6374
    specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate measurement
    of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as related metrics such as
    delay variation in MPLS networks. This document utilizes these mechanisms for
    Performance Delay and Loss Measurements in SR networks with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS),
    for both SR-MPLS links and end-to-end SR-MPLS paths including Policies. In addition,
    this document defines Return Path TLV and Block Number TLV extensions for RFC
    6374.</p>"
