abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 2141bis formalizes the concept of Uniform Resource Names (URNs)
    for persistent, location-independent, resource identifiers within the generic
    URI system specified in RFC 3986. To structure and organize URN usage, RFC 2141bis
    specifies a hierarchy that divides the set of possible URNs into "URN Namespaces"
    that can be individually defined and managed. URN Namespaces allow to map existing
    identifier systems into the URN scheme and thereby make available generic, network-based
    resolution services for the identified resources (documents, artifacts, and other
    objects) and metadata related to them. To this end, URN Namespaces need to be
    defined and specified in a comparable manner, and their Namespace Identifiers
    (NIDs) need to be registered with IANA, so that naming conflicts are avoided and
    implementers of services can follow a structured approach in support of various
    namespaces, guided by the registry to the related documents and the particularities
    of specific namespaces, as described in these Namespace registration documents.
    This RFC serves as a design guideline for stakeholders of URN Namespaces and authors
    of URN Namespace definition and registration documents. It describes the process
    to be followed to register a URN Namespace with IANA and the essential content
    of such documents. This document supersedes and replaces RFC 3406.</p>
