abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Within the Domain Name System, several names have been reserved
    or\nused for special purposes, some at the top level and some at other\nlevels.
    \ IANA registries of Reserved and Special Names can reduce the\nlikelihood of
    conflict of names and the consequent ambiguity.  This\nspecification establishes
    those registries.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft is submitted to
