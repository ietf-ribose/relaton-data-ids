abstract:
  content: <p>RFC5648 extends MIPv6 with the ability for a Mobile Node to registerMultiple
    Care-of Addresses with its Home Agent and CorrespondentNode(s). RFC 5648 also
    introduces the notion of a Home Binding thatis essentially a binding on the Home
    Link, where the Care-of Addressis set to the Home Address of the Mobile Node.
    A Mobile Node usessuch a Home Binding together with one or more Multiple Care-ofAddress
    binding(s) to be able to use simultaneously both the HomeLink and one or more
    visited link(s). The description of the HomeBinding in a section of RFC 5846 entitled
    "Returning Home:Simultaneous Home and Visited Link Operation" seems to imply that
    aHome Binding can only be legitimately created while returning homeand maintaining
    simultaneous bindings on one or more visited link(s).There is however no specific
    reason to prevent creation of such aHome Binding when the Mobile Node is only
    attached to the Home Linkand does not have any interface attached to a visited
    link.Moreover, there is a specific use case for the creation of such aLone Home
    Binding. This specification explicits the use case forcreation of a Lone Home
    Binding, and clarifies the protocol behaviorof Mobile IPv6 nodes (Mobile Node,
    Home Agent, Correspondent Node)involved with its creation.</p>
