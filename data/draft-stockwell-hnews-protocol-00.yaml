abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines HNEWS (HTTP News Protocol), an HTTP-tunnelingnews
    protocol. The NNTP(Network News Transfer Protocol) protocoldescribed in RFC 977
    is recast as HTTP CGI (Common Gateway Interface)requests that may be filled by
    any server that supports CGI. Two newcommands are defined for connecting and disconnecting
    from an HNEWSserver. Also, a mechanism for session state management is described.This
    document assumes that you have a working knowledge of the CommonGateway Interface
    [2] for running executable content on a web server andsome familiarity with the
    NNTP news protocol [1].A new URL scheme has also been specified for HNEWS and
    is described ina separate document [5].</p>"
