abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes syslog-international, a mechanism addingsupport
    for international character sets to syslog.Syslog-international provides these
    features in a way that has norequirements and no impact on existing syslog implementations.
    It ispossible to support syslog-international and gain some of itsfunctionality
    by only changing the behavior of the devices generatingsyslog messages. Some additional
    processing of the received syslogmessages may realize additional benefits. There
    is no need to changesyslog relays in order to support syslog-international. Existingsyslog
    implementations will benefit from the fact thatsyslog-international supporting
    devices emit proper syslog messagesin all cases. It is common practice for many
    non-syslog-internationalclients to accidently emit 8 bit characters if used in
    e.g. Europeanlanguage environments. Syslog-international just adds a protocollayer
    to the MSG part of the syslog message. As such, it iscompatible with all existing
    and future implementations of syslog.</p>"
