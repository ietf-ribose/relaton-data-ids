abstract:
- content: "<p>There is not currently any standardized method of dealing with distributed
    or other large scale threats other than individual firewall and/or null routing
    instructions. This Internet Draft describes an optional BGP Capability (as defined
    by RFC 5492) that allowed Autonomous Systems to self-censor utilizing the existing
    Inter-Domain Routing system. This capability does not add any automatic actions
    and must be explicitly activated by an administrator.</p>"
