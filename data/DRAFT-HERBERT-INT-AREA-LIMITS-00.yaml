abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification provides guidance for limiting the size
    of\n   protocol headers in packets. Intermediate nodes that perform deep\n   packet
    inspection (DPI), particularly hardware implementations, are\n   often limited
    as to how many bytes of protocol headers they can\n   process. We recommend that
    256 bytes be established as the minimum\n   number of bytes of headers that intermediate
    nodes are expected to be\n   able to process. This limit is explicitly not intended
    to be a\n   standard requirement, however it can be used as a guideline in\n   hardware
    design, protocol design, as well as a useful constraint in\n   implementation
    or configuration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
