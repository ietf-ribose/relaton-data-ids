abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents a new method for the detection of increases\nin
    PMTU using the newly defined Hop-by-Hop option header.\nTo detect increases in
    a path's PMTU, a node does not increase its \nassumed PMTU unconditionally without
    considering network status, \nbut measures its real PMTU, and then replaces the
    previous PMTU with \nnew one. To measure node's real PMTU, the node sends the
    IP packet\nwith the newly defined Hop-by-Hop option header to the destination
    \nnode right before a timer expires. This can eliminate the chance of \noccurrence
    of packets being discarded and Packet Too Big messages \nbeing generated.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
