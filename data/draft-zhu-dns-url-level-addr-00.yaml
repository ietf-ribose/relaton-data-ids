abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Recently there are a number of efforts [sw1, sw2, in,tpc, etc.]
    of trying toconnect the packet-switching network with circuit-switching network,
    especiallyconnecting the Internet with public telephone networks. The first problemof
    such interconnection is naming and addressing, later will come withdirectory services
    and routing problems. This draft concentrates onnaming for DNS and URL. Other
    problems are discussed in other documents[utrpt, framework].</p>"
