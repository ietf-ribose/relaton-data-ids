abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a scheme for overlapped block motion\n
    \  compensation that could be incorporated into a next-generation video\n   codec.
    \ The scheme described is that currently used by Xiph's Daala\n   project, which
    supports variable block sizes without introducing any\n   discontinuities at block
    boundaries.  This makes the scheme suitable\n   for use with lapped transforms
    or other techniques where encoding\n   such discontinuities is expensive.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
