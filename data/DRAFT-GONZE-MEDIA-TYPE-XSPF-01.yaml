abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a new media type for the XML Shareable Playlist\nFormat
    (XSPF, pronounced like \"spiff\").  XSPF allows playlists to be\nexchanged between
    different software, across networks and across\nadministrative boundaries.  A
    media type registration enhances\nshareability.\n\nAn XSPF playlist describes
    a sequence of objects to be rendered in\ntime.  Objects might be audio, video,
    text, playlists, or any other\nmedia type with an inherent duration.  The function
    of an XSPF\ndocument is to identify the objects and communicate their order.\n\n\t
