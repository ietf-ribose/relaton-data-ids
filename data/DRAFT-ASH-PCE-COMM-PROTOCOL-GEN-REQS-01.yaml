abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block
    for\n   traffic engineering systems such as multiprotocol label switching\n   (MPLS)
    and generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS)\n   networks.  Path computation
    in large, multi-domain or multi-layer\n   networks is highly complex and may require
    special computational\n   components and cooperation between the different network
    domains.\n\n   There are multiple components in the Path Computation Element (PCE)-\n
    \  based path computation model, including PCE discovery and the PCE\n   communication
    protocol.  The PCE model is described in the \"PCE\n   Architecture\" document
    and facilitates path computation requests from\n   Path Computation Clients (PCCs)
    to PCEs.  This document specifies\n   generic requirements for a communication
    protocol between PCCs and\n   PCEs, and between PCEs where cooperation between
    PCEs is desirable.\n   Subsequent documents will specify application-specific
    requirements\n   for the PCE communication protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
