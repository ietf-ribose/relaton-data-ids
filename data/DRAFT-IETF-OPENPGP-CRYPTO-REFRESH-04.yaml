abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   { Work in progress to update the OpenPGP specification from
    RFC4880 }\n\n   This document specifies the message formats used in OpenPGP.  OpenPGP\n
    \  provides encryption with public-key or symmetric cryptographic\n   algorithms,
    digital signatures, compression and key management.\n\n   This document is maintained
    in order to publish all necessary\n   information needed to develop interoperable
    applications based on the\n   OpenPGP format.  It is not a step-by-step cookbook
    for writing an\n   application.  It describes only the format and methods needed
    to\n   read, check, generate, and write conforming packets crossing any\n   network.
    \ It does not deal with storage and implementation questions.\n   It does, however,
    discuss implementation issues necessary to avoid\n   security flaws.\n\n\t </p>\n
