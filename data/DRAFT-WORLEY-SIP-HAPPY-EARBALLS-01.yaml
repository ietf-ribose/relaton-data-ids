abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TBD: The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports multiple\n
    \  transports running both over IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.  In more and\n   more
    cases, a SIP user agent (UA) is connected to network interfaces\n   with multiple
    address families.  In these cases sending a message\n   from a dual stack client
    to a dual stack server may suffer from the\n   issues described in [RFC6555] (\"Happy
    Eyeballs\"): the UA attempts to\n   send the message using IPv6, but IPv6 connectivity
    is not working to\n   the server.  This can cause significant delays in the process
    of\n   sending the message to the server.  This negatively affects the\n   user's
    experience.\n\n   TBD: This document builds on [RFC6555] by modifying the procedures\n
    \  specified in [RFC3263] and related specifications to require that a\n   client
    ensure that communication targets are accessible before\n   sending messages to
    them, to allow a client to contact targets out of\n   the order required by other
    specifications, and to require a client\n   to properly distribute the message
    load among targets over time.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
