abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a possible alternative solution for
    handling\n   applied configuration state in YANG as described in draft-openconfig-\n
    \  netmod-opstate-01.  The proposed solution, roughly modelled on the\n   with-defaults
    NETCONF/RESTCONF capability, aims to meet the key\n   requirements set out in
    draft-ietf-netmod-opstate-reqs-01 without the\n   need for YANG module authors
    to explicitly duplicate configuration\n   nodes in both configuration and operational
    containers.  This draft\n   does not address the issue of co-location of configuration
    and\n   operational state for interfaces, nor does it provide a NETCONF\n   mechanism
    to retrieve operational data separately from configuration\n   data.\n\n\t </p>\n
