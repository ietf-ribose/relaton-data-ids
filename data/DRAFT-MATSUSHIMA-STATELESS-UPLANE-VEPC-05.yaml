abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We envision a new mobile architecture for the future Evolved
    Packet\n   Core (EPC).  The new architecture is designed to support the\n   virtualization
    scheme called NFV (Network Function Virtualization).\n   In our architecture,
    the user plane of EPC is decoupled from the\n   control-plane and uses routing
    information to forward packets of\n   mobile nodes.  Although the EPC control
    plane will run on hypervisor,\n   our proposal does not modify the signaling of
    the EPC control plane.\n   The benefits of our architecture are 1) scalability,
    2) flexibility\n   and 3) Manageability.  How to run the EPC control plane on
    NFV is out\n   of our focus in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
