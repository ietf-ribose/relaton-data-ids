abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a metric for one path congestion across Internet
    paths. The traditional mode evaluates network congestion based on the bandwidth
    utilization of the link. However, there is a lack of E2E path congestion that
    is truly service oriented. So A Path Congestion Metric is required.</p>"
