abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo discusses the relationship between the packet sampling (PSAMP)
    Working Group and the IP flow information export (IPFIX) Working Group. The goals
    of writing this memo are: avoiding duplication of work, increase mutual benefits
    between the groups, and harmonize the documents and standards developed by the
    groups. Therefore, potential overlap of both group's activities is analyzed, activities
    in both groups that potentially complement each other are pointed out, and common
    issues are listed that should be harmonized between the groups.</p>"
