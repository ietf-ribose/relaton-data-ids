abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing allows a node to steer a packet through an
    ordered\n   list of instructions, called segments.  The ingress node prepends
    a\n   SR header to a packet containing a set of \"segments\".  A segment can\n
    \  represent any instruction topological or service-based.  Segment\n   Routing
    can be applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of\n   routing extension
    header.  A segment is encoded as an IPv6 address.\n   An ordered list of segments
    is encoded as an ordered list of IPv6\n   addresses in the routing extension header.
    \ The segment to process is\n   indicated by a pointer in the routing extension
    header.  Upon\n   completion of a segment, the pointer is incremented.  This document\n
    \  describes how to decrease the length of the IPv6 list with ListID\n   carried.\n\n\t
