abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo documents a proposal for exchanging EPP (Extensible\nProvisioning
    Protocol) messages as XML documents between a client and\na server via SOAP (Simple
    Object Access Protocol), using the SOAP\nrequest/response communication model.
    An EPP message is encapsulated\nin the SOAP Body, while the EPP session information
    is encoded in the\nSOAP header, enabling EPP session-oriented messaging over the
    SOAP\nprotocol. It is designed to work on top of any transport bindings\ndefined
    for SOAP, taking advantage of the variety of SOAP software\ntools and environments
    available for web services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
