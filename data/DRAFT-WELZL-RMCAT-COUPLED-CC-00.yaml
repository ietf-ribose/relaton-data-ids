abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When multiple congestion controlled RTP sessions traverse the
    same\n   network bottleneck, it can be beneficial to combine their controls\n
    \  such that the total on-the-wire behavior is improved.  This document\n   describes
    such a method for flows that have the same sender, in a way\n   that is as flexible
    and simple as possible while minimizing the\n   amount of changes needed to existing
    RTP applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
