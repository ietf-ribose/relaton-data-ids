abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an OSPF Link-Local-Signaling (LLS) TLV to signal
    the current Geo Coordinates of the OSPF router. For Point-to- Point (P2)) and
    Point-to-Multi-Point (P2MP) networks, the Geo Coordinates can be used to dynamically
    computing the cost to neighbors. This is useful both from the standpoint of auto-
    configuration and situations where the OSPF routers are moving. The Geo Coordinates
    are also useful for other applications such as Traffic Engineering (TE) and network
    management and can be advertised in the OSPF Router Information (RI) LSA.</p>"
