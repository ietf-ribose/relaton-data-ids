abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes a private extension to SIP in the form of
    a\nP-Called-Party-ID header. A proxy inserts this header typically in an\nINVITE,
    en-route to its destination. The header is populated with the\nRequest-URI received
    by the proxy in the request. The UAS identifies\nwhich ID out of several IDs the
    invitation was sent to (for example,\nthe user may be using simultaneously a personal
    and a business SIP URI\nto receive invitation to sessions). The UAS may use the
    information to\nrender different distinctive audiovisual alerting tones, depending
    on\nthe ID used to receive the invitation to the session.\n\t </p>\n      "
