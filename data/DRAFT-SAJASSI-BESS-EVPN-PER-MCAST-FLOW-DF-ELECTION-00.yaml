abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RFC7432] describes mechanism to elect designated forwarder
    (DF) at\n   the granularity of (ESI, EVI) which is per VLAN (or per group of\n
    \  VLANs in case of VLAN bundle or VLAN-aware bundle service).  However,\n   the
    current level of granularity of per-VLAN is not adequate for some\n   of applications.
    \ [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-ac-df] and\n   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-df-election] improves
    base line DF election.\n   This document is an extension to HRW base drafts\n
    \  ([I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-ac-df] and [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-df-election]) and\n   further
    enhances HRW algorithm to do DF election at the granularity\n   of (ESI, VLAN,
    Mcast flow).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
