abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document reports on experience and simulations of dynamic\n
    \  probing of alternate paths between two IPv6 hosts when network\n   failures
    occur.  Two models for such probing were investigated: the\n   Shim6 REAchability
    Protocol (REAP) and the Multipath Transmission\n   Control Protocol (MPTCP).  The
    motivation for this document is to\n   identify some aspects of path probing at
    large or very large scale\n   that may be broadly relevant to future protocol
    design.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
