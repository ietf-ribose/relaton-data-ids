abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate\n
    \  addresses using a combination of locally available information and\n   information
    advertised by routers.  Addresses are formed by combining\n   network prefixes
    with an interface identifier.  This document\n   describes an extension that causes
    nodes to generate global scope\n   addresses from interface identifiers that change
    over time.  Changing\n   the interface identifier (and the global scope addresses
    generated\n   from it) over time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and\n
    \  other information collectors to identify when different addresses\n   used
    in different transactions actually correspond to the same node.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
