abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a standard format and a standard navigation\nmechanism
    so that mail stores can provide interoperable access to\nmailboxes and messages
    over HTTP.  Mailbox contents and listings of\nmailboxes are exposed as Atom Feeds,
    while messages themselves are\ndownloaded as a document of type message/822.  Each
    mailbox and each\nmessage is assigned an HTTP URL, and if permissions checks are\nsatisfied,
    each message may be downloaded independently.\n\t </p>\n      "
