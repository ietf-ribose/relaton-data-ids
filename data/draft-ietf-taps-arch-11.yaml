abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for exposing transport protocol
    features to applications for network communication, the Transport Services architecture.
    The Transport Services Application Programming Interface (API) is based on an
    asynchronous, event-driven interaction pattern. It uses messages for representing
    data transfer to applications, and it describes how implementations can use multiple
    IP addresses, multiple protocols, and multiple paths, and provide multiple application
    streams. This document further defines common terminology and concepts to be used
    in definitions of Transport Services APIs and implementations.</p>"
