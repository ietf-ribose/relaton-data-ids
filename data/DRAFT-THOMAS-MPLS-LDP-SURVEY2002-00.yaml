abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a method for forwarding\n
    \  packets that uses short, fixed-length values carried by packets,\n   called
    labels, to determine packet nexthops [RFC3031]).  A\n   fundamental concept in
    MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers\n   (LSRs) must agree on the meaning
    of the labels used to forward\n   traffic between and through them.  This common
    understanding is\n   achieved by using a set of procedures, called a label distribution\n
    \  protocol, by which one LSR informs another of label bindings it has\n   made.
    \ One such protocol called LDP [RFC3036] is used by LSRs to\n   distribute labels
    to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed\n   paths.  This document reports
    on a survey of LDP implementations\n   conducted in August 2002 as part of the
    process of advancing LDP from\n   proposed to draft standard.\n\t </p>\n      "
