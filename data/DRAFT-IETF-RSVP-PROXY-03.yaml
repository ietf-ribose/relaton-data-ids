abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RSVP has been extended in several directions [POLICY], [RSVP-APPID],\n[DCLASS],
    [AGGRRSVP], [RSVPDIFF]. These extensions have broadened the\napplicability of
    RSVP characterizing it as a signaling protocol\nusable both inside and outside
    the Integrated Services [INTSERV]\nmodel.\nWith the addition of the 'Null Service
    Type' [NULLSERV], RSVP is\nalso being adopted by mission critical applications
    that require some\nform of prioritized service, but cannot quantify their resource\nrequirements.
    In cases where RSVP cannot travel end-to-end, these\napplications may still benefit
    from reservations that are not truly\nend-to-end, but that are 'proxied' by a
    network node on the data path\nbetween the sender and the receiver(s).  \nRSVP
    Receiver Proxy is an extension to the RSVP message processing\n(not to the protocol
    itself) in which an intermediate network node\noriginates the Resv message on
    behalf of the receiver(s) identified\nby the Path message.\n\t </p>\n      "
