abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a new approach for network\n
    \  programmability.  Network programmability refers to the ability to\n   control,
    change, and manage network behavior dynamically through\n   software via open
    interfaces as opposed to relying on closed boxes\n   and propietary defined interfaces.
    \ SDN introduces an abstraction for\n   the data forwarding plane and by doing
    so separates it from the\n   control plane.  This separation allows faster innovation
    cycles at\n   both planes as experience has already shown.  However, there is\n
    \  increasing confusion as to what exactly SDN is, what is the layer\n   structure
    in an SDN architecture and how do layers interface with\n   each other.  This
    document does not aim to standardize any layers or\n   interfaces but rather aims
    to answer these questions and provide a\n   concise reference document for SDNRG
    in particular and the SDN\n   community in general.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
