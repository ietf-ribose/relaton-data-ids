abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) has no inherent capability to protect
    the privacy of end users. The data associated with DNS queries and responses can
    be observed by intermediate systems, and such observations could provide a source
    of metadata relating to end user behaviour. This document describes an approach
    which separates the data in DNS queries and responses from the identity of the
    DNS resolver used by DNS clients. This approach does not address privacy concerns
    between a stub resolver and a recursive resolver. This approach imposes no requirement
    for modification of authority servers, and does not depend upon widespread deployment
    of DNSSEC signing or validation.</p>"
