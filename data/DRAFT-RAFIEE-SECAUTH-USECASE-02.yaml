abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document aims to explain the requirement and usecases
    for\n   reducing reliability gaps in first point of contact during secure\n   authentication
    of nodes without the need of any CA. It focuses on use\n   of network layer security
    approaches for this purpose. Privacy\n   requirement is also one of the important
    topic that will be addressed\n   in this draft. It also discusses the requirements
    and use cases for\n   having a common language (protocols) for authentication/authorization\n
    \  in visualization environments where Software Defined Network (SDN) or\n   Network
    Function Visualization (NFV) approaches are in use.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
