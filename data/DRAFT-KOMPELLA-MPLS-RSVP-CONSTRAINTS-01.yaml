abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Constraint-based routing is the computation of a path through
    a\nnetwork that satisfies some constraints.  Typically, some device A\nobtains
    the constraints (perhaps through configuration), and also\nknows the network topology
    and resources, and thereby computes the\npath.  However, in certain cases, the
    device A that knows the\nconstraints cannot compute the full path.  In such cases,
    it is\nuseful for A to be able to communicate the constraints to some other\ndevice
    B that can carry out or complete the computation, and\nmoreover, to communicate
    these constraints in an extensible,\ninteroperable fashion, and such that A's
    semantics are understood by\nB.  This document suggests one such means of constraint\ncommunication:
    use a signalling mechanism (such as RSVP) for carrying\nthe constraints, and carry
    the constraints as a program.\n\t </p>\n      "
