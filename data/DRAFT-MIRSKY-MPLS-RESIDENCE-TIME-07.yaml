abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies G-ACh based Residence Time Measurement
    and\n   how it can be used by time synchronization protocols being\n   transported
    over MPLS domain.\n\n   Residence time is the variable part of propagation delay
    of timing\n   and synchronization messages and knowing what this delay is for
    each\n   message allows for a more accurate determination of the delay to be\n
    \  taken into account in applying the value included in a PTP event\n   message.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
