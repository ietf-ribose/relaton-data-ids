abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC6265 by removing the ability for a
    non-\n   secure origin to set cookies with a 'secure' flag, and to overwrite\n
    \  cookies whose 'secure' flag is set.  This deprecation improves the\n   isolation
    between HTTP and HTTPS origins, and reduces the risk of\n   malicious interference.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
