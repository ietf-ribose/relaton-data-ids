abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft aims to illustrate possible approaches to make network\n
    \  management and operations more autonomic in several aspects.  The\n   ultimate
    goal is that the network could run all by itself, so that\n   users/administrators
    just feel like there isn't a network to take\n   care of at all (a.k.a.  \"Networkless\").
    \ The approaches are described\n   in a form of different levels (inspired by
    the Self-Driven Car\n   levels).  The higher the level is, the more autonomic
    management\n   capabilities the network could have.\n\n   Please note that although
    some specific technologies are categorized\n   into different levels, it is not
    the draft's intent to rank them;\n   rather, this draft is more about discussing
    what's the possible next\n   stage and what's the ultimate vision.  Hopefully,
    this draft could\n   collect people's consensus in the industry and provide guidance
    for\n   future technology developments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
