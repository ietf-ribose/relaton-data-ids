abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the scenarios, simulation and suggestions for
    the "Centrally Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR)" architecture, which integrates
    the merit of traditional distributed protocols (IGP/BGP), and the power of centrally
    control technologies (PCE/SDN) to provide one feasible traffic engineering solution
    in various complex scenarios for the service provider. Traditional MPLS-TE solution
    is mainly used in static network planning scenario and is difficult to meet the
    QoS assurance requirements in real-time traffic network. With the emerge of SDN
    concept and related technologies, it is possible to simplify the complexity of
    distributed control protocol, utilize the global view of network condition, give
    more efficient solution for traffic engineering in various complex scenarios.</p>
