abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>During the last few years, a number of proposals for\nextensions
    or improvements to email have run into trouble with a\nside-effect of mail relaying.
    \ In the current Internet Mail model, every SMTP server is required to break strict
    layering by inserting one or more additional 'trace' headers into the message
    headers which are actually part of the SMTP payload.  Since the headers are\naltered
    in transit, header-signing is not an available option, various\nanti-spam and
    internationalization strategies are infeasible or much\nmore complex, and so on.
    \ This document proposes to change the\nInternet mail model to place the in-transit
    trace information in the\nenvelope, removing the requirement that relaying systems
    modify the\nmessage payload.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
