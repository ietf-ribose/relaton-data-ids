abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node to connect to the same
    Proxy\n   Mobile IPv6 domain through different interfaces.  This document\n   describes
    extensions to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol that are\n   required to support
    network based flow mobility over multiple\n   physical interfaces.\n\n   The extensions
    described in this document consist on the operations\n   performed by the local
    mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway\n   to manage the prefixes assigned
    to the different interfaces of the\n   mobile node, as well as how the forwarding
    policies are handled by\n   the network to ensure consistent flow mobility management.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
