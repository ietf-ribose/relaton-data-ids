abstract:
  content: "<p>This document presents a framework in which gateways (points ofinterconnection
    between the Public Switched Telephone Network andInternet-based telephone systems)
    register themselves with a locationservice in order to communicate their own availability
    and theavailability of the resources and services they provide. Unlikeprevious
    approaches to this problem, this document considers trunkgroups as a resource
    which gateways register.</p>"
