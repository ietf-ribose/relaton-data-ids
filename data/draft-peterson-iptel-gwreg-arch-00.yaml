abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a framework in which gateways (points of interconnection
    between the Public Switched Telephone Network and Internet-based telephone systems)
    register themselves with a location service in order to communicate their own
    availability and the availability of the resources and services they provide.
    Unlike previous approaches to this problem, this document considers trunk groups
    as a resource which gateways register.</p>"
