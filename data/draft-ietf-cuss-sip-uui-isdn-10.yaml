abstract:
- content: <p>The motivation and use cases for interworking and transporting ITU-T
    DSS1 User to User information element data in SIP are described in RFC 6567. As
    networks move to SIP, it is important that applications requiring this data can
    continue to function in SIP networks as well as the ability to interwork with
    this ISDN service for end-to-end transparency. This document defines a usage (a
    new package) of the User-to-User header field to enable interworking with this
    ISDN service. This document covers the interworking with both public ISDN and
    private ISDN capabilities, so the potential interworking with QSIG will also be
    addressed. The package is identified by a new value "isdn-uui" of the "purpose"
    header field parameter.</p>
