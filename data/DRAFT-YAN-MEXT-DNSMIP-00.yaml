abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       In order to update the DNS (Domain Name System)[1] resource
    records\n       (RRs) for the node when its name or address changes, the DDNS\n
    \      (Dynamic DNS) protocol[2] has been standardized as an extension of\n       basic
    DNS protocol. Then the security DDNS scheme[3] was proposed to\n       enhance
    the security of DDNS. Based on these two protocols, the DNS\n       update can
    be used in many scenarios, for example in the DHCP\n       (Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol)[4] deployed environment.\n\n       Based on these specifications, this
    document defines the extension\n       in MIPv6 (Mobile IPv6)[5] to achieve DNS
    update for the named MN\n       (Mobile Node). Specifically speaking, the FQND
    Option defined in the\n       RFC4704[6] is included in the MIPv6 BU (Binding
    Update) signaling\n       message. Then the PTR RR or AAAA and PTR RRs may be
    updated by the\n       HA (Home Agent) when the HoA (Home Address) or name of
    MN changes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
