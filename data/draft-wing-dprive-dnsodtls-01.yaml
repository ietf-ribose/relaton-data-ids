abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS queries and responses are visible to network elements on the path
    between the DNS client and its server. These queries and responses can contain
    privacy-sensitive information which is valuable to protect. An active attacker
    can send bogus responses causing misdirection of the subsequent connection. To
    counter passive listening and active attacks, this document proposes the use of
    Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for DNS, to protect against passive listeners
    and certain active attacks. As DNS needs to remain fast, this proposal also discusses
    mechanisms to reduce DTLS round trips and reduce DTLS handshake size. The proposed
    mechanism runs over the default DNS port and can also run over an alternate port.</p>"
