abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   QUIC does not provide a complete version negotiation mechanism
    but\n   instead only provides a way for the server to indicate that the\n   version
    the client offered is unacceptable.  This document describes\n   a version negotiation
    mechanism that allows a client and server to\n   select a mutually supported version.
    \ Optionally, if the original and\n   negotiated version share a compatible first
    flight format, the\n   negotiation can take place without incurring an extra round
    trip.\n\n   Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF\n
    \  mailing list quic@ietf.org (mailto:quic@ietf.org) or on the GitHub\n   repository
    which contains the draft: https://github.com/quicwg/\n   version-negotiation/
    (https://github.com/quicwg/version-\n   negotiation/).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
