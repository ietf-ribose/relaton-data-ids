abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a design for an
    HTTP\n   authentication method with credentials that are not vulnerable to\n   phishing
    attacks, and that does not require a server-side password\n   database.  The design
    can also be used in Javascript-based\n   authentication embedded in HTML.  HOBA
    is an alternative to HTTP\n   authentication schemes that require passwords with
    all the negative\n   attributes that come with password-based systems.  HOBA can
    be\n   integrated with account management and other applications running\n   over
    HTTP and supports portability, so a user can associate more than\n   one device
    or origin-bound key with the same service.  We also\n   describe a way in which
    the HOBA design can be used from a Javascript\n   web client.  When deployed,
    HOBA will be a drop-in replacement for\n   password-based HTTP authentication
    or JavaScript authentication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
