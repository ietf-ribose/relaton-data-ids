abstract:
- content: <p>The rise in frequency, volume, and pernicious effects of DDoS attacks
    has elevated them from fare for the specialist to generalist press. Numerous reports
    detail the taxonomy of DDoS types, the varying motivations of their attackers,
    as well as the resulting business and reputation loss of their targets. BGP FlowSpec
    (RFC 5575, "Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules") can be used to rapidly
    disseminate filters that thwart attacks, being particularly effective against
    the volumetric type. Operators can use existing FlowSpec components to match on
    pre-defined packet header fields. However recent enhancements to forwarding plane
    filter implementations allow matches at arbitary locations within the packet header
    and, to some extent, the payload. This capability can be used to detect highly
    amplified attacks, whose attack signature remains relatively constant. We define
    a new FlowSpec component, "Flexible Match Conditions", with similar matching semantics
    to those of existing components. This component will allow the operator to define
    bounded match conditions using offsets and bitmasks.</p>
