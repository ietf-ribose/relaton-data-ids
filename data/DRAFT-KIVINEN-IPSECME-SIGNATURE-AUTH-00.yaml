abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has limited\n
    \  support for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).\n   The
    current support only includes support for three Elliptic Curve\n   groups, and
    there is fixed hash algorithm tied to each curve.  This\n   document generalizes
    the IKEv2 signature support so it can support\n   any signature method supported
    by the PKIX and also adds signature\n   hash algorithm negotiation.  This generic
    mechanism is not limited to\n   ECDSA, but can also be used with other signature
    algorithms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
