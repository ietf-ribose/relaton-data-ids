abstract:
  content: "\t <t>As the work in the NSIS working has begun to describe requirements
    and the framework people started thinking about possible security implication.
    This document should provide a starting point for the discussion at the NSIS working
    group mailing list regarding the security issues that have to be addressed by
    a protocol or within the framework. This document does not describe vulnerabilities
    of a particular protocol or threats of published NSIS framework proposals. This
    memo is furthermore meant to create awareness for security issues within the NSIS
    group. Security requirements related to the threat scenarios are described in
    [1].</p>"
