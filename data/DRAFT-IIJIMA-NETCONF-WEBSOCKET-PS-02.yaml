abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo proposes a way of transporting NETCONF over WebSocket\n
    \  protocol.  Web-based applications are increasing with the advancement\n   of
    Web technologies and emergence of cloud computing.  Management\n   systems that
    support browser-based interface are getting common.\n   It's natural to expect
    network devices to have browser-based\n   managemaent interface.  Currently, however,
    few network management\n   protocols support the transportation over HTTP.  Although\n
    \  NETCONF[RFC6241] was defined to be sent over SOAP/HTTPS[RFC4743], it\n   can
    not realize notification mechanism[RFC5277] over SOAP/HTTPS since\n   HTTP lacks
    bi-directional capabilty.  But now, WebSocket protocol,\n   the update of HTTP
    with bi-directional capability, is\n   available[RFC6455].  This memo describes
    the way NETCONF is sent over\n   WebSocket protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
