abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Software Defined Networking proposes the separation of the
    control\n   plane from the data plane in the network nodes and its logical\n   centralization
    on a control entity.  Most of the network intelligence\n   is moved to this functional
    entity.  Typically, such entity is seen\n   as a compendium of interacting control
    functions in a vertical, tight\n   integrated fashion.  The relocation of the
    control functions from a\n   number of distributed network nodes to a logical
    central entity\n   conceptually places together a number of control capabilities
    with\n   different purposes.  As a consequence, the existing solutions do not\n
    \  provide a clear separation between transport control and services\n   that
    relies upon transport capabilities.\n\n   This document describes a proposal named
    Cooperating Layered\n   Architecture for SDN.  The idea behind that is to differentiate
    the\n   control functions associated to transport from those related to\n   services,
    in such a way that they can be provided and maintained\n   independently, and
    can follow their own evolution path.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
