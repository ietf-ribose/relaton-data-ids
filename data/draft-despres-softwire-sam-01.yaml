abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Stateless Address Mapping (SAM) is a generic mechanism to statelesslyestablish
    tunnels, point-to-multipoint, for packets of an addressfamily that traverse domains
    whose routing is in another addressfamily (mesh softwires). It extends tunneling
    principles of [6rd] toother address-family combination than IPv6 across IPv4 domains.
    Itthus introduces, for a variety of use cases, a simpler mesh-softwiremodel than
    that of [RFC5565].Among SAM use cases, some are solutions to previously unsolvedproblems:
    native IPv6 across IPv4 NATs, with optimized paths;multihoming with independent
    CPEs and provider-aggregatable prefixes;public IPv4 addresses across IPv6-only
    domains with optimized paths;static sharing of IPv4 addresses, without impact
    on routinginformation bases.</p>"
