abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RBridges are link layer devices that use routing protocols as
    \na control plane but do not target to scale up to large campus \nnetworks. This
    document contains an alternative proposal to \nlink-state RBridges, named ABridges.
    ABridges overcome \nRBridges L2 network size restrictions allowing applicability
    \nto very large Ethernet campus networks while maintaining zero \nconfiguration
    and high performance, by assuming a topological \nrestriction that is automatically
    performed. The proposal \nincludes a two-layered network architecture with two
    \nhierarchical independent spanning tree layers. Expected \nconvergence is fast,
    probably below two seconds.   \n\n\t </p>\n      "
