abstract:
- content: "<p>The basic set of ATM switch services useful for streaming media such
    as video and audio are virtual circuit segments, virtual path segments, and multicast
    segments with quality of service support. These services are specified using the
    concept of traffic classes. A definition of traffic classes different from that
    used by other bodies is provided here. The present Internet Draft is based on
    the corresponding set of services that are being considered by the IEEE P1520
    working group.</p>"
