abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a generic routing method and protocol for a
    regular data center network, named the Fault-Avoidance Routing (FAR) protocol.
    The FAR protocol provides a generic routing method for all types of regular topology
    network architectures that have been proposed for large-scale cloud-based data
    centers over the past few years. The FAR protocol is designed to leverage any
    regularity in the topology and compute its routing table in a concise manner.
    Fat- tree is taken as an example architecture to illustrate how the FAR protocol
    can be applied in real operational scenarios.</p>"
