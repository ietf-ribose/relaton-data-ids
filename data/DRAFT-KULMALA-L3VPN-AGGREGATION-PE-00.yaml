abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes operation of aggregation PE and applications\n
    \  for it.\n \n   Aggregation PE installs VPN-IPv4 routes into VRFs and acts as
    BGP \n   next hop when it readvertises VPN-IPv4 routes with MP-BGP to other \n
    \  PE routers. This eliminates the need to LSP connectivity (or some \n   other
    type of tunnels) between packet's ingress and egress PE.\n\t </p>\n      "
