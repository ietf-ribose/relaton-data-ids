abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In response to address selection problem statement and requirement\ndocuments,
    this document describes solution approaches and evaluates\nproposed solution mechanisms
    in line with requirements.  It also\nexamines the applicability for each solution
    mechanism, and concludes\nthat no single solution solves the problems and the
    combination of\nthe solutions should be the way forward.\n\t </p>\n      "
