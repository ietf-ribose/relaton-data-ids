abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques
    and\n   many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in\n
    \  very high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core\n   networks.
    \ MPLS-TP has discouraged the use of multipath techniques.\n   Some degradation
    of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot be avoided when\n   operating over current high
    bandwidth multipath implementations.\n\n   The tradeoffs involved in using multipath
    techniques with MPLS and\n   MPLS-TP are described.  Requirements are discussed
    which enable full\n   MPLS-TP compliant LSP including full OAM capability to be
    carried\n   over MPLS LSP which are traversing multipath links.  Other means of\n
    \  supporting MPLS-TP coexisting with MPLS and multipath are discussed.\n\n\t
