abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to provide inter-domain authentication services, it is necessary
    to have a standardized method that domains can use to identify each other's users.
    This document defines the syntax for the Network Access Identifier (NAI), the
    user identifier submitted by the client prior to accessing resources. This document
    is a revised version of RFC 4282. It addresses issues with international character
    sets and makes a number of other corrections to RFC 4282.</p>"
