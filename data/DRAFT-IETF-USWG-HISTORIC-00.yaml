abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    Traditionally, the User Services Area of the IETF has been\n
    \   responsible for keeping FYI documents updated.  However, as the\n    Internet
    has progressed and developed, it has become clear that not\n    all FYIs are worth
    updating.  Some of the information is simply\n    obsolete.  This memo documents
    which FYIs are considered obsolete,\n    and lets users know not to trust the
    information they contain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
