abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the environment, problem statement, and goals
    of the On-The-Fly (OTF) scheduling approach for the IEEE802.15.4e TSCH MAC protocol
    in the context of LLNs. The purpose of OTF is to dynamically adapt the aggregate
    bandwidth, i.e., the number of reserved soft cells between neighbor nodes, based
    on the specific application constraints to be satisfied. The soft cell and Bundle
    reservation with OTF is distributed: through the 6top interface, neighbor nodes
    negotiate the cell(s) to be (re)allocated/deleted, without intervention of a centralized
    entity. This document aims at defining a module which uses the functionalities
    provided by the 6top sublayer to (i) extract statistics and (ii) determine when
    to reserve /delete soft cells in the schedule. The exact reservation and deletion
    algorithm, and the number and type of statistics to be used in the algorithm are
    out of scope. OTF deals only with the number of soft cells to be reserved/deleted;
    it is up to 6top to select the specific soft cells within the TSCH schedule.</p>"
