abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Pipelining was added to HTTP/1.1 as a means of improving theperformance
    of persistent connections in common cases. While it isdeployed in some limited
    circumstances, it is not widely used byclients on the open Internet. This memo
    suggests some measuresdesigned to make it more possible for clients to reliably
    and safelyuse HTTP pipelining in these situations.</p>"
