abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note describes the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS),
    a\n   hash-based digital signature system.  It follows existing\n   descriptions
    in scientific literature.  The note specifies the WOTS+\n   one-time signature
    scheme, a single-tree (XMSS) and a multi-tree\n   variant (XMSS^MT) of XMSS.  Both
    variants use WOTS+ as a main\n   building block.  XMSS provides cryptographic
    digital signatures\n   without relying on the conjectured hardness of mathematical
    problems.\n   Instead, it is proven that it only relies on the properties of\n
    \  cryptographic hash functions.  XMSS provides strong security\n   guarantees
    and is even secure when the collision resistance of the\n   underlying hash function
    is broken.  It is suitable for compact\n   implementations, relatively simple
    to implement, and naturally\n   resists side-channel attacks.  Unlike most other
    signature systems,\n   hash-based signatures can withstand so far known attacks
    using\n   quantum computers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
