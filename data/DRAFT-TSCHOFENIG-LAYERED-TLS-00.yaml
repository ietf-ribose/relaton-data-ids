abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TLS and increasingly also DTLS are frequently used to provide
    channel\n   security for Internet of Things (IoT) communication.  On the Web and\n
    \  smart phones, TLS is already the defacto approach for securing\n   protocol
    interactions.  While the end-to-end security offered by TLS,\n   particularly
    TLS 1.3, is already too much for some, there are others\n   who believe that TLS
    is insufficient.  While the former group is\n   working on ways to weaken TLS
    security, the latter group is\n   interested in designing an application layer
    security solution.\n   Whether application-layer security is used in addition
    to or as a\n   substitute for transport-layer security is of secondary importance.\n
    \  However, the security needs for such an application layer solution\n   are
    similar, if not identical, to those that drove the design of TLS.\n   This is
    for an obvious reason: Security requirements are not tied to\n   the name of a
    security protocol nor to the layer at which it is\n   executed.  One can make
    this observation also in other areas, such as\n   with the increasing similarity
    of Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and the\n   TLS handshake protocols.\n\n   These
    discussions within the IETF inspired the document authors to\n   explore whether
    TLS could actually be used also at the application\n   layer and how complex it
    would be.  We call this approach \"Layered\n   TLS\" since TLS may, in some scenarios,
    be executed at two layers:\n   above the transport layer in the traditional manner
    and also at the\n   application layer.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
