abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document enumerated methods of port assignment in CGN contexts,\n
    \  more focused on NAT64 environments.  The analysis categorized the\n   different
    methods with several key features.  Corresponding to those\n   features, the uses
    of existing protocols are also described.  The\n   potential concerns and workaround
    have been discussed.  It's expected\n   the document could provide a informative
    base line to help operators\n   choosing a proper method.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
