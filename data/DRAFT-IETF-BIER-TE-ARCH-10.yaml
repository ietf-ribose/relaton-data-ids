abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes per-packet stateless strict and loose path\n
    \  steered replication and forwarding for Bit Index Explicit Replication\n   packets
    (RFC8279).  It is called BIER Tree Engineering (BIER-TE) and\n   is intended to
    be used as the path steering mechanism for Traffic\n   Engineering with BIER.\n\n
    \  BIER-TE introduces a new semantic for bit positions (BP) that\n   indicate
    adjacencies, as opposed to BIER in which BPs indicate Bit-\n   Forwarding Egress
    Routers (BFER).  BIER-TE can leverage BIER\n   forwarding engines with little
    changes.  Co-existence of BIER and\n   BIER-TE forwarding in the same domain is
    possible, for example by\n   using separate BIER sub-domains (SDs).  Except for
    the optional\n   routed adjacencies, BIER-TE does not require a BIER routing underlay,\n
    \  and can therefore operate without depending on an Interior Gateway\n   Routing
    protocol (IGP).\n\n   As it operates on the same per-packet stateless forwarding\n
    \  principles, BIER-TE can also be a good fit to support multicast path\n   steering
    in Segment Routing (SR) networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
