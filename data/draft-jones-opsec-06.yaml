abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a list of operational security requirements for
    the infrastructure of large Internet Service Provider (ISP) IP networks (routers
    and switches). A framework is defined for specifying "profiles", which are collections
    of requirements applicable to certain network topology contexts (all, core-only,
    edge-only...). The goal is to provide network operators a clear, concise way of
    communicating their security requirements to vendors. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>
