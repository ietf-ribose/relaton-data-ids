abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In networks with bandwidth constraints, such as wireless cellularnetworks,
    compression of IP and transport headers may be employed toobtain better utilization
    of the available spectrum capacity. Whenheader compression is used along with
    handovers in such networks,the header compression context needs to be relocated
    from one IPaccess point (i.e., a router) to another in order to achieve seamlessoperation.
    In this document, we propose a mechanism to achieve thiscompression context relocation
    using options for the handover ICMPmessages defined for IPv6 and suboptions for
    the destination optionsused by mobile nodes to request smooth handovers.</p>"
