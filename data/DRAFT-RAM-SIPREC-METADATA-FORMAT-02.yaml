abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications\n
    \  environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of\n   these
    environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,\n   compliance and consumer
    protection reasons.  Recording of a session\n   is typically performed by sending
    a copy of a media stream to a\n   recording device.  This document focuses on
    the Recording metadata\n   format which describes the communication session.\n\n\t
