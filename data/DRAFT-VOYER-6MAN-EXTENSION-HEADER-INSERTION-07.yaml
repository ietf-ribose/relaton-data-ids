abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traffic traversing an SR domain is encapsulated in an outer
    IPv6\n   header for its journey through the SR domain.\n\n   To implement transport
    services strictly within the SR domain, the SR\n   domain may require insertion
    or removal of an SRH after the outer\n   IPv6 header of the SR domain.  Any segment
    within the SRH is strictly\n   contained within the SR domain.\n\n   The SR domain
    always preserves the end-to-end integrity of traffic\n   traversing it.  No extension
    header is manipulated, inserted or\n   removed from an inner transported packet.
    \ The packet leaving the SR\n   domain is exactly the same (except for the hop-limit
    update) as the\n   packet entering the SR domain.\n\n   The SR domain is designed
    with link MTU sufficiently greater than the\n   MTU at the ingress edge of the
    SR domain.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
