abstract:
- content: "<p>Header Compression over IPsec [HCOIPSEC], documents the work items
    needed to integrate hop-by-hop header compression algorithms with IPsec security
    associations. However, as a result of various discussions within the IETF, two
    alternative approaches to achieving HCoIPsec have emerged. This draft is intended
    to document the two alternatives, and help those involved with HCoIPsec development
    converge on one common approach for realizing HCoIPsec.</p>"
