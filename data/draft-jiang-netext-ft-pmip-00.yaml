abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply mobility
    management for mobile nodes (MN) in a local small area. If the multihomed MN attaches
    to multiple MAGs by multiple links, then the mobility session in each link is
    independent. As the ongoing communication interface breaking down, the mobility
    session in the link is also broke and the traffic packets are lost. This document
    mainly proposes a fault tolerant scheme. When an interface of the multihomed MN
    broke down, the fault tolerant scheme can be used to handover the interface and
    realize the flow migration and maintain the integrity of data transmission During
    the handover process.</p>"
