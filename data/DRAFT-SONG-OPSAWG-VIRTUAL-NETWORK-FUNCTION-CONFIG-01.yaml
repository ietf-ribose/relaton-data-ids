abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the problem space of remote service\n
    \  installation and configuration in the provider's network through a\n   centralized
    management system.  This is a typical scenario for\n   virtual function installation
    and dynamic configuration in network\n   function virtualization (NFV) context.
    \ It is also a typical scenario\n   in cloud computing environment where end users
    do not have to install\n   applications in their end hosts, but can install their
    own featured\n   powerful software application in the cloud.  This specification
    also\n   identifies the scope that needs standardization based on the\n   problems.\n\n\t
