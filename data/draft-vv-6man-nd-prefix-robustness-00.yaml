abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 prefixes could become invalid abruptly as a result of outages,
    network administrator actions, or particular product shortcomings. That could
    lead to connectivity problems for the hosts attached to the subtended network.
    This document has two targets: on the one hand, to analyze the cases that may
    lead to network prefix invalidity; on the other to develop a root cause analysis
    for those cases and propose a solution. This may bring to extensions of the protocols
    used to convey prefix information and other options.</p>"
