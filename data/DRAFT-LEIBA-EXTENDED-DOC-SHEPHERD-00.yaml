abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 4858 talks about \"Document Shepherding from Working Group
    Last\n   Call to Publication\".  There's a significant part of a document's\n
    \  life that happens before working group last call, starting, really,\n   at
    the time a working group begins discussing a version of the idea\n   that's been
    posted as an individual draft.  It seems reasonable and\n   helpful to begin shepherding
    when there's a call for adoption as a\n   working group document, and this document
    gives one Area Director's\n   view of how that extended shepherding function might
    work, and what\n   tasks might be involved throughout the document's lifecycle.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
