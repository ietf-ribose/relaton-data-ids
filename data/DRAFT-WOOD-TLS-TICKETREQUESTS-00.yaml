abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TLS session tickets enable stateless connection resumption
    for\n   clients without server-side per-client state.  Servers vend session\n
    \  tickets to clients, at their discretion, upon connection\n   establishment.
    \ Clients store and use tickets when resuming future\n   connections.  Moreover,
    clients should use tickets at most once for\n   session resumption, especially
    if such keying material protects early\n   application data.  Single-use tickets
    bound the number of parallel\n   connections a client may initiate by the number
    of tickets received\n   from a given server.  To address this limitation, this
    document\n   describes a mechanism by which clients may request tickets as needed\n
    \  during a connection.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
