abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In transport networks, there are requirements where Generalized\n
    \  Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) end-to-end recovery scheme\n   needs
    to employ restoration Label Switched Path (LSP) while keeping\n   resources for
    the working and/or restoration LSPs reserved in the\n   network after the failure
    occurs.  This document reviews how the LSP\n   association is to be provided using
    Resource Reservation Protocol -\n   Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in
    the context of GMPLS end-\n   to-end recovery when using restoration LSP where
    failed LSP is not\n   torn down.\n\n   This document compliments existing standards
    by explaining the\n   missing pieces of information during the RSVP-TE signaling
    procedure\n   in support of resource sharing-based LSP setup/teardown in\n   GMPLS-controlled
    circuit networks.  No new procedures or mechanisms\n   are defined by this document,
    and it is strictly informative in\n   nature.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
