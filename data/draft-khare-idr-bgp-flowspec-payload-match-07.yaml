abstract:
- content: <p>The rise in frequency, volume, and pernicious effects of DDoS attacks
    has elevated them from fare for the specialist to generalist press. Numerous reports
    detail the taxonomy of DDoS attacks, the varying motivations of their attackers,
    as well as the resulting impact for their targets ranging from internet or business
    services to network infrastrutures. BGP FlowSpec (RFC 5575, "Dissemination of
    Flow Specification Rules") can be used to rapidly disseminate filtering rules
    to mitigate (distributed) denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Operators can use existing
    FlowSpec components to match typical n-tuple criteria in pre-defined packet header
    fields such as IP protocol, IP prefix or port number. Recent enhancements to IP
    Router forwarding plane filter implementations also allow matches at arbitrary
    locations within the packet header or payload. This capability can be used to
    essentially match a signature for the attack traffic and can be combined with
    traditional n-tuple filter criteria to mitigate volumetric DDoS attacks and reduce
    false positive to a minimum. To support this new filtering capability we define
    a new FlowSpec component, "Flexible Match Conditions", with similar matching semantics
    to those of existing components. This component will allow the operator to define
    a new match condition using a combination of offset and pattern values.</p>
