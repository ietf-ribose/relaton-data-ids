abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>An efficient resource allocation scheme directly affects the overall\nsystem's
    network utilization, and notably, the wireless resource such\nas bandwidth is
    itself an expensive commodity. In this regards, to\naddress the requirement of
    massively increased IoT traffic at the\nedge, as a solution approach, a number
    of small cell base stations\n(SBSs) have been deployed with certain computational
    capabilities.\nHowever, it is still limited, and any inappropriate resource\nallocation
    scheme for the associated nodes with traffic\ncharacterized by ultra-reliability
    and low-latency (URLLC)\nrequirements can impact the system's resource utilization
    and\nperformance. Considering a reserve resource for such kind of traffic,\nthe
    resource allocation problem in each time slot behaves as a node\nselection problem
    with contention amongst active nodes for the\nresource. In this paper, we have
    formulated this as an index problem,\nand with simulation results have shown that
    the cumulative reward in\nterms of network utility is maximized following this
    approach.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
