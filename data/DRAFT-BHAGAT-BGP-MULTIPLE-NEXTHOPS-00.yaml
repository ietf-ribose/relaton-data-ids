abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a new feature in BGP that allows grouping
    of\n   multiple BGP sessions between a pair of speakers and sending multiple\n
    \  nexthops for a single prefix.  This helps avoid sending and receiving\n   duplicate
    routes across all sessions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
