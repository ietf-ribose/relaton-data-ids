abstract:
- content: "<p>There have been a number of proposals for alternate semantics for the
    ECN field in the IP header [ECN]. This document discusses some of the issues in
    defining alternate semantics for the ECN field, and specifies requirements for
    a safe co-existence in an Internet that could include routers that do not understand
    the defined alternate semantics. This document evolved as a result of discussions
    with the authors of one recent proposal for such alternate semantics.</p>"
