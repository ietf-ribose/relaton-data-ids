abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to BGP route reflectors. On route
    reflectors, BGP route selection is modified in order to choose the best route
    from the standpoint of their clients, rather than from the standpoint of the route
    reflectors. Depending on the scaling and precision requirements, route selection
    can be specific for one client, common for a set of clients or common for all
    clients of a route reflector. This solution is particularly applicable in deployments
    using centralized route reflectors, where choosing the best route based on the
    route reflector's IGP location is suboptimal. This facilitates, for example, best
    exit point policy (hot potato routing). The solution relies upon all route reflectors
    learning all paths which are eligible for consideration. BGP Route Selection is
    performed in the route reflectors based on the IGP cost from configured locations
    in the link state IGP.</p>"
