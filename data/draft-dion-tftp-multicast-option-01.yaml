abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, filetransfer
    protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto aremote host.This document
    describes a new TFTP option. This new option will allowthe multiple clients to
    receive the same file concurrently throughthe use of Multicast packets. The TFTP
    Option Extension mechanism isdescribed in [2].Often when similar computers are
    booting remotely they will eachdownload the same image file. By adding multicast
    into the TFTPoption set, two or more computers can download a fileconcurrently,
    thus increasing network efficiency.This document assumes that the reader is familiar
    with theterminology and notation of both [1] and [2].</p>"
