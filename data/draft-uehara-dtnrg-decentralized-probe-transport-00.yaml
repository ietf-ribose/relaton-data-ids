abstract:
  content: "<p>(This document is a description of the decentralized viechle toviechle
    probe mechanism currently being prototyped. The main purposeof disclosing this
    -00 document is to introduce the application ideaand start discussion within the
    DTNRG. Because of this, the currentmechanism described in this docment does not
    conform to the protocolsdefined in the DTNRG at this moment. The mechanism should
    be updatedbased on the discussion in this group.)This document describes the transport
    protocol specification used forthe decentralized probe system for vehicles. The
    probe systemexchanges probe messages between vehicles using a wirelesscommunication
    methods with low bandwidth and lossy properties. Thecommunication environment
    dynamically changes as vehicle moves. Theprotocol try to utilize the limited bandwidth
    as much as possible andincrease reachability rate by using sender-side error correctionmechanism.</p>"
