abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT)stresses
    the global routing system in a number of ways. One of themost costly stresses
    is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade routerhardware simply because the FIB has
    run out of space, and routervendors must design routers that have adequate FIB.
    FIB suppressionis an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT loading selectedRIB
    entries into the FIB. This document specifies two styles of FIBsuppression. Edge
    suppression (ES) allows ISPs that deploy a core-edge topology to shrink the FIBs
    of their edge routers, includingthose that interface to other ISPs and exchange
    the full DFRT.Virtual Aggregation (VA) allows ISPs to shrink the FIBs of any andall
    routers. Both styles may be deployed autonomously by an ISP(cooperation between
    ISPs is not required), and can co-exist withlegacy routers in the ISP.</p>"
