abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This paper describes a simple distance vector protocol that exposes\nonly
    a default route towards the infrastructure in a nested NEMO\nconfiguration.  The
    draft extends the Neighbor Discovery Protocol\n[RFC4861] in order to carry information
    and metrics which will help a\nMobile Router select its Attachment Router(s) in
    an autonomous\nfashion and provides generic rules which guarantee that the\ninteraction
    of different selection processes will not create loops.\n\t </p>\n      "
