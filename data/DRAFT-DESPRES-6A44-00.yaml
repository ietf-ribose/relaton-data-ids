abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In customer sites having IPv4-only CPEs, Teredo provides a
    last\n   resort IPv6 connectivity [RFC4380] [RFC5991] [RFC6081].  However,\n   because
    it is designed to work without involvement of Internet\n   service providers,
    it has significant limitations (connectivity\n   between IPv6 native addresses
    and Teredo addresses is uncertain;\n   connectivity between Teredo addresses fails
    for some combinations of\n   NAT types). 6a44 is a complementary solution that,
    being base on ISP\n   cooperation, avoids these limitations.  At the beginning
    of IPv6\n   addresses, it replaces the Teredo well-known prefix by network\n   specific
    prefixes assigned by local ISP's (an evolution similar to\n   that from 6to4 to
    6rd).  In hosts, 6a44 can be implemented either\n   autonomously or as an extension
    of Teredo.  The specification is\n   complete enough for actual deployment, including
    with independently\n   written codes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
