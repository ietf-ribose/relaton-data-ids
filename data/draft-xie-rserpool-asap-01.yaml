abstract:
- content: "<p>Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP) in conjunction with ENRP [ENRP]
    provides a fault tolerant data transfer mechanism over IP networks. ASAP uses
    a name-based addressing model which isolates a logical communication endpoint
    from its IP address(es), thus effectively eliminating the binding between the
    communication endpoint and its physical IP address(es) which normally constitutes
    a single point of failure.</p>"
