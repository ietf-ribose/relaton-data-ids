abstract:
- content: "<p>Under certain conditions, it is desirable for a Border Gateway Protocol
    (BGP) route reflector to be able to modify the Route Target (RT) list of a Virtual
    Private Network (VPN) route that the route reflector distributes, enabling the
    route reflector to control how a route originated within one VPN Routing and Forwarding
    table (VRF) is imported into other VRFs. This technique works effectively as long
    as the VRF that exports the route is not on the same Provider Edge (PE) router
    as the VRF(s) that imports the route. However, due to the constraints of BGP,
    it does not work if the two are on the same PE. This document describes a modification
    to BGP allowing this technique to work when the VRFs are on the same PE and to
    be used in a standard manner throughout an autonomous system.</p>"
