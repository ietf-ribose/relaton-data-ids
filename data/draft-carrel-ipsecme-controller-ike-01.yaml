abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a key exchange method allowing devices managed
    by a controller (e.g., an SDN management station) to create private pair-wise
    IPsec SAs without IKEv2 or any other direct peer-to-peer session establishment
    messages. The method can be used when a full mesh of IKEv2 sessions between IPsec
    devices is not appropriate.</p>"
