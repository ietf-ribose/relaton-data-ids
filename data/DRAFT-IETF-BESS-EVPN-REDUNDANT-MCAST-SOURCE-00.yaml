abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EVPN supports intra and inter-subnet IP multicast forwarding.\n
    \  However, EVPN (or conventional IP multicast techniques for that\n   matter)
    do not have a solution for the case where: a) a given\n   multicast group carries
    more than one flow (i.e., more than one\n   source), and b) it is desired that
    each receiver gets only one of the\n   several flows.  Existing multicast techniques
    assume there are no\n   redundant sources sending the same flow to the same IP
    multicast\n   group, and, in case there were redundant sources, the receiver's\n
    \  application would deal with the received duplicated packets.  This\n   document
    extends the existing EVPN specifications and assumes that IP\n   Multicast source
    redundancy may exist.  It also assumes that, in case\n   two or more sources send
    the same IP Multicast flows into the tenant\n   domain, the EVPN PEs need to avoid
    that the receivers get packet\n   duplication by following the described procedures.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
