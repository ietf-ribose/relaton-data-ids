abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Dual-Stack Lite (RFC 6333) describes an architecture for transporting\n
    \  IPv4 packets over an IPv6 network.  This document specifies an\n   extension
    to DS-Lite called Lightweight 4over6 which moves the\n   Network Address and Port
    Translation (NAPT) function from the\n   centralized DS-Lite tunnel concentrator
    to the tunnel client located\n   in the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).  This
    removes the\n   requirement for a Carrier Grade NAT function in the tunnel\n   concentrator
    and reduces the amount of centralized state that must be\n   held to a per-subscriber
    level.  In order to delegate the NAPT\n   function and make IPv4 Address sharing
    possible, port-restricted IPv4\n   addresses are allocated to the CPEs.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
