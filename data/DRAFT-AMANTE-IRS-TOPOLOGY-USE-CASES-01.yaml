abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes use cases for gathering routing, forwarding\n
    \  and policy information, (hereafter referred to as topology\n   information),
    about the network.  It describes several applications\n   that need to view the
    topology of the underlying physical or logical\n   network.  This document further
    demonstrates a need for a \"Topology\n   Manager\" and related functions that
    collects topology data from\n   network elements and other data sources, coalesces
    the collected data\n   into a coherent view of the overall network topology, and
    normalizes\n   the network topology view for use by clients -- namely, applications\n
    \  that consume topology information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
