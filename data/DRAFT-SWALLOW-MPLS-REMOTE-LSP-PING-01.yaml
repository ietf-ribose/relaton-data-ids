abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a means of remotely initiating Multiprocal\n
    \     Label Switched Protocol Pings on Label Switched Paths.  A proxy\n      ping
    request is sent to any Label Switching Routers along a Label\n      Switched Path.
    \ The primary motivations for this facility are\n      first to limit the number
    of messages and related processing when\n      using LSP Ping in large Point-to-Multipoint
    LSPs, and second to\n      enable leaf to root tracing.\n\t </p>\n      "
