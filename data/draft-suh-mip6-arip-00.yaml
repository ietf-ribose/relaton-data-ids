abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines Access Router Information Protocol (ARIP)whereby
    a mobile host can improve the handoff performance byexchanging, in advance, the
    information among geographicallyadjacent access router(AR)s. This protocol does
    not need a certainassumption of network topology so that it can be applied toheterogeneous
    networks as well as homogeneous networks. This documentalso describes a framework
    to minimize the handoff latency with theaid of ARIP. Therefore, ARIP can be combined
    with the protocol such asFast Handovers (for Mobile IPv6) which tries to minimize
    the handofflatency.</p>"
