abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Source-specific routing is an extension to traditional next-hop\n
    \  routing where packets are forwarded according to both their\n   destination
    and their source address.  This document describes the\n   source-specific routing
    extension to the Standard Track's Babel\n   routing protocol defined in [BABEL].
    \ It is incompatible with the\n   Experimental Track's Babel [RFC6126].\n\n   Source-specific
    routing is also known as Source Address Dependent\n   Routing, SAD Routing, SADR,
    Destination/Source Routing or Source/\n   Destination Routing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
