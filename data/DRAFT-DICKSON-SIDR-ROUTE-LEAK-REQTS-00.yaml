abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Border Gateway Protocol, version 4, (BGP4) provides the
    means to\n   advertise reachability for IP prefixes.  This reachability\n   information
    is propagated in a peer-to-peer topology.  Sometimes\n   routes are announced
    to peers for which the local peering policy does\n   not permit.  And sometimes
    routes are propagated indiscriminantly,\n   once they have been accepted.\n\n
    \  This document considers the situations that can lead to routes being\n   leaked,
    and tries to find acceptable definitions for describing these\n   scenarios.\n\n
    \  The purpose of these definitions is to facilitate discussion on what\n   a
    route leak is, and what the scope of the problem space for route\n   leaks is.
    \ This, in turn, is intended to inform a requirements\n   document for detection
    of (and prevention of) route leaks.  And\n   finally, the definitions and requirements
    are intended to allow\n   proposed solutions which meet these criteria, and to
    facilitate\n   evaluation of proposed solutions.\n\n   The fundamental objective
    is to \"solve the route leaks problem\".\n\n\t </p>\n      "
