abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a solution for overcoming the limitations
    \n   of existing route reflect mechanism:even there are equal \n   routes,route
    reflector(RR) would use the nexthop router ID to \n   break tie and only reflect
    the route with lower router ID to its \n   clients,so RR clients send all the
    traffic for the destination to \n   only one nexthop which leads to traffic unbalanced
    in an AS. \n   Additive-Routes-Wanted ORF extends ORF to not only filter BGP \n
    \  routes but also give RR client the ablility to ask RR for additive \n   BGP
    routes in its BGP database. With the additive routes, RR \n   clients could make
    inner-AS native IP and VPNV4 load sharing \n   easier. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
