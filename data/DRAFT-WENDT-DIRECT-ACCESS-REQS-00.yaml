abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Current networking systems generally rely on data copy operations
    to \nmove incoming data from network protocol stack buffers into \napplication
    buffers.  These data copy operations consume significant \nportions of a host
    system's processor-memory bandwidth and \ninstruction cycle count, resources that
    could be applied to running \napplications.\n\t </p>\n      "
