abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGPLS provides a mechanism by which Link state and traffic\n
    \  engineering information can be collected from internal networks and\n   shared
    with external network routers using BGP.  BGPLS defines a new\n   Address Family
    to exchange this information using BGP.\n\n   BGP Optimal Route Reflection [BGP-ORR]
    [RFC9107] provides a mechanism\n   for a centralized BGP Route Reflector to acheive
    requirements of a\n   Hot Potato Routing as described in Section 11 of [RFC4456].
    \ Optimal\n   Route Reflection requires BGP ORR to overwrite the default IGP\n
    \  location placement of the route reflector; which is used for\n   determining
    cost to the nexthop contained in the path.\n\n   This draft augments BGPLS and
    defines a new extensions to exchange\n   cost information to next-hops for the
    purpose of calculating best\n   path from a peer perspective rather than local
    BGP speaker own\n   perspective.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
