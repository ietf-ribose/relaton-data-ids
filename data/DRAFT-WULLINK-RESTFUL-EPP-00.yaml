abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a 'RESTful interface for EPP' (REPP)
    with the\n   aim to improve efficiency and interoperability of EPP systems.\n\n
    \  This document includes a new EPP Protocol Extension as well as a\n   mapping
    of [RFC5730] XML-commands to an HTTP based (RESTful)\n   interface.  Existing
    semantics and mappings as defined in [RFC5731],\n   [RFC5732] and [RFC5733] are
    largely retained and reusable in RESTful\n   EPP.\n\n   With REPP, no session
    is created on the EPP server.  Each request\n   from client to server will contain
    all of the information necessary\n   to understand the request.  The server will
    close the connection\n   after each HTTP request.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
