abstract:
- content: '<p>Deploying a new network device often requires that an employee physically
    travel to a datacenter to perform the initial install and configuration, even
    in shared datacenters with "smart-hands" type support. In many cases, this could
    be avoided if there was a standard, secure way to initially provision the devices.
    This document extended existing auto-install / Zero-Touch Provisioning to make
    the process more secure. [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional
    background information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings,
    etc. They will be removed before publication. This document is being collaborated
    on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft- wkumari-opsawg-sdi. The most
    recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available here.
    The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests. ] [ Ed note: This document introduces
    concepts and serves as the basic for discussion - because of this it is conversational,
    and would need to be firmed up before being published ]</p>'
