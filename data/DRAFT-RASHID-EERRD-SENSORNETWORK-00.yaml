abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Efficient energy utilization and prolonged lifetime are two
    most \n   covetable targets for sensor network. For increased lifetime,each\n
    \  node must conserve energy as much as possible.  In this paper we \n   propose
    a protocol in which energy is conserved by amortizing the \n   energy cost of
    superfluous packets and idle state energy consumption\n   To achieve our goal
    we have exercised well-known periodic sleep \n   protocol and reduce redundant
    transmission by creating broadcast \n   tree based on residual energy and distance
    based communication cost. \n   Wasteful energy consumption of sensor nodes (e.g.
    idle listening, \n   retransmission due to packet collision, overhearing etc)
    can be \n   minimized by selecting minimum number of forwarding nodes. Our \n
    \  proposed algorithm selects minimum number of forwarding while \n   creating
    broadcast tree. All intermediate nodes acts as forwarding \n   node (non-leaf)
    while all the other nodes acts as a non-forwarding \n   (child)  reduces wasteful
    energy consumption by keeping radio \n   transceiver off. Simulation shows our
    algorithm is better in terms\n   Dense Sensor Network Based on Residual Energy
    and Distance\n   of energy conservation and network lifetime\n\t </p>\n      "
