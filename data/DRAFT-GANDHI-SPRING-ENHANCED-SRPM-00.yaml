abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.
    \ SR is\n   applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6\n
    \  (SRv6) data planes.  This document defines procedure for Enhanced\n   Performance
    Measurement of end-to-end SR paths including SR Policies\n   for both SR-MPLS
    and SRv6 data planes using Simple Two-Way Active\n   Measurement Protocol (STAMP)
    defined in RFC 8762.  The procedure\n   reduces the deployment and operational
    complexities in a network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
