abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an application of the Resource Public Key\nInfrastructure
    to validate the origination of routes advertised in\nthe Border Gateway Protocol.
    \ The proposed application is intended to\nfit within the requirements for adding
    security to inter-domain\nrouting, including the ability to support incremental
    and piecemeal\ndeployment, and does not require any changes to the specification
    of\nBGP.\n\t </p>\n      "
