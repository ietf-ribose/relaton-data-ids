abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SIP already provides the ability to perform hop-by-hop traceroute\n
    \  for SIP messages using the Max-Forwards header field, in order to\n   determine
    the reachability path of requests to a target.  A\n   mechanism for media-loopback
    calls has also been defined separately,\n   which enables test calls to be generated
    which result in media being\n   looped back to the originator.  This document
    describes a means of\n   performing hop-by-hop traceroute-style test calls using
    the media-\n   loopback mechanism, in order to test the media path when SIP\n
    \  sessions go through media-relaying B2BUAs.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
