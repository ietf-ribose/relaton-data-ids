abstract:
- content: "<p>Used in Massive Data Centers (MDCs), BGP-SPF and similar protocols
    need link neighbor discovery, link encapsulation data, and Layer 2 liveness. The
    Link State Over Ethernet protocol provides link discovery, exchanges supported
    encapsulations (IPv4, IPv6, ...), discovers encapsulation addresses (Layer 3 /
    MPLS identifiers) over raw Ethernet, and provides layer 2 liveness checking. The
    interface data are pushed directly to a BGP-LS API, obviating the need for centralized
    controller architectures. This protocol is intended to be more widely applicable
    to other upper layer routing protocols which need link discovery and characterisation.</p>"
