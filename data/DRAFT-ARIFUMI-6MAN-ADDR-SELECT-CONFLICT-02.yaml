abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document examines how policy conflicts happen, and how to\naddress
    the conflicts.  After making it clear what kind of address\nselection policy should
    be necessary, we proposed how to merge the\npossibily conflicting policies for
    each of the destination address\nselection policy and source address selection
    policy.\n\t </p>\n      "
