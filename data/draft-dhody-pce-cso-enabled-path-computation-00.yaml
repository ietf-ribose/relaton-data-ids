abstract:
- content: "<p>Applications like cloud computing, video gaming, HD Video streaming,
    Live Concerts, Remote Medical Surgery, etc are offered by Data Centers. These
    data centers are geographically distributed and connected via a network. Many
    decisions are made in the Application space without any concern of the underlying
    network. Cross stratum application/network optimization focus on the challenges
    and opportunities presented by data center based applications and carriers networks
    together [CSO-DATACNTR]. Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building
    block for traffic engineering systems such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. [RFC4655] explains
    the architecture for a Path Computation Element (PCE)-based model to address this
    problem space. This document explains architecture for CSO enabled Path Computation.</p>"
