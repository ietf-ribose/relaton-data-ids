abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable\n
    \  communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to\n   TCP
    [RFC0793].  With the widespread deployment of Network Address\n   Translators
    (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT for TCP\n   that allows multiple
    hosts to reside behind a NAT and yet use only a\n   single globally unique IPv4
    address, even when two hosts (behind a\n   NAT) choose the same port numbers for
    their connection.  This\n   additional code is sometimes classified as Network
    Address and Port\n   Translation or NAPT.  To date, specialized code for SCTP
    has NOT yet\n   been added to most NATs so that only pure NAT is available.  The
    end\n   result of this is that only one SCTP capable host can be behind a\n   NAT.\n\n
    \  This document describes an SCTP specific variant of NAT which\n   provides
    similar features of NAPT in the single point and multi-point\n   traversal scenario.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
