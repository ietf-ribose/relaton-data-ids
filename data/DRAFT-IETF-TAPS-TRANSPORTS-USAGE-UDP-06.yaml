abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is an informational document that describes the transport\n
    \  protocol interface primitives provided by the User Datagram Protocol\n   (UDP)
    and the Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite) transport\n   protocols.
    \ It identifies the datagram services exposed to\n   applications and how an application
    can configure and use the\n   features offered by the Internet datagram transport
    service.  RFCxxxx\n   documents the usage of transport features provided by IETF
    transport\n   protocols, describing the way UDP, UDP-Lite and other transport\n
    \  protocols expose their services to applications and how an\n   application
    can configure and use the features that make up these\n   services.  This document
    provides input to and context for that\n   document, as well as offering a road
    map to documentation that may be\n   of help to users of the UDP and UDP-Lite
    protocols.\n\n   XXX RFC-Ed Note - please replace RFCxxxx with the published RFC\n
    \  number for I-D.ietf-taps-transports-usage, when these documents are\n   both
    published XXX.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
