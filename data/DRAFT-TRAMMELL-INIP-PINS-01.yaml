abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a set of necessary functions and desirable\n
    \  properties of an ideal system for resolving names to addresses and\n   associated
    information for establishing communication associations in\n   the Internet.  For
    each property, it briefly explains the rationale\n   behind it, and how the property
    is or could be met with the present\n   Domain Name System.  It is intended to
    start a discussion within the\n   IAB's Names and Identifiers program about gaps
    between the present\n   reality of DNS and the naming service the Internet needs
    by returning\n   to first principles.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
