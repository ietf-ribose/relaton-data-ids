abstract:
  content: "<p>Mobile DTLS (Mobi-D) is an extension to DTLS that provides hostmobility
    support. After obtaining a new IP address or port, a DTLSclient mobile host can
    continue sending to its DTLS servercorrespondent host. The mobile host continues
    to use the existingset of security parameters, from the new address, without re-negotiation.
    The correspondent host accepts packets from the new IPaddress or port, also without
    re-negotiation. After receiving anyvalid DTLS packet from the mobile host's new
    address or port, thecorrespondent host uses the new address or port to send to
    the mobilehost.</p>"
