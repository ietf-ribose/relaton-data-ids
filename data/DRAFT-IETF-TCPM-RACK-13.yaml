abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents the RACK-TLP loss detection algorithm
    for TCP.\n   RACK-TLP uses per-segment transmit timestamps and selective\n   acknowledgements
    (SACK) and has two parts: RACK (\"Recent\n   ACKnowledgment\") starts fast recovery
    quickly using time-based\n   inferences derived from ACK feedback.  TLP (\"Tail
    Loss Probe\")\n   leverages RACK and sends a probe packet to trigger ACK feedback
    to\n   avoid retransmission timeout (RTO) events.  Compared to the widely\n   used
    DUPACK threshold approach, RACK-TLP detects losses more\n   efficiently when there
    are application-limited flights of data, lost\n   retransmissions, or data packet
    reordering events.  It is intended to\n   be an alternative to the DUPACK threshold
    approach.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
