    \ These prefixes are globally unique and are intended for\nlocal communications,
    usually within a single network administration.\nThey are not intended to be used
    in place of Provider Independent\n(PI) address prefixes available from the Regional
    Internet Registries\n(RIR) &lt;ref:  http://www.iana.org/numbers/ &gt; , and should
    not appear\nin the global routing table for the Internet.\n\nThe draft is being
    discussed on the ipv6@ietf.org list.\n\nLegal\n\nThis documents and the information
