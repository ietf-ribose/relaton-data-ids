abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the applicability of the reliable server
    pool\narchitecture and protocols to applications which want to have High\navialebility
    services. This is accomplished by using redundant\nservers and failover between
    servers of the same pool in case of\nserver failure. Processing load in a pool
    may de distributed/shared\nbetween the members of the pool according to a certain
    policy. Also\nsome guidance is given on the choice of underlying transport protocol\n(and
    corresponding transport protocol mapping) for transporting\napplication data and
    Rserpool specific control data.\n\t </p>\n      "
