- content: "<p>HIP DEX (Host Identity Protocol Diet EXchange) is a light-weight key
    exchange protocol designed for constrained devices. MLE (Mesh Link Establishment)
    is defined for establishing and configuring secure links in IEEE 802.15.4 mesh
    networks. This document defines an extension of MLE protocol to encapsulate HIP
    DEX key exchange protocol messages.</p>"
