abstract:
- content: "<p>Acknowledgement packets (ACKs) are used by transport protocols to confirm
    the delivery of packets, and their reception is used in a variety of other ways
    (to measure path round trip time, to gauge path congestion, etc). However, the
    transmission of ACKs also consumes resources at the receiver, forwarding resource
    in the network and processing resources at the sender. On network paths with significant
    path asymmetry, transmission of ACKs can limit the available throughput or can
    reduce the efficient use of network capacity. This occurs when the return capacity
    is significantly more constrained than the forward capacity, and/or the cost of
    transmission per packet is a significant component of the total transmission cost.
    In these cases, reducing the ratio of ACK packets to data packets can improve
    link utilisation and reduce link transmission costs. It can also reduce processing
    overhead at the sender and receiver. This document proposes a change to the default
    acknowledgement policy of the QUIC transport protocol to improve performance over
    paths with appreciable asymmetry.</p>"
