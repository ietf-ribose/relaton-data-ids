abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is intended to provide an alternative perspective
    to\n   the document prepared by Jim Fenton for DomainKeys Identified Mail\n   (DKIM),
    although it borrows from his substantial effort.  This review\n   removes emphasis
    on email-address domains, as DKIM allows signatures\n   to be independent of the
    email-address.  This document also considers\n   the impact of adding an opaque-identifier
    and implementing abusive\n   message replay abatement.  This document considers
    threats against\n   Internet mail and threats created when employing a signature-based\n
    \  method for establishing an accountable domain for a message, in\n   particular
    DKIM.  This document also ranks threat levels, modes of\n   access, Bad Actors
    and their capabilities, and possible motivations\n   for various attack scenarios.\n\t
