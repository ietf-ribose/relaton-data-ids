abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The previously proposed Hybrid Overlay Multicast Framework uses
    a \n   structured peer-to-peer overlay to connect peers in different types \n
    \  of multicast regions of the Internet. We use AMT (Automatic IP \n Multicast
    Without Explicit Tunnels) to connect peers in ALM \n   (Application Layer Multicast)
    regions with peers in native multicast \n   regions. Here we define the overlay
    messaging needed to support the \n   multicast tree operations. One goal of this
    approach is to ensure \n   that the SAM framework is compatible with the P2P-SIP
    overlay, which \n   is still being defined. Another goal is to be overlay agnostic
    so \n   that different overlay algorithms can interoperate in a single SAM \n
    \  (Scalable Adaptive Multicast) session. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
