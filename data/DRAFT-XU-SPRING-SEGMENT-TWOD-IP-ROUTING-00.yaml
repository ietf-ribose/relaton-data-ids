abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) allows a headend node to steer traffic
    into a\n   Segment Routing Policy (SR Policy), which represents the routing path\n
    \  by matching the destination address and the corresponding Binding\n   Segment
    Identifier (BSID).  However, determining the target SR Policy\n   only based on
    destination aspect is incapable for demands for higher\n   dimensional routing.
    \ Two Dimensional IP (TwoD-IP) routing is an\n   Internet routing architecture
    that makes forwarding decisions based\n   on source and destination addresses.
    \ TwoD-IP routing can easily\n   express a routing policy between host to host,
    or network to network,\n   and have much lower storage and calculation consumption
    compared to\n   the higher dimensional routing.\n\n   In this document, we extend
    SR to support TwoD-IP routing, illustrate\n   some typical scenarios of SR with
    TwoD-IP routing to express the\n   advantage of extending SR to support TwoD-IP
    routing, and describe\n   the mechanism of how TwoD IP routing protocol cooperates
    with SR.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
