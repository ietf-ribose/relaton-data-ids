abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method that allows parties to electronically
    sign Routing Policy Specification Language objects and validate such electronic
    signatures. This allows relying parties to detect accidental or malicious modifications
    of such objects. It also allows parties who run Internet Routing Registries or
    similar databases, but do not yet have authentication (based on Routing Policy
    System Security) of the maintainers of certain objects, to verify that the additions
    or modifications of such database objects are done by the legitimate holder(s)
    of the Internet resources mentioned in those objects. This document updates RFCs
    2622 and 4012 to add the signature attribute to supported RPSL objects.</p>"
