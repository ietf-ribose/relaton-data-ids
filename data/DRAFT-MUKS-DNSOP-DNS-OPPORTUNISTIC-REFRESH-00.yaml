abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism whereby a DNS resolver
    can\n   opportunistically refresh the TTLs of cached records of a zone using\n
    \  serial number information carried in responses from the zone's\n   nameservers.
    \ As well as improving resolver response time by reducing\n   the need to make
    upstream queries, the mechanism can also reduce the\n   workload of authoritative
    servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
