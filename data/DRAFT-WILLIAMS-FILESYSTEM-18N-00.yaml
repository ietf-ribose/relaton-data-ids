abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes requirements for internationalization
    (I18N)\n   of filesystems specifically in the context of Internet protocols, the\n
    \  architecture for filesystems in most currently popular general\n   purpose
    operating systems, and their implications for filesystem\n   I18N.  From the I18N
    requirements for filesystems and the\n   architecture of running code we derive
    requirements and\n   recommendations for implementors of operating systems and/or\n
    \  filesystems, as well as for Internet remote filesystem protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n
