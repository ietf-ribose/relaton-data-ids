abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft proposes to engineer traffic such that we can speak of anOrchestrally
    Conducted Traffic (OCT): Any traffic stream (given byits source and destination
    nodes and by a priority class) may useseveral differently routed LSPs. Each, traffic
    stream ingressreports, periodically, the currently measured traffic load (inbitrate)
    to a common TE Conductor (TEC) who evaluates them as toforecast what traffic load
    change might occur in the immediate timeahead. Accordingly the TEC computes well
    synchronized likelihoodvalues by which to take which route/LSP. These values will
    be suchthat any traffic stream will be served as good as possible, as oftenas
    possible, while equally ranked traffic streams are treated fair,higher ranked
    streams are prioritized and the network thruput ismaximized. The TEC sends the
    likelihood values to the respectiveingress node, who will distribute the received
    packets of thetraffic stream to the pertaining LSPs accordingly.</p>"
