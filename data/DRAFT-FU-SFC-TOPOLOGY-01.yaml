abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a deployment topology of Service Function\n
    \  Chaining(SFC).  The topology is in accordance with the SFC\n   architecture
    in [I-D.ietf-sfc-architecture].  Currently, such\n   architecture only includes
    architectural concepts, principles, and\n   components used in the construction
    of composite services through\n   deployment of SFCs, without any instruction
    for the field deployment.\n   It is still difficult to map from the architecture
    to a real\n   deployment of SFC.  In this document, we propose this topology which\n
    \  will give instructions for the field deployments.  We further propose\n   a
    VCPE usecase of SFC in the transport network, which explains the\n   details of
    the deployment topology.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
