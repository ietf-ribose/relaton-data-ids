abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a proposed update for the usage of
    the\n   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol to protect user\n   messages
    sent over the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).\n\n   DTLS over SCTP
    provides mutual authentication, confidentiality,\n   integrity protection, and
    replay protection for applications that use\n   SCTP as their transport protocol
    and allows client/server\n   applications to communicate in a way that is designed
    to give\n   communications privacy and to prevent eavesdropping and detect\n   tampering
    or message forgery.\n\n   Applications using DTLS over SCTP can use almost all
    transport\n   features provided by SCTP and its extensions.  This document intends\n
    \  to obsolete RFC 6083 and removes the 16 kB limitation on user message\n   size
    by defining a secure user message fragmentation so that multiple\n   DTLS records
    can be used to protect a single user message.  It\n   further updates the DTLS
    versions to use, as well as the HMAC\n   algorithms for SCTP-AUTH, and simplifies
    secure implementation by\n   some stricter requirements on the establishment procedures.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
