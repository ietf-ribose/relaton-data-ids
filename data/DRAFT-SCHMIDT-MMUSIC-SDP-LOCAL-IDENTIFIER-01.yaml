abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Dynamic Policy Controllers like resource and admission control\n
    \  systems need to be able to locate media receivers in each segment of\n   the
    network to determine the path of the media flows prior to\n   allowing or rejecting
    the session setup.  This is fine as long as\n   this is handled within an operator's
    network but limited when\n   extending this to home network.  Current definitions
    of SDP are not\n   clear about conveying a local identifier (e.g., a private IP
    address)\n   of the client that is destined to receive media streams after\n   successful
    SDP negotiation.  In this draft we outline the need for\n   carrying such information
    over SDP and discuss a set of possible\n   solutions in a scenario with a home
    network and a operator network\n   domain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
