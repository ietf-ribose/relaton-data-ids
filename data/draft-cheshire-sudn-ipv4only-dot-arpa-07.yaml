abstract:
  content: "<p>The specification for how a client discovers its network's NAT64 prefix
    [RFC7050] defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for this purpose, but declares
    it to be a non-special name in that specification's Domain Name Reservation Considerations
    section. Consequently, despite the well articulated special purpose of the name,
    (at the time of writing) 'ipv4only.arpa' still does not appear as one of the names
    with special properties recorded in the Special- Use Domain Names registry. This
    document formally declares the actual special properties of the name, and adds
    similar declarations for the corresponding reverse mapping names.</p>"
