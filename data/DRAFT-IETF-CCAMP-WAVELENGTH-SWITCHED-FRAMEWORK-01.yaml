abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo provides a framework for applying Generalized Multi-\nProtocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) and the Path Computation Element \n(PCE) architecture
    to the control of wavelength switched optical \nnetworks (WSON).  In particular
    we provide control plane models for \nkey wavelength switched optical network
    subsystems and processes. The \nsubsystems include wavelength division multiplexed
    links, tunable \nlaser transmitters, reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers
    \n(ROADM) and wavelength converters.  \n\nLightpath provisioning, in general,
    requires the routing and \nwavelength assignment (RWA) process. This process is
    reviewed and the \ninformation requirements, both static and dynamic for this
    process \nare presented, along with alternative implementation scenarios that
    \ncould be realized via GMPLS/PCE and/or extended GMPLS/PCE protocols. \nThis
    memo does NOT address optical impairments in any depth and \nfocuses on topological
    elements and path selection constraints that \nare common across different WSON
    environments.  It is expected that a \nvariety of different techniques will be
    applied to optical \nimpairments depending on the type of WSON, such as access,
    metro or \nlong haul.\n\t </p>\n      "
