abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NTP has been widely used through several revisions, with the
    latest\n   being RFC 5905 [RFC5905].  A core component of the protocol and the\n
    \  algorithms is the Reference ID, or REFID, which is used to identify\n   the
    source of time used for synchronization.  Traditionally, when the\n   source of
    time was another system the REFID was the IPv4 address of\n   that other system.
    \ The core purpose of the REFID is to prevent a\n   one-degree timing loop, where
    if A has several timing sources that\n   include B, if B decides to get its time
    from A we don't want A then\n   deciding to get its time from B.  The REFID is
    considered to be\n   \"public data\" and is a vital core-component of the base
    NTP packet.\n   If a system's REFID is the IPv4 address of its system peer, an\n
    \  attacker can try to use that information to send spoofed time packets\n   to
    either or both the target or the target's server, attempting to\n   cause a disruption
    in time service.  This proposal is a backward-\n   compatible way for a time source
    to tell its peers or clients \"If you\n   use me as your system peer, use this
    nonce as your REFID.\"  This\n   nonce SHOULD be untraceable to the original system,
    and if it is used\n   as the REFID this type of attack is prevented.\n\n\t </p>\n
