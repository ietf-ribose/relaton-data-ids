abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS as a mature technology is increasingly deployed in large-scale
    networks which consists of multiple domains (e.g., IGP areas/levels and even Autonomous
    Systems). To scale such multi-domain MPLS deployment, the concept of hierarchical
    LSPs is usually resorted. This document describes an enhancement to such hierarchical
    multi- domain MPLS deployment architecture that could further improve the scalability
    of multi-domain MPLS deployment.</p>"
