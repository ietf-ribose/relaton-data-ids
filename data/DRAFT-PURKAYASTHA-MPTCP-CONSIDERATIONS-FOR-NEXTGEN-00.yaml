abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MPTCP is deployed in devices which have multiple interfaces
    to\n   different networks.  It takes advantage of these multiple interfaces\n
    \  to improve user experience by bandwidth aggregation, redundancy, and\n   increased
    reliability by having a fallback option.  This document\n   describes scenarios
    where next generation (5G) mobility management\n   frameworks may impact MPTCP
    operations thus potentially jeopardizing\n   achievement of some of these gains.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
