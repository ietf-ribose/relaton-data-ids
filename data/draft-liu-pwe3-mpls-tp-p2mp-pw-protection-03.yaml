abstract:
- content: "<p>The requirements of MPLS-TP in RFC 5654 include a requirement(R63)
    that requires MPLS-TP MUST be possible to provide protection for MPLS-TP data
    plane without any IP forwarding capability and control plane.If applying 1:1 protection
    mechanism for the p2mp traffic in rfc6718 , it must have a return path to coordinate
    switch state to select the same path to receive and send traffic packet.For the
    above problem,this document describes a kind of protection solution to recovery
    and protect the p2mp traffic under the failure condition. This document is a product
    of a joint Internet Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
    Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
    Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</p>"
