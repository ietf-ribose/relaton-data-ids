abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a mechanism via which X Window System client
    applications may have their communications with the X WindowsSystem server forwarded
    across a Telnet communications channel. Thisis desireable when the Telnet session
    is established through a Firewallor Network Address Translator which does not
    allow arbitrary connectionsto be created from the host machine to the client machine;
    or when theTelnet session is using an authenticated and encrypted channel and
    thatsame security is desired for the X Window System session data. Authorization
    to communicate across the tunnel is provided to the X Windows System client via
    use of X Display access control data.</p>"
