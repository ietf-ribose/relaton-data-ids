abstract:
- content: <p>A category of services such as Intrusion Detection Service and Packet
    Capture operates in "receive-only" mode. They are "packet sinks" which consume
    all packets sent to them. This document describes the proposals for such service
    to be part of the Service Function Chaining framework.</p>
