abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an asynchronous management architecture
    (AMA)\n   suitable for providing application-level network management services\n
    \  in a challenged networking environment.  Challenged networks are\n   those
    that require fault protection, configuration, and performance\n   reporting while
    unable to provide humans-in-the-loop with synchronous\n   feedback or otherwise
    preserve transport-layer sessions.  In such a\n   context, networks must exhibit
    behavior that is both determinable and\n   autonomous while maintaining compatibility
    with existing network\n   management protocols and operational concepts.\n\n\t
