abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding\n
    \  standard ITU-T Recommendation H.266 and ISO/IEC International\n   Standard
    23090-3, both also known as Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and\n   developed by
    the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET).  The RTP payload\n   format allows for packetization
    of one or more Network Abstraction\n   Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload
    as well as fragmentation\n   of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.  The payload
    format has wide\n   applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming,
    and\n   high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among others.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
