abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>L2TP provides layer-2 tunneling over long distances,   and a single
    L2TP\nsession is likely to carry different type of IP packets.  Currently, one\nL2TP
    session carries only one payload session; for PPP session (payload)\nthe LCP controls
    the corresponding L2TP session.  Assigning one diffserv\ncode point to a L2TP
    session,  as  mentioned  in [ref-6] can not provide\ndifferentiated services for
    the  different  kind  of IP packets that are\ntunneled. For example, VoIP and
    FTP packets, will have to be treated the\nsame in the backbone,  even  though
    \ the intermediate nodes are diffserv\ncapable.\n\t </p>\n      "
