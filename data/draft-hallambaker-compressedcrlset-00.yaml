abstract:
- content: "<p>An efficient encoding for Certificate Revocation Lists is described
    based on a Disjoint Set encoding technique. When applied to the population of
    currently issued certificates enroled in the Certificate Transparency Notary network,
    the data set was reduced by 97% without introduction of false positives or false
    negatives.</p>"
