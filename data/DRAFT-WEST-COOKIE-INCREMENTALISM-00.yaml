abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes two changes to cookies inspired by the\n
    \  properties of the HTTP State Tokens mechanism proposed in\n   [I-D.west-http-state-tokens].
    \ First, cookies should be treated as\n   \"SameSite=Lax\" by default.  Second,
    cookies that explicitly assert\n   \"SameSite=None\" in order to enable cross-site
    delivery should also be\n   marked as \"Secure\".\n\n\t </p>\n      "
