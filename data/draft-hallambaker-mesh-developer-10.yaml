abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an end-to-end secure infrastructure
    that facilitates the exchange of configuration and credential data between multiple
    user devices. This document describes the Mesh reference code and how to install,
    run and make use of it in applications. It does not form a part of the Mesh specifications
    and is not normative. This document is also available online at http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-mesh-developer.html.</p>"
