abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft proposes an extension to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
    to\n   exchange Stateful Address Identification and Location between State\n   Maintaining
    Entities located over a backbone link about attached\n   nodes that are attached
    to the backbone via a Wireless Link, in order\n   to maintain all the entities
    up-to-date and maintain reachability as\n   the attached nodes move.\n\n\t </p>\n
