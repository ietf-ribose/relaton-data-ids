abstract:
  content: "<p>As each global IPv4 address will be shared among more and morecustomers,
    and as more and more NATs will be deployed in ISPinfrastructures, the lack of
    end-to-end transparency and the limitedscalability of some NATs are likely to
    cause increasing difficultiesto customers and to ISPs. This document introduces
    IPv4-IPv6coexistence scenarios where IPv4 addresses are shared with goodscalability
    and, in favorable configurations, with full IPv4 end-to-end transparency. For
    this, the key tool is the Stateless AddressMapping (SAM) of draft-despres-SAM-00,
    with in particular itsextended IPv4 addressing (IPv4E) in which port prefixes
    are used asIPv4 address extensions. For each considered scenario, StaticAddress
    Mappers (SAMs) are deployed at scenario specific places.</p>"
