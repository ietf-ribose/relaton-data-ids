abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet Draft describes a new Standards Action BGP community,\nLAST_RESORT.\n\nThis
    community provides a simple and easily deployable solution to a\ncertain class
    of BGP \"wedgies\".\n\nInitial deployment is expected to be achieved by voluntary
    use in the\nnetwork operator community-at-large.\nLong-term adoption via software
    enforcement of the community, will\nimprove global behavior, and simplify router
    configurations.\n\nThe Standards Action range of communities (previously limited
    to the\n\"well-known\" communities) ensures that the expectation of (eventual)\nrouter
    support is reasonable.\n\t </p>\n      "
