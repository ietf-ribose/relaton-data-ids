abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Stream switching is a technique used to change the data rate of
    a \nmedia being streamed, typically for the purpose of adaptation to \nthe effectively
    available bandwidth of the network. A backward \ncompatible and independent RTSP
    'SWITCH' command is proposed in \norder to enable RTSP-based stream switching.\n\t
