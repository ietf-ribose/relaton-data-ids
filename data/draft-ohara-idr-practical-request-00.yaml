abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2007, a large scale incident have occurred multiple ISPs where a
    number of BGP sessions were disconnected. This happened because of the different
    implementation of BGP error handling. Therefore, it is necessary to classify the
    error processing of BGP to achieve stable operation of BGP, and to define it clearly.
    This document describes to clarify the classification of BGP error handlings.</p>"
