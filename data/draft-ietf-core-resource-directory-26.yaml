abstract:
- content: "<p>In many IoT applications, direct discovery of resources is not practical
    due to sleeping nodes, or networks where multicast traffic is inefficient. These
    problems can be solved by employing an entity called a Resource Directory (RD),
    which contains information about resources held on other servers, allowing lookups
    to be performed for those resources. The input to an RD is composed of links and
    the output is composed of links constructed from the information stored in the
    RD. This document specifies the web interfaces that an RD supports for web servers
    to discover the RD and to register, maintain, lookup and remove information on
    resources. Furthermore, new target attributes useful in conjunction with an RD
    are defined.</p>"
