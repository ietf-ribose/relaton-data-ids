abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines a MIME content-type that may be used by a
    mail user\n   agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition
    of a\n   message after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient.\n   This
    content-type is intended to be machine-processable.  Additional\n   message header
    fields are also defined to permit Message Disposition\n   Notifications (MDNs)
    to be requested by the sender of a message.  The\n   purpose is to extend Internet
    Mail to support functionality often\n   found in other messaging systems, such
    as X.400 and the proprietary\n   \"LAN-based\" systems, and often referred to
    as \"read receipts,\"\n   \"acknowledgements\", or \"receipt notifications.\"
    \ The intention is to\n   do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have
    often been\n   expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past.\n\n
    \  Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other\n   messaging
    systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary \"LAN-based\"\n   systems), the MDN
    protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-\n   protocol messaging environment.
    \ To this end, the protocol described\n   in this memo provides for the carriage
    of \"foreign\" addresses, in\n   addition to those normally used in Internet Mail.
    \ Additional\n   attributes may also be defined to support \"tunneling\" of foreign\n
    \  notifications through Internet Mail.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 3798
    and updates RFC 2046, RFC 3461 and\n   replaces MDN definition in RFC 6533.\n\n
    \  Note: This draft shows how a combined MDN and EAI MDN document might\n   look
    like.  This work represents opinion of editors about possible\n   future direction
    for a combined specification and is not the result\n   of consensus of any IETF
    WG.  This draft can be used as a replacement\n   or update to draft-melnikov-mdn-3798bis-eai.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
