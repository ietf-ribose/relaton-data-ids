abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   YANG and SDF are two languages for modelling the interaction
    with and\n   the data interchanged with devices in the network.  As their areas
    of\n   application (network management, IoT, resp.) overlap, it is useful to\n
    \  be able to translate between the two.\n\n   The present specification provides
    information about how models in\n   one of the two languages can be translated
    into the other.  This\n   specification is not intended to be normative, but to
    help with\n   creating translators.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
