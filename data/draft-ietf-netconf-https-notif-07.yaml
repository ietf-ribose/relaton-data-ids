abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines both a protocol for sending notifications over
    HTTPS as well as extensions to the data model for configured subscriptions defined
    in RFC 8639. It also presents an example module for configuration without using
    the data model defined in RFC 8639. This document requires that the publisher
    is a "server" (e.g., a NETCONF or RESTCONF server), but does not assume that the
    receiver is a server.</p>
