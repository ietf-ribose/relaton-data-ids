abstract:
  content: "<p>A third party authorization label (TPA-Label) is a DNS-basedextension
    for DKIM ADSP records that allows domains in the Fromheader field to authorize
    acceptable third-party signatures. Thisapproach allows autonomous and unilateral
    authorizations for third-party domains using scalable, individual DNS transactions.
    Theextended scope of DKIM signing practice assertions introduced heresupplants
    transparent authorization schemes that are more difficultto administer. Alternatives
    for facilitating third-partyauthorizations currently necessitate coordination
    between two or moredomains to synchronously set up selector/key DNS records, DNS
    zonedelegations, and/or a regular exchange of public/private keys.Checking TPA-Label
    Resource Records for signing practices might occurinfrequently when a message
    is not compliant with restrictive ADSPpractices, where an Author Domain Signature
    is either missing orinvalid. When a third-party signature is found, TPA-Label
    ResourceRecord transactions offer an efficient means for Author Domains toauthorize
    specific third-party signing domains. Recipients areafforded a method to determine
    whether authorization exists insituations where other modes of authorization are
    impractical. TPA-Label Resource Records permit Author Domains a means to influencemessage
    handling selectively, for messages otherwise lacking validAuthor Domain signatures.</p>"
