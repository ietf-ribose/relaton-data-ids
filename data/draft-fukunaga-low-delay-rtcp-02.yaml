abstract:
  content: "<p>Low delay feedback in RTP has gained a lot of interest recently inorder
    to enhance the performance in RTP sessions with two or only asmall number of participants.
    A recent document describes rules thatenhance the functionality of the existing
    RTP timing and allow lowdelay feedback. While that document describes when it
    is allowed tosend data, we describe here what kind of low delay feedback may besent.
    Therefore we define three general RTCP feedback message typesas well as some recommendations
    how the sender SHOULD react tocertain feedback. The message types can either be
    used as is or theycan be extended in payload or application specific ways.</p>"
