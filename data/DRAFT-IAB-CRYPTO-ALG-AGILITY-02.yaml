abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many IETF protocols use cryptographic algorithms to provide\n
    \  confidentiality, integrity, or non-repudiation.  Communicating peers\n   must
    support the same set of cryptographic algorithms for these\n   mechanisms to work
    properly.  This memo provides guidelines to ensure\n   that protocols have the
    ability to migrate from one algorithm suite\n   to another over time.\n\n\t </p>\n
