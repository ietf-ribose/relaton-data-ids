abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Current Internet Service Providers (ISPs) scale their networks
    by\nusing the RADIUS protocol, which provides user Authentication,\nAuthorization
    and Accounting (AAA) of Dial-up PPP clients. The recent\nwork done in the Roaming
    Operations (ROAMOPS) Working Group was to\ninvestigate whether RADIUS could be
    used in a roaming network, and\nconcluded that RADIUS was ill-suited for inter-domain
    purposes.\nThe IETF has formed a new NAS Requirements Working Group, and part
    of\ntheir charter is to document the next generation NAS' AAA\nrequirements.  Recently,
    the Mobile-IP Working Group also documented\ntheir own AAA requirements that would
    help Mobile IP scale for\nInter-Domain mobility.\nThe DIAMETER protocol is a follow-on
    to the RADIUS protocol. DIAMETER\naddresses the known RADIUS deficiencies, and
    is intended for use with\nthe NASREQ and Mobile IP application space.\n\t </p>\n
