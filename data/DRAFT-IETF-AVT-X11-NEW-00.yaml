abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the payload format for encapsulating\nX-protocol
    streams in the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP).\nThis specification is intended
    for X-protocol media streams\nthat are not already handled by other RTP payload\nspecifications.
    This specification gives details of the\npayload format of X-protocol data requests
    that are carried\nover RTP/UDP/IP in a shared window session. Multiple X\nprotocol
    requests can be carried over an RTP packet as well as\none X protocol request
    can be carried over multiple RTP\npackets. a shared window header is defined within
    the RTP\npayload to carry X protocol media requests. An RTCP join and\nRTP reply
    packets are specified to allow a latecomer to join\nan on-going session. This
    specification is intended for\nstreaming stored X Window protocol data as well
    as live X\nprotocol data requests.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
