abstract:
- content: <p>Traditional finite-field-based Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange during
    the TLS handshake suffers from a number of security, interoperability, and efficiency
    shortcomings. These shortcomings arise from lack of clarity about which DH group
    parameters TLS servers should offer and clients should accept. This document offers
    a solution to these shortcomings for compatible peers by using a section of the
    TLS "EC Named Curve Registry" to establish common finite-field DH parameters with
    known structure and a mechanism for peers to negotiate support for these groups.</p>
