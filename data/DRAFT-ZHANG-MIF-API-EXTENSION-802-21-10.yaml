abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Application Program Interface (API) of MIF, specified in
    the MIF\n   API consideration, must lean upon lower layer functionalities when\n
    \  handover between homogeneous or heterogeneous networks is necessary.\n   To
    improve the connectivity performance, the existing MIF API needs\n   to be extended.
    IEEE also aims at the similar issue from different\n   way. A kind of logical
    entities over the link layer protocol for\n   handling the seamless handover has
    been defined in IEEE802.21. This\n   document proposes a mechanism via integrating
    MIF API and IEEE\n   802.21 to support application service better.\n\n\t </p>\n
