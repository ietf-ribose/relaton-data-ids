abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes some mechanisms to enable an IP network
    to\ntransport both the IP traffic of the local realm and the IP traffics\nof external
    realms in the native (non-tunneled) way [TRANSP-FRAM].\nThe methods, described
    in this document, provide to the routers of\nthe operated network the necessary
    information enabling the delivery\nof IP traffics originated from the foreign
    realms the operator offer\nconnectivity to. This information is derived by the
    currently\navailable routing information routers have and is moreover provided\nto
    them by the mean of a local delivery mechanism.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
