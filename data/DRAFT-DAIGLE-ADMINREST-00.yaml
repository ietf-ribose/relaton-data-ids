abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document outlines a proposal for an administrative oversight\n
    \  entity for the collection of activities that allow the IETF to carry\n   out
    its work.  The current description of the IETF's work can be\n   found in [2].
    \  The proposal is based on the observations and\n   recommendations outlined
    in the IAB Advisory Committee report ([1]).\n   The motivation for this proposal
    is described separately ([3]).\n   These 4 documents must be read together for
    completeness.\n\t </p>\n      "
