abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo presents an object-oriented data definition language
    for\nthe specification of various kinds of management information. It is\nindependent
    of management protocols and applications. Protocol\nmappings are defined as extensions
    to this language in separate\nmemos. The language builds on experiences gained
    with the SMIv2 and\nits derivate SPPI. It is expected that the language presented
    in\nthis memo along with its protocol mappings will replace the SMIv2\nand the
    SPPI in the long term.\n\t </p>\n      "
