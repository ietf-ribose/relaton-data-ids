abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning (TEEP) Protocol
    is\n   used to manage code and configuration data in a Trusted Execution\n   Environment
    (TEE).  This document specifies the HTTP transport for\n   TEEP communication
    where a Trusted Application Manager (TAM) service\n   is used to manage TEEs in
    devices that can initiate communication to\n   the TAM.  An implementation of
    this document can (if desired) run\n   outside of any TEE, but interacts with
    a TEEP implementation that\n   runs inside a TEE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
