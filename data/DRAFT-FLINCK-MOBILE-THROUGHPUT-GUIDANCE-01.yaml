abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The bandwidth available for end user devices in cellular networks
    can\n   vary by an order of magnitude over a few seconds due to changes in\n   the
    underlying radio channel conditions, as device mobility and\n   changes in system
    load as other devices enter and leave the network.\n   Furthermore, packets losses
    are not always signs of congestion.  The\n   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    can have difficulties adapting to\n   these rapidly varying conditions leading
    to inefficient use of a\n   cellular network's resources and degraded application
    performance.\n   Problem statement, requirements and the architecture for a solution\n
    \  is documented in [Req_Arch_MTG_Exposure]\n\n   This document proposes a mechanism
    and protocol elements that allow\n   the cellular network to provide near real-time
    information on\n   capacity available to the TCP server.  This \"Throughput Guidance\"\n
    \  (TG) information would indicate the throughput estimated to be\n   available
    at the radio downlink interface (between the Radio Access\n   Network (RAN) and
    the mobile device (UE)).  TCP server can use this\n   TG information to ensure
    high network utilization and high service\n   delivery performance.  The document
    describes the applicability of\n   the proposed mechanism for video delivery over
    cellular networks; it\n   also presents test results from live operator's environment.\n\n\t
