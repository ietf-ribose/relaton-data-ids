abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain
    to be\n   able to associate tags with prefixes and links.  Previously, OSPFv2\n
    \  and OSPFv3 were relegated to a single tag for AS External and Not-So-\n   Stubby-Area
    (NSSA) prefixes.  With the flexible encodings provided by\n   OSPFv2 Prefix/Link
    Attribute Advertisement and OSPFv3 Extended LSAs,\n   multiple administrative
    tags may advertised for all types of prefixes\n   and links.  These administrative
    tags can be used for many\n   applications including route redistribution policy,
    selective prefix\n   prioritization, selective IP Fast-ReRoute (IPFRR) prefix
    protection,\n   and many others.\n\n   The ISIS protocol supports a similar mechanism
    that is described in\n   RFC 5130.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
