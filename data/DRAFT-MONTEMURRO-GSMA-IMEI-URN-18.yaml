abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification specifies a Uniform Resource Name namespace
    for\n   the GSMA (Global System for Mobile communications Association) and a\n
    \  Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the IMEI (International Mobile\n   station
    Equipment Identity), and an associated parameter for the\n   IMEISV (International
    Mobile station Equipment Identity and Software\n   Version number).  The IMEI
    is 15 decimal digits long and the IMEISV\n   is 16 decimal digits long and both
    are encoded using Binary Encoded\n   Decimal (BCD).  The IMEI and IMEISV were
    introduced as part of the\n   specification for Global System for Mobile communications
    (GSM) and\n   are also now incorporated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project\n
    \  (3GPP) as part of the 3GPP specification for GSM, the Universal\n   Mobile
    Telecommunications System (UMTS) and 3GPP LTE (Long Term\n   Evolution).  The
    IMEI and IMEISV are used to uniquely identify Mobile\n   Equipment within these
    systems and are managed by the GSMA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
