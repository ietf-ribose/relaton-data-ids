abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document details use cases to mitigate DDoS attacks.  These
    use\n   cases are expected to illustrates involved communications to detect\n
    \  and mitigate DDoS attacks.  It is expected that these communications\n   will
    be in the future handled by the DDoS Open Threat Signaling\n   (DOTS).  These
    scenarios are intended to be useful to derive\n   requirements for the design
    of DDoS Open threat Signaling.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
