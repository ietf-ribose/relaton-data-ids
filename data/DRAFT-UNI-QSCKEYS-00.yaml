abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This proposal addresses key identification, key serialization,
    and\n   key compression for Quantum Safe Cryptographic (QSC) algorithms\n   currently
    under evaluation in the NIST Post Quantum Cryptography\n   (PQC) process.  The
    purpose of this proposal is to simplify the\n   management of key material for
    algorithms as they evolve through\n   standardization phases into production.
    \ Early definition of key\n   material standards will help expedite the adoption
    of new quantum\n   safe algorithms at the same time as improving interoperability\n
    \  between implementations and minimizing divergence across standards.\n\n\t </p>\n
