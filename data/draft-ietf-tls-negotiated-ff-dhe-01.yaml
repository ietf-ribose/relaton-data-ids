abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditional finite-field-based Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange during
    the TLS handshake suffers from a number of security, interoperability, and efficiency
    shortcomings. These shortcomings arise from lack of clarity about which DH group
    parameters TLS servers should offer and clients should accept. This document offers
    a solution to these shortcomings for compatible peers by establishing a registry
    of DH parameters with known structure and a mechanism for peers to indicate support
    for these groups.</p>"
