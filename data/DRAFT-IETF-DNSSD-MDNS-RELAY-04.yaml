abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document complements the specification of the Discovery
    Proxy\n   for Multicast DNS-Based Service Discovery.  It describes a\n   lightweight
    relay mechanism, a Discovery Relay, which, when present\n   on a link, allows
    remote clients, not attached to that link, to\n   perform mDNS discovery operations
    on that link.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
