abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC 5492 by making a change to the registration\n
    \  procedures for BGP Capability Codes.  Specifically, the range\n   formerly
    designated \"Reserved for Private Use\" is divided into three\n   new ranges,
    respectively designated as \"First Come First Served\",\n   \"Experimental\" and
    \"Reserved\".\n\n\t </p>\n      "
