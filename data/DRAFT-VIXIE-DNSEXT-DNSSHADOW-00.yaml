abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Whenever it is desireable to exactly replicated the content
    of a DNS\n   zone into one or more other DNS zones so that the content is\n   reachable
    by multiple names at different zone apexes, it is likewise\n   desireable that
    this behaviour be automated so that cooperating\n   primary and secondary nameservers
    can generate and serve the entire\n   set of shadows without human intervention
    and in an open multivendor\n   manner.  This document describes a new CLONE resource
    record for a\n   zone apex which can guide such cooperation.\n\t </p>\n      "
