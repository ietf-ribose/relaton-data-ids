abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is desirable to minimize traffic disruption caused by changing
    IP\n   address during a mobility event.  One mechanism to minimize\n   disruption
    is to expose a shorter network path to the mobility event\n   so only the local
    network elements are aware of the changed IP\n   address but the remote peer is
    unaware of the changed IP address.\n\n   This draft provides such an IP address
    mobility solution using TURN.\n   This is achieved by allowing a client to retain
    an allocation on the\n   TURN server when the IP address of the client changes.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
