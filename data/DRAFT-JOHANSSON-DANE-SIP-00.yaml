abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Use of TLS in the SIP protocol is defined in multiple documents,\n
    \  starting with RFC 3261.  The actual verification that happens when\n   setting
    up a SIP TLS connection to a SIP server based on a SIP URI is\n   described in
    detail in RFC 5922 - SIP Domain Certificates.\n\n   In this document, an alternative
    method is defined, using DNS-Based\n   Authentication of Named Entities (DANE).
    \ By looking up TLSA DNS\n   records and using DNSsec protection of the required
    queries,\n   including lookups for NAPTR and SRV records, a SIP Client can verify\n
    \  the identity of the TLS SIP server in a different way, matching on\n   the
    SRV host name in the X.509 PKIX certificate instead of the SIP\n   domain.  This
    provides more scalability in hosting solutions and make\n   it easier to use standard
    CA certificates (if needed at all).\n\n   This document updates RFC 5922.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
