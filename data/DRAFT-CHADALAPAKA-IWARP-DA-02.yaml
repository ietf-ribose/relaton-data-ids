abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>iSCSI is a SCSI transport protocol that maps the SCSI family \nof
    application protocols onto TCP/IP.  The Datamover \nArchitecture for iSCSI (DA)
    defines an abstract model in \nwhich the movement of data between iSCSI end nodes
    is \nlogically separated from the rest of the iSCSI protocol in \norder to allow
    iSCSI to adapt to innovations available in new \nIP transports.  The new Datamover
    protocol provides a \nreliable transport for all iSCSI PDUs, but actually moves
    the \ndata required for certain iSCSI PDUs without involving the \nremote iSCSI
    layer itself.  This document begins with an \nintroduction of a few new abstractions,
    defines a layered \narchitecture for iSCSI and Datamover protocols, and then \nmodels
    the interactions within an iSCSI end node between the \niSCSI layer and the Datamover
    layer that happen in order to \ntransparently perform remote data movement within
    an IP \nfabric.  It is intended that this definition would help map \niSCSI to
    generic RDMA-capable IP fabrics in the future \ncomprising TCP, SCTP, and possibly
    other underlying network \ntransport layers.\n\t </p>\n      "
