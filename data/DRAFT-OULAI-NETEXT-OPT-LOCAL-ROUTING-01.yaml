abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Base Proxy Mobile IPv6 requires all communications to go through
    the\nlocal mobility anchor.  As this can be suboptimal, local routing has\nbeen
    defined to allow mobile nodes attached to the same or different\nmobile access
    gateways to exchange traffic by using local forwarding\nor a direct tunnel between
    the gateways.  This document proposes an\ninitiation method and fast handover
    mechanisms for local routing.\nThe solutions aim at reducing handover delay and
    packet loss.\n\t </p>\n      "
