abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HTTP Level multicast, using BIER, is described as a use case
    in BIER\n   Use cases document.  HTTP Level Multicast is used in today's video\n
    \  streaming and delivery services such as HLS, AR/VR etc., generally\n   realized
    over IP Multicast.  A realization of \"HTTP Multicast\" over\n   \"IP Multicast\"
    is described.  IP multicast is commonly used for IPTV\n   services.  DVB and BBF
    is also developing a reference architecture\n   for IP Multicast service.  Few
    problems with IPMC, such as waste of\n   transmission bandwidth, increase in signaling
    when there are few\n   users are described.  Realization over BIER, through a
    BIER Multicast\n   Overlay Layer, is described.  How BIER Multicast Overlay operation\n
    \  improves over IP Multicast, such as reduction in signaling, dynamic\n   creation
    of multicast groups to reduce signaling and bandwidth\n   wastage is described.
    \ We conclude with few next steps.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
