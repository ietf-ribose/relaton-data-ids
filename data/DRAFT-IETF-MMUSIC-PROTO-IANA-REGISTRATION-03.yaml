abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) provides end-to-end network\n
    \  transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time\n   data
    such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or\n   unicast network
    services.  The data transport is augmented by RTP\n   Control Protocol (RTCP),
    to allow monitoring of the data delivery in\n   a manner scalable to large multicast
    networks, and to provide minimal\n   control and identification functionality.\n\n
    \  The RTP specification [RFC3550] establishes a registry of profile\n   names
    for use by higher-level control protocols, such as the Session\n   Description
    Protocol (SDP), to refer to the transport methods.  This\n   specification describes
    the following new SDP transport protocol\n   identifiers for transporting RTP
    Media over TCP: 'TCP/RTP/AVPF',\n   'TCP/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP',
    'TCP/DTLS/RTP/\n   SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF'.\n\n\t </p>\n
