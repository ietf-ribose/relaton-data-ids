abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery
    Networks\n   Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery\n
    \  Network (CDN) is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer\n   serves
    as the downstream CDN (dCDN).  This document proposed\n   extensions to the RFC8006
    Metadata Model by way of a set of\n   GenericMetadata objects that address extend
    the original CDNI\n   capabilities to meet the more general needs of the CDN and
    Open\n   Caching industry.  Extensions to RFC8008 are also introduced to allow\n
    \  a dCDN to advertise support for these extended metadata capabilities.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
