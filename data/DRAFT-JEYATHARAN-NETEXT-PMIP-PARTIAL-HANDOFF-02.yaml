abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) only supports session continuity for
    one\nbasic scenario of vertical handoff -- the transfer of all prefixes\nassigned
    from one interface to another.  However, there are some\nother advanced scenarios
    associated with vertical handoff that\ninvolves only transferring one (or some,
    but not all) of the prefixes\nthat are allocated to an existing interface to a
    newly powered on\ninterface.  This draft outlines extensions to PMIPv6 protocol
    in\norder for a multiple interfaced mobile node to achieve such partial\nvertical
    handoff of selected prefix(es).\n\t </p>\n      "
