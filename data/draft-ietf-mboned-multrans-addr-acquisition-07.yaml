abstract:
- content: "<p>Each IPTV operator has their own arrangements for pre-provisioning
    program information including addresses of the multicast groups corresponding
    to broadcast programs on the subscriber receiver. During the transition from IPv4
    to IPv6, scenarios can occur where the IP version supported by the receiver differs
    from that supported by the source. This memo examines what has to be done to allow
    the receiver to acquire multicast address information in the version it supports
    in such scenarios.</p>"
