abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Simple Certificate Enrolment Protocol (SCEP),
    a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) communication protocol which leverages existing
    technology by using CMS (formerly known as PKCS #7) and PKCS #10 over HTTP. SCEP
    is the evolution of the enrolment protocol sponsored by Cisco Systems, which now
    enjoys wide support in both client and server implementations, as well as being
    relied upon by numerous other industry standards that work with certificates.</p>"
