abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document describes how to use the SIP REFER method and
    the\n   dialog package to manipulate conversations, dialogs, and sessions on\n
    \  remote User Agents.  Specifically it extends the REFER mechanism to\n   allow
    the specification of a response that a UA should send in a\n   dialog.  This functionality
    is most useful for collections of loosely\n   coupled User Agents that wish to
    present a coordinated user\n   experience.  It does not require a Third-Party
    Call Control\n   controller to be involved in any of the manipulated dialogs.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
