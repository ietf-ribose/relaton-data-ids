abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the neighborhood discovery protocol for
    the\nOptimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2.  The protocol\nprovides
    each node with local topology up to two hops distance,\ndescribing a node's 1-hop
    neighbors and symmetric 2-hop neighbors.\nThis is achieved through periodic message
    exchange.  The neighborhood\ndiscovery protocol may be used by other MANET protocols
    which need\nneighborhood information.\n\nThe protocol imposes minimum requirements
    to the network by not\nrequiring sequenced or reliable transmission of control
    traffic.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
