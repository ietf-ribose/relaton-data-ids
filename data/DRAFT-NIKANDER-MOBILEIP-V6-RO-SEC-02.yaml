abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is a succint account of the rationale behind the
    Mobile\nIPv6 (MIPv6) Route Optimization Security Design. The purpose of this\ndocument
    is to present the thinking and to preserve the reasoning\nbehind the Mobile IPv6
    Security Design in 2001-2002.\nThe document has two target audiences: (1) MIPv6
    implementors (so\nthat they can better understand the design choices in MIPv6
    security\nprocedures); and (2) people dealing with mobility or multi-homing (so\nthat
    they can avoid a number of potential security pitfalls in their\ndesign).\n\t
