abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents how mobility management is handled in
    Hybrid-\n   ICN [I-D.muscariello-intarea-hicn].  The objective of the document
    is\n   to present how end-points mobility is managed in two main cases: the\n
    \  end-point sends data (data producer ) or the end-point receive data\n   (data
    consumer).  These two cases are taken into account entirely to\n   provide anchorless
    mobility management in hICN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
