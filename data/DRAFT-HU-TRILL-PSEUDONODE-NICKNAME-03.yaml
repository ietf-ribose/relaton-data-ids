abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   At the edg of TRILL campus, some RBridges provide end-station\n
    \  services to their attached end stations; these RBridges are called\n   edge
    RBridges.  To avoid potential frame duplication or loops in\n   TRILL campus,
    only one edge RBridge is permitted to provide such\n   services in a VLAN at all
    times to its attached end stations even\n   they are also attached to other edge
    RBridges.  However, in some\n   application scenarios, for example in Link Aggregation
    Group (LAG),\n   more than one edge RBridge is required to provide such services
    to an\n   end station even in a VLAN to improve resiliency and maximize the\n
    \  available network bandwidth, which causes the flip-flopping of the\n   egress
    RBridge nickname for such an end station in remote RBridges'\n   forwarding tables.
    \ In this document, the concept of Virtual RBridge,\n   along with its pseudo-nickname,
    is introduced to address the above\n   problem.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
