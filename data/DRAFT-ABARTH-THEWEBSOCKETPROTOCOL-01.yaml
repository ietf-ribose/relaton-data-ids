abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The WebSocket protocol enables two-way communication between a
    user\nagent running untrusted code running in a controlled environment to a\nremote
    host that has opted-in to communications from that code.  The\nsecurity model
    used for this is the Origin-based security model\ncommonly used by Web browsers.
    \ The protocol consists of an initial\nhandshake followed by basic message framing,
    layered over TCP.  The\ngoal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for
    browser-based\napplications that need two-way communication with servers that
    does\nnot rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g. using\nXMLHttpRequest
    or &lt;iframe&gt;s and long polling).\n\nPlease send feedback to the hybi@ietf.org
    mailing list.\n\t </p>\n      "
