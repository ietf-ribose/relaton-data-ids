abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet storage services have become more and more popular. They attract
    huge number of users and produce a significant share of Internet traffic. However,
    most existing Internet storage services make use of proprietary sync protocols
    to achieve the data synchronization. And almost all of them are proved to be not
    efficient enough and have room for improvement. This document outlines the related
    problems caused by inefficient proprietary sync protocols and shows a demand for
    an efficient and standard sync protocol.</p>"
