abstract:
  content: "<p>The PANA protocol offers a way to authenticate clients in IP basedaccess
    networks. However, in roaming environments, IP clients mightchange of gateways
    and new EAP authentication from scratch may occur.The present document describes
    a solution based on the ContextTransfer Protocol (CXTP) to enhance IP handover
    in mobileenvironments. Note that only the intra-domain case is considered.This
    protocol can recover the previously established PANA securitycontext from previous
    PANA Authentication Agent.</p>"
