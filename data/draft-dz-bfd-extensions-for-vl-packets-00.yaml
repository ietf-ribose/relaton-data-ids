abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document extends BFD mechanism to support detection function
    forpackets with variable lengths. Through dynamically changing thelength of BFD
    packets, it can detect both traditional faults such aslink failure or route fault,
    as well as non-forwarding problem forpackets with a length in a special range,
    which maybe caused byequipment's internal defects.</p>"
