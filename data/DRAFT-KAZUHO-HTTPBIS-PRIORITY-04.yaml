abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a scheme for prioritizing HTTP responses.\n
    \  This scheme expresses the priority of each HTTP response using\n   absolute
    values, rather than as a relative relationship between a\n   group of HTTP responses.\n\n
    \  This document defines the Priority header field for communicating the\n   initial
    priority in an HTTP version-independent manner, as well as\n   HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
    frames for reprioritizing the responses.  These\n   share a common format structure
    that is designed to provide future\n   extensibility.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
