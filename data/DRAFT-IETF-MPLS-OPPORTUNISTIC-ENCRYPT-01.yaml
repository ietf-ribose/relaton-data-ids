abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a way to apply opportunistic security
    between\n   adjacent nodes on an MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) or between end\n
    \  points of an LSP.  It explains how keys may be agreed to enable\n   encryption,
    and how key identifiers are exchanged in encrypted MPLS\n   packets.  Finally,
    this document describes the applicability of this\n   approach to opportunistic
    security in MPLS networks with an\n   indication of the level of improved security
    as well as the continued\n   vulnerabilities.\n\n   This document does not describe
    security for MPLS control plane\n   protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
