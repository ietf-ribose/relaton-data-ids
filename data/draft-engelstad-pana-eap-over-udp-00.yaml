abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Extensible Authentication Protocol over
    UDP (EAPoUDP) to be used for network access authentication. An access domain is
    represented by one or many PANA Authentication Agents (PAAs). Before a PANA Client
    (PaC) is granted access to the domain, a PAA and a PaC MAY use EAPoUDP to authenticate
    each other. EAPoUDP is a variation of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (PPP
    EAP) [2], but runs instead over IP - either IPv4 or IPv6. Unlike PPP EAP, EAPoUDP
    allows authentication over any link layer technology. Furthermore, the PAA and
    the PaC need not be on the same link. EAPoUDP uses UDP as its transport protocol.</p>"
