abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an extension to the Babel routing protocol
    that\n   allows annoncing routes to an IPv4 prefix with an IPv6 next-hop,\n   which
    makes it possible for IPv4 traffic to flow through interfaces\n   that have not
    been assigned an IPv4 address.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
