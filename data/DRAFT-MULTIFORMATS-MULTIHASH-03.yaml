abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cryptographic hash functions often have multiple output sizes
    and\n   encodings.  This variability makes it difficult for applications to\n
    \  examine a series of bytes and determine which hash function produced\n   them.
    \ Multihash is a universal data format for encoding outputs from\n   hash functions.
    \ It is useful to write applications that can\n   simultaneously support different
    hash function outputs as well as\n   upgrade their use of hashes over time; Multihash
    is intended to\n   address these needs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
