abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The RPC port mapper described in [1] and [2] allows a service
    to\n   bind to any free TCP or UDP port. A client that wants to establish a\n
    \  connection to a server will ask the RPC portmapper for the TCP or\n   UDP port
    of the service and establish the connection.\n\n   The problem is that clients
    now need to know the RPC application\n   number of the service they want to connect
    to. These numbers are\n   assigned by the IANA for registered applications. For
    \"experimental\"\n   applications there is a range of application numbers that
    is\n   managed by the local network's administrator.\n\n   Especially when using
    such \"experimental\" applications in wide\n   area networks there is the problem
    that the client needs to know\n   the server application's RPC application number.\n\n
    \  The protocol described in this document allows a server host the\n   dynamical
    assigning of RPC numbers. It allows clients to ask the\n   server for for RPC
    number by the application name.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
