abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The present document focuses on the MPLS Fast Reroute many-to-one
    \nsolution. It defines on the one hand, a specific PLR behavior for the \ndynamic
    setup of bypass LSPs, and on the other hand a distributed \nbypass LSP path computation
    mechanism, taking into account the \npossibility to share protection resources.
    \nIt proposes ISIS-TE/OSPF-TE and RSVP-TE extensions required to \nsupport the
    described functionality.\n\t </p>\n      "
