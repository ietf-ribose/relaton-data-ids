abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidance on IPv6 deployment in Internet Exchange
    Points (IXPs). It includes information regarding the switch fabric configuration,
    the addressing plan and general organizational tasks that need to be performed.
    IXPs are mainly a Layer 2 infrastructure, and, in many cases, the best recommendations
    suggest that the IPv6 data, control, and management plane should not be handled
    differently than in IPv4. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
