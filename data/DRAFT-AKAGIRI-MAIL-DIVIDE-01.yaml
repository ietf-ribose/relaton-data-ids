abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mail Divide Framework (MDF) is a recipient driven partitioning\n
    \  framework for E-Mail delivery.  A protocol to divide mail delivery at\n   the
    source of the message is defined in this draft.  A mechanism\n   called Reputation
    Service Provider is also introduced so that a\n   third-party authority can assure
    senders' trust.  With MDF,\n   subdomaining is used for category-specific MTA
    designation.  Senders\n   decide which category the outgoing mail belongs.  It
    then looks up\n   DNS TXT record to find whether the recipient advertises a specific\n
    \  server for that category.  The specified server puts the received\n   mail
    into a corresponding per-category inbox for the user.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
