abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RIFT is a new specialized dynamic routing protocol originally\n
    \  designed for Clos and Fat Tree Data Center networks.  It is designed\n   to
    work on multilevel network topologies in which nodes in certain\n   level will
    only connect to nodes in one upper or lower level with\n   optional and non-contiguous
    intra-level connectivity.\n\n   While the protocol was originally designed to
    meet the needs of\n   Massively Scalable Data Centers, its ability to automatically
    prune\n   the information distribution from higher levels to lower levels, as\n
    \  well as provide optimal routing for intra and inter-level traffic\n   makes
    it a good match for user access networks, or any network that\n   combines end
    user access and various compute enabling various network\n   service for these
    end users.  Current directions in distributed\n   computing seek to blur even
    that distinction.  Large distributed\n   networks can be created, where virtual
    compute units can be in all\n   tiers, combining and crossing many requirements
    for DC or User Access\n   design.  This draft seeks to analyze these requirements.\n\n\t
