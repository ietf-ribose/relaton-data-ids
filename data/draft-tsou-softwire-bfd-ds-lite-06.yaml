abstract:
- content: "<p>In DS-Lite, the tunnel is stateless, not associated with any state
    information, and the CGN function at the AFTR is stateful. Currently, there is
    no failure detection and failover mechanism for both stateless tunnel and stateful
    CGN function, which makes it difficult to manage and diagnose if there is a problem.
    This draft analyzes the applicability of some of the possible solutions.</p>"
