abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an enhancement to Bi-directional Forwarding Detection
    (BFD) for MPLS LSPs [MPLS-BFD] that can be used to specify the return path of
    BFD control packets for a specific BFD session. Specifying co-routed or protected
    return path increases robustness of BFD failure detection and reduces false positives.
    This document also defines a way to avoid duplicate BFD sessions currently encountered
    with Co-routed Bidirectional LSP and Associated Bidirectional LSP. The enhancement
    halves the BFD sessions over those LSPs, and allows a Co-routed Bidirectional
    LSPs or Associated Bidirectional LSPs to be protected and switched as a single
    entity.</p>"
