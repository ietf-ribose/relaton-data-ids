abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the gateway architecture for the\n
    \  interoperability between 6LoWPAN and external IPv6 networks.  The\n   gateway
    does the compression and decompression of IPv6 packets and\n   performs the mapping
    between 16 bit short addresses and the IPv6\n   addresses for both the external
    IPv6 networks and 6LowPAN,\n   respectively.\n\t </p>\n      "
