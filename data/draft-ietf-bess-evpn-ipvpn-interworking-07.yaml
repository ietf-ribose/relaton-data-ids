abstract:
- content: "<p>EVPN is used as a unified control plane for tenant network intra and
    inter-subnet forwarding. When a tenant network spans not only EVPN domains but
    also domains where BGP VPN-IP or IP families provide inter-subnet forwarding,
    there is a need to specify the interworking aspects between BGP domains of type
    EVPN, VPN-IP and IP, so that the end to end tenant connectivity can be accomplished.
    This document specifies how EVPN interworks with VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 and IPv4/IPv6
    BGP families for inter-subnet forwarding. The document also addresses the interconnect
    of EVPN domains for Inter-Subnet Forwarding routes. In addition, this specification
    defines a new BGP Path Attribute called D-PATH (Domain PATH) that protects gateways
    against control plane loops. D-PATH modifies the BGP best path selection for multiprotocol
    BGP routes of SAFI 1, 128 and EVPN IP Prefix routes, and therefore this document
    updates [RFC4271].</p>"
