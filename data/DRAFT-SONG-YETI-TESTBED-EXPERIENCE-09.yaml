abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet's Domain Name System is designed and built on
    a single\n   root, known as the Root Server System.\n\n   Yeti DNS is an experimental,
    non-production root server testbed that\n   provides an environment where technical
    and operational experiments\n   can safely be performed without risk to production
    root server\n   infrastructure.  Yeti DNS is an independently-coordinated project
    and\n   is not affiliated with the IETF, ICANN, IANA, or any Root Server\n   Operator.
    \ The objectives of the Yeti Project were set by the\n   participants in the project
    based on experiments that they considered\n   would provide valuable information,
    and with the aim of developing a\n   non-production testbed that would be open
    for use by anyone from the\n   technical community to propose or run experiments.\n\n
    \  The Yeti DNS testbed implementation includes various novel and\n   experimental
    components.  These differences from the Root Server\n   System have operational
    consequences; by deploying such a system\n   globally but outside the production
    DNS system, the Yeti DNS project\n   provides an opportunity to gain insight into
    those consequences\n   without threatening the stability of the DNS.\n\n   This
    document neither addresses the relevant policies under which the\n   Root Server
    System is operated nor makes any proposal for changing\n   any aspect of its implementation
    or operation.  This document aims\n   solely to document the technical and operational
    experience of\n   deploying a system which is similar to but different from the
    Root\n   Server System.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
