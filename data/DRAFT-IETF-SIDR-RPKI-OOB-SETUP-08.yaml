abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note describes a simple out-of-band protocol to ease setup
    of\n   the RPKI provisioning and publication protocols between two parties.\n
    \  The protocol is encoded in a small number of XML messages, which can\n   be
    passed back and forth by any mutually agreeable means which\n   provides acceptable
    data integrity and authentication.\n\n   This setup protocol is not part of the
    provisioning or publication\n   protocol, rather, it is intended to simplify configuration
    of these\n   protocols by setting up relationships and exchanging keying material\n
    \  used to authenticate those relationships.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
