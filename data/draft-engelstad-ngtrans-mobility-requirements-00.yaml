abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explores how layer-3 mobility can be provided to mobile
    nodes that are subjects to and affected by the transition mechanisms specified
    by the NGTRANS Working Group. It points out that the combination of mobility and
    transition mechanisms might lead to problems that will require a solution, and
    suggests requirements that a solution should meet.</p>"
