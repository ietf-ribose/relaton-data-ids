abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents a list of tests which implementers of IP
    Flow\nInformation Export (IPFIX) compliant systems are encouraged to\nperform
    on their IPFIX system.  This document has been created to\nhelp implementers test
    the functionality of their IPFIX exporter\nand/or collector component.  The goal
    of these tests is to ensure\nthat all important functions are covered by tests
    and thereby to gain\na level of confidence in the system which allows the implementer
    to\nperform interoperabilty or plug tests with other IPFIX systems.\n\t </p>\n
