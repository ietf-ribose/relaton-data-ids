abstract:
  content: "<p>A multi-homed node can be connected to multiple networks that mayutilize
    different DNS namespaces. The node often receives DNS serverconfiguration information
    from all connected networks. Some of theDNS servers may have information about
    namespaces other servers donot have. When the multi-homed node needs to utilize
    DNS, it has tochoose which of the servers to contact to. This document describes
    apolicy based method for helping on selection of DNS server for bothforward and
    reverse DNS lookup procedures with help of DNS suffix andIPv6 prefix information
    received via DHCPv6.</p>"
