abstract:
- content: "<p>Rotating public identifiers is encouraged as best practice as a means
    of protecting endpoint privacy. For example, regular MAC address randomization
    helps mitigate device tracking across time and space. Other protocols beyond those
    in the link layer also have public identifiers or parameters that should rotate
    over time, in unison with coupled protocol identifiers, and perhaps with application
    level identifiers. This document surveys such privacy-related identifiers exposed
    by common Internet protocols at various layers in a network stack. It provides
    advice for rotating linked identifiers such that privacy violations do not occur
    from rotating one identifier while neglecting to rotate coupled identifiers.</p>"
