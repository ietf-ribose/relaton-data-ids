abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document explains our observation on the usability of
    IODEF\n   [RFC5070], based on our experiments.  We aim at developing an IODEF-\n
    \  capable incident response management systems in order to facilitate\n   incident
    response activities.  We started to design and implement the\n   system for our
    university CERT, however, there are several technical\n   issues while implementing
    and operating the system.  This document\n   shares the observation from our proto-type
    implementation and\n   provides new sight from operational aspects.\n\n\t </p>\n
