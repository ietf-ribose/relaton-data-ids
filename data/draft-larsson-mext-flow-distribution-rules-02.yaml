abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines an OS independent rule language as a mean todefine
    and perform per flow path selection for a multi-homed node.Per flow path selection
    is typically needed when there exist multiplenetwork interfaces, each with different
    network characteristics, andan application has specific performance requirements
    for a data flowthat makes one network interface more suitable than another.The
    flow distribution rule set is used by the node itself but alsoexchanged with other
    nodes that needs to know about the multi-homednode's capability of receiving data
    on multiple network interfaces.This document does not define how the rule set
    is transferred betweennodes.</p>"
