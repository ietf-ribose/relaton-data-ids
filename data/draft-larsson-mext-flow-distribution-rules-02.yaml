abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an OS independent rule language as a mean to
    define and perform per flow path selection for a multi-homed node. Per flow path
    selection is typically needed when there exist multiple network interfaces, each
    with different network characteristics, and an application has specific performance
    requirements for a data flow that makes one network interface more suitable than
    another. The flow distribution rule set is used by the node itself but also exchanged
    with other nodes that needs to know about the multi-homed node's capability of
    receiving data on multiple network interfaces. This document does not define how
    the rule set is transferred between nodes.</p>"
