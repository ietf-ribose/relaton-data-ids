abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPEG Media Transport Protocol (MMTP) is a transport protocol that
    is designed to support download, progressive download, and streaming applications
    simultaneously. MMTP provides a generic media streaming mode by optimizing the
    delivery of generic media data encapsulated according to the ISO-Base Media File
    Format (ISOBMFF). In the file delivery mode, MMTP supports the delivery of any
    type of file. MMTP may used in IP unicast or multicast delivery and supports both
    Forward Error Correction (FEC) and retransmissions for reliable delivery of content.</p>"
