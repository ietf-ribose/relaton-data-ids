abstract:
- content: "<p>The process of producing today's Internet technologies, through a culture
    of open participation and diverse collaboration has proved strikingly efficient
    and effective, and it is distinctive among standards organizations. For its early
    years, participation in the IETF and its antecedent was almost entirely composed
    of well-funded, American, white, male engineers, demonstrating a distinctive and
    challenging group dynamic, both in management and in personal interactions. In
    the case of the IETF, interaction style can often contain singularly aggressive
    behavior, often including singularly hostile tone and content. Groups with greater
    diversity make better decisions. Obtaining meaningful diversity requires more
    than generic good will and statements of principle. Many different behaviors can
    serve to reduce participant diversity or participation diversity. This document
    discusses IETF participation, in terms of the nature of diversity and practical
    issues that can increase or decrease it. The document represents the authors'
    assessments and recommendations, following general disussions of the issues in
    the IETF.</p>"
