abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data leaks are a serious privacy problem for Internet users.
    \ Data in\n   flight and at rest can be protected with traditional communications\n
    \  security and data encryption.  Protecting data in use is more\n   difficult.
    \ In addition, failure to protect data in use can lead to\n   disclosing session
    or encryption keys needed for protecting data in\n   flight or at rest.\n\n   This
    document discusses the use of onfidential Computing, to reduce\n   the risk of
    leaks from data in use.  Our example use case is in the\n   context of DNS resolution
    services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
