abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes many features of the proposals for the
    successor\nto IKEv1. The purpose of the document is to help the IPsec Working
    Group\ndecide which features they want for the next protocol. The document\nfocuses
    on how those features are instantiated in two proposals, IKEv2\nand JFK, but other
    ideas for features and options are also included.\nMost of the material in this
    document comes from many of the authors of\nthe JFK and IKEv2 proposals.\nThis
    document is meant to help the Working Group choose which features\nit finds important
    for the successor to IKE. It should be short-lived\nand is not expected to become
    an RFC.\n\n\n\nThis document is meant to help the Working Group choose which features\nit
