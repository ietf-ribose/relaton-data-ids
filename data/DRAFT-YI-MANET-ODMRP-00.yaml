abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) is a multicast routing\nprotocol
    designed for ad hoc networks with mobile hosts. ODMRP is\na mesh-based, rather
    than a conventional tree-based, multicast \nscheme and uses a forwarding group
    concept (only a subset of nodes \nforwards the multicast packets via scoped flooding).
    It applies\non-demand procedures to dynamically build routes and maintain \nmulticast
    group membership. ODMRP is well suited for ad hoc \nwireless networks with mobile
    hosts where bandwidth is limited, \ntopology changes frequently and rapidly, and
    power is constrained.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
