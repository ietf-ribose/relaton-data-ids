abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new extended community known as "FlowSpec Redirect
    to indirection-id Extended Community". This extended community triggers advanced
    redirection capabilities to flowspec clients. When activated, this flowspec extended
    community is used by a flowspec client to retrieve the corresponding next-hop
    and encoding information within a localised indirection-id mapping table. The
    functionality detailed in this document allows a network controller to decouple
    the BGP flowspec redirection instruction from the operation of the available paths.</p>
