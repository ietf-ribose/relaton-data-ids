abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to MPLS BDI packet to form a newtype
    of OAM packet BNM(Bidirectional Notify Message) , this BNMpacket will not only
    have the function of informing another peer MEPabout existing fault of this path
    like MPLS BDI packet, but also itmay use for performance measure and testing communication
    between twoequipments. in addtion, when Client network has a fault or defect.
    itnotify another peer client network about remote peer fault. Andthese performance
    measure and fault notification information will beencapsulated in BNM packet by
    the way of TLV packet. So it maydecrease the number of OAM type and keep compatibility
    with MPLSnetwork. on the other hand, this encapsulating these information bythe
    way of TLV packet will be easy to extend OAM function to operatean MPLS Transport
    profile(MPLS-TP) label switched path (LSP).</p>"
