abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely\n
    \    shown to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed or\n     wireless
    networks).  Recent research has yielded many alternate\n     congestion control
    schemes.  Using these new congestion control\n     schemes in the global Internet
    has possible ramifications to both\n     the network and to traffic using the
    currently standardized\n     congestion control.  Therefore, the IETF must proceed
    with caution\n     when dealing with alternate congestion control proposals.  The
    goal\n     of this document is to provide guidance for considering alternate\n
    \    congestion control algorithms within the IETF.\n\t </p>\n      "
