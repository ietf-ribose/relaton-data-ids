abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The TCP protocol relies on receivers sending accurate and timelyfeedback
    to the sender. Currently the sender has no means to verifythat a receiver is correctly
    sending this feedback according to theprotocol. A receiver that is non-compliant
    has the potential todisrupt a sender's resource allocation, increasing its transmissionrate
    on that connection which in turn could adversely affect thenetwork itself. This
    document presents a two stage test process thatcan be used to identify whether
    a receiver is non-compliant. Thetests enshrine the principle that one shouldn't
    attribute to malicethat which may be accidental. The first stage test causes minimumimpact
    to the receiver but raises a suspicion of non-compliance. Thesecond stage test
    can then be used to verify that the receiver isnon-compliant. This specification
    does not modify the core TCPprotocol - the tests can either be implemented as
    a test suite or asa stand-alone test through a simple modification to the senderimplementation.StatusBy

    from previous drafts (to be removed by the RFC Editor)From -01 to -02:A number
    of changes made following an extensive review from AlfredHoenes. These were largely
    to better comply with the stated aimsof the previous version but also included
    some tidying up of theprotocol details and a new section on a possible unwantedinteraction.From
    -00 to -01:Draft rewritten to emphasise testing for non-compliance. Somechanges
    to protocol to remove possible unwanted interactions withother TCP variants. Sections
    added on comparison of solutions andalternative uses of test.</p>"
