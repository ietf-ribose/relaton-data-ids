abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many Massively Scaled Data Centers (MSDCs) have converged on\n
    \  simplified layer 3 routing.  Furthermore, requirements for\n   operational
    simplicity have led many of these MSDCs to converge on\n   BGP as their single
    routing protocol for both their fabric routing\n   and their Data Center Interconnect
    (DCI) routing.  This document\n   describes a solution which leverages BGP Link-State
    distribution and\n   the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm similar to Internal
    Gateway\n   Protocols (IGPs) such as OSPF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
