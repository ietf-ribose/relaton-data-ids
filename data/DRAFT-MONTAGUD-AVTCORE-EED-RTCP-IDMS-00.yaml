abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 7272 defines two RTCP messages to enable Inter-Destination
    Media\n   Synchronization (IDMS).  However, if such RTCP messages are exchanged\n
    \  using the Regular RTCP reporting rules specified in RFC 3550,\n   unacceptable
    delays can be originated when exchanging the\n   synchronization information conveyed
    into RTCP packets.  Accordingly,\n   this document proposes Early Event-Driven
    (EED) RTCP reporting rules\n   and messages to enable higher interactivity, dynamism,
    flexibility\n   and accuracy when using RTP/RTCP for IDMS.  Such IDMS extensions
    are\n   targeted at providing faster reaction on dynamic situations, such as\n
    \  out-of-sync situations and channel change delays, as well as a finer\n   granularity
    for synchronizing media-related events, while still\n   adhering to the RTCP bandwidth
    bounds specified in RFC 3550.\n   Besides, a new RTP/AVPF transport layer feedback
    message is proposed\n   to allow the request of re-IDMS setting instructions (e.g.,
    in case\n   of RTCP packet loss) as well as rapid accommodation of latecomers
    in\n   on-going sessions.  Finally, this document also discusses various\n   situations
    in which the reporting of Reduced-Size RTCP packets (RFC\n   3556) can be applicable
    and beneficial for IDMS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
