abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is
    to\n   bridge the gap between network and applications by provisioning\n   network
    related information.  This allows applications to make\n   informed decisions,
    for example when selecting a target host from a\n   set of candidates.  The ALTO
    problem statement [RFC5693] considers\n   typical applications as file sharing,
    real-time communication and\n   live streaming peer-to-peer networks.  Recently
    other use cases\n   focused on Content Distribution Networks and Data Centers
    have\n   emerged.\n\n   The present draft proposes to extend the cost information
    provided by\n   the ALTO protocol.  The purpose is to broaden the decision\n   possibilities
    of applications to not only decide 'where' to connect\n   to, but also 'when'.
    \ This is useful to applications that have a\n   degree of freedom on when to
    schedule data transfers, such as non-\n   instantaneous data replication between
    data centers or service\n   provisioning to end systems with irregular connectivity.
    \ The draft\n   therefore specifies a new cost mode, called the \"schedule\" mode.
    \ In\n   this mode the ALTO server offers cost maps that contain path ratings\n
    \  that are valid for a given timeframe (e.g. hourly) for a period of\n   time
    (e.g. a day).  Besides the functional time-shift enhancement\n   providing multi-timeframe
    cost values, the ALTO Cost Schedule also\n   allows to save a number of ALTO transactions
    and thus resources on\n   the ALTO server and clients.  Last, guidance to schedule
    application\n   traffic can also efficiently help for load balancing and resources\n
    \  efficiency.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
