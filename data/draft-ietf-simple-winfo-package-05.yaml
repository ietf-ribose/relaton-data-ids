abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the watcher information template-package for
    the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event framework. Watcher information refers
    to the set of users subscribed to a particular resource within a particular event
    package. Watcher information changes dynamically as users subscribe, unsubscribe,
    are approved, or are rejected. A user can subscribe to this information, and therefore
    learn about changes to it. This event package is a template-package because it
    can be applied to any event package, including itself. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
