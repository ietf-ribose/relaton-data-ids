abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the ChaMeLeon Version 2 (CMLv2) routing
    protocol\n   designed for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). CMLv2 is a multi-path,\n
    \  hybrid routing protocol operating within a defined area denoted as the\n   Critical
    Area (CA). The main concept behind CMLv2 is the adaptability of\n   its routing
    mechanisms towards changes in the physical and logical state\n   of a MANET. For
    autonomous communications, there is a likelihood\n   that the network size will
    vary whenever more devices join or leave the\n   network. In addition, battery
    depletion of lightweight mobile\n   communication devices will stipulate another
    reason for changes in the\n   network size. Hence, CMLv2 adapts its routing behavior
    according to\n   changes in the network size within a pre-defined CA. For small
    networks,\n   CMLv2 routes data proactively using the Optimized Link State Routing\n
    \  version v2 (OLSRv2) protocol whereas for larger networks it utilizes the\n
    \  reactive Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Version 2 (AODVv2) Routing\n   protocol.
    These transitions occur via the oscillation phase, which is\n   maintained from
    CMLv1. O-phase will be totally removed in the next\n   release of CMLv2.CMLv2
    creates multi-path routes  for nodes with disjoint\n   paths thereby increasing
    the reliability of the network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
