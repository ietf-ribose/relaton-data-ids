abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of this document is to express the general Internet\n
    \  community's expectations of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) with\n   respect
    to security.\n \n   It is not the intent of this document to define a set of requirements\n
    \  that would be appropriate for all ISPs, but rather to raise awareness\n   among
    ISPs of the community's expectations, and to provide the\n   community with a
    framework for discussion of security expectations\n   with current and prospective
    service providers.\n\t </p>\n      "
