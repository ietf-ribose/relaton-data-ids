abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo proposes to use COPS for the communication between a
    Label \nSwitching Router (LSR) and a Path Computation Server (PCS). Path \ncomputation
    is in much regard a complex function and might be out-\nsourced. For this reason
    a protocol between an LSR and a Path \nComputation Server is needed. This memo
    proposes to use COPS as a \nbase protocol for that task. \n\t </p>\n      "
