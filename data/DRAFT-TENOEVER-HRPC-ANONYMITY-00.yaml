abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Anonymity is less discussed topic in the IETF than for instance\n
    \  security [RFC3552] or privacy [RFC6973].  This can be attributed to\n   the
    fact anonymity is a hard technical problem or that anonymizing\n   user data is
    not of specific market interest.  It remains a fact that\n   'most internet users
    would like to be anonymous online at least\n   occasionally' [Pew].\n\n   This
    document aims to break down the different meanings and\n   implications of anonymity
    on a mediated computer network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
