abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses and describes design choices made in
    order to\n   utilize Information Centric Networking (ICN) for the Internet of\n
    \  Things (IoT).  Based on requirements and challenges identified in\n   draft-zhang-icnrg-iotchallenges-00,
    we propose design choices for an\n   IoT architecture to handle these requirements,
    while providing\n   efficiency and scalability.  An objective is to, as far as
    possible,\n   not require IoT specific changes of the ICN architectures per se,
    but\n   we do indicate some potential modifications of ICN that would improve\n
    \  efficiency and scalability for IoT and other applications.\n\n   Furthermore,
    the document starts outlining how to map the proposed\n   design choices to existing
    ICN architectures, in a first instance\n   shown for CCN1.0.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
