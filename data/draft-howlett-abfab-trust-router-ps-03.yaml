abstract:
- content: "<p>TODO: This document outlines the requirements for trust in a federated
    environment, and enumerates the requirements for a trust infrastructure. It also
    examines existing trust infrastructures given these requirements and concludes
    that none fulfil all of the requirements, and suggests that maybe a new one is
    required that does.</p>"
