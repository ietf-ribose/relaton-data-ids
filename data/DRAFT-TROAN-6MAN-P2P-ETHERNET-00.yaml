abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ethernet topology is no longer a shared medium.  It is a long
    time\n   since Ethernet has been a thick yellow cable snaking its way from\n   station
    to station.  Ethernet is now effectively deployed in a hub\n   and spoke topology.
    \ With a point to point link between a host and\n   the network device.  This
    memo describes a set of simplications for\n   how to run IP over such links, where
    the physical topology is exposed\n   in the network layer topology.\n\n\t </p>\n
