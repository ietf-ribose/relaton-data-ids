abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a TCP sender algorithm to trigger loss recovery
    based on the TCP Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) information gathered on a SACK
    scoreboard instead of simply counting the number of arriving duplicate acknowledgements
    (ACKs) in the traditional way. The given algorithm is more robust to ACK losses,
    ACK reordering, missed duplicate acknowledgements due to delayed acknowledgements,
    and extra duplicate acknowledgements due to duplicated segments and out-of-window
    segments. The algorithm allows not only a timely initiation of TCP loss recovery
    but also reduces false fast retransmits. It has a low implementation cost on top
    of the SACK scoreboard defined in RFC 3517.</p>"
