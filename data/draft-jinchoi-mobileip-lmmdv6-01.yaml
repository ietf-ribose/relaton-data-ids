abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document presents Localized Mobility Management for MobileIPv6
    in Distributed Manner (LMMDv6). Localized Mobility Management,in general introduces
    Local Mobility Agent functionality forproxying a Regional care of address that
    remains the same while themobile node moves within a Local Mobility Domain, which
    reduces thebinding update signaling latency and the signaling load outside theLocal
    Mobility Domain. We present a new way of forming LocalMobility Domains and Local
    Mobility Agents. In this protocol, LocalMobility Agent functionality is distributed
    across all accessrouters and a Local Mobility Domain is formed dynamically accordingto
    the mobile node's movement.</p>"
