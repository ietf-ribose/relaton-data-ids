abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol to discover
    other\nnodes on the link, to determine each other's link-layer addresses, to\nfind
    routers and to maintain reachability information about the paths\nto active neighbors.
    \ If not secured, ND protocol is vulnerable to\nvarious attacks.  This document
    specifies security mechanisms for ND.\nContrary to the original ND specifications,
    these mechanisms do not\nmake use of IPsec.\n\n   The purpose of this draft is
    to present an alternative to the current\n   approach in the Working Group.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
