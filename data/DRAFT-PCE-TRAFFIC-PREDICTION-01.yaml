abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides\n   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n
    \  computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n   It
    is helpful for PCEs to calculate more reasonable path if PCCs can\n   provide
    information of traffic prediction.  This memo specifies\n   extensions to PCEP
    that allow PCE to request prediction-related\n   information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
