abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines an "Minimum-Request-Interval" option for CoAP,
    which can be used to negotiate the minimum time between two subsequent requests
    within a single client and server pair. It can be used for flow and congestion
    control, reducing the consumption of server and network resources when needed.
    Note Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent
    to core@ietf.org.</p>
