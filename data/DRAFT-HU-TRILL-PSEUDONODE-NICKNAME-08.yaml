abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n
    \  protocol provides support for flow level multi-pathing for both\n   unicast
    and multi-destination traffic in networks with arbitrary\n   topology. Active-active
    access at the TRILL edge is the extension of\n   these characteristics to end
    stations that are multiply connected to\n   a TRILL campus. In this document,
    the edge RBridge (TRILL switch)\n   group providing active-active access to such
    an end station can be\n   represented as a Virtual RBridge. Based on the concept
    of Virtual\n   RBridge along with its pseudo-nickname, this document facilitates
    the\n   TRILL active-active access of such end stations.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
