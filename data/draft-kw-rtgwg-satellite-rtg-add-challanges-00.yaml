abstract:
- content: "<p>Future networks, including the Internet, will utilize an increasing
    amount of space-based transport infrastructure. Control and transport between
    Earth-based and space-based networks present several problems - high dynamicity,
    spatial connectivity, continual movement tracking and prediction, ocular obstruction,
    integration with existing Internet infrastructure, all of which challenge existing
    architectures, routing mechanisms and addressing schemes. This document summerises
    near-to-mid-term space-networking problems; it outlines the key components, challenges,
    and requirements for integrating future space-based network infrastructure with
    existing networks and mechanisms. Furthermore, this document highlights the network
    control and transport interconnection, and identify the resources and functions
    required for successful interconnection of space-based and Earth-based Internet
    infrastructure.</p>"
