abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This text documents 'P-Charge-Info', an existing private Session\n
    \  Initiation Protocol (SIP) header (P-header) used to convey billing\n   information
    about the party to be charged.  This P-Header is\n   currently in production usage
    by a number of equipment vendors and\n   carriers and this document is submitted
    to request the registration\n   of this header with IANA.  This P-Header may also
    be used in some\n   situations to carry the ISUP Charge Number parameter for PSTN\n
    \  interconnection.\n\n   NOTE: This document has been in development since 2008
    under the name\n   draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info.  This -05 document is identical
    to\n   draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info-15 except for edits to the text to\n   indicate
    this is now for the DISPATCH working group as the SIPPING\n   working group no
    longer exists.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
