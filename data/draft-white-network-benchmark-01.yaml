abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document attempts to discuss some of the definitions required
    toundertake the specifications of such benchmarks, and also to discusssome of
    the possible ways to benchmark a routing protocol performancewithin a network,
    and some of the implications of those benchmarks.The definition of convergence
    is discussed first, then pollingnetwork devices. Several tests which are commonly
    used to measurenetwork convergence are examined.This draft does not attempt to
    define what techniques should be usedto benchmark network convergence, but only
    to provide considerationsthat testers shoudl consider when attempting to measure
    netowrkconvergence using various methods.</p>"
