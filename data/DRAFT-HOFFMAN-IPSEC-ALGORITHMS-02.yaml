abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IKEv2 protocol [IKEv2] relies on security algorithms to provide\nprivacy
    and authentication between the initiator and responder. There\nare many such algorithms
    available, and two IKEv2 systems cannot\ninteroperate unless they are using the
    same algorithms. This document\nspecifies an initial set of algorithms for registration
    with IANA, and\nspecifies which are mandatory to implement. This document also
    specifies\noptional suites of algorithms and attributes that can be used to\nsimplify
    the administration of IKEv2.\n\t </p>\n      "
