abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to prove ownership of telephone numbers on the Internet,\n
    \  some kind of public infrastructure needs to exist that binds\n   cryptographic
    keys to authority over telephone numbers.  This\n   document describes a certificate-based
    credential system for\n   telephone numbers, which could be used as a part of
    a broader\n   architecture for managing telephone numbers as identities in\n   protocols
    like SIP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
