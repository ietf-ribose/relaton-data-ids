abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document outlines multiple advanced use cases and integrations\n
    \  that ACME facilitates without any modifications or enhancements\n   required
    to the base ACME specification.  These use cases are not\n   immediately obvious
    from reading the ACME specification and thus are\n   explicitly documented here.
    \ The use cases include ACME issuance of\n   subdomain certificates, and ACME
    integration with EST and TEAP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
