abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces a MIN_STREAM_DATA frame to enable partial reliability
    for QUIC streams. The MIN_STREAM_DATA frame allows a sender to give up on retransmitting
    older parts of a stream and to notify the receiver about this decision. The content
    of this draft is intended for merging into QUIC transport, recovery, and applicability
    drafts.</p>"
