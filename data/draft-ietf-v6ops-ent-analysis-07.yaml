abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the transition to IPv6 in enterprise networks
    focusing on IP Layer 3. These networks are characterized as having multiple internal
    links and one or more router connections to one or more Providers, and as being
    managed by a network operations entity. The analysis focuses on a base set of
    transition notational networks and requirements expanded from a previous document
    on enterprise scenarios. Discussion is provided on a focused set of transition
    analysis required for the enterprise to transition to IPv6, assuming a Dual-IP
    layer (IPv4 and IPv6) network and node environment within the enterprise. Then,
    a set of transition mechanisms are recommended for each notational network. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
