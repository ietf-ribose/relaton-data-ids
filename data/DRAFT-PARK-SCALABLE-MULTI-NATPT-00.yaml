abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides scalability extension to NAT-PT. The extension
    \nis based on the use of DNS-ALG and exchange of load metrics amongst a\ncluster
    of NAT-PT devices. We refer such a NAT-PT device as mNAT-PT. \nmNAT-PT is valuable
    in connecting large V6 domains to legacy V4 \ndomain.\n\t </p>\n      "
