abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft describes a method to achieve Fast Handoffs in MobileIPv6.
    Fast Handoffs are required in Mobile IPv6 in order to limitthe period of service
    disruption experienced by a wireless MobileNode when moving between access routers.
    This requirement becomeseven more important when supporting real-time services.
    FastHandoffs involve anticipating the movement of MNs by sendingmultiple copies
    of the traffic to potential Mobile Node movementlocations. Both flat and Hierarchical
    Mobile IPv6 models areconsidered. The Hierarchical MIPv6 mobility Management model
    in [1]already offers improvements to Mobile IP handoffs by providing alocal Mobility
    Anchor Point (MAP) functionality. Some additionsare made to the operation of this
    existing Hierarchical model toachieve Fast Handoffs.</p>"
