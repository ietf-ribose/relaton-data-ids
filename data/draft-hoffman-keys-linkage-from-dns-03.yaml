abstract:
- content: "<p>TLS and DTLS use certificates for authenticating the server. Users
    want their applications to verify that the certificate provided by the TLS server
    is in fact associated with the domain name they expect. Instead of trusting a
    certificate authority to have made this association correctly, the user might
    instead trust the authoritative DNS server for the domain name to make that association.
    This document describes how to use secure DNS to associate the TLS server's certificate
    with the the intended domain name.</p>"
