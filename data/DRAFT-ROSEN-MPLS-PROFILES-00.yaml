abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The MPLS protocol specifications provide a large number of options,\nand
    it can be difficult to know exactly which protocol messages,\nobjects, and procedures
    must be supported in order to provide some\nparticular application of MPLS, or
    in order to interoperate with some\nother implementation.  This document specifies
    a number of MPLS\n'Profiles'.  Each Profile is a subset of the full MPLS functionality,\nspecified
    in enough detail to ensure that two implementations of a\ngiven Profile will interoperate.
    \ This document also specifies which\nProfiles may be used for which purposes.
    \ In the future, it is hoped\nthat specifications for the applications of MPLS
    will specify the\nProfiles that must be implemented in order to support the\napplication.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
