abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In [I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition], the authors
    have\n   provided a definition of the route leak problem, and also enumerated\n
    \  several types of route leaks.  In this document, we first examine\n   which
    of those route-leak types are detected and mitigated by the\n   existing origin
    validation [RFC 6811] and BGPSEC path validation [I-\n   D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol].
    \ Where the current BGPSEC protocol\n   doesn't offer a solution, this document
    suggests an enhancement that\n   would extend the route-leak detection and mitigation
    capability of\n   BGPSEC.  The solution can be implemented in BGP without necessarily\n
    \  tying it to BGPSEC.  Incorporating the solution in BGPSEC is one way\n   of
    implementing it in a secure way.  We do not claim to have provided\n   a solution
    for all possible types of route leaks, but the solution\n   covers several, especially
    considering some significant route-leak\n   attacks or occurrences that have been
    observed in recent years.  The\n   document also includes a stopgap method for
    detection and mitigation\n   of route leaks for the phase when BGPSEC (path validation)
    is not yet\n   deployed but only origin validation is deployed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
