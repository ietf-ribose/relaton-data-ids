abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes current practices for combined use
    of the\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the eXtensible Messaging and\n
    \  Presence Protocol (XMPP).  Such practices aim to provide a single\n   fully
    featured real-time communication service by using complimenting\n   subsets of
    features from each of the protocols.  Typically such\n   subsets would include
    telephony oriented from SIP and instant\n   messaging and presence capabilities
    from XMPP.  This specification\n   does not define any new protocols or syntax
    for neither SIP nor XMPP.\n   However, implementing it may require modifying or
    at least\n   reconfiguring existing client and server-side software.  Also, it
    is\n   not the purpose of this document to make recommendations as to\n   whether
    or not such combined us should be preferred to the mechanisms\n   provided natively
    by each protocol like for example SIP's SIMPLE or\n   XMPP's Jingle.  It merely
    aims to provide guidance to those who are\n   interested in such a combined use.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
