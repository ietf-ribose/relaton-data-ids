abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a new type of response for the Constrained\n
    \  Application Protocol (CoAP) called a \"Pending\" response.  A CoAP\n   server
    can use a Pending response to indicate that it has accepted a\n   request but
    has not yet started processing it or that processing the\n   request will take
    longer than a client is typically willing to wait\n   for a response.\n\n\t </p>\n
