abstract:
- content: <p>A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance guarantees
    to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency (including
    bounded latency variation, i.e., "jitter"). As a result, securing a DetNet requires
    that in addition to the best practice security measures taken for any mission-critical
    network, additional security measures may be needed to secure the intended operation
    of these novel service properties. This document addresses DetNet-specific security
    considerations from the perspectives of both the DetNet system-level designer
    and component designer. System considerations include a taxonomy of relevant threats
    and attacks, and associations of threats versus use cases and service properties.
    Component-level considerations include ingress filtering and packet arrival-time
    violation detection. This document also addresses security considerations specific
    to the IP and MPLS data plane technologies, thereby complementing the Security
    Considerations sections of those documents.</p>
