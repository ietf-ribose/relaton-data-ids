abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the existing IPv6 mechanisms for ping and
    traceroute can be used in an SRv6 network. The document also specifies the OAM
    flag in the Segment Routing Header (SRH) for performing controllable and predictable
    flow sampling from segment endpoints. In addition, the document describes how
    a centralized monitoring system performs a path continuity check between any nodes
    within an SRv6 domain.</p>"
