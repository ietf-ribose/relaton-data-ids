abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a coping mechanism used to deal with
    the\n   unpredictable disruption problem and congestion control problem in\n   Space
    Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) [RFC4838]. Since Licklider\n   Transmission Protocol
    (LTP) [RFC5326] provides retransmission-based\n   reliability for bundles, several
    times of retransmissions can be\n   seen as a failure occurred over links. The
    proposed mechanism is\n   used to direct the following packets to other nodes
    as soon as the\n   selected path is detected as disruption or congestion and probes
    the\n   availability of the links which has disrupted unexpectedly.\n\n\t </p>\n
