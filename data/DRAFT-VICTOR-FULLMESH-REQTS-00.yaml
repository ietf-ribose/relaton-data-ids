abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo enumerates requirements to realize full-mesh multiparty
    \nconferencing using baseline Session Initiation Protocol. Primary \nrequirement
    is to advertise conference membersâ€™ addresses to new \nparticipants by concatenating
    multiple SDP session descriptions \ntogether. This particular requirement can
    solve several well-known \nproblems, including disjoint meshes and race conditions,
    that are \nlingering in full-mesh conferencing for a while now. \n\t </p>\n      "
