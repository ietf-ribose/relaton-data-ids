abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module
    which\n   contains Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Multiprotocol\n
    \  Label Switching (MPLS) management information.  The intent is that\n   these
    TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in MPLS\n   related MIB modules
    that would otherwise define their own\n   representations.  This document obsoletes
    RFC3811 as it addresses the\n   need to support IPv6 extended TunnelID's by defining
    a new TC-\n   MplsNewExtendedTunnelID which suggests using IPv4 address of the\n
    \  ingress or egress LSR for the tunnel for an IPv6 network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
