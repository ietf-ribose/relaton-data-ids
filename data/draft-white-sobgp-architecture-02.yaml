abstract:
  content: "<p>There is a great deal of concern over the security of internetworksbuilt
    using the Border Gateway Protocol to provide routinginformation to autonomous
    systems connected to the internetwork.This draft provides an architecture for
    a secure distributed registryof routing information to address these concerns.
    The draft beginswith an overview of the operation of this system, and then followswith
    various deployment scenarios, starting with what we believe willbe the most common
    deployment option.</p>"
