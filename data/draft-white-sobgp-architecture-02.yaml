abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a great deal of concern over the security of internetworks
    built using the Border Gateway Protocol to provide routing information to autonomous
    systems connected to the internetwork. This draft provides an architecture for
    a secure distributed registry of routing information to address these concerns.
    The draft begins with an overview of the operation of this system, and then follows
    with various deployment scenarios, starting with what we believe will be the most
    common deployment option.</p>"
