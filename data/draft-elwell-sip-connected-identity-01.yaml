abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Because of retargeting of a dialog-forming request, the UAS can
    havea different identity from that in the To header. This documentprovides a means
    for that UA to supply its identity to the peer UA bymeans of a request in the
    reverse direction and for that identity tobe signed by an authentication service.
    The same mechanism can beused to indicate a change of identity during a dialog,
    e.g., becauseof some action in a PSTN behind a gateway.This work is being discussed
    on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
