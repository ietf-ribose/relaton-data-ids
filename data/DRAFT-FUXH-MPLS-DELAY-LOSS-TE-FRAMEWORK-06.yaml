abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Deployment and usage of cloud based applications and services
    that use\n   an underlying MPLS network are expanding and an increasing number
    of\n   applications are extremely sensitive to delay and packet loss.\n   Furthermore,
    in cloud computing an additional decision problem arises of\n   simultaneously
    choosing the data center to host applications along with\n   MPLS network connectivity
    such that the overall performance of the\n   application is met. Mechanisms exist
    to measure and monitor MPLS path\n   performance parameters for packet loss and
    delay, but the mechanisms\n   work only after the path has been setup. The cloud-based
    and performance\n   sensitive applications would benefit from measurement of MPLS
    network\n   and potential path information that would be provided for use in the\n
    \  computation before LSP setup and then the selection of LSPs.\n\n   This document
    provides a framework and architecture to solve operator\n   problems and requirements
    using current/proposed approaches, documents\n   scalability assessment and recommendations,
    and identifies any needed\n   protocol development.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
