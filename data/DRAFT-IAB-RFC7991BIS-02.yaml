abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the \"xml2rfc\" version 3 vocabulary:
    an XML-\n   based language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts.  It is\n
    \  heavily derived from the version 2 vocabulary that is also under\n   discussion.
    \ This document obsoletes the earlier v3 grammar described\n   in RFC 7991, which
    in turn obsoleted the v2 grammar in RFC 7749.\n\nEditorial Note (To be removed
    by RFC Editor)\n\n   Discussion of this draft takes place on the xml2rfc-dev@ietf.org\n
    \  mailing list, which has its home page at\n   &lt;https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/xml2rfc-dev&gt;.\n\n\t
