abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the problems that enterprises face
    today\n   when interconnecting their branch offices with dynamic workloads in\n
    \  third party data centers (a.k.a. Cloud DCs). There can be many\n   problems
    associated with network connecting to or among Clouds, many\n   of which probably
    are out of the IETF scope. The objective of this\n   document is to identify some
    of the problems that need additional\n   work in IETF Routing area. Other problems
    are out of the scope of\n   this document.\n\n   It examines some of the approaches
    interconnecting cloud DCs with\n   enterprises' on-premises DCs &amp; branch offices.
    This document also\n   describes some of the network problems that many enterprises
    face\n   when they have workloads &amp; applications &amp; data split among different\n
    \  data centers, especially for those enterprises with multiple sites\n   that
    are already interconnected by VPNs (e.g., MPLS L2VPN/L3VPN).\n\n   Current operational
    problems are examined to determine whether there\n   is a need to improve existing
    protocols or whether a new protocol is\n   necessary to solve them.\n\n\t </p>\n
