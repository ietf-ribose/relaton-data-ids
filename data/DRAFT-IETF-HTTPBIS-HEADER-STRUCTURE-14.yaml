abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a set of data types and associated
    algorithms\n   that are intended to make it easier and safer to define and handle\n
    \  HTTP header fields.  It is intended for use by specifications of new\n   HTTP
    header fields that wish to use a common syntax that is more\n   restrictive than
    traditional HTTP field values.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
