abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTCP with a new
    RTCP\nXR (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding media\ntransmission
    or reception quality, as proposed in\ndraft-ietf-avt-rtcp-guidelines (work in
    progress [replace with RFC\nnumber]).  This memo suggests that a new block should
    contain a\nsingle metric or a small number of metrics relevant to a single\nparameter
    of interest or concern, rather than containing a number of\nmetrics which attempt
    to provide full coverage of all those\nparameters of concern to a specific application.
    \ Applications may\nthen \"mix and match\" to create a set of blocks which covers
    their set\nof concerns.  Where possible, a specific block should be designed to\nbe
    re-usable across more than one application, for example, for all\nof voice, streaming
    audio and video.\n\t </p>\n      "
