abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>During the development of Internationalized Domain Name (IDN),
    it is\ndiscovered that there is a substantial lack of information and\nmisunderstanding
    on Han ideographs and its folding mechanism.\n\nThis document attempts to address
    some of the issues on doing han\nfolding with respect to IDN. Hopefully, this
    will dispel some of the\ncommon misunderstanding of this problem and to discuss
    some of the\nissues with han ideograph and its folding mechanism.\n\nThis document
    addresses very specific problem to IDN and thus is not\nmeant as a reference for
    generic Han folding. Generic Han folding are\nmuch more complicated and certainly
    beyond this document. However, the\nuse of this document may be applicable to
    other areas that are related\nwith names, e.g. Common Name Resolution Protocol
    [CNRP].\n\t </p>\n      "
