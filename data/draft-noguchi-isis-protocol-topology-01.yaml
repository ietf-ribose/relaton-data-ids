abstract:
  content: "<p>RFC 1195 [1] documents a dual routing protocol that can be used toroute
    both CLNP and IPv4, that is Integrated IS-IS. [2] addsfunctionality to Integrated
    IS-IS so that it supports IPv6.RFC 1195 [1] places topological restrictions on
    networks that arerouted using Integrated IS-IS, specifically, that every router
    in alevel-1 area must be capable of all network layer protocols that arepresent
    in that area, and every router in a level-2 area must becapable of all network
    layer protocols that are present in the wholeIS-IS routing domain.The mechanism
    described in this document enables a single IS-ISrouting domain to support different
    network layer protocol topologiesby maintaining separate SPF trees for each network
    layer protocol.</p>"
