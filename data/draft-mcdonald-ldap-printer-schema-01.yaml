abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines a schema, object classes and attributes, for
    printers and printer services, for use with directories that support Lightweight
    Directory Access Protocol (RFC 4510). This document is based on the printer attributes
    listed in Appendix E of Internet Printing Protocol/1.1 (IPP) (RFC 2911). A few
    additional printer attributes are based on definitions in the Printer MIB (RFC
    1759), IEEE-ISTO PWG Command Set for IEEE 1284 Device ID (PWG 5107.2), or IEEE-ISTO
    PWG IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 [PWG5100.JPS3].</p>"
