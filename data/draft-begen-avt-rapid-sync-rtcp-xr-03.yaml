abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In most RTP-based multicast applications, the RTP source sends inter-related
    data. Due to this interdependency, randomly joining RTPreceivers usually cannot
    start consuming the multicast data rightafter they join the session. Thus, they
    often experience a randomacquisition delay. One approach to reduce this delay
    is to use anauxiliary unicast RTP session with a retransmission server to receivea
    burst stream that facilitates rapid acquisition of the multicaststream. An RTP
    receiver may use this approach (or any otherapproach) to achieve rapid acquisition.
    Yet, due to various factors,performance of the rapid acquisition methods usually
    varies.Furthermore, in some cases the RTP receiver may (or may have to) do asimple
    multicast join. For quality reporting, monitoring anddiagnostics purposes, it
    is important to collect detailed informationfrom the RTP receivers about their
    acquisition and presentationexperiences. This document addresses this issue by
    defining a newreport block type, called Multicast Acquisition (MA) Report Block,within
    the framework of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports(XR). This document
    also defines the necessary signaling of the newMA report block type in the Session
    Description Protocol (SDP).</p>"
