abstract:
- content: "<p>The document specifies a new BGP NLRI and SAFI for advertising WAN
    ports properties of a SDWAN edge node. SDWAN edge node's WAN ports may face untrusted
    networks, such as the public internet, may get assigned IP addresses from the
    Internet Service Providers (ISPs), may get assigned dynamic IP addresses via DHCP,
    or may have private addresses (e.g. inside third party Cloud DCs). Packets forwarded
    through those SDWAN WAN ports might need to be encrypted (depending on the user
    policies) or need to go through NAT. SDWAN edge nodes need to propagate those
    WAN ports properties to the peers who are authorized to communicate across different
    types of underlay networks including the untrusted networks. BGP Route Reflectors
    (RR) are proposed as the entities to propagate the WAN ports properties of SDWAN
    edge nodes to a controlled group of edges reachable via overlay networks.</p>"
