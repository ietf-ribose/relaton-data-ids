abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a new suboption of the DHCP relay information\noption
    [6] which allows the DHCP relay to specify a new value for the\nServer-ID option,
    which is inserted by the DHCP Server.  In some\ncases it is convenient for the
    DHCP relay to act as the actual DHCP\nserver such that DHCP RENEWAL requests will
    come to the relay instead\nof going to the server directly.  This gives the relay
    the\nopportunity to include the Relay Agent option with appropriate\nsuboptions
    even on RENEWAL messages.\nThis new relay agent suboption allows the relay to
    tell the DHCP\nserver what value to use in the Server-ID option [3].  If this\nsuboption
    is not present, the server should build the Server-ID\noption in the normal fashion.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
