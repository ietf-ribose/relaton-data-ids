abstract:
- content: <p>This specification describes how to declare in a CBOR Web Token (CWT)
    that the presenter of the CWT possesses a particular proof-of- possession key.
    Being able to prove possession of a key is also sometimes described as the presenter
    being a holder-of-key. This specification provides equivalent functionality to
    "Proof-of- Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)" (RFC 7800), but
    using CBOR and CWTs rather than JSON and JWTs.</p>
