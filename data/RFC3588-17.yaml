abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Diameter base protocol is intended to provide an Authentication,
    Authorization and Accounting (AAA) framework for applications such as network
    access or IP mobility.  Diameter is also intended to work in both local Authentication,
    Authorization &amp; Accounting and roaming situations.  This document specifies
    the message format, transport, error reporting, accounting and security services
    to be used by all Diameter applications.  The Diameter base application needs
    to be supported by all Diameter implementations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t </p>\n
