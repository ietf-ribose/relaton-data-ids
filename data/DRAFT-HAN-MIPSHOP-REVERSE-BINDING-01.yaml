abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo proposes a scheme that utilizes only pre-established
    bi-\ndirectional tunnels between LMA and MAGs to support a fast handover\neffectively
    in Proxy Mobile IPv6.  To expedite the handover\nprocedure, we define new signaling
    messages, Fast PBU/PBA and Reverse\nPBU/PBA, exchanged by LMA and MAGs.  Because
    any signaling messages\nexchanged by two MAGs are neither created nor utilized
    and thus bi-\ndirectional tunnel between MAGs is not created, the proposed scheme\nputs
    less overload upon network than the existing fast handover\nscheme for PMIPv6.
    \ It can also tackle effectively with the so-called\nping-pong movement of mobile
    nodes.\n\t </p>\n      "
