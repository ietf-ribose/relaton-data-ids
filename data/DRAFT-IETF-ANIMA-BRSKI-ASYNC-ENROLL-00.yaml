abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes enhancements of bootstrapping a remote
    secure\n   key infrastructure (BRSKI) to also operate in domains featuring no
    or\n   only timely limited connectivity between involved components.  It\n   addresses
    connectivity to backend services supporting enrollment like\n   a Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI) and also to the connectivity\n   between pledge and registrar.  For this
    it enhances the use of\n   authenticated self-contained objects in BRSKI also
    for request and\n   distribution of deployment domain specific device certificates.
    \ The\n   defined approach is agnostic regarding the utilized enrollment\n   protocol
    allowing the application of existing and potentially new\n   certificate management
    protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
