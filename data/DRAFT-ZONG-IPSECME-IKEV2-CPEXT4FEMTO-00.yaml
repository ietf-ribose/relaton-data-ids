abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPSec IKEv2, RFC 5996 [RFC5996], has been adopted by many\n
    \  standardized network solutions to provide the secure transport\n   between
    network elements over third party's infrastructure.  Today\n   Femtocell deployment
    requires the mobile operator's Femtocell AP\n   (FAP) to leverage the IPSec IKEv2
    to support mutual authentication\n   and data protection between the insecure
    Femtocell, which typically\n   deployed in customer's premise, and its corresponding
    mobile core\n   network.\n\n   A known security threat exists in Femto architecture
    for failing to\n   validate the FAP's identity and information provided by FAP
    at the\n   mobile operator's core network.\n\n   This document reviews this security
    threat and proposes a simple\n   extension of the IKEv2 to resolve the issue.\n\n\n\t
