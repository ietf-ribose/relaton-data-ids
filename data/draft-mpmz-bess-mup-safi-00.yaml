abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new SAFI known as a BGP Mobile User Plane (BGP-MUP)
    SAFI to support MUP Extensions and a extended community for BGP. This document
    also provides BGP signaling and procedures for the new SAFI to convert mobile
    session information into appropriate IP forwarding information. These extensions
    can be used by operators between MUP PE, MUP GW and MUP Controller for integrating
    mobile user plane into BGP MUP network using the IP based routing.</p>"
