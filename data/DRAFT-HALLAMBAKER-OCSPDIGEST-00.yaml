abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The OCSP digest extension creates a strong cryptographic binding\n
    \  between an OCSP token and the certificate it asserts a status value\n   for.
    \ Support for the digest identifier extension permits a\n   certificate issuer
    to employ a high assurance cryptographic digest\n   function such as SHA2 to attest
    to the authenticity of their\n   certificates in a fashion that is fully downwards
    compatible with\n   legacy clients that only support SHA1.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
