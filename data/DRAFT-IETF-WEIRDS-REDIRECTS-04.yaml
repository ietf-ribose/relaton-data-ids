abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The traditional WHOIS protocol has several important shortcomings,\n
    \  and over the past few years several approaches to a better\n   Registration
    Data Access Protocol (RDAP) have been discussed and\n   proposed.\n\n   It is
    worth noting that the term WHOIS is sometimes used\n   interchangeably to mean
    either (a) the registration data itself or\n   (b) the protocol used to access
    registration data\n\n   Among these shortcomings, different registries operate
    different\n   WHOIS services.  For users this means that several WHOIS queries
    to\n   different registries may be necessary in order to obtain data for a\n   given
    resource.\n\n   This document describes a redirection service for RDAP queries.
    \ This\n   service allows clients to query a single RDAP service and expect\n
    \  either an authoritative answer or a redirection hint pointing to\n   another,
    possibly authoritative, RDAP server.\n\n   The solution implemented proposed here
    applies to Regional Internet\n   Registries(RIRs) and Domain Name Registries(DNRs).\n\n\t
