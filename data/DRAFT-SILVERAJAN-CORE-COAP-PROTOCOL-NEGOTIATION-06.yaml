abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP has been standardised as an application-level REST-based\n
    \  protocol.  When multiple transport protocols exist for exchanging\n   CoAP
    resource representations, this document introduces a way forward\n   for CoAP
    endpoints as well as intermediaries to agree upon alternate\n   transport and
    protocol configurations as well as URIs for CoAP\n   messaging. 2 mechanisms are
    proposed: The first by extending the CoRE\n   Resource Directory with new parameter
    types and the second, by\n   introducing a new CoAP Option with which clients
    can interact\n   directly with servers without needing the Resource Directory.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
