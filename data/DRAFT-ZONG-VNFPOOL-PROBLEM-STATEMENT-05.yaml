abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network functions are traditionally implemented on specialized\n
    \  hardware rather than on general purpose servers, but there is a clear\n   trend
    to implement a number of network functions, such as firewall or\n   load balancer,
    as software on virtualized computing platforms.  These\n   virtualized functions
    are called Virtualized Network Functions\n   (VNFs), which can be used to build
    network services.  The use of VNFs\n   to build network services introduces additional
    challenges on\n   reliability, such as additional points of failure and the need
    to\n   coordinate various VNFs.\n\n   This document introduces a general idea
    of VNF Pool to support\n   reliable function provision by the VNFs.  We then highlight
    the\n   reliability challenges and issues when using the VNFs to build\n   services.
    \ Related IETF works are also briefly described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
