abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a content sharing usage for REsource LOcation
    And Discovery (RELOAD). The content sharing usage provides the functionality of
    distributing and fetching shared content to and from a P2P overlay network. The
    shared content including such as streaming media, files etc. are provided by those
    shared content service providers. Using content sharing usage of RELOAD can construct
    a peer-to-peer overlay, the overlay performs as Content Delivery Network and is
    service insensitive.</p>"
