abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multi-homed networks based on IPv6 form an important architecture\n
    \  within the NEMO (NEtwork MObility) configurations. Mainly in these\n   networks
    the Mobile Router (MR) can appear in the neighbourhood of\n   several Access Routers
    (ARs). In this case, MR has several egress\n   interfaces and can detect several
    ARs simultaneously.\n\n   This draft introduces a protocol that achieves handoff
    and resource\n   management in a NEMO network in the case of multi-homed MR. We
    called\n   this protocol an HRMMN protocol (Handoff and Resource Management for\n
    \  Multi-homed Networks). We introduce into the NEMO architecture an\n   intelligent
    control entity called Access Router Controller (ARC).\n   Based on traffic information
    transmitted through several ARs under\n   the control of specific ARC, this latter
    is responsible of taking\n   decisions about handoff, resource management and
    maintain of multiple\n   bidirectional tunnels.\n\t </p>\n      "
