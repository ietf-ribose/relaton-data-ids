abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft summarizes the results in some experiments looking
    at the\n   impact of proposed changes to ICE based on the latest consumer NATs.\n
    \  It looks and the amount of non congestion controlled bandwidth a\n   browser
    can use and the impacts of that on ICE timing.\n\n   This draft is not meant to
    become an RFC.  It is purely information\n   to help guide development of other
    specifications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
