abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance\n
    \  guarantees to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates\n   and
    bounded latency.  As a result, securing a DetNet requires that in\n   addition
    to the best practice security measures taken for any\n   mission-critical network,
    additional security measures may be needed\n   to secure the intended operation
    of these novel service properties.\n\n   This document addresses DetNet-specific
    security considerations from\n   the perspectives of both the DetNet system-level
    designer and\n   component designer.  System considerations include a threat model,\n
    \  taxonomy of relevant attacks, and associations of threats versus use\n   cases
    and service properties.  Component-level considerations include\n   ingress filtering
    and packet arrival time violation detection.  This\n   document also addresses
    DetNet security considerations specific to\n   the IP and MPLS data plane technologies
    thereby complementing the\n   Security Considerations sections of the various
    DetNet Data Plane\n   (and other) DetNet documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
