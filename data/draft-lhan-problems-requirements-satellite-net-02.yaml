abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the detailed analysis about the problems and
    requirements of satellite constellation used for Internet. It starts from the
    satellite orbit basics, coverage calculation, then it estimates the time constraints
    for the communications between satellite and ground-station, also between satellites.
    How to use satellite constellation for Internet is discussed in detail including
    the satellite relay and satellite networking. The problems and requirements of
    using traditional network technology for satellite network integrating with Internet
    are finally outlined.</p>"
