abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a backward compatible optimization for theDatabase
    Exchange process in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3. In thisoptimization, a router does not
    list an LSA in Database Descriptionpackets sent to a neighbor, if the same or
    a more recent instance ofthe LSA was listed in a Database Description packet already
    receivedfrom the neighbor. This optimization reduces Database Descriptionoverhead
    by about 50% in large networks. This optimization does notaffect synchronization,
    since it only omits unnecessary informationfrom Database Description packets.</p>"
