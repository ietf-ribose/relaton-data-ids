abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo introduces a new authorization scheme for SMTP e-mail\n
    \  transport.  It is designed to be a simple and robust protection\n   against
    e-mail fraud, spam, and worms.  It is based solely on\n   organisational security
    mechanisms and does not require but still\n   allow use of cryptography.  This
    memo also focuses on security and\n   privacy problems and requirements in context
    of spam defense.\n   This document is part of the LMAP work of the Anti-Spam Research\n
    \  Group (ASRG) of the IRTF.\n\t </p>\n      "
