abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this memo is to document how the requirements for advancing
    a routing protocol to Full Standard have been satisfied by Border Gateway Protocol
    version 4 (BGP-4). This report documents experience with BGP. It is the second
    of two reports on the BGP protocol. The remaining sections of this memo document
    how BGP satisfies General Requirements specified in Section 3.0, as well as the
    Requirements for Full Standard as specified in Section 6.0 of the 'Internet Routing
    Protocol Standardization Criteria' document [1]. Please send comments to bgp@ans.net.</p>"
