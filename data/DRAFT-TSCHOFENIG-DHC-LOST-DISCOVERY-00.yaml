abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) describes
    an XML-\nbased protocol for mapping service identifiers and geospatial or\ncivic
    location information to service contact Uniform Resource\nLocators (URIs).  LoST
    servers can be located anywhere but a\nplacement closer to the end host, i.e.,
    in the access network, is\ndesireable.  Such a LoST server placement provides
    benefits in\ndisaster situations with intermittent network connectivity regarding\nthe
    resiliency of emergency service communication.\n\nThis document describes such
    a LoST discovery procedure based on\nDHCP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
