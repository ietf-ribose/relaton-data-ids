abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies foundational use cases, derived functional
    capabilities, and requirements needed to provide a foundation for creating interoperable
    automation tools and continuous monitoring solutions that provide visibility into
    the state of assets, user activities, and network behavior. Stakeholders will
    be able to use these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant security and operational
    data to understand the organizations security posture, quantify business risk,
    and make informed decisions that support organizational objectives while protecting
    critical information. Organizations will be able to use these tools to augment
    and automate information sharing activities to collaborate with partners to identify
    and mitigate threats. Other automation tools will be able to integrate with these
    capabilities to enforce policies based on human decisions to harden systems, prevent
    misuse and reduce the overall attack surface.</p>"
