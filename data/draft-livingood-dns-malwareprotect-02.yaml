  content: "\t <t>The objective of this document is to describe the design of so-calledDNS-based
    malware protection services deployed by Internet ServiceProviders (ISPs), DNS
    Application Service Providers (ASPs), and otherorganizations. These organizations
    provide so-called DNS-basedmalware protection services via their recursive DNS
    servers. Thisdocument specifically and narrowly addresses those cases where theseDNS
    servers are being utilized to provide a service for end userswhich blocks domains
    hosting malicious software, and makesrecommendations concerning operation of such
    a service.</p>"
