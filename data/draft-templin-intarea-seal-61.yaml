abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies a Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer
    (SEAL). SEAL operates over virtual topologies configured over connected IP network
    routing regions bounded by encapsulating border nodes. These virtual topologies
    are manifested by tunnels that may span multiple IP and/or sub-IP layer forwarding
    hops, where they may incur packet duplication, packet reordering, source address
    spoofing and traversal of links with diverse Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs).
    SEAL addresses these issues through the encapsulation and messaging mechanisms
    specified in this document.</p>"
