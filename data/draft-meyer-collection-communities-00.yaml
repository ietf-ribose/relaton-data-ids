abstract:
  content: "\t <t>BGP communities (RFC 1997) are used by service providers for manypurposes,
    including tagging of customer, peer, and geographicallyoriginated routes. Such
    tagging is typically used to control thescope of redistribution of routes within
    a provider's network, and toits peers and customers. With the advent of large
    scale BGP datacollection (and associated research), it has become clear that theinformation
    carried in such communities is essential for a deeperunderstanding of the global
    routing system. This document definesstandard (outbound) communities and their
    encodings for export to BGProute collectors.</p>"
