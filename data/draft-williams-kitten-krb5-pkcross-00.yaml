abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a protocol for obtaining cross-realm Kerberos
    tickets using existing, related protocols. The resulting protocol has a number
    of desirable security properties, including privacy protection for the user relative
    to their home realm's infrastructure, as well a support for leap-of-faith trust
    establishment, and automated cross-realm keying. This protocol allows Kerberos
    to scale to large numbers of realms.</p>"
