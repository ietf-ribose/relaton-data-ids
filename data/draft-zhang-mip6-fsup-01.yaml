abstract:
- content: "<p>A mobile IPv6 node remains reachable when it moves in a IPv6 Internet.
    However, if such a node, i.e. MN, moves to a network which is protected by firewalls,
    the communication that is already existed before its moving may be blocked by
    firewall. The document presents a mechanism to update the corresponding access
    control entry of firewall to avoid the communication interrupted.</p>"
