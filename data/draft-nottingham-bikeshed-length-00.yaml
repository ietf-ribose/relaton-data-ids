abstract:
- content: "<p>The HTTP Content-Length header field is overloaded with (at least)
    two duties: message delimitation in HTTP/1, and metadata about the length of an
    incoming request body to the software handling it. This causes confusion, and
    sometimes problems. This document proposes a new header to untangle these semantics
    (at least partially).</p>"
