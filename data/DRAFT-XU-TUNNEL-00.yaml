abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Virtual Aggregation (VA) is a mechanism for shrinking the size
    of the\nDFZ FIB in routers [I-D.francis-intra-va].  VA can result in longer\npaths
    and increased load on routers within the ISP that deploys VA.\nThis document describes
    a mechanism that allows an AS that originates\na route to associate a tunnel endpoint
    terminating at itself with the\nroute.  This allows routers in a remote AS to
    tunnel packets to the\noriginating AS.  If transit ASes between the remote AS
    and the\noriginating AS install the prefixes associated with tunnel endpoints\nin
    their FIBs, then tunneled packets that transit through them will\ntake the shortest
    path.  This results in reduced load for the transit\nAS, and better performance
    for the customers at the source and\ndestination.\n\t </p>\n      "
