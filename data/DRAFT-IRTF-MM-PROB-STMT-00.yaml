abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IP [1] has been developed in the IETF for a number of years
    already.\nIt's simplicity and scalability give it a growing success within the
    \nIETF as several Internet drafts are proposed to extend various \nimprovements
    for Mobile IP and its counterpart designed \nfor IPv6, Mobile IPv6 [2].  Mobile
    IP suffers from several well-known \nweaknesses that have led to the definition
    of the macro/micro-mobility  \narchitecture.  Such an architecture implies the
    division of the mobility \narchitecture into two different parts: mobility management
    at a \nlarge scale, between the different domains (macro-mobility), and, on the
    other hand, at a local scale, inside these domains (micro-mobility).  Each type
    of mobility is then managed by specific mechanisms and protocols.  \nThe macro-micro
    approach results in many advantages that all \nmicro-mobility protocols will have;
    thereby effectively addressing weaknesses that plague Mobile IP.\n\nThis document
    discusses the micro-mobility problem, and is an attempt to\nenumerate some of
    the concepts and approaches defining the micromobility\nproblem space.  This draft
    will serve to document the problem\nspace and definition of micro-mobility for
    discussion in the IRTF\nmicro-mobility working group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
