abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a strawman summary of information that
    should\n   be used for the LWM2M specification [LWM2M].  LWM2M is based on CoAP,\n
    \  on top of which it describes certain management interfaces and data\n   models
    that go beyond the CoAP specifications itself.  However LWM2M\n   does not describe
    all behavior that should be expected from\n   implementations of the CoAP specifications.
    \ This document attempts\n   to clarify what should be present in a LWM2M system
    beyond what is\n   specified in the LWM2M documents.  Additionally, this document
    also\n   adds information about IPSO Objects [IPSO] and their usage with LWM2M\n
    \  as application protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
