abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a taxonomy of \"Alternative Network\n
    \  deployments\", and a set of definitions and shared characteristics.\n   It
    also discusses the technologies employed in these network\n   deployments, and
    their differing architectural characteristics.\n\n   The term \"Alternative Network
    deployments\" includes a set of network\n   access models that have emerged in
    the last decade with the aim of\n   bringing Internet connectivity to people,
    using topological,\n   architectural and business models different from the so-called\n
    \  \"traditional\" ones, where a company deploys or leases the network\n   infrastructure
    for connecting the users, who pay a subscription fee\n   to be connected and make
    use of it.\n\n   Several initiatives throughout the world have built large scale\n
    \  networks that are alternative to the traditional network operator\n   deployments
    using predominantly wireless technologies (including long\n   distance) due to
    the reduced cost of using the unlicensed spectrum.\n   Wired technologies such
    as fiber are also used in some of these\n   alternate networks.  There are several
    types of such alternate\n   network: networks such as community networks are self-organized
    and\n   decentralized networks wholly owned by the community; networks owned\n
    \  by individuals who act as wireless internet service providers\n   (WISPs),
    networks owned by individuals but leased out to network\n   operators who use
    such networks as a low-cost medium to reach the\n   underserved population and
    finally there are networks that provide\n   connectivity by sharing wireless resources
    of the users.\n\n   The emergence of these networks can be motivated by different
    causes\n   such as the reluctance, or the impossibility, of network operators
    to\n   provide wired and cellular infrastructures to rural/remote areas.  In\n
    \  these cases, the networks have self sustainable business models that\n   provide
    more localised communication services as well as Internet\n   backhaul support
    through peering agreements with traditional network\n   operators.  Some other
    times, networks are built as a complement and\n   an alternative to commercial
    Internet access provided by\n   \"traditional\" network operators.\n\n   The present
    classification considers different existing network\n   models such as Community
    Networks, open wireless services, user-\n   extensible services, traditional local
    Internet Service Providers\n   (ISPs), new global ISPs, etc.  Different criteria
    are used in order\n   to build a classification as e.g., the ownership of the
    equipment,\n   the way the network is organized, the participatory model, the\n
    \  extensibility, if they are driven by a community, a company or a\n   local
    (public or private) stakeholder, etc.\n\n   According to the developed taxonomy,
    a characterization of each kind\n   of network is presented, in terms of specific
    network characteristics\n   related to architecture, organization, etc.\n\n\t
