abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF PCN Working Group has continued its work investigating
    pre-\ncongestion and admission control mechanisms.  This work has\nprogressed
    under the current charter, but has not yet considered\nrelated legacy PSTN interactions
    or the need for ubiquitous\nconnectivity between users on dissimilar networks.
    \ The PCN charter\ncould be improved by a strong positive statement to the effect\ncommitting
    to future work addressing legacy networks.\n\nIn that light, please consider the
    questions below which include\ndifferential PCN treatment based on traffic types,
    security, and PSTN\ninteroperability concerns.  It seems helpful to have a touchstone
    of\nsome concerns relative to the PSTN network and IP network Gateway in\norder
    to confirm that they will be addressed in future work.  This\nattempt is motivated
    by a desire to avoid the accidental omission of\na topic that may be hard to \"retrofit\"
    in later.\n\t </p>\n      "
