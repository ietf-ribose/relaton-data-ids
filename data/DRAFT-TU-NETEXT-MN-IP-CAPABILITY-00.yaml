abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   WiFi is beginning to be considered as a trusted non-3GPP access\n
    \  network which can provide the service of accessing to the EPC core\n   network
    to the user.  And EAP/AKA(and EAP/AKA') is specified as the\n   access authentication
    protocol in this case.  This document defines a\n   new EAP attribute to provide
    the mobile node IPv4/IPv6/IPv4v6\n   capability to the network so that mobile
    node IP address/prefix\n   assignment and PMIP session establishment can be processed\n
    \  accordingly.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
