abstract:
- content: "<p>Third party call control refers to the ability of one entity to create
    a call in which communication is actually between other parties. Third party call
    control is possible using the mechanisms specified within the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP). However, there are several possible approaches, each with different
    benefits and drawbacks. This document discusses best current practices for the
    usage of SIP for third party call control. This document specifies an Internet
    Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and
    suggestions for improvements.</p>"
