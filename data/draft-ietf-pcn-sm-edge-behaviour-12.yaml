abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is a means for protecting the quality
    of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. The overall PCN
    architecture is described in RFC 5559. This memo is one of a series describing
    possible boundary-node behaviors for a PCN-domain. The behavior described here
    is that for a form of measurement-based load control using two PCN marking states:
    not- marked and excess-traffic-marked. This behavior is known informally as the
    Single Marking (SM) PCN-boundary-node behavior. This document defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
