abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When a local LAN running spanning tree protocol connecting
    to TRILL\n   campus via more than one RBridge, there are several ways to perform\n
    \  loop avoidance. One of them illustrated by RFC6325 [RFC6325] A.3 was\n   to
    make relevant ports on edge RBridges involving in spanning tree\n   calculation.
    When edge RBridges are emulated as a single highest\n   priority root, the local
    bridged LAN will be naturally partitioned\n   after running spanning tree protocol.
    This approach achieves better\n   link utilization and intra-VLAN load balancing
    in some scenarios.\n   This document describes how the edge RBridges react to
    topology\n   change occurring in bridged LAN in order to make the abovementioned\n
    \  spanning tree approach function correct.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
