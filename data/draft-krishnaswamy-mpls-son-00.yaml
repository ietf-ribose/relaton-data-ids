abstract:
- content: "<p>The advent of switched multi-channel (WDM) optical networks using OXCs
    (Optical Cross-connects) presents many new opportunities for supporting faster
    and more flexible provision of IP services. Key to realizing such opportunities
    is providing the ability to automatically set-up and tear-down paths (optical
    channels) across the optical network, and provide means for IP services to leverage
    this capability. Therefore, it is necessary to establish supporting protocols
    and mechanisms. In this draft we study the requirements and mechanisms for optical
    network topology discovery, signaling path setup, data path computation, and optical
    channel set-up. We leverage MPLS and other IP based protocols as a basis for achieving
    the above objectives.</p>"
