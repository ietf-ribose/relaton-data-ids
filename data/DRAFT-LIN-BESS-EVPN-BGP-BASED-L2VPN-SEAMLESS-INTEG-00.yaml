abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a seamless integration solution for
    BGP-based\n   Layer-2 VPN (L2VPN) and EVPN to provide point-to-point Virtual\n
    \  Private Wire Service (VPWS).  In addition, this document also extends\n   the
    existing seamless integration for multipoint Ethernet VPN service\n   with all-active
    multihoming support.  The specified solution allows\n   the coexistence of EVPN
    and L2VPN services under the same point-to-\n   point or multipoint VPN instance.
    \ By using this seamless integration\n   solution, a service provider can introduce
    EVPN into their existing\n   L2VPN network or migrate from an existing L2VPN based
    network to\n   EVPN.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
