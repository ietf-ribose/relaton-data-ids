  content: "\n\t <p>   The Centralized Conferencing (XCON) framework defines a model
    whereby\n   client initiated interactions are required for creation, deletion,\n
    \  manipulation and querying the state of a of conference.  This\n   document
    defines a Media Control Channel Package for XCON\n   conferencing client initiated
    Conference Control.  The Package is\n   based on the Media Control Channel Framework,
    which is also used for\n   media server control, thus optimizing the implementation
    for some\n   entities participating in an XCON system.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
