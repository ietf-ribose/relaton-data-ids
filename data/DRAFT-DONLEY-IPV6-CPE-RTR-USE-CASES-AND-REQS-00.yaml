abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document captures use cases and associated requirements for
    an\nIPv6 Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) router.  Specifically, the\ncurrent
    version of this document focuses on the provisioning of an\nIPv6 CPE router and
    the provisioning of IPv6 Home Devices attached to\nit.  It also addresses IPv6
    traffic forwarding and IPv6 CPE Router\nsecurity.  This document also identifies
    areas for future\nconsideration.  These areas include prefix sub-delegation, IPv6\nmulticast,
    transition and tunneling mechanisms, provisioning\nconsistency between DHCPv4
    and DHCPv6, and DNS support.  This\ndocument does not address IPv4 use cases or
    requirements, as they are\nwidely understood; however, it is expected that IPv6
    CPE Routers will\nalso support IPv4.\n\t </p>\n      "
