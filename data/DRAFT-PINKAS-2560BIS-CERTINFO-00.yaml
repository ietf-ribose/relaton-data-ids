abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OCSP [RFC2560] has been designed to allow an OCSP server to
    use\n   any kind of trustable information to answer to a client varying\n   from
    CRLs to an access to a database of issued certificates.\n\n   In its original
    version, OCSP does not allow taking full advantage\n   of an access to a database
    of issued certificates.\n\n   When a database of issued certificates is used by
    an OCSP server,\n   this document explains how the OCSP server shall respond and
    how\n   OCSP clients shall react.\n\n   The proposal is intended to update 2560bis.
    It defines a new single\n   extension in a single response, called certInfo.  The
    extension is\n   non critical.  The meaning of \"good\", \"revoked\" and \"unknown\"
    are\n   unchanged.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
