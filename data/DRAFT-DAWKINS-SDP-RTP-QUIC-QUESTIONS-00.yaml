abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is a companion document to \"SDP Offer/Answer
    for RTP\n   using QUIC as Transport\".  That document focuses on the description\n
    \  and registration of SDP \"proto\" attribute parameters with IANA, to\n   allow
    applications that rely on SDP Offer/Answer to negotiate the\n   QUIC protocol
    as an encapsulation for RTP.\n\n   In writing that document, it became obvious
    that decisions about an\n   appropriate SDP description would depend on decisions
    about the way\n   RTP would be encapsulated in QUIC, and different proposals for
    those\n   encapsulations had made different assumptions.  Given that none of\n
    \  these proposals have been adopted by an IETF working group yet, it's\n   not
    appropriate to try to base a general-purpose set of \"QUIC/RTP\"\n   IANA registrations
    on any one of them, so this document includes the\n   questions that have come
    up, and (as discussions progress) suggested\n   answers for those questions.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
