abstract:
- content: "<p>This document attempts to make a balanced comparison between the RA-
    based and DHCPv6-based host configuration mechanisms. It compares the two on different
    aspects, e.g: underlying media assumptions, coordination, locality, etc. and highlights
    the strong and weak sides of both protocols for each scenario.</p>"
