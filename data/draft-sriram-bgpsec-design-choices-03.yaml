abstract:
- content: "<p>This document has been written to capture the design rationale for
    the individual draft-00 version of BGPSEC protocol specification (I-D.lepinski-bgpsec-protocol-00).
    It lists the decisions that were made in favor of or against each design choice,
    and presents brief summaries of the arguments that aided the decision process.
    A similar document can be published in the future as the BGPSEC design discussions
    make further progress and additional design considerations are discussed and finalized.</p>"
