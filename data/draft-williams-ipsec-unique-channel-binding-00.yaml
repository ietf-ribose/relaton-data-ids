abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the unique channel bindings for IPsec channels
    constructed by connection latching, where the peers used the Internet Key Exchange
    protocol version 2 (IKEv2). New IKEv2 notification payloads are used to select
    an IKE_SA from which to derive the unique channel bindings for a given IPsec channel.</p>"
