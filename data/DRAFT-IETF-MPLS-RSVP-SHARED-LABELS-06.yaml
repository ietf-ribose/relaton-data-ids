abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the scale of MPLS RSVP-TE networks has grown, so the number
    of\n   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) supported by individual network elements\n
    \  has increased.  Various implementation recommendations have been\n   proposed
    to manage the resulting increase in control plane state.\n\n   However, those
    changes have had no effect on the number of labels\n   that a transit Label Switching
    Router (LSR) has to support in the\n   forwarding plane.  That number is governed
    by the number of LSPs\n   transiting or terminated at the LSR and is directly
    related to the\n   total LSP state in the control plane.\n\n   This document defines
    a mechanism to prevent the maximum size of the\n   label space limit on an LSR
    from being a constraint to control plane\n   scaling on that node.  It introduces
    the notion of pre-installed 'per\n   Traffic Engineering (TE) link labels' that
    can be shared by MPLS\n   RSVP-TE LSPs that traverse these TE links.  This approach\n
    \  significantly reduces the forwarding plane state required to support\n   a
    large number of LSPs.  This couples the feature benefits of the\n   RSVP-TE control
    plane with the simplicity of the Segment Routing MPLS\n   forwarding plane.\n\n\n\t
