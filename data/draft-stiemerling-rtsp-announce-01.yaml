abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Some IPTV deployments that are using the Real Time Streaming Protocol(RTSP)
    require the ability of the server to notify clients aboutasynchronous events occurring
    during an RTSP session. Currentdeployments typically use the ANNOUNCE method of
    RTSP 1.0 for sendingsuch asynchronous events from a server to clients by using
    someproprietary extensions. However, the ANNOUNCE method has beenremoved from
    the current RTSP 2.0 draft, leaving the newspecification without a mechanism for
    sending asynchronous messagesfrom the server. This memo describes a use case for
    such anasynchronous message and proposes a new RTSP 2.0 method.</p>"
