abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The initial deployment of IPv6 will require a tightly coupled
    use of\nIPv4 addresses to support the interoperation of IPv6 and IPv4. Nodes\nwill
    be able to be deployed with IPv6 addresses, but will still need\nto communicate
    with IPv4 nodes that do not have a dual IP layer\nsupporting both IPv4 and IPv6.
    This specification defines a\nmechanism called 'Assignment of IPv4 Global Addresses
    to IPv6 hosts'\n(AIIH), which will assign an IPv6 host a temporary IPv4 Global\nAddress,
    which can be used to communicate with a host that supports\nIPv4 or IPv4/IPv6.
    This document includes also the definition of a \nDynamic Tunneling Interface
    (DTI) to ease the automatic IPv4 address\nassignment and to remove the IPv4 routing
    table from routers. \nAnother objective is to demonstrate that IPv6 Addresses
    can\nbe deployed now instead of non-Global IPv4 Addresses within an\nIntranet.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
