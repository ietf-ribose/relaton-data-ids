abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) is deprecated.  Accordingly,\n
    \  IKEv1 has been moved to Historic status.  A number of old algorithms\n   that
    are associated with IKEv1, and not widely implemented for IKEv2\n   are deprecated
    as well.  IANA is instructed to close all IKEv1\n   registries.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
