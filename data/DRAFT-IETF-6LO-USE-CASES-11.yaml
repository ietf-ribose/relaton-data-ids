abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the applicability of IPv6 over constrained\n
    \  node networks (6lo) and provides practical deployment examples.  In\n   addition
    to IEEE Std 802.15.4, various link layer technologies such\n   as ITU-T G.9959
    (Z-Wave), Bluetooth Low Energy, DECT-ULE, MS/TP, NFC,\n   and PLC are used as
    examples.  The document targets an audience who\n   would like to understand and
    evaluate running end-to-end IPv6 over\n   the constrained node networks for local
    or Internet connectivity.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
