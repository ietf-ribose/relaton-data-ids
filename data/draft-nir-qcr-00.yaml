abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes an extension to the IKEv2 protocol thatallows
    for faster crash recovery using a saved token method.When an IPsec tunnel between
    two IKEv2 implementations isdisconnected due to a restart of one peer, it can
    take as much asseveral minutes to recover. In this text we propose an extension
    tothe protocol, that allows for recovery within a few seconds of thereboot.</p>"
