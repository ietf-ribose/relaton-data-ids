abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a framework for transcoding with SIP. This framework
    includes how to discover the need of transcoding services in a session and how
    to invoke those transcoding services. Two models for transcoding services invocation
    are discussed; the conference bridge model and the third party call control model.
    Both models meet the requirements for SIP regarding transcoding services invocation
    to support deaf, hard of hearing and speech-impaired individuals.</p>"
