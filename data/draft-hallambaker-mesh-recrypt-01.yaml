abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Re-encryption 'recryption' is a form of public key encryption
    in which decryption requires the use of multiple keys. The Mesh/ Recrypt protocol
    is an implementation of a recryption scheme that supports use of end-to-end encryption
    by groups of users whose membership may change over time. The system is implemented
    using two separate protocols; An administration protocol that allows the creation
    of recryption groups, adding and removing members and a client protocol that allows
    an authorized group member request a partial decryption operation.</p>"
