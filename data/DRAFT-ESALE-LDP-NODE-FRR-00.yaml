abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes procedures to support node protection
    for\n   (unicast) Label Switched Paths(LSPs) established by LDP(\"Label\n   Distribution
    Protocol\"). In order to protect a node N, the Point of\n   Local Repair (PLR)
    of N must discover the Merge Points(MPTs) of node\n   N such that traffic can
    be redirected to them in case node N fails.\n   Redirecting the traffic around
    the failed node N depends on existing\n   point-to-point LSPs originated from
    the PLR to the MPTs while\n   bypassing the protected node N.  The procedures
    described in this\n   document are topology independent in a sense that they provide
    node\n   protection in any topology.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
