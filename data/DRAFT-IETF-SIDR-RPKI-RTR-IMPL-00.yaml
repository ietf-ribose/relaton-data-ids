abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an implementation report for RPKI Router\n
    \  protocol as defined in [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr].  The editor did not\n   verify
    the accuracy of the information provided by respondents or by\n   any alternative
    means.  The respondents are experts with the\n   implementations they reported
    on, and their responses are considered\n   authoritative for the implementations
    for which their responses\n   represent.  Respondents were asked to only use the
    YES answer if the\n   feature had at least been tested in the lab.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
