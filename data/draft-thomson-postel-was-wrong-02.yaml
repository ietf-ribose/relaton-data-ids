abstract:
- content: <p>Jon Postel's famous statement in RFC 1122 of "Be liberal in what you
    accept, and conservative in what you send" is a principle that has long guided
    the design and implementation of Internet protocols. The posture this statement
    advocates promotes interoperability, but can produce negative effects in the protocol
    ecosystem in the long term. Those effects can be avoided by properly maintaining
    protocols.</p>
