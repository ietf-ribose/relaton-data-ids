abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines a protocol for conveying binary MIME content
    innear-real time, peer-to-peer or through one or more relays, with theopportunity
    for store and forward. SIMS (SIMPLE Instant MessagingSessions) can be used as
    a standalone protocol, or in conjunction witha rendezvous or session setup protocol
    such as SIP.While SIMS was originally envisioned as an alternative to the MediaSession
    Relay Protocol (MSRP), one section of this document describeshow these ideas could
    be applied as MSRP extensions for features suchas chunking, relay connection multiplexing,
    and prevention ofhead-of-line blocking.</p>"
