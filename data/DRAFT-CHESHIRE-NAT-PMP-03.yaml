abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a protocol for automating the process
    of\n   creating Network Address Translation (NAT) port mappings. Included in\n
    \  the protocol is a method for retrieving the external IP address of a\n   NAT
    gateway, thus allowing a client to make this external IP address\n   and port
    number known to peers that may wish to communicate with it.\n   This protocol
    is implemented in current Apple products including Mac\n   OS X, Bonjour for Windows,
    and AirPort wireless base stations.\n\t </p>\n      "
