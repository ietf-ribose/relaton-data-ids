abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We introduce a new class of Model Based Metrics designed to
    assess if\n   a complete Internet path can be expected to meet a predefined Target\n
    \  Transport Performance by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to\n   successive
    subpaths.  The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly\n   applied to critical
    infrastructure, such as network interconnections\n   or even individual devices,
    to accurately detect if any part of the\n   infrastructure will prevent paths
    traversing it from meeting the\n   Target Transport Performance.\n\n   Model Based
    Metrics rely on peer-reviewed mathematical models to\n   specify a Targeted Suite
    of IP Diagnostic tests, designed to assess\n   whether common transport protocols
    can be expected to meet a\n   predetermined Target Transport Performance over
    an Internet path.\n\n   For Bulk Transport Capacity IP diagnostics are built using
    test\n   streams and statistical criteria for evaluating the packet transfer\n
    \  that mimic TCP over the complete path.  The temporal structure of the\n   test
    stream (bursts, etc) mimic TCP or other transport protocol\n   carrying bulk data
    over a long path.  However they are constructed to\n   be independent of the details
    of the subpath under test, end systems\n   or applications.  Likewise the success
    criteria evaluates the packet\n   transfer statistics of the subpath against criteria
    determined by\n   protocol performance models applied to the Target Transport\n
    \  Performance of the complete path.  The success criteria also does not\n   depend
    on the details of the subpath, end systems or application.\n\n   Model Based Metrics
    exhibit several important new properties not\n   present in other Bulk Transport
    Capacity Metrics, including the\n   ability to reason about concatenated or overlapping
    subpaths.  The\n   results are vantage independent which is critical for supporting\n
    \  independent validation of tests by comparing results from multiple\n   measurement
    points.\n\n   This document provides a framework for designing suites of IP\n
    \  diagnostic tests that are tailored to confirming that infrastructure\n   can
    meet the predetermined Target Transport Performance.  It does not\n   fully specify
    the IP diagnostics tests needed to assure any specific\n   target performance.\n\n\t
