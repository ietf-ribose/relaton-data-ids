abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A transport network is a lower-layer network designed to provide\n
    \  connectivity services for a higher-layer network to carry the traffic\n   opaquely
    across the lower-layer network resources.  A transport\n   network may be constructed
    from equipment utilizing any of a number\n   of different transport technologies
    such as the evolving optical\n   transport infrastructure (Synchronous Optical
    Networking (SONET) /\n   Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical Transport
    Network\n   (OTN)) or packet transport as epitomized by the MPLS Transport\n   Profile
    (MPLS-TP).\n\n   All transport networks have high benchmarks for reliability and\n
    \  operational simplicity.  This suggests a common, technology-\n   independent
    management/control paradigm that can be extended to\n   represent and configure
    specific technology attributes.\n\n   This document describes the high-level requirements
    facing transport\n   networks in order to provide open interfaces for resource\n
    \  programmability and control/management automation.  Furtheremore, gap\n   analysis
    against existing models are also provided so that it can\n   used as the guidance
    to separate efforts/drafts proposing new models\n   or augmentation models based
    on existing models.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
