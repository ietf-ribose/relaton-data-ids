abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP is to enable a concept of web of sensors, but there are many cases
    that the sensors are not always online and hence the requests from the web client
    cannot reach them in timely manner. This document analyzes this problem and describes
    the requirements for a CoAP enabled sensor to behave always online.</p>"
