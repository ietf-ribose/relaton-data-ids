abstract:
- content: "<p>Since large-scale Internetworks such as the public Internet must continue
    to support escalating growth due to increasing demand, it is clear that Autonomous
    Systems (ASes) must avoid injecting excessive de-aggregated prefixes into the
    interdomain routing system and instead mitigate de-aggregation internally. This
    document describes an Interior Routing Overlay Network (IRON) architecture that
    supports sustainable growth within AS-interior routing domains while requiring
    no changes to end systems and no changes to the exterior routing system. In addition
    to routing scaling, IRON further addresses other important issues including mobility
    management, mobile networks, multihoming, traffic engineering, NAT traversal and
    security. While business considerations are an important determining factor for
    widespread adoption, they are out of scope for this document.</p>"
