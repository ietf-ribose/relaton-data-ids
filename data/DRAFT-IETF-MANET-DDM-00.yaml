abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a multicast routing protocol for mobile ad
    hoc\nnetworks (MANETs).  The protocol---termed Differential Destination\nMulticast
    (DDM)---differs from common approaches proposed for ad hoc\nmulticast routing
    in two ways.  Firstly, instead of distributing\nmembership control throughout
    the network, DDM concentrates this\nauthority at the data sources (i.e.  senders)
    thereby giving senders\nknowledge of group membership.  Secondly, differentially-encoded,\nvariable-length
    destination headers are inserted in data packets\nwhich are used in combination
    with unicast routing tables to forward\nmulticast packets towards multicast receivers.
    \ Instead of requiring\nthat multicast forwarding state be stored in participating
    nodes,\nthis approach also provides the option of stateless multicasting.\nEach
    node independently has the choice of maintaining cached\nforwarding state, or
    requesting its upstream neighbor to insert this\nstate into self-routed data packets,
    or some combination thereof.\nThe protocol is best suited for use with small multicast
    groups\noperating in dynamic networks of any size.\n\t </p>\n      "
