abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a formal description of the interactions\n
    \  between two SIP User Agents establishing a multimedia session,\n   describing
    the negotiation of the two parties as an exchange of\n   signals between two instances
    of networks of Finite State Machines\n   (FSMs).\n\n   The goal is to provide
    a common reference model for both SIP\n   extensions and User Agent implementations:
    two flows that can be\n   implemented by using the external interface of the FSMs
    are\n   guaranteed not to conflict to each other.  On the other hand a\n   reference
    model for User Agents is expected to improve\n   interoperability between different
    implementations and help\n   implementors to model their software in a way that
    makes SIP\n   extensions conforming to this document easier to implement.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
