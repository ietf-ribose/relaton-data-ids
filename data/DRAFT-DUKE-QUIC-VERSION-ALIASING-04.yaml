abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The QUIC transport protocol [QUIC-TRANSPORT] preserves its
    future\n   extensibility partly by specifying its version number.  There will
    be\n   a relatively small number of published version numbers for the\n   foreseeable
    future.  This document provides a method for clients and\n   servers to negotiate
    the use of other version numbers in subsequent\n   connections and encrypts Initial
    Packets using secret keys instead of\n   standard ones.  If a sizeable subset
    of QUIC connections use this\n   mechanism, this should prevent middlebox ossification
    around the\n   current set of published version numbers and the contents of QUIC\n
    \  Initial packets, as well as improving the protocol's privacy\n   properties.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
