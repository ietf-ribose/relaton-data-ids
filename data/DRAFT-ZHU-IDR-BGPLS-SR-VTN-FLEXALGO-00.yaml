abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) as defined in I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn
    aims to\n   provide enhanced VPN service to support applications's needs of\n
    \  enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.  VPN+\n   requries
    integration between the overlay VPN and the underlay\n   network.  A Virtual Transport
    Network (VTN) is a virtual network\n   which consists of a subset of the network
    toplogy and network\n   resources allocated from the underlay network.  A VTN
    could be used\n   as the underlay for one or a group of VPN+ services.\n\n   I-D.dong-idr-bgpls-sr-enhanced-vpn
    defines the BGP-LS extensions to\n   distribute the information of Segment Routing
    (SR) based VTNs to\n   external entities, such as the network controllers.  This
    document\n   describes a simplified mechanism to distribute the information of
    SR\n   based VTNs using BGP-LS with Flex-Algo.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
