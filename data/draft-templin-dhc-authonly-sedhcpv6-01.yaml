abstract:
- content: "<p>Secure DHCPv6 includes mechanisms for encryption and authentication,
    where encryption is currently mandated due to concerns for pervasive monitoring
    in the Internet. The Secure DHCPv6 specification states that the mechanisms are
    applicable in any environment where physical security on the link is not assured
    and attacks on DHCPv6 are a concern. However, this document presents a reference
    use case where physical and/or link-layer security are already assured. This document
    therefore proposes an authentication-only application of Secure DHCPv6 when there
    is already sufficent protection against pervasive monitoirng.</p>"
