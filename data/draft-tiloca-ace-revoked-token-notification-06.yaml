abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies a method of the Authentication and Authorization
    for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework, which allows an Authorization Server
    to notify Clients and Resource Servers (i.e., registered devices) about revoked
    Access Tokens. The method relies on resource observation for the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP), with Clients and Resource Servers observing a Token Revocation
    List on the Authorization Server. Resulting unsolicited notifications of revoked
    Access Tokens complement alternative approaches such as token introspection, while
    not requiring additional endpoints on Clients and Resource Servers.</p>"
