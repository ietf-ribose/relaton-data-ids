abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document addresses topics related to hierarchical and stitched
    \nGeneralized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Label Switched \nPaths (LSPs).
    \ It describes extensions to allow an egress to identify \nthat a bi-directional
    LSP will be used as a dynamically signaled \nForwarding Adjacency LSP (FA-LSP)
    or Routing Adjacency (RA). In \naddition, the document also addresses the issue
    of how to indicate \nthat an LSP should be advertised as a traffic engineering
    (TE) link \ninto a different instance of the IGP and how to identify the instance
    \nthat should be used.\n\t </p>\n      "
