abstract:
- content: <p>The 6rd tunnel MTU is currently recommended to be set to 1480. This
    is to avoid IPv4 fragmentation within the tunnel, but requires the 6rd tunnel
    ingress to drop any IPv6 packet larger than 1480 bytes and return an ICMPv6 Packet
    Too Big (PTB) message. Concerns for operational issues with both IPv4 and IPv6
    Path MTU Discovery point to the possibility of MTU-related black holes when a
    packet is dropped due to an MTU restriction. Fortunately, the "Internet cell size"
    is 1500 bytes (i.e., the minimum MTU configured by the vast majority of links
    in the Internet) so if the 6rd tunnel can be made to support at least this size
    MTU issues are alleviated. This document specifies methods that can be employed
    to support these larger sizes.</p>
