abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for the inter-working between Protocol
    Independent Multicast [PIM] and a leaf-driven P2MP tunnel signaling protocol such
    as [mRSVP-TE] or [mLDP] so that multiple PIM sites around an MPLS network can
    form a single PIM domain without compromising PIM's features, scalability, and
    performance. In this document, PIM modes PIM-SM, PIM-SSM, and PIM-BIDIR are considered.</p>"
