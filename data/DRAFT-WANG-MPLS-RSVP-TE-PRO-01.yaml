abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>ASON (Automatic Switch Optical Network), which provides fast and
    \ndynamic connection from point to point, is the typical representation \nof the
    next generation intelligent optical network. There are two \nmain kinds of resource
    reservation protocols in RSVP-TE (Resource \nReservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering),
    the most widely applied \nsignaling in ASON, which are FRP (forward reservation
    protocol) and \nBRP (backward reservation protocol). Both of them are used to
    apply \nin single-domain optical network. However, when they are used in \nmulti-domain
    optical network, there are apparent drawbacks. On base \nof FRP and BRP, we propose
    a reservation protocol-IDRPBP, which is \nbased on priority in multi-domain optical
    network with wavelength \nconversion implement at border nodes. Through analysis
    and simulation, \nwe find it can achieve the trade-off between blocking probability
    and \nconnection setup time.\n\t </p>\n      "
