abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version
    4 minor\n   version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS\n
    \  version 4 minor version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and\n   protocol
    extensions made subsequently.  The later minor version has\n   no dependencies
    on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and is considered a\n   separate protocol.\n\n
    \  This document obsoletes RFC 5661.  It substantially revises the\n   treatment
    of features relating to multi-server namespace, superseding\n   the description
    of those features appearing in RFC 5661.\n\n   The content of this document reflects
    that of RFC8881, presented in\n   the form of an I-D.  This is intended to provide
    a helpful point of\n   comparision for drafts leading to an eventual rfc5661bis
    document\n   suite.  This document can serve as a baseline to enable use of\n
    \  rfcdiff when reviewing such drafts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
