abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When a host is connected to multiple multicast capable routers,
    each\n   of these routers is a candidate to process the multicast flow for\n   that
    LAN, but only one router should be elected to process it.  This\n   document proposes
    a generic multicast router election mechanism using\n   Internet Group Management
    Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener\n   Discovery (MLD) that can be used by
    any Multicast Overlay Signalling\n   Protocol (MOSP).  Having such generic election
    mechanism removes a\n   dependency on Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM).\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
