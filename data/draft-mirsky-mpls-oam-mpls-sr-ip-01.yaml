abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment routing uses source routing paradigm to traffic engineering
    by specifying segments a packet traverses through the network. MPLS Segment Routing
    applies that paradigm to an MPLS data plane-based networks. SR-MPLS over IP uses
    MPLS label stack as a source routing instruction set and uses IP encapsulation/tunneling
    such as MPLS-in- UDP as defined in RFC 7510 to realize a source routing mechanism
    across MPLS, IPv4, and IPv6 data planes. This document describes Operations, Administration,
    and Maintenance operations in SR-MPLS over IP environment.</p>"
