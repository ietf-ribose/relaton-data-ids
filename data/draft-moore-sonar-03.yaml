abstract:
  content: "<p>SONAR is a service which, when presented with a list of InternetProtocol
    addresses, attempts to order that list according to theproximity from the SONAR
    server to each address. Given multiplelocations for a network accessible resource,
    SONAR is designed to helpnetworked applications make a reasonable choice between
    thosealternatives. This memo describes the SONAR protocol as well as anexperimental
    implementation of the SONAR service. While the name 'SONAR' is intended as a pun
    on the 'ping' utilitythat uses ICMP echo requests to verify network connectivity,
    the SONARservice does not specify use of any particular means of estimatingnetwork
    proximity. To the contrary, the design of SONAR assumes thatthe best means of
    estimating network proximity will change over time andperhaps from one network
    location to another. The SONAR protocol isintended to provide a stable interface
    for applications that need tomeasure network proximity, thus allowing proximity
    measurementalgorithms to evolve separately from those applications.</p>"
