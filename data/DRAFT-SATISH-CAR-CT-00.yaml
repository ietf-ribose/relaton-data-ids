abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Protocols being designed for seamless IP-level handovers, such
    as fast \nhandover, context transfer (CT) and Candidate Access Router (CAR)\ndiscovery
    protocols will have to go hand in hand for any meaningful \nseamless handover
    implementation. The CAR discovery and subsequent \nTarget Access Router (TAR)
    discovery is achieved through L3 QoS \nparameters, user preferences and application
    level QoS parameter match \nbetween the geographically adjacent access routers
    (GAAR). It is \nasserted in this draft that the primary consideration for fast
    handover \nand CAR discovery will still be layer 3 QoS parameters as supported
    by \nthe ARs.\n\t </p>\n      "
