abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
    records\n   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet\n
    \  traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document\n   proposes
    a new Geneve tunnel option and outlines how IOAM data fields\n   are carried in
    the option data field.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
