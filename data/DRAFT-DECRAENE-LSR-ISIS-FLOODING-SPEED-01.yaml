abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a mechanism that can be used to increase
    the\n   speed at which link state information is flooded across a network\n   when
    multiple LSPDUs need to be flooded, such as in case of a node\n   failure.  It
    also reduces the likelihood of overloading the\n   downstream flooding neighbors.
    \ This document defines a new TLV to be\n   advertised in IS-IS Hello messages.
    \ This TLV carries two parameters\n   indicating the performance capacity to receive
    LSPDUs: the minimum\n   delay between two consecutive LSPDUs and the number of
    LSPDUs which\n   can the received back to back.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
