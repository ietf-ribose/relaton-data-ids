abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo presents extensions to IP that enable the use of source-baseddistribution
    trees (such as those established by DVMRP[1] or PIM-DM[2])to deliver multicast
    packets generated by members of a multicast groupin the opposite direction to
    packets originated by the source (S).Packets generated by a member M of a group
    G are forwarded (unicast)from an in-tree router to another, towards the source
    S.In addition to send the packet to its upstream, each in-tree router injects
    it into the multicast tree (S,G). This enables packets to reach the rest of the
    receivers, as S would originate them.The 'reversed' use of the distribution tree
    is intended for sending oflow volume feedback information produced by receivers
    in applicationssuch as RTP/RTCP[3] and reliable multicast.This feature diminish
    the overhead in routers in case of applicationswith a source and many receivers
    sending feedback, because only onedistribution tree, rooted at the sender S must
    be maintained, in placeof one per member.In addition, multicast packets originated
    by receivers,travel throughthe inverse path of information ones in the distribution
    tree.This can be exploited by multicast transport protocols to localizeprocesses
    to subtrees or to reduce exposure.</p>"
