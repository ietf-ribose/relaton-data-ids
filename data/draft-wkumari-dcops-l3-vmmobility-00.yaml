abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines how Virtual Machine mobility can be accomplished
    in datacenter networks that are based on L3 technologies. It is not really intended
    to solve (or fully define) the problem, but rather to outline it at a very high
    level to determine if standardization within the IETF makes sense.</p>"
