abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the Protected Entertainment Rights Management\n
    \  (PERM) protocol for management of usage rights to digital\n   entertainment
    content. PERM is not intended to replace existing copy\n   protection and conditional
    access systems. Rather it is intended to\n   complement such systems by providing
    standardized methods of device\n   and user authentication, content protection
    and content rights\n   management across heterogeneous data networks. PERM does
    not impose\n   any content usage policy upon an implementation of the PERM protocol.\n
    \  PERM defines a common method for policy enforcement, and implementors\n   are
    free to design and enforce their own policy by using the features\n   and conventions
    of the PERM protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
