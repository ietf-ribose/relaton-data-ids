abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The OAuth 2.0 bearer token specification, as defined in RFC
    6750,\n   allows any party in possession of a bearer token (a \"bearer\") to get\n
    \  access to the associated resources (without demonstrating possession\n   of
    a cryptographic key).  To prevent misuse, bearer tokens must to be\n   protected
    from disclosure in transit and at rest.\n\n   Some scenarios demand additional
    security protection whereby a client\n   needs to demonstrate possession of cryptographic
    keying material when\n   accessing a protected resource.  This document motivates
    the\n   development of the OAuth 2.0 proof-of-possession security mechanism.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
