abstract:
- content: <p>Historically, any DNS RR may occur for any domain name. Recent additions
    have defined DNS leaf nodes that contain a reserved node name, beginning with
    an underscore. The underscore construct is used to define a semantic scope for
    DNS records that are associated with the parent domain. This specification explores
    the nature of this DNS usage and defines the "underscore names" registry with
    IANA.</p>
