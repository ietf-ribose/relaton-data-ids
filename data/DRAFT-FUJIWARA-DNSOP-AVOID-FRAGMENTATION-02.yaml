abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Path MTU discovery remains widely undeployed due to security
    issues,\n   and IP fragmentation has exposed weaknesses in application protocols.\n
    \  Currently, DNS is known to be the largest user of IP fragmentation.\n   It
    is possible to avoid IP fragmentation in DNS by limiting response\n   size where
    possible, and signaling the need to upgrade from UDP to\n   TCP transport where
    necessary.  This document proposes to avoid IP\n   fragmentation in DNS.\n\n\t
