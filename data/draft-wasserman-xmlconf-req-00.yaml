abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines basic concepts and describes the requirements
    for a standard network configuration protocol, which could be used to manage the
    configuration of networks and networking equipment. The document also discusses
    a phased approach to developing an XML- based configuration protocol that could
    provide tangible benefits in the short term, while working towards an XML-based
    configuration protocol that meets the full requirements.</p>"
