abstract:
- content: "<p>When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be
    able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to reduce sending
    traffic for some period of time. Otherwise, it must continue to expend resources
    parsing and responding to Diameter messages, possibly resulting in congestion
    collapse. The existing mechanisms provided by Diameter are not sufficient for
    this purpose. This document describes the limitations of the existing mechanisms,
    and provides requirements for new overload management mechanisms.</p>"
