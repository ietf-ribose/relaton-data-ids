abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document lists security threats related to IPv6 multihoming\n
    \  solutions, transport layer protocols of which are expected to handle\n   multiple
    addresses of a host and an identity of the host is\n   recognized not necessarily
    by a single address.\n\n   The intent is to look at how IPv6 multihoming solutions
    might make\n   the Internet less secure than the current Internet, without studying\n
    \  any proposed solution but instead looking at threats that are\n   inherent
    in the problem itself.\n\t </p>\n      "
