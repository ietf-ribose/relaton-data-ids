abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is one of a set of documents, which together
    describe\n   all aspects of the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP).  IPP is an\n
    \  application level protocol that can be used for distributed printing\n   using
    Internet tools and technologies.  This document describes a\n   simplified model
    consisting of abstract objects, their attributes,\n   and their operations that
    is independent of encoding and transport.\n   The model consists of several objects
    including Printers and Jobs.\n   Jobs optionally support multiple Documents.  IPP
    1.1 semantics allow\n   End Users and Operators to query Printer capabilities,
    submit print\n   jobs, inquire about the status of print Jobs and printers, and\n
    \  cancel, hold, and release print Jobs.  IPP 1.1 semantics allow\n   Operators
    to pause and resume (Jobs from) Printer objects.  This\n   document also addresses
    security, internationalization, and directory\n   issues.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
