abstract:
- content: "<p>A common definition base for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting
    service in the internet is highly desirable if for growth in a common direction.
    It is possible for Accounting to stand alone if one is willing to trust what the
    other person says. Authentication is required if Authorization is to work. This
    documents is a discussion and flow trace of a basic authentication flow.</p>"
