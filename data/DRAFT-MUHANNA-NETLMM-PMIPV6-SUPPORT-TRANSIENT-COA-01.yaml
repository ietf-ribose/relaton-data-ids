abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In order for the local mobility anchor to receive and forward
    uplink\ntraffic for a mobile node, Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocol mandates\nthe
    LMA to have an active BCE with a registered proxy CoA that is the\nother end of
    the tunnel between the LMA and MAG.  In some systems and\nduring active inter-MAG
    handoff with traffic that is sensitive to\ndelay and packet loss, the LMA is required
    to forward uplink traffic\nfor the mobile node from the target MAG without completely
    switching\nthe tunnel from the source MAG.  This document specifies a mechanism\nwhich
    allows the target MAG to perform transient registration for a\nnew proxy CoA and
    the LMA to create a transient BCE for the same\nmobile node for a specified period
    of time while maintaining the\noriginal mobile node's BCE which reference the
    old pCoA at the source\nMAG.\n\t </p>\n      "
