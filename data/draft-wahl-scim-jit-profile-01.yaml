abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a profile of the System for Cross-Domain Identity
    Management Protocol (SCIM). Servers which implement protocols such as SAML or
    OpenID Connect receive user identities through those protocols and often cache
    them, and this profile of SCIM defines how an identity provider can notify a SCIM
    server of changes to user accounts.</p>"
