abstract:
- content: "<p>With the wide deployment of 4G and beyond mobile networks, a great
    number of cells need high precision frequency and/or time synchronization for
    their normal operation. It is crucial to configure and manage the synchronization
    network in a scalable way, and simplify the monitoring and operation for synchronization
    networks. This document analyzes the use cases and requirements in synchronization
    networks, and provides a problem statement for scalable synchronization networks.</p>"
