abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The latency associated with Mobile IPv6's Return Routability
    test can\n   have an adverse impact on delay-sensitive applications.  Early\n
    \  Binding Updates mitigate this issue by already using a new care-of\n   address
    in parallel with testing it.  We propose and analyze a\n   credit-based mechanism
    that prevents misuse of Early Binding Updates\n   for amplified flooding attacks
    and discourages such misuse for\n   non-amplified flooding attacks.\n\t </p>\n
