abstract:
- content: "<p>The Identifier Tracing Protocol (IDTP) is an application-level protocol
    for distributed and collaborative information systems. It is a generic communication
    protocol which can be used for many tasks with two types of forwarding mechanisms
    to achieve traceability by using Universal Traceable Identifier (UTID) [I-D-UTID]
    which contains two types of forwarding messages. This document provides the specification
    of IDTP, including syntax, data format, and the guidelines for their use, too.</p>"
