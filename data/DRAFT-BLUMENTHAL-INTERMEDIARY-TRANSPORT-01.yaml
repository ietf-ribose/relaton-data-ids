abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The growth of the Internet has witnessed an emergence of transport\nservices
    that rely on or can benefit from assistance of network\nintermediaries between
    communicating end-points.  Such services,\nfor example, include TCP performance
    enhancements, multimedia\npacket filtering, header compression, and prevention
    of\nDenial-of-Service.  In this draft, we describe some of the\nimportant aspects
    of the problem of securely enabling\nintermediary-based services.  We also present
    several scenarios\nwhere this problem is manifested.\n\t </p>\n      "
