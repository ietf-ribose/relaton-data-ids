abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document aims to describe how internet standrds and protocols\n
    \  and its implementations may impact diverse groups and communities.\n   The
    research on how some protocol can be enabler for specific human\n   rights while
    possibly restricting others has been documented in\n   [RFC8280].  Similar to
    how RFC 8280 has taken a human rights lens\n   through which to view engineering
    and design choices by internet\n   standardisation, this document addreses the
    opportunities and\n   vulnerabilities embedded within internet protocols for specific,\n
    \  traditionally maginalised groups.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
