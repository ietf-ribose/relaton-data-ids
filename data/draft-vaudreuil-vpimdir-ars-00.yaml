abstract:
  content: "<p>The telephone number delegation and call routing system is ahierarchitecal
    system. ITU standard E.164 defines the structure of thetelephone number as follows:{country
    code) (Nationally significant part)The country code may be from one to three digits,
    and the total lengthmay be up to 16 digits. The nationally significant portion
    may bearbitraily divided on any number boundary. In many countries numeringplans,
    the divisions are not uniform, that is, the 'area codes' or'City codes' may be
    of varying lengths within a single country and thetotal number of digits may be
    variable.Within this flexiblity, it is always the case that the delegation ofauthority
    is done left-to-right. With this assumption, a numberingtree can be built on a
    digit-by-digit basis can represent any of thesehierarchical structures. DNS permits
    the delegation of authority onarbitary boundaries such that a delegation to country
    code '1', '44',and '972' can all coexist under a single numbering plan root. Thesame
    applies for 'area codes', 'City codes' or 'service selectors'within numbering
    plans.The protocol mechanics outlined in this document are devised in such amanner
    that the clients do not need any knowledge of the numberingplan itself to correctly
    construct a query of the Address ResolutionService. The client may mechanically
    collect digits, format thequery, and receive a response to any telephone number
    in the world.</p>"
