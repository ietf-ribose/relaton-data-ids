abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides\n   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n
    \  computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n   The
    stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multi-Protocol\n   Label Switching
    (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE\n   LSPs) using PCEP.\n\n
    \  This document proposes a set of extensions for the stateful PCE, so\n   as
    to enable bandwidth scheduling for LSP and adjust the bandwidth\n   based on the
    customers' scheduled bandwidth requirement of a traffic\n   service in a centralized
    network environment.  A bandwidth scheduled\n   LSP can be adjusted to the new
    bandwidth at its starting time and\n   adjusted back to the original bandwidth
    at its ending time.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
