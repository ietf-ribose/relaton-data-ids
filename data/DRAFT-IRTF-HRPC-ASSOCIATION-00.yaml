abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document scopes the relation between Internet protocols
    and the\n   right to freedom of assembly and association.  Increasingly, the\n
    \  Internet mediates our lives, our relationships and our ability to\n   exercise
    our human rights.  As a forum, the Internet provides a\n   global public space
    even though it is built predominantly on private\n   infrastructure.  Since Internet
    protocols play a central role in the\n   management, development and use of the
    Internet, the relation between\n   protocols and the aforementioned rights should
    be documented and any\n   adverse impacts of this relation should be mitigated.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
