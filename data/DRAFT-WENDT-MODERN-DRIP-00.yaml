abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a protocol for allowing a distributed
    set of\n   nodes to synchronize a set of information in real-time with minimal\n
    \  amount of delay.  This is useful for registry types of information\n   like
    identity and telephone numbers with associated routing and\n   ownership information
    and could be extended to support other\n   distributed real-time information updates
    as well.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
