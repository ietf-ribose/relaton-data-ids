abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The base BGP specifications prevent a BGP speaker from advertisingany
    route that is not the best route for a BGP destination. Thisdocument specifies
    a modification of this rule. Routes are dividedinto two categories, \"external\"
    and \"internal\". A specification isprovided for choosing a \"best external route\"
    (for a particular valueof the Network Layer Reachability Information). A BGP speaker
    isthen allowed to advertise its \"best external route\" to its internalBGP peers,
    even if that is not the best route for the destination.The document explains why
    advertising the best external route canimprove convergence time without causing
    routing loops. Additionalbenefits include reduction of inter-domain churn and
    avoidance ofpermanent route oscillation. The document also generalizes thenotions
    of \"internal\" and \"external\" so that they can be applied toRoute Reflector
    Clusters and Autonomous System Confederations.</p>"
