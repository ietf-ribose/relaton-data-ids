abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an extension to LoST (RFC5222) that allows
    a\n   planned change to the data in the LoST server to occur.  Records that\n
    \  previously were valid will become invalid at a date in the future,\n   and
    new locations will become valid after the date.  The extension\n   adds two elements
    to the &lt;findservice&gt; request: A URI to be used to\n   inform the LIS that
    previously valid locations will be invalid after\n   the planned change date,
    and add a date which requests the server to\n   perform validation as of the date
    specified.  It also adds an\n   optional Time-To-Live element to the response,
    which informs clients\n   about the current expected lifetime of the validation.
    \ This document\n   also provides a conventional XML schema for LoST, as backwards\n
    \  compatible alternative to the RelaxNG schema in RFC5222\n\n\t </p>\n      "
