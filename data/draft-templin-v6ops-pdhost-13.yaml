abstract:
  content: "<p>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which then
    use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks. This document
    considers the case when the requesting router is a node that acts as a host on
    behalf of its local applications and as a router on behalf of any downstream networks.</p>"
