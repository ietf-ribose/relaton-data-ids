abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   LTE, 4G mobile networks use IP-based transport for the control
    plane\n   to establish the data session at the user plane for the actual data\n
    \  delivery.  In the existing architecture, IP transport used in the\n   user
    plane is not optimized for data transport, which leads to\n   inefficient data
    delivery.  For instance, IP unicast routing from\n   server to clients is used
    for the delivery of multimedia content to\n   User Equipment (UE), with each user
    receiving a separate stream.\n   From a bandwidth and routing perspective, this
    approach is\n   inefficient.  Multicast and broadcast technologies have recently\n
    \  emerged for mobile networks, but their deployments are very limited\n   or
    at an experimental stage.  ICN is a rapidly emerging technology,\n   although
    much of the work is focused on fixed networks.  The focus of\n   this draft is
    on native deployment of ICN in cellular mobile networks\n   by using ICN in a
    3GPP protocol stack.  ICN has inherent capabilities\n   for multicast, anchorless
    mobility, and security, while being\n   optimized for data delivery using local
    caching at the edge.  The\n   proposed approaches in this draft allow ICN to be
    enabled natively\n   over the current LTE stack comprising PDCP/RLC/MAC/PHY, or
    in a dual\n   stack mode (alongside IP).  This document is a product of the\n
    \  Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
