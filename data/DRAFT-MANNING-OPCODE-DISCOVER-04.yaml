abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the DISCOVER opcode, an experimental\n
    \  extension to the Domain Name System (DNS) to use multicast queries\n   for
    resource discovery. This opcode was tested in experiments run\n   during 1995
    and 1996 for the TBDS project. TBDS was the first known\n   use of multicast transport
    for DNS.  A client multicasts a DNS\n   query using the DISCOVER opcode and processes
    the multiple responses\n   that may result.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
