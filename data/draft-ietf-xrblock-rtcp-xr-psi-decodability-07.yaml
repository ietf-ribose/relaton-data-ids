abstract:
  content: "<p>An MPEG2 Transport Stream (TS) is a standard container format used
    in the transmission and storage of multimedia data. Unicast/multicast MPEG2 TS
    over RTP is widely deployed in IPTV systems. This document defines an RTP Control
    Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) block that allows the reporting of MPEG2
    TS decodability statistics metrics related to transmissions of MPEG2 TS over RTP.
    The metrics specified in the RTCP XR block are related to Program Specific Information
    (PSI) carried in MPEG TS.</p>"
