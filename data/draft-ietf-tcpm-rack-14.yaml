abstract:
- content: '<p>This document presents the RACK-TLP loss detection algorithm for TCP.
    RACK-TLP uses per-segment transmit timestamps and selective acknowledgements (SACK)
    and has two parts: RACK ("Recent ACKnowledgment") starts fast recovery quickly
    using time-based inferences derived from ACK feedback. TLP ("Tail Loss Probe")
    leverages RACK and sends a probe packet to trigger ACK feedback to avoid retransmission
    timeout (RTO) events. Compared to the widely used DUPACK threshold approach, RACK-TLP
    detects losses more efficiently when there are application-limited flights of
    data, lost retransmissions, or data packet reordering events. It is intended to
    be an alternative to the DUPACK threshold approach.</p>'
