abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a profile for AS Adjacency Attestation\nObjects
    (AAOs).  An AAO is a digitally signed object that provides a\nmeans of verifying
    that an AS holder has made an attestation that it\nhas a inter-domain routing
    adjacency with one or more other AS's,\nwith the associated inference that this
    AS is prepared to announce or\nreceive routes with these adjacent AS's in the
    inter-domain domain\nenvironment.\n\t </p>\n      "
