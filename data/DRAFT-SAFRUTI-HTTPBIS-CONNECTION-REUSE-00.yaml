abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a suggested enhancement to HTTP, in
    which a\n   user-agent and a server can use a single connection to exchange\n
    \  requests/responses for multiple requested hostnames for which the\n   server
    is authorized to serve.  This enhancement suggests that user-\n   agents will
    prefer to re-use an existing connection if it can be used\n   to other hosts,
    and presents methods for a server to announce hosts\n   that are served by it,
    as well as a mechanism for the user-agent to\n   validate that the server is indeed
    trusted to serve this hosts.\n\n   This is highly relevant when the server is
    actually a surrogate (like\n   in a case of a CDN server), or in multi-hosts hosting
    environments,\n   where the same server serves multiple hostnames/domains and
    can\n   improve performance by the reuse of established and already optimized\n
    \  connections.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
