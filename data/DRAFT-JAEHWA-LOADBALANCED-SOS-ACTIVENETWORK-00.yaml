abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Secure overlay services (SOS) architecture has been proposed to
    \nprovide reliable communication between clients and a target under\nDDoS attacks.
    The SOS architecture employs a set of overlay nodes\narranged in three hierarchical
    layers that controls access to the\ntarget. Although the architecture is novel
    and works well under \nsimple congestion based attacks, we observe that it is
    flimsy after\nit resisted the DDoS for a period of time and it didn't pay \nattention
    to the endurance of the Nodes. We propose an Algorithm to\nimprove the secure
    overlay services (SOS) both on load balance \nand resilient. \n\t </p>\n      "
