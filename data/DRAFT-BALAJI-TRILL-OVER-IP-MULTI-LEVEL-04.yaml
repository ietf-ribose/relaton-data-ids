abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a need to connect (a) TRILL based data centers or
    (b) TRILL\n   based networks which provide Provider Backbone like functionalities\n
    \  or (c) Campus TRILL based networks over the WAN using one or more\n   ISPs
    that provide regular IP+GRE or IP+MPLS transport. A few\n   solutions have been
    proposed as in [1] in the recent past that have\n   not looked at the PB-like
    functionality. These solutions have not\n   dealt with the details as to how these
    services could be provided\n   such that multiple TRILL sites can be inter-connected
    with issues\n   like nick-name collisons for unicast (multicast is still TBD)
    being\n   taken care of. It has been found that with extensions to BGP the\n   problem
    statement which we will define below can be handled. Both\n   control plane and
    data plane operations can be driven into the\n   solution to make it seamlessly
    look at the entire set of TRILL sites\n   as a single entity which then can be
    viewed as one single Layer 2\n   cloud. MAC moves across TRILL sites and within
    TRILL sites can be\n   realized. This document / proposal envisions the use of
    BGP-MAC-VPN\n   vrfs both at the IP cloud PE devices and at the peripheral PEs
    within\n   a TRILL site providing Provider Backbone like functionality. We deal\n
    \  in depth with the control plane and data plane particulars for\n   unicast
    (multicast is still TBD) with nick-name election being taken\n   care of as part
    of the solution.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
