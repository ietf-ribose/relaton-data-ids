abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A communication network includes an access network segment
    that\n   delivers data to/from the users and an associated core network\n   segment
    providing connectivity with the application servers.\n   Multiconnectivity scenarios
    are common where an end-user device can\n   simultaneously connect to multiple
    communication networks based on\n   different technology implementations and network
    architectures like\n   WiFi, LTE, DSL.  A smart selection and combination of access
    and core\n   network paths that can dynamically adapt to changing network\n   conditions
    can improve quality of experience for a user in such a\n   Multiconnectivity scenario
    and improve overall network utilization\n   and efficiency.  This document presents
    the problem statement and\n   proposes solution principles.  It specifies the
    requirements and\n   reference architecture for a multi-access management services\n
    \  framework that can be used to flexibly select the best combination of\n   access
    and core network paths for uplink and downlink, as well as the\n   flexible usage
    of uplink and downlink, ensuring better network\n   efficiency and enhanced application
    performance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
