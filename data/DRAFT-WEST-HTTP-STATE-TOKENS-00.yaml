abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism which allows HTTP servers
    to\n   maintain stateful sessions with HTTP user agents.  It aims to address\n
    \  some of the security and privacy considerations which have been\n   identified
    in existing state management mechanisms, providing\n   developers with a well-lit
    path towards our current understanding of\n   best practice.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
