abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines concepts and terminology for using the Session
    Initiation Protocol in a peer-to-peer environment where the traditional proxy-registrar
    and message-routing functions are replaced by a distributed mechanism. These mechanisms
    may be implemented using a Distributed Hash Table or other distributed data mechanism
    with similar external properties. This document includes a high-level view of
    the functional relationships between the network elements defined herein, a conceptual
    model of operations, and an outline of the related problems addressed by the P2PSIP
    working group, the REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) protocol, and the
    SIP usage document defined by the working group.</p>"
