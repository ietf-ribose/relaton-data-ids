abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In 2013, after a great deal of community discussion, the decision
    was\n   made to shift from the plain-text, ASCII-only canonical format for\n   RFCs
    to XML as the canonical format with more human-readable formats\n   rendered from
    that XML.  The high-level requirements that informed\n   this change were defined
    in RFC6949, \"RFC Series Format Requirements\n   and Future Development.\"  Plain
    text remains an important format for\n   many in the IETF community, and will
    still be one of the publication\n   formats rendered from the XML.  This draft
    documents the rendering\n   requirements for the plain-text RFC publication format.
    \ These\n   requirements do not apply to plain-text RFCs published before the\n
    \  format transition.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
