  content: "\n\t <p>The nominal Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the Internet has\nbecome
    1500 bytes, but existing IP/*/IP tunneling mechanisms impose\nan encapsulation
    overhead that can reduce the effective path MTU to\nsmaller values.  Additionally,
    existing tunneling mechanisms are\nlimited in their ability to discover and utilize
    larger MTUs.  This\ndocument specifies a trivial mechanism for tunnel MTU determination\nthat
    addresses these issues.1.  Introduction\n\nThe nominal Maximum Transmission Unit
    (MTU) of today's Internet has\nbecome 1500 bytes due to the preponderance of networking
    gear that\nconfigures an MTU of that size.  Since not all links in the Internet\nconfigure
    a 1500 byte MTU, however, packets can be dropped due to an\nMTU restriction on
    the path.\n\nUpper layers see IP/*/IP tunnels as ordinary links, but even for\npackets
    no larger than 1500 bytes these links are susceptible to\nsilent loss (e.g., due
    to path MTU restrictions, lost error messages,\nlayered encapsulations, reassembly
    buffer limitations, etc.)\nresulting in poor performance and/or communications
    failures\n[RFC2923][RFC4459][RFC4821][RFC4963].\n\nThis document specifies a trivial
    mechanism for IP/*/IP tunnel MTU\ndetermination.  It updates the functional specifications
    for Tunnel\nEndpoints (TEs) found in existing tunneling mechanisms (see:\nSection
    9).\n\t </p>\n      "
