abstract:
- content: "<p>The Strengthening the Internet (STRINT) workshop assembled one hundred
    participants in London for two days in early 2014 to discuss how the technical
    community, and in particular the IETF and the W3C, should react to Pervasive Monitoring
    and more generally how to strengthen the Internet in the face of such attacks.
    The discussions covered issues of terminology, the role of user interfaces, classes
    of mitigation, some specific use cases, transition strategies (including opportunistic
    encryption), and more. The workshop ended with a few high-level recommendations,
    that it is believed could be implemented and could help strengthen the Internet.
    This is the report of that workshop. Note that this document is a report on the
    proceedings of the workshop. The views and positions documented in this report
    are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB views
    and positions.</p>"
