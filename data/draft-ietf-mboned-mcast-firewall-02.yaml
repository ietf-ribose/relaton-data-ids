abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, we discuss the issues surrounding the traversal of
    IP multicast traffic across a firewall, and describe possible ways in which a
    firewall can implement and control this traversal. We also explain why some firewall
    mechanisms - such as SOCKS - that were designed specifically for unicast traffic,
    are less appropriate for multicast. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
