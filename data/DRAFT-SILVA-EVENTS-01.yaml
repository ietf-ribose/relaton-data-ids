abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines extensions to iCalendar and iTIP that
    allow the\n   expression of imprecise and multiple alternative events in calendar\n
    \  objects and scheduling messages.  Imprecise events can be used to\n   imprecisely
    describe an event by specifying various ranked periods of\n   time in which it
    could be scheduled.  Alternative events can be used\n   to describe an event in
    terms of multiple ranked event descriptions,\n   imprecise or not, that could
    alternatively be scheduled.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
