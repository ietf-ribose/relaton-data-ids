abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a mechanism for a host to indicate via
    the Port Control Protocol (PCP) which connections should be protected against
    network failures. These connections will then be subject to high-availability
    mechanisms enabled on the network side.\n\n This approach assumes that applications
    and/or users have more visibility about sensitive connections than any heuristic
    that can be enabled on the network side to guess which connections should be check-pointed.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
