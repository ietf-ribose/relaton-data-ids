abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo describes a batch of Presence Information Data Format(PIDF)
    and its extension schemas written with the RELAX NG schemalanguage. Unlike with
    the current W3C XML Schema language it ispossible to write reasonable forwards
    and backwards compatiblepresence combination schemas. These RELAX NG schemas are
    stricterthan the W3C Schemas and thus the instance documents that validatewith
    these schemas follow the intended content model more closely.Especially, these
    schemas are targeted to actual implementations inorder to decrease interoperability
    problems.</p>"
