abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    and\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE\n
    \  LSPs) are established using signaling procedures defined in\n   [RFC4875].
    However, [RFC4875] does not address several issues that\n   arise when a P2MP-TE
    LSP is signaled in inter-domain networks. One\n   such issue is the computation
    of a loosely routed inter-domain P2MP-\n   TE LSP paths that are re-merge free.
    Another issue is the\n   reoptimization of the inter-domain P2MP-TE LSP tree vs.
    an individual\n   destination(s), since the loosely routing domain ingress border
    node\n   is not aware of the reoptimization scope. This document defines the\n
    \  required protocol extensions needed for establishing and reoptimizing\n   P2MP
    MPLS and GMPLS TE LSPs in inter-domain networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
