abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper we discuss various security issues concerning Mobile
    Hosts using Mobile-IP or other mobility systems (DHCP standalone) and current
    firewall technology. We first present some recent attacks on the Internet and
    what they might mean for mobile systems like Mobile-IP that rely on tunneling
    technologies. We point out that tunnels are a security threat and suggest how
    mobile systems may be made 'less insecure' with the use of IP layer security (IPSEC)
    as one means for creating Virtual Private Networks. The goal is to describe a
    security model wherein mobile systems can work across the Internet and not just
    as an interior routing protocol within one security and/or interior routing domain.
    Both the protection of Mobile Systems abroad and of Security Enclaves that tolerate
    mobile visitors must be considered.</p>"
