abstract:
  content: "<p>In this paper we discuss various security issues concerning MobileHosts
    using Mobile-IP or other mobility systems (DHCP standalone)and current firewall
    technology. We first present some recentattacks on the Internet and what they
    might mean for mobile systemslike Mobile-IP that rely on tunneling technologies.
    We point outthat tunnels are a security threat and suggest how mobile systemsmay
    be made 'less insecure' with the use of IP layer security(IPSEC) as one means
    for creating Virtual Private Networks. Thegoal is to describe a security model
    wherein mobile systems canwork across the Internet and not just as an interior
    routing protocolwithin one security and/or interior routing domain. Both theprotection
    of Mobile Systems abroad and of Security Enclaves thattolerate mobile visitors
    must be considered.</p>"
