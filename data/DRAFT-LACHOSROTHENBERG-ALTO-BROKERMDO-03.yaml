abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Evolving networking scenarios (e.g., 5G) demand new multiple\n
    \  administrative domain (aka multi-domain) orchestration models.  This\n   document
    proposes a new broker-plane approach working on top of per-\n   domain management
    and orchestration functions to coordinate the\n   delivery of a multi-operator
    End-to-End Network Service (E2ENS).\n   This proposed design resorts to the Application-Layer
    Traffic\n   Optimization (ALTO) protocol to offer topology and resource\n   information
    from different administrative domains.  The ALTO services\n   with the proposed
    protocol extension offer aggregated views on\n   various types of resources contributing
    to a more simple and scalable\n   solution.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
