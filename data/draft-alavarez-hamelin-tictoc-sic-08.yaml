abstract:
  content: "<p>Synchronizing Internet Clock (sic) Frequency specifies a new secure
    method to synchronize clocks on the Internet, assuring smoothness (i.e., frequency
    stability) and robustness to man-in-the-middle attacks. This protocol is oriented
    to assure the quality of Internet performance measurements, where they are frequently
    obtained as the difference of timestamps, hence frequency stability is needed.
    In 90% of all cases, Synchronized Internet Clock Frequency is highly accurate,
    with a Maximum Time Interval Error of fewer than 25 microseconds by a minute.
    Synchronized Internet Clock Frequency is based on a regular packet exchange and
    works with commodity terminal hardware.</p>"
