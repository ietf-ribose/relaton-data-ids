abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   PIM is widely deployed multicast protocol.  PIM protocol is
    defined\n   in [RFC4601] and [RFC7761].  As deployment for PIM protocol growing\n
    \  day by day, user expect least traffic loss and fast convergence in\n   case
    of any network failure.  This document provides extension to\n   existing defined
    protocol which would improve stability of PIM\n   protocol with respect to traffic
    loss and convergence time when the\n   PIM DR is down.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
