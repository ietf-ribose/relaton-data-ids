abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Routers perform two distinct user-plane functionalities, namely\n
    \  forwarding (where the packet should be sent) and scheduling (when the\n   packet
    should be sent).  One forwarding paradigm is segment routing,\n   in which forwarding
    instructions are encoded in the packet in a stack\n   data structure, rather than
    programmed into the routers.  Time\n   Sensitive Networking and Deterministic
    Networking provide several\n   mechanisms for scheduling under the assumption
    that routers are time\n   synchronized.  The most effective mechanisms for delay
    minimization\n   involve per-flow resource allocation.\n\n   SRTSN is a unified
    approach to forwarding and scheduling that uses a\n   single stack data structure.
    \ Each stack entry consists of a\n   forwarding portion (e.g., IP addresses or
    suffixes) and a scheduling\n   portion (deadline by which the packet must exit
    the router).  SRTSN\n   thus fully implements network programming for time sensitive
    flows,\n   by prescribing to each router both to-where and by-when each packet\n
    \  should be sent.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
