abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) refers to the
    set of\n   virtual network operations needed to orchestrate, control and manage\n
    \  large-scale multi-domain TE networks, so as to facilitate network\n   programmability,
    automation, efficient resource sharing, and end-to-\n   end virtual service aware
    connectivity and network function\n   virtualization services.\n\n   This document
    explains how the different types of YANG models\n   defined in the Operations
    and Management Area and in the Routing\n   Area are applicable to the ACTN framework.
    This document also shows\n   how the ACTN architecture can be satisfied using
    classes of data\n   model that have already been defined, and discusses the\n
    \  applicability of specific data models that are under development. It\n   also
    highlights where new data models may need to be developed.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
