abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  PMIPv6\nenables
    mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across\ngateways without
    changing the IP address.\n\nCurrent PMIPv6 specification does only support the
    movement of hosts\nwithin the localized mobility domain.  A mobile network (commonly\nreferred
    to as a NEMO, NEtwork that MOves) can also benefit from the\nnetwork-based localized
    mobility support provided by PMIPv6, but in a\nlimited way.  This I-D describes
    what can be done with current\nstandardized protocols, and describes the problem
    statement of fully\nsupporting network mobility in Proxy Mobile IPv6.\n\nThe goal
    of this document is to present the problem -- and the use\ncases where this problem
    is relevant to be solved -- to collect\nfeedback from the community about the
    interest in working on this\nproblem.\n\t </p>\n      "
