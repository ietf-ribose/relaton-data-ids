abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
    guidance to applications, which have to select one or several hosts from a set
    of candidates that are able to provide a desired resource. Entities seeking guidance
    need to discover and possibly select an ALTO server to ask. This is called ALTO
    server discovery. This memo describes an ALTO server discovery mechanism for a
    3rd party setting, i.e., where the ALTO client is not co-located with the actual
    resource consumer.</p>"
