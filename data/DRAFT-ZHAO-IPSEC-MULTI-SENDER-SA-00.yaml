abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Astract: In this draft, we propose two efficient and practical
    \nmechanisms to enable the anti-replay service in the multiple sender SA. \nAs
    IPSec is still under its development, this draft is mainly based on \nthe existing
    RFCs. The two solutions require only minor change to the \ncurrent standards and
    are back compatible. The security of new \nproposals and the impacts of possible
    future standards will be analyzed \nand discussed. \n\t </p>\n      "
