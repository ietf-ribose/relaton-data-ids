abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Traffic Engineering (TE) mesh-group is defined as a group
    of Label\n   Switch Routers (LSRs) that are connected by a full mesh of TE LSPs.\n
    \  Routing (OSPF and IS-IS) extensions for discovery Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching
    (MPLS) LSR TE mesh membership has been defined to automate\n   the creation of
    mesh of TE LSPs.\n\n   This document introduces a role-based TE mesh-group that
    applies to\n   the scenarios where full mesh TE LSPs is not necessary and TE LSPs\n
    \  setup depends on the roles of LSRs in a TE mesh-group.  Interior\n   Gateway
    Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for automatic discovery of\n   role-based TE
    mesh membership are defined accordingly.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
