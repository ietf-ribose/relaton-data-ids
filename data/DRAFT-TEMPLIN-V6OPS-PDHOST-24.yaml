abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Requesting nodes typically acquire IPv6 prefixes from a prefix\n
    \  delegation service for the network.  The requesting node can\n   provision
    the prefix according to whether it acts as a router on\n   behalf of any downstream
    networks and/or as a host on behalf of its\n   local applications.  In the latter
    case, the requesting node can use\n   portions of the delegated prefix for its
    own multi-addressing\n   purposes.  This document therefore considers prefix delegation
    models\n   for both the classic routing and various multi-addressing use cases.\n\n\t
