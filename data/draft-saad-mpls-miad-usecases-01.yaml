abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a number of use cases that have a common need
    for encoding MPLS function indicators and ancillary data inside MPLS packets.
    There has been significant recent interest in extending the MPLS data plane to
    carry such ancillary data to address a number of use cases described in this document.
    The use cases described are not an exhaustive set, but rather the ones that are
    actively discussed by members of the IETF MPLS, PALS and DETNET working groups
    participating in the MPLS Open Design Team.</p>"
