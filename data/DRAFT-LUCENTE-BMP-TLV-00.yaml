abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Most of the message types defined by the BGP Monitoring Protocol\n
    \  (BMP) do provision for optional trailing data; however Route\n   Monitoring
    message (to provide a snapshot of the monitored Routing\n   Information Base)
    and Peer Down message (to indicate that a peering\n   session was terminated)
    do not.  Supporting optional data in TLV\n   format across all BMP message types
    allows for an homogeneous and\n   extensible surface that would be useful for
    the most different use-\n   cases that need to convey additional data to a BMP
    station.  While\n   this document does not want to cover any specific utilization\n
    \  scenario, it defines a simple way to support optional TLV data in all\n   message
    types.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
