abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The packet loss rate of each path between the source node anddestination
    node can be obtained through two methods, one is directmeasurement, another approach
    is proposed in this documentcalculating the packet loss rate based on the flow
    sensing parameter.The core idea of the calculating approach is the flow sensingparameter,
    which can be used to calculate the packet loss rate ofeach path between the source
    node and destination node and select thepath whose packet loss rate is smallest
    to be the data transmissionpath.</p>"
