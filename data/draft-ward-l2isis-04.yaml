abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft specifies the IS-IS extensions necessary to support multi-link
    IPv4 and IPv6 networks, as well as to provide true link staterouting to any protocols
    running directly over layer 2. Whilesupporting this concept involves several pieces,
    this document onlydescribes extensions to IS-IS. We leave it to the systems usingthese
    IS-IS extensions to explain how the information carried inIS-IS is used.1. OverviewThere
    are a number of systems (for example, [RBRIDGES]) which haveproposed using layer
    2 addresses carried in a link state routingprotocol, specifically IS-IS [IS-IS]
    [RFC1195], to provide true layer2 routing in specific environments. This draft
    proposes a set ofTLVs and sub-TLVs to be added to [IS-IS] level 1 PDUs, and three
    newPDU types, to support these proposed systems.This draft does not propose new
    forwarding mechanisms using thisadditional information carried within IS-IS. There
    is a shortsection included on two possible ways to build a shortest path firsttree
    including this information, to illustrate how this informationmight be used.</p>"
