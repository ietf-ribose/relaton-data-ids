abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The document describes a mechanism for basic IPv6 multihoming support,and
    its operational requirements. The mechanism can be combined withmore sophisticated
    (or complex) multihoming support mechanisms, and canbe used as a foundation for
    other mechanisms. The document is largelybased on RFC2260 [Bates, 1998] by Tony
    Bates.</p>"
