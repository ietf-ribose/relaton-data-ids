abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\n
    \  functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching
    (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n\n   The Source Packet Routing
    in Networking (SPRING) architecture\n   describes how Segment Routing (SR) can
    be used to steer packets\n   through an IPv6 or MPLS network using the source
    routing paradigm.  A\n   Segment Routed Path can be derived from a variety of
    mechanisms,\n   including an IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration,
    or\n   a Path Computation Element (PCE).\n\n   Since the SR does not require signaling,
    the path maximum\n   transmission unit (MTU) information for SR path is not available.\n
    \  This document specify the extension to PCE communication protocol\n   (PCEP)
    to carry path (MTU) in the PCEP messages.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
