abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The \"Basic\" authentication scheme defined in RFC 2617 does
    not\n   properly define how to treat non-ASCII characters.  This has led to a\n
    \  situation where user agent implementations disagree, and servers make\n   different
    assumptions based on the locales they are running in.\n   There is little interoperability
    for the non-ASCII characters in the\n   ISO-8859-1 character repertoire, and even
    less interoperability for\n   any characters beyond that.\n\n   This document
    defines a backwards-compatible extension to \"Basic\",\n   specifying the server's
    character encoding scheme expectation, using\n   a new authentication scheme parameter.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
