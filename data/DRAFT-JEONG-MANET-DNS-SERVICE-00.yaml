abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an architecture of DNS service system
    for \n   mobile ad hoc network which might be connected to the Internet.  The
    \n   resolution of DNS names of mobile nodes within mobile ad hoc network \n   is
    performed by multicast DNS and that of DNS names of nodes in the \n   Internet
    is performed through DNS autoconfiguration of recursive DNS \n   server.  In the
    former, each mobile node plays a role of DNS name \n   server for the DNS resource
    records associated with DNS name of which \n   authority it has.  The latter allows
    mobile node to receive the \n   global Internet service, such as web service,
    by providing global DNS \n   resolution in mobile ad hoc network connected to
    the Internet.  These \n   two kinds of DNS name resolution are processed automatically
    without \n   the intervention of users in mobile ad hoc network.  Also, this \n
    \  document specifies how to authenticate DNS message as well as how to \n   provide
    ad hoc users with service discovery based on multicast DNS. \n\t </p>\n      "
