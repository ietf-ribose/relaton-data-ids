abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPsec tunneling provides a site-to-site connection when building
    a \nCE-based IPsec VPN. In a large scale VPN deployment, especially when \na service
    provider manages a large number VPNs, there is a need to \nmanage IPsec tunnels
    on a group basis, instead of on a tunnel basis.  \nThis document describes the
    definition of a VPN group, its \nattributes, and usage of VPN group when managing
    IPsec tunnels. By \ngrouping IPsec tunnels and sites into an IPsec VPN group,
    service \nproviders can design, provision, and manage the IPsec-based CE VPN \nat
    both group level and tunnel/site level. This gives service \nproviders more flexibility
    and provides more aggregation capability \nto reduce operation complexity.\n\t
