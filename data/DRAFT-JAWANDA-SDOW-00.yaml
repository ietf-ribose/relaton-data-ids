abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this document, a concept of main directory agent (MDA) is introduced.\nThe
    main directory agent utilizes conjoined operations of Mobile IP and\nSLP including
    new proposed extensions. The MDA expedites service &amp;\nlocation discovery process
    for mobile hosts and provides local system\nadministrators with control over the
    usage of deployed services. It\nprovides a mechanism for local system administrators
    to enforce local\npolicies for the allocation of local access resources when desired.\n
    \nThe MDA based service discovery by mobile hosts is particularly\neffective in
    the case of wireless networks. Wireless links have\nsubstantially lower bandwidth,
    suffer from higher error rates and need\nto support higher mobility of hosts/data
    terminals compared to wired\nlinks (e.g. LAN). Thus, to disseminate any information
    to mobile hosts\nover the wireless links the multicasting or broadcasting paradigm\nshould
    be used sparingly.\n \nIn view of this, optional extensions to Mobile IP and SLP
    protocol are\nrecommended and discussed in this document. Again, the intent is
    to\nmake the overall service discovery process expeditious and effective\nfor
    mobile hosts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
