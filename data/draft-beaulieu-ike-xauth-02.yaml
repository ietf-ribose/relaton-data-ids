abstract:
  content: "<p>[IKE] allows a device to set up a secure session by using abidirectional
    authentication method using either pre-shared keys ordigital certificates. However
    [IKE] does not provide a method toleverage legacy authentication methods which
    are widely deployedtoday.This document describes a method for using existing unidirectionalauthentication
    mechanisms such as RADIUS, SecurID, and OTP withinIPSec's ISAKMP protocol. The
    purpose of this draft is not toreplace or enhance the existing authentication
    mechanisms describedin [IKE], but rather to allow them to be extended using legacyauthentication
    mechanisms.</p>"
