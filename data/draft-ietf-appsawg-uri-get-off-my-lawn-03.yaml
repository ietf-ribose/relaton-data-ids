abstract:
- content: <p>RFC3986 Section 1.1.1 defines URI syntax as "a federated and extensible
    naming system wherein each scheme's specification may further restrict the syntax
    and semantics of identifiers using that scheme." In other words, the structure
    of a URI is defined by its scheme. While it is common for schemes to further delegate
    their substructure to the URI's owner, publishing independent standards that mandate
    particular forms of URI substructure is inappropriate, because the essentially
    usurps ownership. This document clarifies both this problematic practice and some
    acceptable alternatives in standards.</p>
