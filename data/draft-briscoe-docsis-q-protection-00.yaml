abstract:
  content: "<p>This informational document defines and explains the specification
    of the queue protection algorithm used in DOCSIS 3.1. It is believed this algorithm
    will be useful in scenarios other than DOCSIS. A shared low latency queue relies
    on the non-queue-building behaviour of every traffic flow using it. However, some
    flows might not take such care, either accidentally or maliciously. If a queue
    is about to exceed a threshold level of delay, the queue protection algorithm
    can rapidly detect the flow(s) most likely to be responsible. It can then prevent
    selected packets of these flows (or whole flows) from harming the queuing delay
    of other traffic in the low latency queue.</p>"
