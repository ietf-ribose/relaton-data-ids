abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Service Orchestration Protocol
    (SOP)\n   message flows for some important service orchestration scenarios. The\n
    \  flows contain complete packet information including both SOP and\n   Service
    Description Framework (SDF) payloads. The message flows in\n   this document are
    by no means exhaustive, but they carry sufficient\n   information using which
    other flows can be easily constructed. The\n   deployment scenarios for services
    are varied, and it is not possible\n   to cover every possible scenario. Nevertheless,
    those flows will\n   follow closely the information given in this document.\n\n\t
