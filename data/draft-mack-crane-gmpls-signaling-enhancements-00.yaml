abstract:
- content: "<p>GMPLS [2] has now been proposed as an extension to the MPLS framework
    to include non packet-switched optical technologies, such as time-division multiplexing
    (PDH/SDH/SONET) and wavelength division multiplexing (lambdas/fibers). This draft
    proposes an enhanced label request format for such optical technologies, which
    accounts for some special characteristics of these technologies (see, for instance,
    [3], [4], [5])that differentiate them from packet-switched technologies. When
    enumerating our encoding, we focus, for clarity, on optical TDM technologies,
    since the standards for these are well-defined, but it will be seen that the proposal
    has very general applicability.</p>"
