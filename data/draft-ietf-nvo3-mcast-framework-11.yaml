abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework for supporting multicast traffic
    in a network that uses Network Virtualization over Layer 3 (NVO3). Both infrastructure
    multicast and application-specific multicast are discussed. It describes the various
    mechanisms that can be used for delivering such traffic as well as the data plane
    and control plane considerations for each of the mechanisms.</p>"
