abstract:
- content: <p>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained devices. These
    devices typically have some combination of limited battery power, small memory
    footprint and low throughput links. It is expected that in CoAP networks there
    will be a certain portion of devices that are "sleepy" and which may occasionally
    go into a sleep mode (i.e. go into a low power state to conserve power) and temporarily
    suspend CoAP protocol communication. This document proposes a minimal and efficient
    mechanism building on the Resource Directory concept to enhance sleepy node support
    in CoAP networks.</p>
