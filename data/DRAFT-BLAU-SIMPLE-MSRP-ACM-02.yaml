abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an alternative connection model for MSRP
    UAs.\nThe model differs from the standard MSRP model, as defined in RFC4975\nand
    RFC4976 in the following ways: it uses COMEDIA for TCP connection\nestablishment,
    and it allows the usage of SDP in a more conventional\nway for conveying endpoint
    address information.  Because of this, the\nmodel also allows for the usage of
    generic mainstream mechanisms for\nNAT traversal, instead of using MSRP relays.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
