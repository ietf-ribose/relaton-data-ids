abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Deals with DMARC acceptance failures disrupting legitimate
    and valid\n   message distribution affecting millions while attempting to exclude\n
    \  From header field domains not aligned with email acceptance methods\n   in
    a manner incompatible with normal email conventions.  DMARC does\n   not accommodate
    recent message structure underscoring the erroneous\n   premise of a store-and-forward
    transport enforcing non-negotiable\n   message structure.  Active exploitation
    of DMARC dependency on flawed\n   acceptance practices are further aggravated
    when its feedback is sent\n   to malefactors.  Risks prevented by careful accommodation
    of\n   legitimate and valid messages also better ensures economic, social,\n   and
    civic benefits derived from an open exchange of email.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
