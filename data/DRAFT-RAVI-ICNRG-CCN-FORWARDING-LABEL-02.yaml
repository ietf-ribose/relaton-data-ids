abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The objective of this proposal is to enable application identifier\n
    \  (AI) and network identifier (NI) split in the CCN protocol that has\n   several
    applications such as towards Interest routing optimization,\n   mobility, conversational
    session support, handling indirections in\n   manifests, and routing scalability.
    \ We enable this through the\n   notion of forwarding label object (FLO), which
    is an optional hop-by-\n   hop payload in the Interest message with a topological
    name which\n   identifies a network domain, router or a host.  FLO can be inserted\n
    \  by the end user applications or by the network.  FLO is processed by\n   the
    network resulting in either terminating it or swapping it with a\n   new FLO based
    on the network service context.  Furthermore, depending\n   on the application
    and trust context, a FLO can be subjected to\n   policy based actions by the forwarders
    such as invoking security\n   verification or enabling other FLO management actions.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
