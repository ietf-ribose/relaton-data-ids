abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes updated processes for defining and implementing
    policies regarding the RFC Series as a whole and thus specifies version 3 of RFC
    Editor Model. As specified here, the model divides the responsibilities for the
    RFC Series into two high- level tasks. Policy definition is the responsibility
    of the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces policy proposals that are
    subject to approval by the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB). Policy implementation
    is primarily the responsibility of the RFC Production Center (RPC), under the
    ultimate authority of the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF
    LLC). This document obsoletes RFC 8728.</p>"
