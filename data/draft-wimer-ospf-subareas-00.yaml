abstract:
  content: "<p>This document outlines a proposal for extending the OSPF intra-domainrouting
    protocol [1] to support an additional level of hierarchy fortraffic engineering
    purposes. The additional level of hierarchyallows the construction of much larger
    networks.With some modification, it should be possible to apply theseprinciples
    to the IS-IS routing protocol as well.</p>"
