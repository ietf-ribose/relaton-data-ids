abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the BGP is deployed in a single Autonomous System for network\n
    \  convergence such as Seamless MPLS, it is desirable for BGP to carry\n   more
    information to help select routing more intelligently.  It can\n   reduce the
    cost proposed by complex policy control design on BGP\n   routes and adapt to
    network change easily.  This document proposed a\n   new path attribute for BGP
    routes that can record the next hop path\n   for the route to help BGP route selection
    and network management.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
