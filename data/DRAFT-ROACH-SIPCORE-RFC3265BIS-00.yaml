abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation\nProtocol
    (SIP).  The purpose of this extension is to provide an\nextensible framework by
    which SIP nodes can request notification from\nremote nodes indicating that certain
    events have occurred.\n\nNote that the event notification mechanisms defined herein
    are NOT\nintended to be a general-purpose infrastructure for all classes of\nevent
    subscription and notification.\n\t </p>\n      "
