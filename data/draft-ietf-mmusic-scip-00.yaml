abstract:
- content: "<p>The conference invitation protocol (SCIP) is an application-level protocol
    for inviting users to multimedia conferences. Network users are identified by
    their universal communication identifier, usually their electronic mail address.
    SCIP offers personal mobility by supporting forwarding and redirection. It can
    reuse the general email infrastructure, including DNS MX records, mailing lists
    and aliases. The protocol combines aspects of HTTP and SMTP and can re-use their
    security mechanism. The protocol is extensible in methods and parameters and is
    designed to allow interoperation with ITU-T T.124 (Generic Conference Control).
    Extension to VCR-control are possible as well. The protocol supports both loose
    and tight conference styles.</p>"
