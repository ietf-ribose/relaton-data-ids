abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The demand for wireless mobile networking has been dramatically
    \nincreased thanks to rapid development of Wireless technology and \nde facto
    Mobile IP technology.  Mobile IP, as originally specified, \ndefines the protocol
    enhancements that can provide IP mobility over \nthe Internet.  The mobile node,
    identified by its Home Address \nregardless its attaching point can have transparent
    routing of IP \ndatagrams.  However it is also necessary to provide User Mobility
    in \nnowadays wireless mobile network.  The user authentication which is \ndefining
    in this document is to help user to originate and terminate \nthe packet regardless
    of the location of mobile terminal and \nwithout home address through AAA infrastructure.
    \ This document \nspecifies the mechanism for the MN-AAA authentication in Mobile
    IPv6 \nfor IP User Mobility support.\n\t </p>\n      "
