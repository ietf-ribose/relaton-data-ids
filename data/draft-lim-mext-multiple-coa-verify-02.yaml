abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Using multiple care-of address registration, there is a possibilitythat
    a malicious mobile node could create multiple care-of addressbindings that does
    not belong to the mobile node at its home agent.The home agent would accept these
    bindings without verifying them dueto the trust relationship it has with the mobile
    node. With thesebindings, the mobile node can launch attacks by asking the home
    agentto flood the victims of these care-of addresses with useless packets.To mitigate
    such a problem, this memo introduces a few possibleverification mechanisms that
    the home agent would use in order toverify the care-of addresses for the mobile
    node before using themfor packet routing.</p>"
