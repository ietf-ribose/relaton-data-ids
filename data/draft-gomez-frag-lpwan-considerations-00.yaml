abstract:
- content: "<p>The SCHC adaptation layer provides header compression and fragmentation
    functionality between IPv6 and an underlying LPWAN technology. SCHC fragmentation
    has been specifically designed for the characteristics of LPWANs. However, when
    CoAP is used at the application layer, there exists an alternative approach for
    fragmentation, which is using the CoAP Block option. This document aims at illustrating
    the advantages and limitations of each approach for transferring larger payloads.</p>"
