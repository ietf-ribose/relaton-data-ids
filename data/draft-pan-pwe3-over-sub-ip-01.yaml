abstract:
  content: "<p>Several recent developments have significantly affected the carrieraccess
    networks. First, all large carrier backbones have migrated toMPLS. Second, carriers
    are upgrading access circuits with less expensiveand high-speed Ethernet. Finally,
    the carriers will be offering advanceddata services over the access network infrastructure.
    Subsequently, thecarriers have to face challenges in migration cost, data transportefficiency
    and edge-to-edge user traffic management.The Dry-Martini architecture is designed
    to help the carriers toalleviate these challenges. It provides an approach to
    establish andmaintain pseudo-wires over any access network infrastructure, whilestripping
    off much of the IP/MPLS routing and signaling features thatare irrelevant in access
    network. As a result, all the existingtransport equipment, such as SONET/SDH MSPP,
    can provide MPLS pseudo-wire functionality without much change to the existing
    platform.Further, due its simplicity, this approach allows the new accessdevices,
    such as PON’s and Ethernet CPE’s, to maintain low cost, whilebeing able to interface
    with MPLS networks.This document assumes that the reader has at least some familiarity
    withMPLS and pseudo-wire technologies.</p>"
