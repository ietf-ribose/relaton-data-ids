abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies how to interconnect multiple Transparent\n
    \  Interconnection of Lots of links (TRILL) sites with an intervening\n   MPLS
    network using existing TRILL and VPLS standards. This draft\n   addresses two
    problems as follows:\n\n   1) Providing connection between more than two TRILL
    sites that\n   are separated by MPLS provider network.\n\n   2) Providing a single
    logical virtualized TRILL network for\n   different tenants that are separated
    by an MPLS provider network.\n\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
