abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is an application protocol\n
    \  proposed for constrained nodes and constrained networks. Industrial\n   Internet
    of Things (IIoT) is an attractive scenario for CoAP. OPC\n   Unified Architecture
    (OPC UA) defines a semantic-based information\n   model and a service-oriented
    architecture for IIoT, which can\n   satisfy the requirements of Industry 4.0.
    This document analyses\n   requirements for transmitting OPC UA over CoAP.\n\n\t
