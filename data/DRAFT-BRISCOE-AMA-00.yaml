abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This paper presents an approach for solving the inherent problem
    with\nmulticast routing scalability - by co-operation between end-systems and\nthe
    network. We introduce an extremely efficient, elegant way to name\narbitrary sized
    inter-meshed aggregations of multicast addresses. This\nis done in such a way
    that it is easy to calculate how to change the\nname to encompass many more related
    names. We describe how these\naggregate names could be used anywhere in place
    of the set of addresses\nto which they refer, not by resolving them into multiple
    operations, but\nby a single bulk action throughout the routing tree, and in session\ndescriptions
    potentially including those for reservations. Initial\naggregation in end-systems
    might only reduce the problem by an order of\nmagnitude, but it is believed that
    this will provide sufficient\nstructure for routers to be able to recognise further
    aggregation\npotential.  To improve the chances of router aggregation, address
    set\nallocation schemes must fulfil certain criteria that are laid down in\nthis
    paper.\n\t </p>\n      "
