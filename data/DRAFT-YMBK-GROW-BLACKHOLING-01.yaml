abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of a well-known Border Gateway\n
    \  Protocol (BGP) community for blackholing at IP networks and Internet\n   Exchange
    Points (IXP).  This well-known advisory transitive BGP\n   community, namely BLACKHOLE,
    allows an origin AS to specify that a\n   neighboring IP network or IXP should
    blackhole a specific IP prefix.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
