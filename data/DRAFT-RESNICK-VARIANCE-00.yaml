abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   From time to time, there are unforeseen circumstances which
    make\n   following the requirements of a Best Current Practice (BCP)\n   untenable,
    or where the procedures described in the BCP gives no\n   guidance.  This document
    defines a process for the IETF to grant a\n   variance to any IETF process for
    a single use or of very short\n   duration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
