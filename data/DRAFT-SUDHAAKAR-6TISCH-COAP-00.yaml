abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The [IEEE802154e] standardizes the TSCH mode of operation and
    defines\n   the mechanisms for layer 2 communication between conforming devices.\n
    \  6top defines a set of commands to monitor and manage the TSCH\n   schedule.
    \ To realize the full functionality of sensor networks and\n   allow their adoption
    and use in real applications we need additional\n   mechanisms.  Specifically,
    we need to define how to interact with\n   6top, control and modify schedules,
    monitor parameters etc.  Higher\n   layers monitoring and management entities
    are then able to use these\n   capabilities to create feedback loops.  Although,
    there have been\n   many custom implementations of such feedback loops between
    the\n   routing, transport and MAC layers in sensor network deployments,\n   there
    has been a lack of standards based approaches.  The goal of the\n   memo is to
    define a generic data model between monitoring and\n   management entities and
    the 6top layer and define a mapping to the\n   6top commands.  The document also
    presents a particular\n   implementation of the model based on CoAP and CBOR.\n\n\t
