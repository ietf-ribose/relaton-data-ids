abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Flow Label field in IPv6 packet header is designed to\n
    \  differentiate the various traffic flow session within network. The\n   current
    definition of IPv6 Flow Label focuses mainly on how the\n   packet source forms
    the value of this field and how the forwarder\n   in-path treats it. There is
    no analysis on the relation between the\n   flow label from source nodes and its
    corresponding value in return\n   packet. This draft analyzes the requirements
    for flow label\n   reflection between the upstream session and the corresponding\n
    \  downstream session. Based on the analysis, the flow label reflection\n   mechanism
    is proposed in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
