abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to request and provision keying material
    in group communication scenarios where communications are based on CoAP and secured
    with Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE). The proposed
    method delegates the authentication and authorization of new client nodes that
    join an OSCORE group through a Group Manager server. This approach builds on the
    ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization, and leverages protocol-specific
    profiles of ACE to achieve communication security, proof-of-possession and server
    authentication.</p>"
