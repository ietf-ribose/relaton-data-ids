abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Documents in the RFC series normally use only plain-text ASCII\ncharacters
    and a fixed-width font.  However, there is sometimes a\nneed to supplement the
    ASCII text with graphics or picture images.\nThe historic solution to this requirement,
    allowing secondary PDF and\nPostscript files, is seldom used because it is awkward
    for authors\nand publisher.  This memo suggests a more convenient scheme for\nattaching
    authoritative diagrams, illustrations, or other graphics to\nRFCs.  It further
    proposes conventions for additional input and\ndisplay formats, to improve readability.
    \ This proposal is based on\ndraft-rfc-image-files-00, by Braden and Klensin,
    and revises it as\nlittle as possible, while expanding the goals of the effort.\n\t
