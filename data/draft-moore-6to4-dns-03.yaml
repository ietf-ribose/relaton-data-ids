abstract:
  content: "<p>6to4 [1] defines a mechanism for allowing sites to communicateusing
    IPv6 over the public IPv4 Internet. It does so by assigning ablock of IPv6 addresses
    corresponding to any 'public' (globally-scoped)IPv4 address, and a means of tunneling
    IPv6 traffic destined for suchaddresses over the IPv4 Internet. In this way, any
    site which isconnected to the IPv4 Internet and which has at least one global
    IPv4address assigned to it, can communicate with IPv6.The advantage of 6to4 is
    that it decouples deployment of IPv6 bythe core of the network (e.g. Internet
    Service Providers or ISPs) fromdeployment of IPv6 at the edges (e.g. customer
    sites), allowing eachsite or ISP to deploy IPv6 support in its own time frame
    according toits own priorities. With 6to4, the edges may communicate with oneanother
    using IPv6 even if one or more of their ISPs do not yet providenative IPv6 service.
    In addition, the principal cost of the 6to4transition mechanism is borne by those
    who benefit from it.However, the ability to perform so-called 'reverse lookups'(lookups
    of IP addresses rather than domain names) in DNS requires thatthere be a delegation
    path for the IP address being queried, from theDNS root to the servers for the
    DNA zone which provides the PTR recordsfor that IP address. For ordinary IPv6
    addresses, the necessary DNSservers and records for IPv6 reverse lookups would
    be maintained by theeach organization to which an address block is delegated;
    the delegationpath of DNS records reflects the delegation of address blocksthemselves.
    However, for IPv6 addresses beginning with the 6to4 addressprefix, the DNS records
    would need to reflect IPv4 address delegation.Since the entire motivation of 6to4
    is to decouple site deployment ofIPv6 from infrastructure deployment of IPv6,
    such records cannot beexpected to be present for a site using 6to4 - especially
    for a sitewhose ISP did not yet support IPv6 in any form.This memo discusses several
    potential mechanisms for locating theDNS servers which are assumed to provide
    'reverse lookup' of 6to4addresses.</p>"
