abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document recommends IPv6 behavior for Customer Premises\nEquipment
    (CPE) routers in Internet-enabled homes and small offices.\nThe CPE Router may
    be a standalone device.  The CPE Router may also\nbe embedded in a device such
    as a cable modem, DSL modem, cellular\nphone, etc.  This document describes the
    router portion of such a\ndevice.  The purpose behind this document is to provide
    minimal\nfunctionality for interoperability and create consistency in the\ncustomer
    experience and satisfy customer expectations for the device.\nFurther, the document
    also provide some guidance for implementers to\nexpedite availability of IPv6
    CPE router products in the marketplace.\nIt is expected that standards bodies
    other than the IETF developing\nstandards for specific products in this area (e.g.
    \ CableLabs\neRouter, DSL Forum, Home Gateway Initiative, etc.) may reference
    this\nwork for basic functionality and provide value-added or linktype-\nspecific
    customizations and enhancements which are beyond the scope\nof this document.\n\t
