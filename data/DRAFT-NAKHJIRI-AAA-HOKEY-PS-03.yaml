abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides a framework
    for\nperforming authentication and key management using the AAA\ninfrastructure.
    \ The framework deals with a model which includes a\npeer, a pass-through authenticator
    and a backend authentication\nserver.\n\nSome of the emerging mobile networks
    use EAP in handover scenarios in\nways that go beyond currently defined EAP keying
    framework.  This\ndocument provides a problem statement for the usage of EAP in
    these\nemerging mobile networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
