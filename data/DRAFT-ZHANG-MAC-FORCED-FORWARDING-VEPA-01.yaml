abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   If MAC Forced Forwarding (RFC4562) is enabled on Top Of Rack\n
    \  switches, ARPing messages exchanged within a Customer Premises\n   Network
    should be discarded. However, when Virtual Ethernet Port\n   Aggregator is deployed
    in the Customer Premises Network, this kind of\n   discarding may disconnect VMs
    within the same subnet. This document\n   suggests interfaces should be differentiated
    to address this problem.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
