abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) enable Relying Parties
    to put\n   trust in the trustworthiness of a remote Attester and therefore to\n
    \  decide if to engage in secure interactions with it - or not.\n   Evidence about
    trustworthiness can be rather complex, voluminous or\n   Attester-specific.  As
    it is deemed unrealistic that every Relying\n   Party is capable of the appraisal
    of Evidence, that burden is taken\n   on by a Verifier.  In order to conduct Evidence
    appraisal procedures,\n   a Verifier requires not only fresh Evidence from an
    Attester, but\n   also trusted Endorsements and Reference Values from Endorsers,
    such\n   as manufacturers, distributors, or owners.  This document specifies\n
    \  Concise Reference Integrity Manifests (CoRIM) that represent\n   Endorsements
    and Reference Values in CBOR format.  Composite devices\n   or systems are represented
    by a collection of Concise Module\n   Identifiers (CoMID) and Concise Software
    Identifiers (CoSWID) bundled\n   in a CoRIM document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
