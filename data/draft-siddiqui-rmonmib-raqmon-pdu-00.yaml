abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo defines a common protocol data unit (PDU) used betweenRAQMON
    Data Source (RDS) and RAQMON Report Collector (RRC) to reporta QOS statistics
    using RTCP and SNMP as Transport Protocol.The original RAQMON draft [SIDDIQUI3]
    was split into 3 parts toidentify the RAQMON Framework, RAQMON QOS PDU and RAQMON
    MIB.This memo defined RAQMON QOS Protocol Data Unit (PDU). This memo alsooutlines
    mechanisms to use Real Time Transport Control Protocol(RTCP) and Simple Network
    Management Protocol (SNMP) to transportthese PDUs between RAQMON Data Source (RDS)
    and RAQMON ReportCollector (RRC) as outlined in RAQMON Charter of the RMON Workgroup.The
    memo [SIDDIQUI2] defines a Real-Time Application QOS Monitoring(RAQMON) Framework
    that extends the RMON Framework to allow Real-timeApplication QoS information
    as outlined by RAQMON Charter of the RMONWorkgroup.The memo [SIDDIQUI1] defines
    a portion of the Management InformationBase (MIB) for use with network management
    protocols in the Internetcommunity. The document proposes an extension to the
    RemoteMonitoring MIB [RFC2819] to accommodate RAQMON solution.Distribution of
    this memo is unlimited.</p>"
