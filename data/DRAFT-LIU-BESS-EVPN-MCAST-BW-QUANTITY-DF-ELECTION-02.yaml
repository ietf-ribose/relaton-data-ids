abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN, RFC7432) is becoming\n
    \  prevalent in Data Centers, Data Center Interconnect (DCI) and\n   Service Provider
    VPN applications. When multi-homing from a CE to\n   multiple PEs, including links
    in an EVPN instance on a given\n   Ethernet Segment, in an all-active redundancy
    mode, [RFC7432]\n   describes a basic mechanism to elect a Designated Forwarder
    (DF),\n   and [RFC8584] improves basic DF election by a HRW algorithm. [I-\n   D.ietf-bess-evpn-per-mcast-flow-df-election]
    enhances the HRW\n   algorithm for the multicast flows to perform DF election
    at the\n   granularity of (ESI, VLAN, Mcast flow). This document specifies a\n
    \  new algorithm, based on multicast bandwidth utilization and\n   multicast state
    quantity, in order for the multicast flows to elect\n   a DF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
