abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document first analyzes the critical issues of bottlenecks
    in\n   existing tunneling and translation technologies, which can be solved\n
    \  by proper load balancing mechanisms(e,g., scalability, availability,\n   and
    single point of failure).  Then, several key factors in designing\n   a valid
    load balancing mechanism are described.  Solutions to\n   specific load balancing
    requirements can be drawn out by considering\n   these factors.  At last, current
    efforts about load balancing are\n   introduced.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
