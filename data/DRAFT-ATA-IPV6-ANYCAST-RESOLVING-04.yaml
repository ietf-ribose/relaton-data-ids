abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Since the route of packets to the same anycast adddress may
    change\n   according to the network/node condition, it is not suitable to use\n
    \  anycast addresses directry for stateful communications (such as TCP).\n   The
    more preferable use of the anycast addresses is to discover (the\n   unicast address
    of) service node.\n\n   The approach intended to describe in this document is
    to resolve\n   (i.e., obtain) the corresponding unicast address for the anycast\n
    \  address prior to establishing the communication. We call this process\n   as
    Anycast Address Resolving (AARP).\n\n   The objevtive of the AARP is to enable
    the use of anycast addresses\n   to all existing applications without any modifications.\n\t
