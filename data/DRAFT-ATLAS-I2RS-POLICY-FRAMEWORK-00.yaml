abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A key aspect of the Interface to the Routing System (I2RS)
    is what\n   mechanisms it includes to carry policy information and to enable\n
    \  policy control.  This applies both in the protocol itself and in the\n   services
    associated with the different components of the routing\n   system.  Similarly,
    the data-models associated with the services must\n   be capable of expressing
    the appropriate granularity for access and\n   authorization-related policy.  This
    document describes the policy\n   framework for I2RS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
