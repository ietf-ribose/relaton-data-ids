abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes MRCC, a scalable multirate congestion controlbuilding
    block for multicast. MRCC is an approach that allows multiplereceivers to concurrently
    receive packets from a single sender at vary-ing rates depending on individual
    bandwidth connections and network con-ditions. Two basic goals of the approach
    are to allow each receiver toobtain the full benefit of the available bandwidth
    to the sender and tobe fair to other flows in the network.</p>"
