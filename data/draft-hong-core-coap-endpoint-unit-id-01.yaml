abstract:
- content: <p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a protocol intended towards
    devices which are constrained in terms of memory, processing and power i.e. small
    low power sensors, switches and valves etc. The CoAP allows such devices to interactively
    communicate over the Internet. This document is motivated by the concept of a
    composite CoAP node, a single CoAP entity which integrates multiple CoAP resources
    (sensors, actuators) and the scheme to allow the identification of individual
    integrated resources while using the Unit ID as a new CoAP option. The Unit ID
    option in the CoAP enables the usage of composite nodes consisting of multiple
    sensors and actuators while having a single IP address for communication. The
    integrated resources can be individually or collectively communicated with and/or
    controlled using CoAP messages with additional options of UnitSize and UnitID.
    The UnitSize is basically a numeric value indicating the number of sub-resources
    in a composite CoAP node while the UnitID option has the string identifiers for
    the sub-resource(s) for which the message is intended. These options will enable
    the CoAP to communicate and control multiple resources by using single composite
    messages i.e. UnitID = "*", efficiently utilize IP addresses i.e. one IP multiple
    IDs, reduce communication traffic and hence conserve power among the CoAP resources.</p>
