abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for\n
    \  facilitating dynamic change of an operation plane, which includes\n   multiple
    virtual networks and/or data transmission paths, from a\n   current operation
    one to a backup one during a scheduled maintenance\n   or an emergency such as
    network disaster.  Specifically, the\n   necessity of interfaces between domain
    management systems to\n   establish consistent end-to-end data transmission paths
    over multiple\n   domain networks is addressed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
