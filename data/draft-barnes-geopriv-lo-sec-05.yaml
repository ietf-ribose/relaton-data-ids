abstract:
  content: "<p>Location-based services (such as navigation applications, emergencyservices,
    management of equipment in the field) need geographiclocation information about
    Internet hosts, their users, and otherrelated entities. These applications need
    to securely gather andtransfer location information for location services, and
    at the sametime protect the privacy of the individuals involved. This documentdescribes
    an architecture for privacy-preserving location-basedservices in the Internet,
    focusing on authorization, security, andprivacy requirements for the data formats
    and protocols used by theseservices.</p>"
