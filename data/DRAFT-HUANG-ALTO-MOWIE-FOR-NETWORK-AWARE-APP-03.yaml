abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the quick deployment of 5G networks in the world, cloud
    based\n   interactive services such as clouding gaming have gained substantial\n
    \  attention and are regarded as potential killer applications.  To\n   ensure
    users' quality of experience (QoE), a cloud interactive\n   service may require
    not only high bandwidth (e.g., high-resolution\n   media transmission) but also
    low delay (e.g., low latency and low\n   lagging).  However, the bandwidth and
    delay experienced by a mobile\n   and wireless user can be dynamic, as a function
    of many factors, and\n   unhandled changes can substantially compromise users'
    QoE.  In this\n   document, we investigate network-aware applications (NAA), which\n
    \  realize cloud based interactive services with improved QoE, by\n   efficient
    utilization of Mobile and Wireless Information Exposure\n   (MoWIE) . In particular,
    this document demonstrates, through\n   realistic evaluations, that mobile network
    information such as MCS\n   (Modulation and Coding Scheme) can effectively expose
    the dynamicity\n   of the underlying network and can be made available to applications\n
    \  through MoWIE; using such information, the applications can then\n   adapt
    key control knobs such as media codec scheme, encapsulation and\n   application
    logical function to minimize QoE deduction.  Based on the\n   evaluations, we
    discuss how MoWIE can be a systematic extension of\n   the ALTO protocol, to expose
    more lower-layer and finer grain network\n   dynamics.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
