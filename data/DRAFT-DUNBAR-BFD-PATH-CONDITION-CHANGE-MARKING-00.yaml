abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are times that an LSP source node needs to know change(s)
    has\noccurred along the originally established LSP path. This is\nespecially true
    in the Mobile Backhaul environment where microwave\ntransport is widely deployed.
    The bandwidth provided by the microwave\ntransport can change with weather. The
    source LSR, e.g. LTE's eNodeB,\nneeds to adjust its admission rate or shift more
    load to alternative\npaths when the backhaul transport path condition is changed.\n\nThis
    draft describes a simple mechanism for transit LSRs to notify\nSource LSR of the
    path condition changes.\n\n\n\nConventions used in this document\n\nThe key words
    \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD
    NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be
    interpreted as described in RFC-2119 0.\n\t </p>\n      "
