abstract:
- content: "<p>In an optical mesh network, two adjacent optical cross connects (OXCs)
    may have multiple, parallel, discrete bandwidth links connecting them [1]. When
    a link state routing protocol is used, these links may all be bundled together
    and advertised in a single link state advertisement (LSA). This draft describes
    the requirements, and proposes a method for bundling optical links. The proposed
    method aims to reduce the number of routing adjacencies between neighboring nodes,
    and works in conjunction with a link management protocol (e.g., LMP [2]). The
    discussion in this draft is related specifically to OSPF.</p>"
