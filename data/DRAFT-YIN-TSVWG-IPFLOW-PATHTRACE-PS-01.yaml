abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the requirements of IP flow path trace.\n
    \  Network administrators need to get the real IP flow path information,\n   of
    which a specific IP flow goes through heterogeneous network\n   environments.
    \ It is also desired for more information relevant to\n   the IP flow path.  Based
    on the information, network administrators\n   can locate possible faults of the
    network quickly or optimize network\n   resource for better network performance.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
