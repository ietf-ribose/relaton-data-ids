  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the technical mechanisms used by censorship\n
    \  regimes around the world to block or impair Internet traffic.  It\n   aims
    to make designers, implementers, and users of Internet protocols\n   aware of
    the properties being exploited and mechanisms used to censor\n   end-user access
    to information.  This document makes no suggestions\n   on individual protocol
    considerations, and is purely informational,\n   intended to be a reference.\n\n\t
