abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery can use naming
    systems\n   other than the Domain Name System when looking for services.\n   Different
    name systems use different conventions for the characters\n   allowed in any name.
    \ In order for DNS-SD to be used effectively in\n   environments where multiple
    different name systems are in use, it is\n   important to follow a common set
    of conventions for naming.  This\n   memo presents a convention for maximizing
    such interoperability.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
