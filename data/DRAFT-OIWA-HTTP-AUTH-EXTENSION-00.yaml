abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an extension of HTTP authentication framework\n
    \  for use with interactive clients.  Recently, the fundamental features\n   of
    HTTP-level authentication is not enough for complex requirements\n   of various
    Web-based applications.  This makes these applications to\n   implement their
    own authentication frameworks using HTML Forms and\n   other means, which becomes
    one of the hurdles against introducing\n   secure authentication mechanisms handled
    jointly by servers and user-\n   agent clients.  The extended framework fills
    gaps between Web\n   application requirements and HTTP authentication provisions
    to solve\n   the above problems, while maintaining some upper-compatibility\n
    \  against existing Web and non-Web uses of HTTP authentications.\n\n\t </p>\n
