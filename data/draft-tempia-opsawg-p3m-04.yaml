abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a passive method to perform packet loss, delay
    and jitter measurements on live traffic. Implementation and deployment details
    are also explained in order to clarify how the tools and features currently available
    on existing routing platforms can be used to implement the method. This method
    has been invented and engineered in Telecom Italia and it's currently being used
    in Telecom Italia's network.</p>"
