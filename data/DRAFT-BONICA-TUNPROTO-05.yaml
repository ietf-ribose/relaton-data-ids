abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the Generic Tunnel Tracing Protocol (GTTP).\nGTTP
    supports enhanced route-tracing applications. Network operators\nuse enhanced
    route-tracing applications to trace the path between any\ntwo points on an IP
    network. Enhanced route-tracing applications can\ntrace through a network's forwarding
    plane, its control plane or\nboth. Furthermore, enhanced route-tracing applications
    can reveal\ndetails concerning tunnels that support the traced path. Tunnel\ndetails
    can be revealed regardless of tunneling technology. For\nexample, enhanced route-tracing
    applications can trace through an\nMPLS LSP as well as they can trace through
    an IP-in-IP tunnel.\n\t </p>\n      "
