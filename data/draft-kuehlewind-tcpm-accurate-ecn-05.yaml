abstract:
  content: "<p>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where network
    nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate incipient congestion
    to the end-points. Receivers with an ECN- capable transport protocol feed back
    this information to the sender. ECN is specified for TCP in such a way that only
    one feedback signal can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT). Recently, new
    TCP mechanisms like Congestion Exposure (ConEx) or Data Center TCP (DCTCP) need
    more accurate ECN feedback information whenever more than one marking is received
    in one RTT. This document specifies an experimental scheme to provide more than
    one feedback signal per RTT in the TCP header. Given TCP header space is scarce,
    it overloads the three existing ECN-related flags in the TCP header and provides
    additional information in a new TCP option.</p>"
