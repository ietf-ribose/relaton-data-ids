abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents two profiles for configuring IPsec within
    a\n   data center using an SDN controller and the YANG model described in\n   the
    sdn-ipsec draft.\n\n   Two profiles are described to allow both the IKE and IKE-less
    cases\n   because some data centers may be required to use a standardized\n   method
    of key exchange rather than SDN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
