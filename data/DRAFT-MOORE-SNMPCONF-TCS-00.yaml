abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines two textual conventions similar to the\nRowPointer
    textual convention defined in RFC2579.  These two textual\nconventions indicate
    how the conceptual row to which an object points\nis to be handled when the object
    is cloned to create an instance-\nspecific configuration.  This cloning may involve
    the scripting-based\ntechniques defined under the SMNP Configuration umbrella,
    but it need\nnot: cloning can also be realized with ordinary SNMP Get and Set\noperations.\n\n\t
