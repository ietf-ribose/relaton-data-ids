abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One-way delay is a key indicator to measure network quality.
    \ Some\n   applications are one-way transmission in the network, such as some\n
    \  high-definition video services, and are very sensitive to one-way\n   delay.
    \ Excessive delay will affect user experience greatly.  To some\n   extent, the
    network can't even be used, so it is very important to\n   accurately measure
    the network transmission delay.  The current one-\n   way delay measurement method
    has problems such as high complexity and\n   low measurement accuracy.  In order
    to solve the problem of high-\n   precision one-way delay measurement, a one-way
    delay measurement\n   method based on deterministic networking is proposed in
    this\n   document.  The method takes advantage of the delay characteristics of\n
    \  the deterministic networking and does not depend on precise time\n   synchronization.\n\n\t
