abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The structure of the MPLS IANA registries is not entirely intuitive.\n
    \  This document proposes a clarification.  The intention is to make a\n   structure
    that is implicit in the MPLS IANA registries clearly\n   visible.\n\n   This document
    does not change any RFC, nor are the content of any\n   registry touched.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
