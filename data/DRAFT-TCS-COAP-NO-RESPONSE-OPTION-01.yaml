abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The server end-point does not respond with acknowledgment (ACK)
    in\n   non-confirmable (NON) mode of CoAP. However, the server responds the\n
    \  client with a status code indicating \"the result of the attempt to\n   understand
    and satisfy the request\". But there may be typical\n   scenarios, while updating
    resources in NON mode, where any kind of\n   response from the server may be considered
    redundant. Thus, in this\n   case, the transaction becomes completely open-loop
    with no reverse\n   path from the server to the client. This kind of exchange
    may be\n   useful in constrained systems looking for maximized throughput with\n
    \  minimized resource consumption. This draft introduces a header\n   option:
    'No-Resp' to suppress responses from the server and\n   discusses an exemplary
    but practical use case which actually\n   motivated this proposition based on
    real experience. This option not\n   only allows suppressing any kind of responses
    but allows suppressing\n   a typical class or a combination of classes of responses.
    This\n   option is applicable for both request/ response as well as resource-\n
    \  observe mode and may be effective for both unicast and multicast\n   scenarios.\n\n\t
