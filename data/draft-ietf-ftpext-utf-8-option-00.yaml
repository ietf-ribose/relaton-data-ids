abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the File Transfer Protocol(FTP)
    which provides for inter-operation between existingimplementations and those supporting
    the exchange of UTF-8 encodedpathnames, and clarifies certain issues involved
    with UTF-8 encoding.It introduces a new option, UTF-8, negotiated by use of the
    OPTScommand. Through use of this option, the user informs the server ofits willingness
    to accept UTF-8 encoded pathnames. The proposedextension requires that neither
    party transmit UTF-8 encodedpathnames without having first successfully negotiated
    this option.</p>"
