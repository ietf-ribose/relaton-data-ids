abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies\n
    \  covering different Internet of Things (IoT) applications.  The common\n   characteristics
    for LPWANs are large coverage, low bandwidth, small\n   data sizes and long battery
    life operation.  One of these\n   technologies include Narrowband Internet of
    Things (NB-IoT) developed\n   and standardized by 3GPP.  This document is an informational
    overview\n   to NB-IoT and gives the principal characteristics and restrictions
    of\n   this technology in order to help with the IETF work for providing\n   IPv6
    connectivity to NB-IoT along with other LPWANs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
