abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Route discovery for symmetric and asymmetric Peer-to-Peer (P2P)\n
    \  traffic flows is a desirable feature in Low power and Lossy Networks\n   (LLNs).
    \ For that purpose, this document specifies a reactive P2P\n   route discovery
    mechanism for both hop-by-hop routing and source\n   routing: Ad Hoc On-demand
    Distance Vector Routing (AODV) based RPL\n   protocol (AODV-RPL).  Paired Instances
    are used to construct\n   directional paths, for cases where there are asymmetric
    links between\n   source and target nodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
