abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the mesh link establishment (MLE) protocol
    for\n   establishing and configuring links in an ad hoc mesh radio network.\n
    \  Effective mesh networking using radio links requires identifying,\n   configuring,
    and securing usable links to neighboring devices.  In an\n   ad hoc mesh network
    a device's neighbors may come and go as the\n   network's membership and physical
    environment change.  Newly usable\n   links need to be identified and configured
    automatically, where\n   configuration values can include link-layer addresses,
    transmit and\n   receive modes, security parameters, and so forth.  MLE includes
    the\n   option of securing the configuration messages themselves, as link-\n   layer
    security may not be available prior to configuration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
