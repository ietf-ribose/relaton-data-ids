abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Flexible Sender Validation (FSV) is a lightweight validation\n
    \  technique to detect and deter some kinds of e-mail address\n   forgery.  It
    publishes information in the DNS about IP\n   addresses authorized to send mail
    for a domain, one in a\n   family of IP based mail validation proposals dating
    back to\n   Paul Vixie's original in 2002[5].  FSV uses redundant copies\n   of
    IP data to permit both efficient use by very high-volume\n   mail servers, and
    simple implementation on low to moderate\n   volume mail servers.\n\t </p>\n      "
