abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Realtime Internet Peering Protocol\n
    \  (RIPP).  RIPP is used to provide telephony peering between a trunking\n   provider
    (such as a telco), and a trunking consumer (such as an\n   enterprise, cloud PBX
    provider, cloud contact center provider, and so\n   on).  RIPP is an alternative
    to SIP, SDP and RTP for this use case,\n   and is designed as a web application
    using HTTP/3.  Using HTTP/3\n   allows trunking consumers to more easily build
    their applications on\n   top of cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure and Google
    Cloud, all of\n   which are heavily focused on HTTP based services.  RIPP also\n
    \  addresses many of the challenges of traditional SIP-based trunking.\n   Most
    notably, it mandates secure caller ID via STIR, and provides\n   automated trunk
    provisioning as a mandatory protocol component.  RIPP\n   supports both direct
    and \"BYO\" trunk configurations.  Since it runs\n   over HTTP/3, it works through
    NATs and firewalls with the same ease\n   as HTTP does, and easily supports load
    balancing with elastic cluster\n   expansion and contraction, including auto-scaling
    - all because it is\n   nothing more than an HTTP application.  RIPP also provides
    built in\n   mechanisms for migrations of calls between RIPP client and server\n
    \  instances, enabling failover with call preservation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
