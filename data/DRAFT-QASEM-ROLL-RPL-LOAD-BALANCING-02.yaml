abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an extended Objective Function(OF)that\n
    \  balances the number of child nodes of the parent nodes to avoid the\n   overloading
    problem and ensure node lifetime maximization in the IPv6\n   Routing Protocol
    for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The standard\n   OFs are used to build
    a Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph\n   (DODAG) where the bottleneck
    nodes may suffer from unbalanced traffic\n   load. As a result, a part of the
    network may be disconnected as the\n   energy of the overloaded preferred parent
    node will drain much faster\n   than other candidate parents. Thus, a new RPL
    metric has been\n   introduced to balance the traffic load over the network. Finally,
    the\n   potential extra overhead has been mitigated using a new utilization\n
    \  technique.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
