abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A framing protocol is defined for TCP that is fully compliant
    with\napplicable TCP RFCs and fully interoperable with existing TCP\nimplementations.
    The framing mechanism is designed to work as an\n'adaptation layer' between TCP
    and the Direct Data Placement [DDP]\nprotocol, preserving the reliable, in-order
    delivery of TCP, while\nadding the preservation of higher-level protocol record
    boundaries\nthat DDP requires.\n\t </p>\n      "
