abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a marking scheme for tagging low-latency
    flows\n   (for example: interactive voice and video, gaming, machine to machine\n
    \  applications) that is safe to use by the mobile network for matching\n   such
    flows to suitable per-hop behaviors (EPS bearers defined by\n   3GPP) in its core
    and radio segments.  The suggested scheme re-uses\n   NQB, a DiffServ-based signalling
    scheme with compatible rate-delay\n   trade-off semantics that has been recently
    introduced in the context\n   of fixed access to allow differential treatment
    of non-queue building\n   vs queue building flows.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
