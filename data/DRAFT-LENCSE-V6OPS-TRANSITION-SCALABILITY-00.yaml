abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Several IPv6 transition technologies have been developed to
    provide\n   customers with IPv4-as-a-Service (IPv4aaS) for ISPs with an IPv6-only\n
    \  access and/or core network.  All these technologies have their\n   advantages
    and disadvantages, and depending on existing topology,\n   skills, strategy and
    other preferences, one of these technologies may\n   be the most appropriate solution
    for a network operator.\n\n   This document examines the scalability of the five
    most prominent\n   IPv4aaS technologies (464XLAT, Dual Stack Lite, Lightweight
    4over6,\n   MAP-E, MAP-T) considering two aspects: (1) how their performance\n
    \  scales up with the number of CPU cores, (2) how their performance\n   degrades,
    when the number of concurrent sessions is increased until\n   hardware limit is
    reached.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
