abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that\n
    \  provides optimal multicast forwarding through a \"BIER domain\" without\n   requiring
    intermediate routers to maintain any multicast related per-\n   flow state.  BIER
    also does not require any explicit tree-building\n   protocol for its operation.
    \ A multicast data packet enters a BIER\n   domain at a \"Bit-Forwarding Ingress
    Router\" (BFIR), and leaves the\n   BIER domain at one or more \"Bit-Forwarding
    Egress Routers\" (BFERs).\n   The BFIR router adds a BIER header to the packet.
    \ The BIER header\n   contains a bit-string in which each bit represents exactly
    one BFER\n   to forward the packet to.  The set of BFERs to which the multicast\n
    \  packet needs to be forwarded is expressed by setting the bits that\n   correspond
    to those routers in the BIER header.\n\n   This document describes some of the
    use cases for BIER.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
