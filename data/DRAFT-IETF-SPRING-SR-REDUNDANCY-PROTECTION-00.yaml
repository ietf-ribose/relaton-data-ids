abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Redundancy Protection is a generalized protection mechanism
    to\n   achieve the high reliability of service transmission in Segment\n   Routing
    network.  The mechanism inherits the \"Live-Live\" methodology,\n   targeting
    to enhance the functionalities of Segment Routing over\n   IPv6.  Inspired by
    DetNet Packet Replication and Packet Elimination\n   functions, two new Segments
    are introduced to provide replication and\n   elimination functions on specific
    network nodes by leveraging SRv6\n   Segment programming capabilities.\n\n\n\t
