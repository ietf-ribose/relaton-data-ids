abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A number of applications and services running over IP/MPLS
    networks\n   have strict requirements relating to their routing, or the\n   performance
    of the path supporting their traffic flow, for instance,\n   in terms of characteristics
    such as latency, loss, or bandwidth\n   availability.  Segment routing provides
    a means by which the data-\n   plane of an IP/MPLS network can be programmed to
    support such\n   \"performance engineered\" paths.  This document describes an\n
    \  architecture for the use of such performance engineered label\n   switched
    paths, and the control-plane functionality required to allow\n   both distributed
    and centralised computation of acceptable forwarding\n   paths.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
