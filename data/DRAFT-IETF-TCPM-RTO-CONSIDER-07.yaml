abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    Ensuring reliable communication often manifests in a timeout
    and\n    retry mechanism.  Each implementation of a retransmission timeout\n    mechanism
    represents a balance between correctness and timeliness\n    and therefore no
    implementation suits all situations.  This document\n    provides high-level requirements
    for retransmission timeout schemes\n    appropriate for general use in the Internet.
    \ Within the\n    requirements, implementations have latitude to define particulars\n
    \   that best address each situation.\n\nTerminology\n\t </p>\n      "
