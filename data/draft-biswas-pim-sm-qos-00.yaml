abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a framework for QoS-aware multicast routingbased
    on enhancements to PIM-SM. This framework has two components:the development of
    multicast tree computation schemes that accountfor heterogeneous receiver QoS
    requirements, and the incorporationof QoS capabilities into PIM-SM for establishing
    computed paths.The choice of PIM-SM is based on its ability to supportreceiver-initiated
    join, both shared and source-specific trees. Twodecentralized tree computation
    schemes, TIQM and NUQM, areconsidered in this document, both requiring support
    from theunderlying unicast routing scheme to acquire link and nodal resourceavailability
    information. Additionally, TIQM requires completeinformation at each router about
    the resource allocation in thenetwork for the existing multicast tree. After a
    brief analysis ofthese two schemes, the incorporation of QoS awareness in PIM-SM
    withNUQM as its underlying route computation mechanism is presented. Itis shown
    that with few extensions to its existing control syntaxes,PIM-SM can be successfully
    used for QoS integration. Finally, a TreeState Update (TSU) mechanism, which can
    be used for efficient andscalable dissemination of multicast tree state information,
    isproposed. It is shown that by using the proposed TSU protocol it ispossible
    to partially alleviate the control overhead of TIQM.</p>"
