abstract:
  content: "\t <t>STUN provides an easy way to traverse some types of NATs and it
    willwork satisfactorily in many NAT deployments. To overcome STUN'slimitations,
    one solution is to accept the idea that NATs can changetoo (and they've been proven
    to change, an example being theproliferation of IPsec pass-thru NAT devices) and
    to colocate STUNserver functionality on the NAT box itself. Upon receipt of a
    STUNrequest, the server colocated within the NAT device allocatesaddresses and
    ports, and installs bindings. This allows hostsrunning the STUN client software
    to transparently achieve symmetricNAT traversal and to make themselves addressable
    from the GlobalInternet.</p>"
