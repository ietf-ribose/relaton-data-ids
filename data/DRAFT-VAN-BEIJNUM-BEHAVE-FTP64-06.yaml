abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The File Transfer Protocol has a very long history, and despite
    the\nfact that today, other options exist to perform file transfers, FTP\nis still
    in common use.  As such, it is important that in the\nsituation where some client
    computers are IPv6-only while many\nservers are still IPv4-only and IPv6-to-IPv4
    translators are used to\nbridge that gap, FTP is made to work through these translators
    as\nbest it can.\n\nFTP has an active and a passive mode, both as original commands
    that\nare IPv4-specific, and as extended, IP version agnostic commands.\nThe only
    FTP mode that works without changes through an IPv6-to-IPv4\ntranslator is extended
    passive.  However, many existing FTP servers\ndon't support this mode, and some
    clients don't ask for it.  This\ndocument describes server, client and middlebox
    (if any) behavior\nthat minimizes this problem.\n\t </p>\n      "
