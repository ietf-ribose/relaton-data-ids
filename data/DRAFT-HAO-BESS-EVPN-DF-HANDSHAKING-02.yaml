abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In [EVPN], in the DF re-election transient period, due to Ethernet\n
    \  Segment route transmission timer and timer clock discrepancy on each\n   PEs,
    dual DF PEs will co-exist, traffic loop and disruption will be\n   incurred. In
    MHN case, the consequences are particularly serious.\n   Handshaking mechanism
    for DF election is introduced in this draft to\n   resolve the problem.\n\n\t
