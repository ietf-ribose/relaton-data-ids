abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless LANs or hot spots are starting to be widely deployed in Enterprise
    Intranets and public areas such as airports, coffee shops, shopping malls etc.
    based on IPv4. This combined with the availability of multi-mode networked devices
    and applications that can take advantage of continuous mobility and constant reachability,
    is driving the need for Mobile IP in these networks.</p>"
