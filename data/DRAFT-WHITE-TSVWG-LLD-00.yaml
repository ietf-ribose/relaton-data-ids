  content: "\n\t <p>   NOTE: This document is a reformatted version of [LLD-white-paper].\n\n
    \  The evolution of the bandwidth capabilities - from kilobits per\n   second
    to gigabits - across generations of DOCSIS cable broadband\n   technology has
    paved the way for the applications that today form our\n   digital lives.  Along
    with increased bandwidth, or \"speed\", the\n   latency performance of DOCSIS
    technology has also improved in recent\n   years.  Although it often gets less
    attention, latency performance\n   contributes as much or more to the broadband
    experience and the\n   feasibility of future applications as does speed.\n\n   Low
    Latency DOCSIS technology (LLD) is a specification developed by\n   CableLabs
    in collaboration with DOCSIS vendors and cable operators\n   that tackles the
    two main causes of latency in the network: queuing\n   delay and media acquisition
    delay.  LLD introduces an approach\n   wherein data traffic from applications
    that aren't causing latency\n   can take a different logical path through the
    DOCSIS network without\n   getting hung up behind data from applications that
    are causing\n   latency, as is the case in today's Internet architectures.  This\n
    \  mechanism doesn't interfere with the way applications share the total\n   bandwidth
    of the connection, and it doesn't reduce one application's\n   latency at the
    expense of others.  In addition, LLD improves the\n   DOCSIS upstream media acquisition
    delay with a faster request-grant\n   loop and a new proactive scheduling mechanism.
    \ LLD makes the\n   internet experience better for latency sensitive applications
    without\n   any negative impact on other applications.\n\n   The latest generation
    of DOCSIS equipment that has been deployed in\n   the field - DOCSIS 3.1 - experiences
    typical latency performance of\n   around 10 milliseconds (ms) on the Access Network
    link.  However,\n   under heavy load, the link can experience delay spikes of
    100 ms or\n   more.  LLD systems can deliver a consistent 1 ms delay on the DOCSIS\n
    \  network for traffic that isn't causing latency, imperceptible for\n   nearly
    all applications.  The experience will be more consistent with\n   much smaller
    delay variation.\n\n   LLD can be deployed by field-upgrading DOCSIS 3.1 cable
    modem and\n   cable modem termination system devices with new software.  The\n
    \  technology includes tools that enable automatic provisioning of these\n   new
    services, and it also introduces new tools to report statistics\n   of latency
    performance to the operator.\n\n   Cable operators, DOCSIS equipment manufacturers,
    and application\n   providers will all have to act in order to take advantage
    of LLD.\n   This white paper explains the technology and describes the role that\n
    \  each of these parties plays in making LLD a reality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
