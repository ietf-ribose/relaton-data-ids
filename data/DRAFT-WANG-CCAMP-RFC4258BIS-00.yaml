abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite
    of\n   protocols has been defined to control different switching\n   technologies
    as well as different applications.  These include\n   support for requesting Time
    Division Multiplexing (TDM) connections\n   including Synchronous Optical Network
    (SONET)/Synchronous Digital\n   Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical Transport Networks
    (OTNs).\n\n   Along with the development of technology, some new routing\n   requirements
    which are addressed in G.7715.1 emerge.  This document\n   concentrates on the
    new routing requirements addressed in G.7715.1\n   and placed on the GMPLS suite
    of protocols in order to support the\n   capabilities and functionalities of an
    Automatically Switched Optical\n   Network (ASON) as defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\t
