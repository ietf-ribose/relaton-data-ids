abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a profile for AS Adjacency Attestation Objects
    (AAOs). An AAO is a digitally signed object that provides a means of verifying
    that an AS holder has made an attestation that it has a inter-domain routing adjacency
    with one or more other AS's, with the associated inference that this AS is prepared
    to announce or receive routes with these adjacent AS's in the inter-domain domain
    environment.</p>"
