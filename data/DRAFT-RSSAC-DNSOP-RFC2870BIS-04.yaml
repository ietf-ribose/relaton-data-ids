abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the Internet has become critical to the world's social and
    economic\n   infrastructure, attention has focused on the correct, safe, reliable,
    and\n   secure operation of the Internet infrastructure itself.  The DNS is considered\n
    \  a crucial part of that technical infrastructure. The root domain and its\n
    \  authoritative name servers are a part of that technical infrastructure.\n\n
    \  The primary focus of this document is to provide guidelines for secure, stable,\n
    \  and resilient authoritative name service for the root zone. Additionally it
    will\n   look into some specifics for the operation of the name servers.  Other
    operators\n   of authoritative name servers such as those for generic top-level
    domains (gTLDs),\n   country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) and other zones may
    also find this\n   document useful.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
