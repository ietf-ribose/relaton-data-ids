abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines the use of the MPLS TC field of MPLS Label
    Stack\n   Entries (LSE) to support cycle tagging of packets for Multiple Buffer\n
    \  Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (TCQF).  TCQF is a mechanism to support\n   bounded
    latency forwarding in DetNet network.\n\n   Target benefits of TCQF include low
    end-to-end jitter, ease of high-\n   speed hardware implementation, optional ability
    to support large\n   number of flow in large networks via DiffServ style aggregation
    by\n   applying TCQF to the DetNet aggregate instead of each DetNet flow\n   individually,
    and support of wide-area DetNet networks with arbitrary\n   link latencies and
    latency variations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
