abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In PIM-SM networks PIM Null-Register messages are sent by the\n
    \  Designated Router (DR) to the Rendezvous Point (RP) to signal the\n   presence
    of Multicast sources in the network.  There are periodic PIM\n   Null-Registers
    sent from the DR to the RP to keep the state alive at\n   the RP as long as the
    source is active.  The PIM Null-Register\n   message carries information about
    a single Multicast source and\n   group.\n\n   This document defines a standard
    to send multiple Multicast source\n   and group information in a single PIM Packed
    Null-Register message.\n   We will refer to the new packed formats as the PIM
    Packed Null-\n   Register format and PIM Packed Register-Stop format throughout
    the\n   document.  This document also discusses interoperability between the\n
    \  PIM routers which do not understand the PIM Packed Null-Register\n   format
    and routers which do understand it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
