abstract:
- content: "<p>In HTTP/2.0, if running over TLS, the client is the first to transmit
    HTTP/2.0 frames on the new session. With its first transmission to the server,
    the client can already overrun some of the server settings and preferences, leading
    to failure conditions and unnecessary complexity. This document proposes a solution
    to this problem based on a very small set of server profiles for initial settings
    sent within the TLS handshake.</p>"
