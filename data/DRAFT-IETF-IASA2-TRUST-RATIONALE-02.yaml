abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is published to capture the rationale for the
    changes\n   introduced in RFC NNNN (RFC Editor: please replace NNNN with the RFC\n
    \  number of [I-D.ietf-iasa2-trust-update]), Update to the Process for\n   Selection
    of Trustees for the IETF Trust.\n\n   At the time RFC NNNN was published, IETF
    administrative structure\n   changes (\"IASA 2.0\") had an impact on the IETF
    Trust because members\n   of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
    IAOC, which was\n   being phased out, had served as Trustees of the IETF Trust.
    \ This\n   document provides background on the past IETF Trust arrangements,\n
    \  explains the effect of the rules in the founding documents during the\n   transition
    to the new arrangement, and provides a rationale for the\n   update.\n\n\t </p>\n
