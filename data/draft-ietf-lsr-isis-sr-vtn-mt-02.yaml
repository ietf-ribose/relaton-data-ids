abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to support
    some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.
    VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics
    provided by the underlay network. A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual
    underlay network which consists of a subset of network resources allocated on
    network nodes and links in a customized topology of the physical network. A VTN
    could be used as the underlay to support one or a group of VPN+ services. In some
    network scenarios, each VTN can be associated with a unique logical network topology.
    This document describes a mechanism to build the SR based VTNs using IS-IS Multi-Topology
    together with other well-defined IS-IS extensions.</p>"
