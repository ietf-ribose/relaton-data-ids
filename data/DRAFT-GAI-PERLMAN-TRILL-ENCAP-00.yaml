abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A new layer of encapsulation is required with RBridges.  A
    previous \n   Internet Draft [2] (draft-bryant-perlman-trill-pwe-encap-00) proposes
    \n   an encapsulation header that contains a Nickname, a flag, TTL and \n   CoS.
    This document introduces additional fields, and gives arguments \n   for their
    usefulness. As a result the encapsulation header needs to \n   be expanded and
    will no longer be able to be in MPLS format. The WG \n   will need to decide on
    the tradeoffs between this additional \n   functionality, and compatibility with
    an existing (MPLS) format. \n\t </p>\n      "
