abstract:
  content: <p>This document describes an extension to the naming mechanism ofdisruption
    tolerant networks (RFC4838) to support intentional naming.Intentional naming is
    a means by which a source node specifies thedestination node(s) for a bundle in
    terms of predicates on attributesof the node(s), instead of by a canonical endpoint
    identifier (EID)of the node. Intentional naming is closely tied to the concept
    ofbinding, as described in RFC 4838. Since information required toroute an intentionally
    named bundle may not be available at thesource node, this information must be
    supplied at one or moresubsequent nodes along the bundle's path toward its destination(s).The
    architecture required for an intentional naming capability in aDTN must support
    the notion that a bundle can make progress towardits destination(s) in the absence
    of complete binding information.In this document we describe a framework for intentional
    naming in aDTN, propose a syntax for intentional names, and describe adistributed
    procedure for late or partial binding. We also presentsample use cases for late
    binding and a notional name bindingalgorithm, called GRAIN, that can deliver bundles
    to intentionalnames with geographic and role attributes, e.g. "first responderswithin
    a kilometer of a specified location." Finally, we discuss thelimitations in our
    current ability to field an ideal intentionalnaming system (i.e., one that can
    support generic intentional names),and we suggest a somewhat restrictive framework
    that is both usefuland feasible to deploy.</p>
