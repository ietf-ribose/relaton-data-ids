abstract:
  content: "\t <t>BikINI is designed to allow multiple client computers to access
    amail message store on a central server. It operates over anyreliable datastream
    protocol, but is commonly used over TCP. BikINIis designed to require minimal
    message parsing by the server, to be8-bit clean for mail message content, and
    to be a lighter-weight andeasier-to-implement than other remote message access
    protocols.</p>"
