abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework for using existing, modified and
    potential new networking technologies as components to provide an Enhanced Virtual
    Private Network (VPN+) service. The purpose is to support the needs of new applications,
    particularly applications that are associated with 5G services, by utilizing an
    approach that is based on existing VPN and TE technologies and adds features that
    specific services require over and above traditional VPNs. Typically, VPN+ will
    be used to form the underpinning of network slicing, but could also be of use
    in its own right. It is not envisaged that large numbers of VPN+ instances will
    be deployed in a network and, in particular, it is not intended that all VPNs
    supported by a network will use VPN+ techniques.</p>"
