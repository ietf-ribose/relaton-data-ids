abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This note discusses how to extend the DNS with new data, for
    a new\n    application.  A discussion which too often circulate around reuse of\n
    \   the TXT record.  It lists different mechanisms to accomplish the\n    extension
    to DNS, and comes to the conclusion use of a new RR Type is\n    the best solution.\n\t
