abstract:
  content: "<p>The base Mobile IP allows a host to transparently send datagrams tomobile
    nodes as it would to any other nodes. Datagrams addressed tothe mobile are always
    routed via the Home Agent in the home network.However, as the mobile node moves
    away from its home network, it mayno longer be topologically close to its home
    agent. Routeoptimization [MIP-OPTIM] has been proposed to allow a host to sendpackets
    to the mobile as a mobile node (MN) moves, without having toroute the packets
    via the home agent each time. The mobile providesits current address to a host
    (or correspondent node, CN) that it iscommunicating with as it moves. The host
    updates the cache of themobile location with this new address and tunnels datagrams(addressed
    to the mobile) to the current address of the mobile.However not all correspondent
    nodes are capable of tunneling IPdatagrams as required by the route optimization
    mechanisms describedin [MIP-OPTIM]. More importantly, disclosing the current location
    (orCOA) of the mobile node to correspondent nodes is not alwaysdesirable, nor
    is the overhead of encapsulating datagram to the MNideal.</p>"
