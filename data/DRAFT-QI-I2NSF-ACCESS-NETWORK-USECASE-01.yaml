abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In traditional telecommunication system, operators usually
    provide\n   general and limited security protection service for users during\n
    \  access (e.g. AKA in 3G/4G network). Now, with the development of\n   network
    virtualization technology and data center, the physical\n   network device is
    became a network function software which is running\n   on virtual machine of
    server and the network functions can be\n   flexible and elastic. So operators
    can provide more flexible security\n   function to users.  In order to provide
    more flexible security\n   service, interfaces between operator's network and
    user should be\n   needed.  These interfaces will be used to request/achieve operate\n
    \  (Virtual) Network Security Functions from operator's network. This\n   draft
    describes use cases for using the interface in operator's\n   network environment.\n\n\t
