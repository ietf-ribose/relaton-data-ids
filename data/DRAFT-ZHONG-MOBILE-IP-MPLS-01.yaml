abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) combines the efficiency and
    \nsimplicity of IP routing together with the high-speed switching of\nATM. Mobile
    IP is a protocol that allows mobile users to maintain\ncontinuous IP network connectivity.
    In this document, we describe\na scheme to integrate both the Mobile IP and MPLS
    protocols. The\nintegration of both these protocols improves the scalability of
    the\nMobile IP data forwarding process by leveraging on the features of\nMPLS
    which are fast switching, small state maintenance and high\nscalability. In addition,
    we have removed the need for IP-in-IP \ntunneling from Home Agent (HA) to Foreign
    Agent (FA) under this\nscheme. This document defines the signaling and control
    mechanisms\nrequired to integrate MPLS and Mobile IP.\n\t </p>\n      "
