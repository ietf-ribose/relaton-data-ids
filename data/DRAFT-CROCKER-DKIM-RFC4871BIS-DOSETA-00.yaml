abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a person, role, or\norganization
    that owns the signing domain to claim some\nresponsibility for a message by associating
    the domain with the\nmessage.  This can be an author's organization, an operational
    relay\nor one of their agents.  DKIM separates the question of the identity\nof
    the signer of the message from the purported author of the\nmessage.  Assertion
    of responsibility is validated through a\ncryptographic signature and querying
    the signer's domain directly to\nretrieve the appropriate public key.  Message
    transit from author to\nrecipient is through relays that typically make no substantive
    change\nto a message or its content and thus preserve the DKIM signature.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
