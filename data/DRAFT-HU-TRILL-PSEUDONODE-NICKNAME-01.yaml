abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Appointed Forwarder on a link for VLAN-x is the RBridge
    that\n   ingresses native frames from the link and egresses native frames to\n
    \  the link in VLAN-x.  If the appointed forwarder for an end station is\n   changed,
    the remote data traffic to the end station could fail.  This\n   document is proposed
    to assign a nickname for pseudonode identifying\n   a multi-access link to solve
    the issue.  When any appointed forwarder\n   encapsulates a packet, it uses the
    pseudonode nickname as \"ingress\n   nickname\" rather than its own nickname.
    \ If it does, then if the\n   appointed forwarder changes, or the DRB changes,
    and the pseudonode\n   still uses the same nickname, then the remote RBridge caches
    won't\n   need to change, and the data traffic to the end station would reach\n
    \  the link uninterruptedly.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
