abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) over HTTPS transport
    binding and the corresponding 'ipps' URI scheme, that is used to designate the
    access to the network location of a secure IPP print service or a network resource
    (for example, a print job) managed by such a service. This memo is published by
    the IETF on behalf of the Internet Printing Protocol Working Group of the IEEE-ISTO
    Printer Working Group. This memo updates RFC 2910 and RFC 2911.</p>"
