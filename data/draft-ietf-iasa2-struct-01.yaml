abstract:
- content: <p>The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally established
    in 2005. In the 13 years from 2005 to 2018, the needs of the IETF have evolved
    in ways that require changes to its administrative structure. The purpose of this
    document is to outline a proposed new "IASA 2.0" structure. The proposal is for
    the work of the IETF's administrative and fundraising tasks to be conducted by
    a new administrative organization, the IETF Administration Limited Liability Corporation
    ("LLC"). Under the proposal, the Internet Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
    will be eliminated, and its oversight and advising functions transferred to the
    new LLC Board.</p>
