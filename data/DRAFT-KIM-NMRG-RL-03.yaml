abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes intelligent network management system
    to\n   autonomously manage and monitor using machine learning techniques.\n   Reinforcement
    learning is one of the machine learning techniques that\n   can provide autonomously
    management with multi-agent path-planning\n   over a communication network.  According
    to intelligent distributed\n   multi-agent system, the main centralized node called
    by the global\n   environment should not only manage all agents workflow in a
    hybrid\n   peer-to-peer networking architecture and, but transfer and share\n
    \  information in distributed nodes.  All agents in distributed nodes\n   are
    able to be provided with a cumulative reward for each action that\n   a given
    agent takes with respect to an optimized knowledge based on a\n   to-be-learned
    policy over the learning process.  The optimized and\n   trained knowledge would
    be involved with a large state information by\n   the control action over a network.
    \ A reward from the global\n   environment is reflected to the next optimized
    control action\n   autonomously for network management in distributed networking
    nodes.\n   The Reinforcement Learning(RL) Process have developed and expanded
    to\n   Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL) with model-driven or data-driven\n   technical
    approaches for learning process.  The trendy technique has\n   been widely to
    attempt and apply to networking fields since Deep\n   Reinforcement Learning can
    be used in practical networking areas\n   beyond dynamics and heterogeneous environment
    disturbances, so that\n   in the technique can be intelligently learned in the
    effective\n   strategy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
