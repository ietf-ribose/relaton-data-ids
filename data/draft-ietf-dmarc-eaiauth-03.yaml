abstract:
- content: "<p>SPF (RFC7208), DKIM (RFC6376), and DMARC (RFC7489) enable a domain
    owner to publish e-mail authentication and policy information in the DNS. In internationalized
    e-mail, domain names can occur both as U-labels and A-labels. The Authentication-Results
    header reports the result of authentication checks made with SPF, DKIM, DMARC,
    and other schemes. This specification updates the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC specifications
    to clarify which form of internationalized domain names to use in those specifications,
    and when creating Authentication-Results headers.</p>"
