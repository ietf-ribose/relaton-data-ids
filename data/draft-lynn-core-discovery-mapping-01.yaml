abstract:
- content: "<p>Resource and service discovery are complimentary. Resource discovery
    provides fine-grained detail about the content of a server, while service discovery
    can provide a scalable method to locate servers in large networks. This document
    defines a method for mapping between CoRE Link Format attributes and DNS-Based
    Service Discovery fields so the two methods may be used interchangeably to locate
    services.</p>"
