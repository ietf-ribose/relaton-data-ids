abstract:
  content: "<p>On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) is a multicast routingprotocol
    designed for ad-hoc networks with mobile hosts. ODMRP isa mesh-based, rather than
    a conventional tree-based, multicastscheme and uses a Forwarding Group concept
    (only a subset of nodesforwards the multicast packets via scoped flooding). It
    applieson-demand procedures to dynamically set up routes and maintainmulticast
    group membership. ODMRP is well suited for ad-hocwireless networks with mobile
    hosts where bandwidth is limited,topology changes frequently and rapidly, and
    power is constrained.</p>"
