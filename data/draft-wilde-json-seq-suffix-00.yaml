abstract:
- content: <p>Structured Syntax Suffixes for media types allow other media types to
    build on them and make it explicit that they are built on an existing media type
    as their foundation. This specification defines and registers "json-seq" as a
    structured syntax suffix for JSON Text Sequences. Note to Readers This draft should
    be discussed on the art mailing list [1]. Online access to all versions and files
    is available on github [2].</p>
