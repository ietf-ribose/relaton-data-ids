abstract:
  content: "<p>In the past Mandatory Access Control(MAC) systems have used veryrigid
    policies which were hardcoded into the particular protocol andplatform. As MAC
    systems are more widely deployed additionalflexibility in mechanism and policy
    is required. Where traditionaltrusted systems implemented Multi-Level Security
    and integritymodels, modern systems have expanded to include technologies such
    astype enforcement. Due to the wide range of policies and mechanismsit has proven
    through past efforts to be virtually impossible toaccomodate all parties in one
    security label format and model.To accomodate multiple MAC mechanisms and label
    formats this documentproposes a registry of label format specifications. This
    registrycontains several identifiers to accomodate both integer and stringpreferences
    and associates those identifiers with an extensivedocument outlining the exact
    syntax and use of the particular labelformat.</p>"
