abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies mechanisms of NSA (Native Short Address)
    that\n   enables IP packet transmission over links where the transmission of a\n
    \  full length address may not be desirable.  This document focuses on\n   carrying
    IP packets across a LLN (Low power and Lossy Network), in\n   which the nodes'
    location is fixed and changes in the logical\n   topology are caused only by unstable
    radio connectivity (not physical\n   mobility).  The specifications include NSA
    allocation, routing\n   mechanisms, header format design including length-variable
    fields,\n   and IPv6 interconnection support.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
