abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the procedure for creating bindings between
    a stateless address (including Stateless Autoconfiguration Address, manually configured
    non-static address, etc) and an anchor (refer to [SAVI-framework]) on SAVI (Source
    Address Validation Improvements) device. The bindings can be used to filter packets
    generated on the local link with forged IP addresses. Different from other proposed
    solution for stateless address (e.g., SAVI-FCFS), this solution follows RFC4862
    to arbitrate the ownership of address. Supplemental binding processes are also
    specified to cover conditions that cannot be handled by control packet snooping.</p>"
