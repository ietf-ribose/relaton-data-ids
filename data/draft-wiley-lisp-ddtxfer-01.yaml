abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a protocol for transferring a LISP Delegated Database
    Tree (LISP-DDT) between DDT nodes and for notifying DDT nodes that the database
    has changed. In the absence of a formally defined protocol the LISP-DDT database
    is transferred using files containing device configuration commands. This protocol
    provides for transferring a complete database or the deltas between two versions
    of the database. This document does not describe the use of DDT as part of the
    LISP mapping service.</p>"
