abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Carrier Grade Ethernet transport solutions require the capability
    of \n   flexible service provisioning and fast protection switching. \n   Currently,
    Ethernet is being extended in IEEE to meet the scalability \n   needs of transport
    networks.  \n    \n   The IETF specified GMPLS to control transport networks.
    To enable \n   integration of Ethernet based transport solutions the extension
    of \n   GMPLS control plane for Ethernet is of value.   \n   This memo describes
    how a GMPLS control plane may be applied to \n   Provider Backbone Transport (PBT)
    and how GMPLS can be used to \n   configure VLAN-aware Ethernet switches in order
    to establish Ethernet \n   P2P and P2MP MAC switched paths and P2P/P2MP VID based
    trees.  This \n   document assumes any standard changes to IEEE data planes will
    be \n   undertaken only in the IEEE.  \n   \n\t </p>\n      "
