abstract:
  content: "\t <t>One key component of traffic engineering is a concept known asconstraint
    based routing. In constraint based routing a topologydatabase is maintained on
    all participating nodes. This databasecontains a complete list of all the links
    in the network thatparticipate in traffic engineering and for each of these links
    a setof constraints which those links can meet. Bandwidth, for example,is one
    essential constraint. Since the bandwidth available changesas new LSPs are established
    and terminated the topology databasewill develop inconsistencies with respect
    to the real network. It isnot possible to increase the flooding rates arbitrarily
    to keep thedatabase discrepancies from growing. We propose a new mechanismwhereby
    a source node can learn about the successes or failures ofits path selections
    by receiving feedback from the paths it isattempting. This fed-back information
    can be incorporated intosubsequent route computations, which greatly improves
    the accuracyof the overall routing solution by significantly reducing thedatabase
    discrepancies.</p>"
