abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The defining feature of a standard is that it be widely, preferably\n
    \  ubiquitously used.  The deployment strategies of previous protocol\n   standardization
    efforts are compared and best practice suggested for\n   application and infrastructure
    protocol deployment strategies are\n   described.  Recommendations for enabling
    deployment of specific\n   protocols and for future IETF working practices are
    made.\n\n   This draft is a generalization of the principles used to develop the\n
    \  deployment strategy for the Mathematical Mesh.  Many documents\n   describing
    deployment considerations have been developed during the\n   development of the
    Mesh and these have motivated many changes to the\n   design during the course
    of development.\n\n   The Mesh is consciously and deliberately modeled on the
    same\n   strategies that succeeded in the Web. Some of these strategies are\n
    \  well known:\n\n   Other parts of the Web strategy have not been widely discussed.
    \ This\n   paper presents some parts of the strategy most relevant to the IAB\n
    \  workshop program.\n\n   This document is also available online at\n   http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-iab-deployment.html\n
