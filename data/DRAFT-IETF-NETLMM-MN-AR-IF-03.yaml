abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an interface between mobile nodes (MNs)
    and a\nmobility access gateway (MAG) of a network-based localized mobility\nmanagement
    (NETLMM) domain.  The interface has two functions which\nare invoked when a MN
    attaches and detaches from a MAG.  The\nattachment function lets the MAG authenticate
    the MN identifier, does\naddress(es) and default router configuration for the
    MN, and informs\nthe MAG about the multicast listener state of the MN.  During
    the\nattachment function the NETLMM protocol is triggered between the MAG\nand
    Localized Mobility Anchor (LMA) to register the MN in the local\ndomain.  The
    detachment function lets the MAG detect that the MN has\nleft so that it can deregister
    the MN at the LMA using the NETLMM\nprotocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
