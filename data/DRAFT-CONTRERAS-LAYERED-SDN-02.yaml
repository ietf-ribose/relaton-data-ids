abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Software Defined Networking (SDN) proposes the separation of
    the\n   control plane from the data plane in the network nodes and its\n   logical
    centralization on a control entity.  Most of the network\n   intelligence is moved
    to this functional entity.  Typically, such\n   entity is seen as a compendium
    of interacting control functions in a\n   vertical, tight integrated fashion.
    \ The relocation of the control\n   functions from a number of distributed network
    nodes to a logical\n   central entity conceptually places together a number of
    control\n   capabilities with different purposes.  As a consequence, the existing\n
    \  solutions do not provide a clear separation between transport control\n   and
    services that relies upon transport capabilities.\n\n   This document describes
    a proposal named Cooperating Layered\n   Architecture for SDN.  The idea behind
    that is to differentiate the\n   control functions associated to transport from
    those related to\n   services, in such a way that they can be provided and maintained\n
    \  independently, and can follow their own evolution path.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
