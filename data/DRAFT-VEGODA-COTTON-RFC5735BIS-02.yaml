abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document obsoletes RFC 5735 and updates RFC 6441.  It
    describes\n   the global and other specialized IPv4 address blocks that have been\n
    \  assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  It does\n   not
    address IPv4 address space assigned to operators and users\n   through the Regional
    Internet Registries, nor does it address IPv4\n   address space assigned directly
    by IANA prior to the creation of the\n   Regional Internet Registries.  It also
    does not address allocations\n   or assignments of IPv6 addresses or autonomous
    system numbers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
