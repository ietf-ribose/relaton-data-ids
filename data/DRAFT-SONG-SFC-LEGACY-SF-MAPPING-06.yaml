abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Service Function Chain (SFC) defines a set of abstract Service\n
    \  Functions (SF) and ordering constraints that must be applied to\n   packets
    and/or frames selected as a result of classification.  One\n   assumption of this
    document is that legacy service functions can\n   participate in service function
    chains without having support for the\n   SFC header, or even being aware of it.
    \ This document provides a\n   mechanism between an SFC proxy and an SFC-unaware
    service function\n   (herein termed \"legacy SF\"), to identify the SFC header
    associated\n   with a packet that is returned from a legacy SF, without an SFC\n
    \  header being explicitly carried in the wired protocol between SFC\n   proxy
    and legacy SF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
