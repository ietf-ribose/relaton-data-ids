abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a framework to assist writers of DNS Security
    Extensions (DNSSEC) Policies and DNSSEC Practice Statements, such as domain managers
    and zone operators on both the top level and secondary level, who are managing
    and operating a DNS zone with Security Extensions implemented. In particular,
    the framework provides a comprehensive list of topics that should be considered
    for inclusion into a DNSSEC Policy definition and Practice Statement. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
