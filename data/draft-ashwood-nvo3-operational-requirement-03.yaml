abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides framework and requirements for Network Virtualization
    over Layer 3 (NVO3) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM). This document
    for the most part gathers requirements from existing IETF drafts and RFCs which
    have already extensively studied this subject for different data planes and layering.
    As a result this draft is high level and broad. We begin to ask which are truly
    required for NVO3 and expect the list to be narrowed by the working group as subsequent
    versions of this draft are created.</p>"
