abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) aims at evolving the
    way\n   network operators design, deploy and provision their networks by\n   leveraging
    on standard IT virtualisation technologies to move and\n   consolidate a wide
    range of network functions and services onto\n   industry standard high volume
    servers, switches and storage.  The\n   primary target for operators, stimulated
    by the recent updates on NFV\n   and SDN, is the network edge.  In fact, operators
    are considering\n   their future datacentres and Points of Presence (PoPs) as\n
    \  increasingly dynamic infrastructures where Virtualised Network\n   Functions
    (VNFs) and on-demand chained services with high elasticity\n   will be deployed.\n\n
    \  This document presents an orchestration framework for automated\n   deployment
    of highly available VNF chains.  Resiliency of VNFs and\n   chained services is
    a key requirement for operators to improve, ease,\n   automate and speed up services
    lifecycle management.  The proposed\n   VNFs orchestration framework is also positioned
    with respect to\n   current NFV and Service Function Chaining (SFC) architectures
    and\n   solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
