abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology described
    in RFC\n   4364 is focused on the scenario in which a network Service Provider\n
    \  (SP) maintains a secure backbone network and offers VPN service over\n   that
    network to its customers.  Customers access the SP's network by\n   attaching
    \"Customer Edge\" (CE) routers to \"Provider Edge\" (PE)\n   routers, and exchanging
    cleartext IP packets.  PE routers generally\n   serve multiple customers, and
    prevent unauthorized communication\n   among customers.  Customer data sent across
    the backbone (from one PE\n   to another) is encapsulated in MPLS, using an MPLS
    label to associate\n   a given packet with a given customer.  The labeled packets
    are then\n   sent across the backbone network in the clear, using MPLS transport.\n
    \  However, many customers want a VPN service that is secure enough to\n   run
    over the public Internet, and which does not require them to send\n   cleartext
    IP packets to a service provider.  Often they want to\n   connect directly to
    edge nodes of the public Internet, which does not\n   provide MPLS support.  Each
    customer may itself have multiple tenants\n   who are not allowed to intercommunicate
    with each other freely.  In\n   this case, the customer many need to provide a
    VPN service for the\n   tenants.  This document describes a way in which this
    can be achieved\n   using the technology of RFC 4364.  The functionality assigned
    therein\n   to a PE router can be placed instead in Customer Premises Equipment.\n
    \  This functionality can be augmented by transmitting MPLS packets\n   through
    IPsec Security Associations.  The BGP control plane sessions\n   can also be protected
    by IPsec.  This allows a customer to use RFC\n   4364 technology to provide VPN
    service to its internal departments,\n   while sending only IPsec-protected packets
    to the Internet or other\n   backbone network, and eliminating the need for MPLS
    transport in the\n   backbone.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
