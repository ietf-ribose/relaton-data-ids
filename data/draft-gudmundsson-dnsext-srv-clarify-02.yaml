abstract:
  content: <p>The DNS SRV record has been specified in RFC 2052 and RFC 2782 foruse
    in dynamic service discovery for a domain. These two RFCs didnot clearly specify
    an IANA registry for the names of the servicesand their underlying protocols.
    This document clarifies RFC 2782regarding the formation and use of the Service
    Prefix in the ownername of SRV records, based on the unified IANA "Service Name
    andTransport Protocol Port Number" registry and provides a few othercorrections,
    clarifications, and usage recommendations.</p>
