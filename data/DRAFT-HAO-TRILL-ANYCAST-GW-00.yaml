abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft mainly describes centralized anycast layer 3 gateway\n
    \  solution in TRILL campus. Comparing to traditional VRRP based\n   active-standby
    layer 3 gateway solution, this solution can achieve\n   better load balancing
    and scalability. Anycast nickname, anycast\n   gateway IP and MAC are introduced.
    It can ensure inter-subnet\n   traffic forwarding in flow-based load balancing
    mode among all\n   physical layer 3 gateways. To avoid sending duplicated ARP
    reply\n   message to the end system, ARP master gateway election mechanism is\n
    \  introduced. The election algorithm is described in this draft.\n\n\t </p>\n
