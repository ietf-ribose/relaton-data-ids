abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>VPN information can be piggybacked into BGP to allow a network-based\nVPN
    to auto-discover its membership and adequate information needed\nbefore any data
    exchange between private sites takes place across\nthe backbone. Other drafts
    (e.g.[VPN-RFC2547]) also piggyback VPN\ninformation onto the backbone instance
    of BGP. However, [VPN-\nRFC2547] implicitly allows only for a single reachability
    mechanism\n(also BGP piggybacking) and a single tunneling mechanism (MPLS).\nThis
    draft allows for the explicit indication of the reachability\nmodes supported
    (e.g. piggybacking or virtual router) and the\ntunneling mechanisms supported,
    by a VPN device. The purpose of this\ndraft is to define a common VPN information
    protocol that can be\nused for both piggybacking and virtual router schemes. It
    allows for\nthe auto-discovery of the nodes in a particular VPN, the selection\nof
    the reachability mechanism to use, and the selection of the\ntunneling protocol
    to use.\n\t </p>\n      "
