abstract:
- content: <p>Many communication protocols operating over the modern Internet use
    hostnames. These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of which may have
    different performance and connectivity characteristics. Since specific addresses
    or address families (IPv4 or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a
    network, clients that attempt multiple connections in parallel have a chance of
    establishing a connection more quickly. This document specifies requirements for
    algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and provides an example algorithm,
    referred to as "Happy Eyeballs". This document obsoletes the original algorithm
    description in RFC 6555.</p>
