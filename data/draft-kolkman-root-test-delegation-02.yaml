abstract:
- content: "<p>The delegation of certain strings as generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs)
    may cause stability and security issues if such strings have been used in private
    environments prior to their delegation. Test delegations can be used to enable
    empirical research on the extent of the potential for name collision. This document
    describes one such approach to an empirical testing framework for name collision,
    and considers the applicability of this approach to detect other forms of name
    collision.</p>"
