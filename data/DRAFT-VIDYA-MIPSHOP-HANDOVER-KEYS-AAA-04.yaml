abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a key management protocol to generate
    a\n   handover key between a mobile node (MN) and an access router (AR) for\n
    \  the purpose of securing Fast Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) signaling messages.\n   As
    such, it specifies a message exchange between the MN and the AR\n   and assumptions
    that must hold in order for this protocol to work.\n   The protocol itself is
    described here for FMIPv6 use, but is\n   applicable to other protocols that need
    to establish shared keys\n   between the MN and a network entity.\n\t </p>\n      "
