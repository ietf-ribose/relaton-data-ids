abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IP fragmentation has long been subject for scrutiny since the\n
    \  publication of \"Fragmentation Considered Harmful\" in 1987.  This work\n   cast
    fragmentation in a negative light that has persisted to the\n   present day.  However,
    the tone of the work failed to honor two\n   principles of creative thinking:
    never say \"always\" and never say\n   \"never\".  This document discusses uses
    for fragmentation that apply\n   both to the present day and moving forward into
    the future.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
