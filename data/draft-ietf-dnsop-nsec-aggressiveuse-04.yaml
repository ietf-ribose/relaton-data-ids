abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS relies upon caching to scale; however, the cache lookup generally
    requires an exact match. This document specifies the use of NSEC/NSEC3 resource
    records to allow DNSSEC validating resolvers to generate negative answers within
    a range, and positive answers from wildcards. This increases performance / decreases
    latency, decreases resource utilization on both authoritative and recursive servers,
    and also increases privacy. It may also help increase resilience to certain DoS
    attacks in some circumstances. This document updates RFC4035 by allowing validating
    resolvers to generate negative based upon NSEC/NSEC3 records (and positive answers
    in the presence of wildcards). [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is
    additional background information, answers to frequently asked questions, general
    musings, etc. They will be removed before publication.This document is being collaborated
    on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-ietf- dnsop-nsec-aggressiveuse.
    The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available
    here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.]</p>"
