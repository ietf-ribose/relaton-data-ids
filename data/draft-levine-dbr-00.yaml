abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Domains can authenticate their outgoing mail using DKIM or othertechniques.
    In some cases where miscreants frequently use a domainwithout authorization in
    the Author address in e-mail messages, itmay be prudent for recipient mail systems
    to discard unauthenticatedmail as likely to be fraudulent. This specification
    defines anextension to Vouch by Reference (VBR) that allows a certifier toidentify
    such domains, and that recipients can use either inconjunction with or independently
    of VBR.</p>"
