abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet operation has typically required no public mechanism
    for\n   announcing restriction or permission of particular hosts to operate\n
    \  clients or servers for particular services on behalf of particular\n   domains.
    \ What is missing is an open, interoperable means by which a\n   trusted agency
    can announce authorization for a host to operate a\n   service.  The current specification
    supports this capability for\n   sending SMTP clients.  Specifically, is a sending
    SMTP client\n   permitted to act as a client MTA?  Has a separate authority given
    it\n   permission to perform this service?  Client SMTP Authorization (CSA)\n
    \  specifies a DNS-based record that states whether an associated host\n   has
    permission to operate as a client MTA.\n\t </p>\n      "
