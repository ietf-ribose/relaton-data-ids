abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Unicode's design goal is to be the universal character set
    for all\n   applications.  The goal entails the inclusion of very large numbers\n
    \  of characters.  It is also focused on written language in general;\n   special
    provisions have always been needed for identifiers.  The\n   sheer size of the
    repertoire increases the possibility of accidental\n   or intentional use of characters
    that can cause confusion among\n   users, particularly where linguistic context
    is ambiguous,\n   unavailable, or impossible to determine.  A registry of code
    points\n   that can be sometimes especially problematic may be useful to guide\n
    \  system administrators in setting parameters for allowable code points\n   or
    combinations in an identifier system, and to aid applications in\n   creating
    security aids for users.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
