abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In the daily communication between technicians, engineers and otherpeople
    who need to deal with computer networks, it is often necessaryto refer to particular
    parts of IP addresses. In the world of IPv4,the term \"octet\" is well established,
    however as the use of IPv6 isspreading, it becomes apparent that there is no such
    commonlyaccepted term for IPv6 addresses.Discussing and explaining technical matters
    become difficult whendifferent people use different terms for the same thing.
    Therefore,this document discusses several naming proposal for those 16bitpieces
    of IPv6 addreses.</p>"
