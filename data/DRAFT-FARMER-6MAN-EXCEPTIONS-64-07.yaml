abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document clarifies exceptions to the standard subnet boundary
    in\n   IPv6 addressing.  The exceptions include unicast IPv6 addresses with\n
    \  the first three bits 000, manually configured addresses, DHCPv6\n   assigned
    addresses, IPv6 on-link determination, and the possibility\n   of an exception
    specified in separate IPv6 link-type specific\n   documents.  Further, operational
    guidance is provided, and Appendix A\n   discusses the valid options for configuring
    the parameters of an IPv6\n   subnet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
