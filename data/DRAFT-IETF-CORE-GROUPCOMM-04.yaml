abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained devices
    and\n   networks.  It is anticipated that constrained devices will often\n   naturally
    operate in groups (e.g. in a building automation scenario\n   all lights in a
    given room may need to be switched on/off as a\n   group).  This document defines
    how the CoAP protocol should be used\n   in a group communication context.  An
    approach for using CoAP on top\n   of IP multicast is detailed for both constrained
    and un-constrained\n   networks.  Also, various use causes and corresponding protocol
    flows\n   are provided to illustrate important concepts.  Finally, guidance is\n
    \  provided for deployment in various network topologies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
