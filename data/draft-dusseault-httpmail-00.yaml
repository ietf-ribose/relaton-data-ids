abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes a standard format and a standard navigationmechanism
    so that mail stores can provide interoperable access tomailboxes and messages
    over HTTP. Mailbox contents and listings ofmailboxes are exposed as Atom Feeds,
    while messages themselves aredownloaded as a document of type message/822. Each
    mailbox and eachmessage is assigned an HTTP URL, and if permissions checks aresatisfied,
    each message may be downloaded independently.</p>"
