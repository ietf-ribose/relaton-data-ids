abstract:
- content: "<p>Route tagging plays an important role in external BGP [RFC4271] relations,
    in communicating various routing policies between peers. It is also a very common
    best practice among operators to propagate various additional information about
    routes intra-domain. The most common tool used today to attach various information
    about routes is through the use of BGP communities [RFC1997]. This document defines
    a new encoding which will enhance and simplify what can be accomplished today
    with the use of BGP communities. The most important addition this specification
    makes over currently defined BGP communities is the ability to specify, carry
    as well as use for execution an operator's defined set of parameters. It also
    provides an extensible platform for any new community encoding needs in the future.</p>"
