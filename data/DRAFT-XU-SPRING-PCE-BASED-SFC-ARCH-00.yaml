abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides a flexible way to
    construct\n   services.  When applying a particular service function chain to
    the\n   traffic, the traffic needs to be steered through an ordered set of\n   service
    functions in the network.  This ordered set of service\n   functions in the network,
    referred to as a Service Function Path\n   (SFP), is an instantiation of the service
    function chain in the\n   network.  Segment Routing (SR) technique can be leveraged
    to steer\n   the traffic through the SFP in SR networks.  This document describes\n
    \  a PCE-based SFC architecture in which the PCE is used to compute a\n   service
    function path (i.e., instantiate a service function chain) in\n   SR networks.\n\n\n\t
