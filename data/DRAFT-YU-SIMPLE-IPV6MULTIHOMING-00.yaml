abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There is a challenge of providing IPv6 multihoming sites with
    the\nbasic benefits such as redundancy and load sharing, and at the same\ntime,
    scaling the global IPv6 routing table. It is equally\nchallenging to provide a
    solution which is simple enough to be\noperational manageable. This document proposes
    a simple solution\nwhich meets the requirements and is also operationally manageable.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
