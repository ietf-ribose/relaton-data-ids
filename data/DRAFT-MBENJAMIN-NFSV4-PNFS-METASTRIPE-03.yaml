abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet-Draft describes a means to add metadata striping
    to\n   pNFS.  The text of this draft is substantially based on prior drafts\n
    \  by Eisler, M., with some departures.  The current draft attempts to\n   define
    a somewhat lighter-weight protocol, in particular, seeks to\n   permit striping
    for \"filehandle only\" operations such as LOCK and\n   OPEN + CLAIM_FH, without
    clients having to obtain metadata layouts on\n   regular files.  We gratefully
    acknowledge the primary contributions\n   of Mike Eisler, Pranoop Ersani, and
    others.\n\nInternet Draft Comments\n\n   Comments regarding this draft are solicited.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
