abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the relationships between the Internet architecture
    and the ability of people to exercise their right to freedom of assembly and association
    online. The Internet increasingly mediates our lives, our relationships, and our
    ability to exercise our human rights. As a global forum, the Internet provides
    a public space, yet it is predominantly built on private infrastructure. Since
    Internet protocols play a central role in the management, development, and use
    of the Internet, we analyze the relation between protocols and the rights to assemble
    and associate to mitigate infringements on those rights.</p>"
