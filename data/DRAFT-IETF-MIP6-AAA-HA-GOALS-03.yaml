abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In commercial deployments Mobile IPv6 can be a service offered
    by a\nMobility Services Provider (MSP).  In this case all protocol\noperations
    may need to be explicitly authorized and traced, requiring\nthe interaction between
    Mobile IPv6 and the AAA infrastructure.\nIntegrating the AAA infrastructure offers
    also a solution component\nfor Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping in integrated and split
    scenarios.\n\nThis document describes various scenarios where a AAA interface
    for\nMobile IPv6 is actually required.  Additionally, it lists design\ngoals and
    requirements for such an interface.\n\t </p>\n      "
