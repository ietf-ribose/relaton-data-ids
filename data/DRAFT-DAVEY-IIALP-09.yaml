abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a system by which Internet Annoyances can
    be\n  logged quickly and automatically using IIALP (Iowa Internet Annoyance\n
    \ Logging Protocol).  The annoyance logs on a particular IIALP Server\n  are condensed
    and forwarded up the IIALP hierarchy to central Root\n  IIALP Servers for central
    annoyance queries.  Serial numbers and TTL\n  values keep the individual reports
    organized and dated.  One unique\n  complaint per IP per epoch period prevents
    flooding.  Differences\n  in detail and propagation parameters exist between Root
    and\n  Subordinate IIALP Servers to allow for more detail to be kept at the\n
    \ originating IIALP Server. Standard XML and TCP security techniques,\n  and Hierarchy
    Structure eliminate erroneous reporting.  Routers and \n  software running IIALP
    can use IIALP to create dynamic QOS\n  lists for abusing Internet assets exceeding
    a set limits. IIALP allows\n  for an infinite number of different types of annoyances
    to exist but\n  has concise templates for common annoyances such as SPAM.  IIALP\n
    \ is a centralized logging system for Internet annoyance event\n  reporting.\n\t
