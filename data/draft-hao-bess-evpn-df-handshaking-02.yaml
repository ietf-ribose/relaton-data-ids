abstract:
- content: "<p>In [EVPN], in the DF re-election transient period, due to Ethernet
    Segment route transmission timer and timer clock discrepancy on each PEs, dual
    DF PEs will co-exist, traffic loop and disruption will be incurred. In MHN case,
    the consequences are particularly serious. Handshaking mechanism for DF election
    is introduced in this draft to resolve the problem.</p>"
