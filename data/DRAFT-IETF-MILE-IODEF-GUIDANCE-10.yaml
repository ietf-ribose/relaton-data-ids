abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format v2 [RFC7970]
    defines\n   a data representation that provides a framework for sharing\n   information
    commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response\n   Teams (CSIRTs) about
    computer security incidents.  Since the IODEF\n   model includes a wealth of available
    options that can be used to\n   describe a security incident or issue, it can
    be challenging for\n   security practitioners to develop tools that can leverage
    IODEF for\n   incident sharing.  This document provides guidelines for IODEF\n
    \  implementers.  It also addresses how common security indicators can\n   be
    represented in IODEF and use-cases of how IODEF is being used.\n   This document
    aims to make IODEF's adoption by vendors easier and\n   encourage faster and wider
    adoption of the model by Computer Security\n   Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs)
    around the world.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
