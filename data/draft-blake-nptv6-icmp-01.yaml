abstract:
- content: <p>NPTv6 is a stateless, transport-agnostic IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix
    Translation function that provides the address-independence benefit associated
    with IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT without some of that mechanism's drawbacks. NPTv6 is intended
    to be deployed in environments where a host might not know its "external" network
    prefix(es). In such an environment, a NPTv6 device must also translate network
    prefixes present in in-bound and out-bound ICMPv6 error message payloads. This
    document describes the required processing of ICMPv6 error messages.</p>
