abstract:
- content: "<p>The widespread adoption of Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting,
    and Conformance (DMARC) led Mailing List Managers (MLM) to rewrite the From: header
    field as a workaround. This document describes reverting MLM transformations in
    IETF mailing lists. That way, it is possible to verify DomainKeys Identified Mail
    (DKIM) signatures that were applied at submission time and thereby restore original
    identifiers. For reliable results, some compliance is required of all agents involved,
    author domain signers, MLMs, forwarders, and final recipients' verifiers.</p>"
