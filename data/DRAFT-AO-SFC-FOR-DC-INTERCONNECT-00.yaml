abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Sometimes some SFs of a SFC are provided by several DC networks.\n
    \  That means a SFC may cross several SFs in different DC network.  How\n   to
    establish such SFC that is across several DCs is what we want to\n   state.  In
    this document, a hierarchical SFC method is proposed.  It\n   will cover data
    plane, control plane for such hierarchical SFC.  And\n   it includes requirements
    of the SFC Gateway for every DC network that\n   provide SF for SFC.\n\n\t </p>\n
