abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) is commonly used along with
    Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) tunnels. The EVPN multi-homing procedures
    may be different depending on the NVO tunnel type used in the EVPN Broadcast Domain.
    In particular, there are two multi-homing Split Horizon procedures to avoid looped
    frames on the multi-homed CE: ESI Label based and Local Bias. ESI Label based
    Split Horizon is used for MPLSoX tunnels, E.g., MPLSoUDP, whereas Local Bias is
    used for others, E.g., VXLAN tunnels. The current specifications do not allow
    the operator to decide which Split Horizon procedure to use for tunnel encapsulations
    that could support both. Examples of tunnels that may support both procedures
    are MPLSoGRE, MPLSoUDP, GENEVE or SRv6. This document extends the EVPN Multi-Homing
    procedures so that an operator can decide the Split Horizon procedure for a given
    NVO tunnel depending on their own requirements.</p>"
