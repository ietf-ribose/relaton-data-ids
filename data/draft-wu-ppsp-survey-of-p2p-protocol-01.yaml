abstract:
- content: "<p>Most of Peer-to-Peer survey papers are described about the P2P applications
    architecture. But it is hard to compare PPSP with them with the high-level description.
    In this survey, we focus on the message design for the well-known P2P file downloading
    and streaming applications (Bittorrent and eMule) and study their base and enhancement
    approach in the peer and tracker protocol specifications. Through the survey,
    we summarize a common message design for the P2P streaming protocol standardization.</p>"
