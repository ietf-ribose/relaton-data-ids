abstract:
- content: "<p>The Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol is
    nearing exhaustion of its current 8-bit attribute type space. In addition, experience
    shows a growing need for complex grouping, along with attributes which can carry
    more than 253 octets of data. This document defines changes to RADIUS which address
    all of the above problems.</p>"
