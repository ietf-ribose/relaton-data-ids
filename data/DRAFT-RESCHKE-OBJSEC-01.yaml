abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A tremendous growth in different uses of the Internet has let
    to a\n   growing need to protect data sent over public networks, including\n   data
    sent via http.  Use of end-to-end TLS for the majority of\n   traffic looks at
    first a most feasible response.  However, the web\n   architecture has become
    more sophisticated and as it has now gone\n   beyond the simple client-server
    model, the end-to-end used of TLS is\n   increasingly showing its downside.  The
    end-to-end use of TLS\n   excludes the use of beneficial intermediaries such as
    use of caches\n   or proxies that provide instrumental services.  Then need for
    greater\n   privacy seems to collide with the equally growing desire for better\n
    \  end-to-end performance and user experience.  As an example, the use\n   of
    HTTP/TLS often appears to maximise the benefit for the combination\n   of both.\n\n
    \  This document describes the above dichotomy and lays out a number of\n   objectives
    of what can ideally be achieved, namely catering for\n   sufficient security and
    privacy whilst providing users with the\n   opportunity to make use of intermediaries'
    services where considered\n   beneficial.  This document introduces a number of
    potential solutions\n   towards use of suitable protocol mechanisms and data formats.
    \ End-\n   to-end protocols which are aware of intermediaries should enable\n
    \  users and/or content providers to exercise fine-grained control over\n   what
    intermediaries should be able to do and what exposure to data or\n   metadata
    they shall be permitted to get.  The document then\n   highlights anticipated
    benefits to key stakeholders such as users,\n   content providers and intermediaries.
    \ As elements such as object\n   security can play a useful role, this document
    encourages the\n   analysis of related work to discern their applicability, limitations,\n
    \  and coverage of use cases.  Such an effort may us espouse innovation\n   to
    frame an overall architecture and motivate more detailed work on\n   protocols
    and mechanisms in the future.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
