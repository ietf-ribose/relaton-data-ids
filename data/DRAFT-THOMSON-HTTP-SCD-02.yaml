abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An architecture is described for content distribution using
    a\n   secondary server that might be operated with reduced privileges.\n   This
    architecture allows a primary server to delegate the\n   responsibility for delivery
    of the payload of an HTTP response to a\n   secondary server.  The secondary server
    is unable to modify this\n   content.  The content is encrypted, which in some
    cases will prevent\n   the secondary server from learning about the content.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
