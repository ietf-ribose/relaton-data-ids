abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       In traditional Internet architectures, current centralized
    mobility\n       management solutions face scalability issues due to the creation
    of\n       network bottlenecks and a single mobility agent of failures. To\n       address
    these issues, we propose a Distributed Mobility Management\n       solution in
    Locator/ID Separation Protocol (DMMLISP). We divide the\n       network into many
    domains according to the area of Autonomous\n       Systems (ASs). Each domain
    consists of a Mapping Server and several\n       Tunnel Routers (xTRs). The Mapping
    Server stores global mappings\n       between EID (Endpoint Identifier) prefixes
    and AS Numbers (ASNs) to\n       lookup the mobile nodes'(MNs') home domain. Meanwhile,
    the Mapping\n       Server also contains ASN-to-xTR mappings so that it can forward
    Map-\n       Register and Map-Request messages to any xTR of the MN's home domain,\n
    \      thus enhancing reliability. In addition, the xTRs in each domain\n       constitute
    one-hop DHT (Distributed Hash Table). Moreover, any xTR\n       in the MN's home
    domain may be the home agent of MNs, and the MNs'\n       EID-to-RLOC (Routing
    Locator) mapping is stored in two xTRs using\n       two hash functions. In this
    way, it not only supports quick lookup\n       but also improves scalability and
    survivability.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
