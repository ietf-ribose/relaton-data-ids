abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide
    origin\n   authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital\n
    \  signatures.  These digital signatures can be verified by building a\n   chain
    of trust starting from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a\n   particular
    node in the DNS.  This document specifies a mechanism that\n   will allow an end
    user to determine the trusted key state for the\n   root key of the resolvers
    that handle that user's DNS queries.  Note\n   that this method is only applicable
    for determing which keys are in\n   the trust store for the root key.\n\n   There
    is an example / toy implementation of this at http://www.ksk-\n   test.net .\n\n
    \  [ This document is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/APNIC-Labs/draft-kskroll-sentinel.
    \ The most\n   recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be\n
    \  available here.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.  Text\n   in
    square brackets will be removed before publication. ]\n\n   [ NOTE: This version
    uses the labels \"kskroll-sentinel-is-ta-&lt;tag-\n   index&gt;\", \"kskroll-sentinel-not-ta-&lt;tag-index&gt;\";
    older versions of\n   this document used \"_is-ta-&lt;tag-index&gt;\", \"_not-ta-&lt;tag-index&gt;\".
    \ Also\n   note that the format of the tag-index is now decimal.  Apolgies to\n
    \  those who have began implmenting.]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
