abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As operators struggle to optimize their network for different\n
    \  applications while maximizing network resources usage, there's\n   growing
    business pressure to minimize operational tasks and the\n   deployment time of
    new services.\n\n   New automation paradigms are meant to help reach these goals,\n
    \  including the optimization of network functions through application\n   control.
    This control could be signaled directly by an application,\n   through a proxy
    or orchestrated in a centralized manner.\n\n   The current version of the Shared
    Unified Policy Automation (SUPA)\n   group charter identifies two fields where
    standardization would be\n   desirable for operators: the definition of a generic
    model for the\n   description of network topologies at any layer and with any
    degree\n   of granularity, and the definition of a standardized model for\n   applications
    to push policies toward a central network controller.\n   The first of these topics,
    the topology modeling, is meant to\n   support the definition and application
    of the second. The present\n   memo analyses the current state of the art of the
    industries\n   regarding these two topics and discusses whether an IETF\n   standardization
    is desirable and for which reasons.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
