abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the DOTS signal channel Call Home,
    which\n   enables a DOTS server to initiate a secure connection to a DOTS\n   client,
    and to receive the attack traffic information from the DOTS\n   client.  The DOTS
    server in turn uses the attack traffic information\n   to identify the compromised
    devices launching the outgoing DDoS\n   attack and takes appropriate mitigation
    action(s).\n\n   The DOTS signal channel Call Home is not specific to the home\n
    \  networks; the solution targets any deployment which requires to block\n   DDoS
    attack traffic closer to the source(s) of a DDoS attack.\n\nEditorial Note (To
    be removed by RFC Editor)\n\n   Please update these statements within the document
    with the RFC\n   number to be assigned to this document:\n\n   o  \"This version
    of this YANG module is part of RFC XXXX;\"\n\n   o  \"RFC XXXX: Distributed Denial-of-Service
    Open Threat Signaling\n      (DOTS) Signal Channel Call Home\";\n\n   o  \"| [RFCXXXX]
    |\"\n\n   o  reference: RFC XXXX\n\n   Please update this statement with the RFC
    number to be assigned to\n   the following documents:\n\n   o  \"RFC YYYY: Distributed
    Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling\n      (DOTS) Signal Channel Specification
    (used to be I-D.ietf-dots-\n      signal-channel)\n\n   Please update TBD statements
    with the assignment made by IANA to DOTS\n   Signal Channel Call Home.\n\n   Also,
    please update the \"revision\" date of the YANG module.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
