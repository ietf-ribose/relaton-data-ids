abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network mobility (NEMO) provides session continuity for mobile
    nodes\n   (MN) while moving in vehicles without their involvement in signaling\n
    \  process. NEMO Basic support protocol is standardized to provide\n   network
    mobility support.\n\n   Current mobility management protocols rely on a central
    mobility\n   anchor in order to provide mobility support for the mobile nodes.\n
    \  These centralized approaches show some big issues, such as a single\n   point
    of failure, non-optimal routing, and scalability.\n   Ever-increasing demand for
    the mobile traffic changes the network\n   architecture from hierarchical to flat
    architecture, and distributed\n   mobility management (DMM) approaches are being
    researched to adapt\n   the new flat architecture and overcome big above issues.\n\n
    \  This document presents about detailed protocol operation to support\n   network
    mobility in the DMM domain.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
