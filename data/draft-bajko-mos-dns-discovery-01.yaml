- content: "<p>This document defines application service tags that allow service location
    without relying on rigid domain naming conventions, and DNS procedures for discovering
    servers which provide Mobility Services. Mobility Services are used to assist
    an MN in handover preparation (network discovery) and handover decision (network
    selection). The services addressed by this document are the Media Independent
    Handover Services defined in [1].</p>"
