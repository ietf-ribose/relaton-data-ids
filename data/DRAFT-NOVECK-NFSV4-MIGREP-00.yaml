abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     The fs_locations attribute in NFSv4 provides support for
    fs\n     migration, replication and referral.  Given the current work on\n     supporting
    these features, and the new needs such as support for\n     global namespace,
    it is time to look at this area and see what\n     further development of this
    protocol area may be required.  This\n     document makes suggestions for the
    further development of these\n     features in NFSv4.1 and also presents ideas
    for work that might be\n     done as part of future minor versions.\n\t </p>\n
