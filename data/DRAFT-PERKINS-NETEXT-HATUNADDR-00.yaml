abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Widely deployed mobility management systems for wireless\n
    \  communications have isolated the path for forwarding data from the\n   control
    plane signaling for mobility management.  To realize this\n   requirement with
    Mobile IP requires that the control functions of the\n   home agent be addressable
    at a different IP address than the source\n   IP address of the tunnel between
    the home agent and mobile node.\n   Similar considerations hold for mobility anchors
    implementing\n   Hierarchical Mobile IP or PMIP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
