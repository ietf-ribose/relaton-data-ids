abstract:
- content: "<p>This document gives guidance on designing well-behaved Label Generation
    Rulesets (LGRs) that support variant labels. Typical examples of labels and LGRs
    are IDNs and zone registration policies defining permissible IDN labels. Variant
    labels are labels that are either visually or semantically indistinguishable from
    an applied for label and are typically delegated together with the applied-for
    label, or permanently reserved. While RFC7940 defines the syntactical requirements
    for specifying the label generation rules for variant labels, additional considerations
    apply that ensure that the label generation rules are consistent and well-behaved
    in the presence of variants.</p>"
