abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft analyze the development and deployment of the existing\n
    \  IETF Low weight IPv6 protocols in the IOT (Internet Of Things)\n   industry.
    \ Taking consideration on the constrained resource nature of\n   devices, the
    IETF low weight IPv6 protocols, including 6LowPan, RPC\n   and COAP, fit perfectly
    in the IOT scenarios.  Recent development and\n   promotion of Zigbee IP and IPSO
    also extend the use of these low\n   weight IPv6 protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
