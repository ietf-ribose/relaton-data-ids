abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Recently, some researchers have suggested that DHT should be applied\nto
    the P2P streaming system to do the media block search. This draft\nevaluates this
    proposal by simulation and modeling analysis, and\ndiscloses that it is inappropriate
    for P2P live streaming system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChen\n\n\n\n\n\n
