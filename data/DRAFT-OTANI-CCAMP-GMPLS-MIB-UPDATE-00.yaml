abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes the necessity of generalized multi-protocol
    label \n   switching (GMPLS) management information base (MIB) family update.
    \n   Since the establishment of basic GMPLS protocol specifications, \n   additional
    functionalities has been proposed and standardized so far, \n   such as recovery,
    call support, optical transport network (OTN) \n   support and so forth. Coinciding
    with these additional specifications, \n   GMPLS MIB family is also desired to
    be updated to manage GMPLS \n   networks appropriately. This document is to clarify
    missing pieces in \n   currently defined GMPLS MIB family due to the enhancement
    of original \n   GMPLS protocols. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
