abstract:
- content: "<p>RTP allows multiple RTP streams to be sent in a single session but
    requires each Synchronization Source (SSRC) to send RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
    reception quality reports for every other SSRC visible in the session. This causes
    the number of RTCP reception reports to grow with the number of SSRCs, rather
    than the number of endpoints. In many cases, most of these RTCP reception reports
    are unnecessary, since all SSRCs of an endpoint are normally co-located and see
    the same reception quality. This memo defines a Reporting Group extension to RTCP
    to reduce the reporting overhead in such scenarios.</p>"
