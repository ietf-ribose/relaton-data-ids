abstract:
- content: "<p>Network-based mobility management enables IP mobility for a host without
    requiring its participation in any mobility-related signaling. The network is
    responsible for managing IP mobility on behalf of the host. The mobility entities
    in the network are responsible for tracking the movements of the host and initiating
    the required mobility signaling on its behalf. This specification describes a
    network-based mobility management protocol and is referred to as Proxy Mobile
    IPv6. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
