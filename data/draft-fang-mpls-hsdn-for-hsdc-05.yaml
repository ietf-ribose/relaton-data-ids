abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Hierarchical SDN (HSDN), an architectural solution
    to scale the Data Center (DC) and Data Center Interconnect (DCI) networks to support
    tens of millions of physical underlay endpoints, while efficiently handling both
    Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP) load-balanced traffic and any-to-any end-to-end Traffic
    Engineered (TE) traffic. HSDN achieves massive scale using surprisingly small
    forwarding tables in the network nodes. HSDN introduces a new paradigm for both
    forwarding and control planes, in that all paths in the network are pre-established
    in the forwarding tables and the labels can identify entire paths rather than
    simply destinations. The HSDN forwarding architecture is based on four main concepts:
    1. Dividing the DC and DCI in a hierarchically-partitioned structure; 2. Assigning
    groups of Underlay Border Nodes in charge of forwarding within each partition;
    3. Constructing HSDN MPLS label stacks to identify endpoints and paths according
    to the HSDN structure; and 4. Forwarding using the HSDN MPLS labels.</p>"
