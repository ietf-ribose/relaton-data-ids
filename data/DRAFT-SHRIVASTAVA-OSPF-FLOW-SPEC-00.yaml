abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the extensions to the OSPF protocol
    to\n   distribute the traffic flow specification rules and associated\n   actions.
    \ The notion and principles of operation of the mechanism\n   were initially introduced
    into the BGP protocol.  The IPv4 part of\n   specification was published in RFC5575
    and later the specification\n   was enhanced for IPv6 via draft-raszuk-idr-flow-spec-v6.
    \ The\n   mechanism allows the routing protocol to distribute information about\n
    \  the traffic flows and associated actions such as packet filtering\n   with
    it.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
