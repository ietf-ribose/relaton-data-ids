abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Key exchange without forward secrecy enables passive monitoring.\n
    \  Massive pervasive monitoring attacks relying on key exchange without\n   forward
    secrecy has been reported, and many more have likely happened\n   without ever
    being reported.  If key exchange without Diffie-Hellman\n   is used, access to
    the long-term authentication keys enables a\n   passive attacker to compromise
    past and future sessions.  Entities\n   can get access to long-term key material
    in different ways: physical\n   attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks,
    espionage, or by simply\n   demanding access to keying material with or without
    a court order.\n   psk_ke does not provide forward secrecy and is NOT RECOMMENDED.
    \ This\n   document sets the IANA registration of psk_ke to NOT RECOMMENDED.\n\n\t
