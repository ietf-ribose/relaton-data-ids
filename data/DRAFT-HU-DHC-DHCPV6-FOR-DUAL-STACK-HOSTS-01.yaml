abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A dual-stack host may wish to obtain IPv4 and/or IPv6 configuration\n
    \  settings via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).Network\n   operators
    deploy seperate DHCPv4 servers and DHCPv6 servers,hosts get\n   IPv4 parameters
    via DHCPv4 servers and IPv6 parameters via DHCPv6\n   servers.  This document
    describes a solution,there is only a single\n   intergrated DHCPv6 server deployed
    in the ISP network,hosts obtain\n   both IPv4 and IPv6 configuration settings
    from this server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
