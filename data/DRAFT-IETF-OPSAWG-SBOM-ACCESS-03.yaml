abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To improve cybersecurity posture, automation is necessary to
    locate\n   what software is running on a device, whether that software has known\n
    \  vulnerabilities, and what, if any recommendations suppliers may have.\n   This
    memo specifies a model to provide access to this information.\n   It may optionally
    be discovered through manufacturer usage\n   descriptions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
