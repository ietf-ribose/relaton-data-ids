abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a deployment model for reconsidered validation
    [RFC8360] in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). It stipulates that
    Relying Parties in the RPKI MUST support reconsidered validation by 1 July TBD-Year,
    and that Certificate Authorities MAY use the reconsidered validation OIDs in CA
    certificates that they issue from this date. Furthermore Certificate Authorities
    should monitor whether the set of resources in CA certificate they receive has
    shrunk, and make adjustments in the CA certificates and/or other RPKI objects
    when appropriate.</p>"
