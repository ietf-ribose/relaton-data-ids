abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a new disposition type (early-session) for
    the\nContent-Disposition header field in SIP. The treatment of\n'early-session'
    bodies is similar to the treatment of 'session\nbodies. That is, they follow the
    offer/answer model. Their only\ndifference is that session descriptions whose
    disposition type is\n'early-session' are used to establish early media sessions
    within\nearly dialogs, as opposed to regular sessions within regular dialog\n\t
    </p>\n      "
