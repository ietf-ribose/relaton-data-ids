abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Localized Mobility Management (LMM) requires mobility support
    for a\n   mobile station within a restricted and topologically localized\n   portion
    of the network.  Mobile IPv6 is a standardized mobility\n   protocol for IPv6
    that can be extended to address the local mobility\n   management requirements.
    \ This document describes a solution based on\n   Proxy Mobile IPv6 scheme by
    introducing new functional entities and\n   extensions to the protocol and by
    restricting the mobility signaling\n   to only certain entities in the network.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
