abstract:
  content: "\t <t>RELOAD [1] defines a class of devices termed as clients that mayattach
    to peers and use the overlay, without having to provideoverlay routing or storage.
    These devices may attach to the identityowner on the overlay or to any arbitrary
    peer. This documentprovides a mechanism to attach to any arbitrary peer with some
    stateon the overlay for routing purposes. This avoids needing applicationspecific
    means of providing a destination list for contactinformation for the client and
    also inherently handles clientmobility.</p>"
