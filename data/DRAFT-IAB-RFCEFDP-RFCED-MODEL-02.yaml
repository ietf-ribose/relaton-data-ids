abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes updated processes for defining and\n
    \  implementing policies regarding the RFC Series.  As specified here,\n   the
    model divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into two\n   high-level
    functions: policy definition governing the RFC Series as a\n   whole, and policy
    implementation for publication of documents in the\n   RFC Series.  The policy
    definition function is the responsibility of\n   the RFC Series Working Group
    (RSWG), which produces policy proposals\n   that are subject to approval by the
    RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB).\n   The policy implementation function is primarily
    the responsibility of\n   the RFC Production Center (RPC), under the ultimate
    authority of the\n   IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC).\n\n
    \  This document reflects experience gained with version 1 of the RFC\n   Editor
    Model as specified in RFC 5620 and with version 2 as specified\n   in RFC 6635
    and RFC 8728.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 8728.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
