abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a conceptual database, the Routing\n
    \  Authentication Policy Database (RAPD), which cooperates with the key\n   table
    to provide the configuration information for the automated key\n   management
    protocols in generating key materials for routing\n   protocols.  Additionally,
    the RAPD also provides authorization\n   policies so as to guarantee that the
    keying material for securing\n   routing protocol exchanges is distributed only
    to the appropriate\n   peers.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
