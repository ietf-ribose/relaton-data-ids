abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an overview of various ways to tunnel
    IPv6\n   packets over IPv4 networks.  It covers mechanisms in current use,\n   touches
    on several mechanisms that are now only of historic interest,\n   and discusses
    some newer tunnel mechanisms that are not (yet) widely\n   used at the time of
    publication.  The goal of the document is helping\n   people with an IPv6-in-IPv4
    tunneling need to select the mechanisms\n   that may apply to them.\n\n\t </p>\n
