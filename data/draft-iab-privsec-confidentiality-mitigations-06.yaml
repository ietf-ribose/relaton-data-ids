abstract:
- content: "<p>The IAB has published [RFC7624] in response to several revelations
    of pervasive attack on Internet communications. In this document we survey the
    mitigations to those threats which are currently available or which might plausibly
    be deployed. We discuss these primarily in the context of Internet protocol design,
    focusing on robustness to pervasive monitoring and avoidance of unwanted cross-mitigation
    impacts.</p>"
