abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Every node must configure its network interface with a unique
    address\n   in order to communicate with other nodes.  Having a centralized DHCP\n
    \  server that provides addresses to nodes, we can easily and\n   automatically
    obtain addresses.  However, in a mobile ad hoc network,\n   difficulties exist
    in supporting address autoconfiguration due to the\n   lack of the centralized
    servers.  We therefore propose a distributed\n   address autoconfiguration approach
    for a mobile ad hoc network using\n   address reservation and optimistic Duplicated
    Address Detection.  The\n   reserved address helps to reduce the allocation latency,
    and the\n   optimistic DAD guarantees the uniqueness of addresses with smaller\n
    \  communication overhead.\n\t </p>\n      "
