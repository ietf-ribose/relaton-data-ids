abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to leverage Segment Routing (SR) to ensure
    that the Unaffiliated BFD (U-BFD) Echo packets must reach the remote system before
    being looped back to the local system. This enables that U-BFD works not only
    for one hop scenario but for multiple hops scenario as well. In addition, this
    document also defines a way to explicitly specify the loop back path of the U-BFD
    Echo packets. This is useful in the case where the forward and reverse path of
    the Echo packets are required to follow the same path.</p>"
