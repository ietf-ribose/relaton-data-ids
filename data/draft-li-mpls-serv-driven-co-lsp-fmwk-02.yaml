abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS TE has been widely deployed to provide traffic engineering and
    traffic protection. The complexity in configuration has much effect on the MPLS
    TE deployment in the large-scale network. The document identifies the configuration
    issues for MPLS TE deployment and proposes a new mechanism, the service-driven
    mechanism, by which the setup of co-routed MPLS TE LSPs is triggered by the bidirectional
    service. Then the document provides the framework for setting up service-driven
    co-routed MPLS Traffic-Engineered Label-Switched Paths(TE LSPs) for L2VPN and
    L3VPN.</p>"
