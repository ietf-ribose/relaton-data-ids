abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to generate a stateless IPv6 host\n
    \  interface identifier based on host geographic location information.\n   This
    method can guarantee the uniqueness and stability of the address\n   generated
    within a certain geographical range. The method is similar\n   to mechanism introduced
    in RFC 7217, but remains stable within an\n   adjustable geographical area.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
