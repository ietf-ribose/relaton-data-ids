abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Originally this draft started out as 'Reliable Extensions To
    UDP'.\n   Instead of calling it 'Reliable Extensions To UDP', it was decided\n
    \  to use an anagram, PURDET, to represent what this draft was about.\n \n   This
    PURDET specification defines a very lightweight protocol\n   with minimal transport
    functions necessary to provide reliability\n   and flow control over non-reliable
    UDP transport.  It is intended\n   to be very easy to implement, to have a small
    footprint on the\n   OS to allow high fan-out, and support simple control of the\n
    \  connection.\n \n   PURDET supports sequencing, flow control, multiplexing/protocol\n
    \  identification (using an optional field), error retransmission,\n   and link
    loss detection.\n \n   PURDET is a work in progress presented for comment.  The
    author\n   hopes this represents positive progress towards a reliability\n   approach
    appropriate to the needs of real time control and similar\n   applications.\n\n\t
