abstract:
- content: "<p>Generalized SRv6 network programming defines the enhanced mechanisms
    of SRv6 to encode SRv6 SIDs, Compressed SIDs and even the MPLS labels or IPv4
    tunnel information in a single SRH. This type of SRH is called Generalized SRH
    (G-SRH), which can reduce the overhead of SRv6 and also provide more flexibility
    for network programming. This document defines the encapsulation and packet processing
    of G-SRH.</p>"
