abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As IP networks grow more complicated, these networks require
    a new\n   interaction mechanism between customers and their networks based on\n
    \  intent rather than detailed specifics.  An intent-based protocol\n   language
    is need to enable customers to easily describe their diverse\n   intent for network
    connectivity to the network management systems.\n   This document describes the
    problem Intent-Based NEtwork Modeling\n   (IB-Nemo) language is trying to solve,
    a summary of the use cases\n   that demonstrate this problem, and a proposed scope
    of work.  Part of\n   the scope is the validation of the language as a minimal
    subset.\n\n   The IB-NEMO language is a protocol language for interactions between\n
    \  an application and a network manager/controller.  Some would call\n   this
    boundary between the application and the network management\n   system as northbound
    interface (NBI), and any protocol language that\n   crosses this as an NBI.  IB-Nemo
    focuses on creating minimal subset\n   of the total possible Intent-Based desired
    commands.  By creating a\n   minimal subset (about 20% of the total possible),
    the IB-Nemo\n   language can be a simple Intent interface for most applications\n
    \  (hopefully 80%).  Part of validation of this language is to to\n   determine
    what data models should result in the network controller\n   from different use
    cases.  This way as IB-Nemo protocol language is\n   reduced the effort can verify
    that the critical information is\n   stilled passed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
