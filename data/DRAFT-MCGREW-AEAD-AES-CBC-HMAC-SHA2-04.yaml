abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies algorithms for authenticated encryption
    with\n   associated data (AEAD) that are based on the composition of the\n   Advanced
    Encryption Standard (AES) in the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)\n   mode of operation
    for encryption, and the HMAC-SHA message\n   authentication code (MAC).\n\n   These
    are randomized encryption algorithms, and thus are suitable for\n   use with applications
    that cannot provide distinct nonces to each\n   invocation of the AEAD encrypt
    operation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
