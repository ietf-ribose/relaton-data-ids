abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The objective of this proposal is to enable ID/Locator split
    in CCN\n   protocol.  We enable this through the notion of forwarding-label (FL)\n
    \  object, which is an optional hop-by-hop payload in the Interest\n   message
    with locator name which identifies a network domain, router,\n   or a host.  Depending
    on the application and trust context FL object\n   is subjected to policy based
    actions by the forwarders such as\n   invoking security verification or enabling
    other service-centric\n   actions such as FL object replacement.  FL can be inserted
    by the\n   applications or by the network.  To enable dynamic name resolution
    FL\n   can be modified in the network by designated points such as the edge\n
    \  routers.  Enabling ID/Locator split in CCN has several applications\n   such
    as towards routing optimization, mobility, handling indirections\n   in manifests,
    and routing scalability.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
