abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol has defined
    multiple services (e.g., network maps, cost maps, filtered maps, the endpoint
    cost service, and the endpoint property service) to provide network state information
    to network applications. In a higher-level view, both the cost maps and the endpoint
    cost service can be considered as providing views into the routing state of a
    network (i.e., the path properties). A drawback of these existing services, however,
    is that they are static, application-oblivious views, without guidance from network
    applications. This document designs a new ALTO service named Routing State Abstraction
    using Declarative Equivalence (RSADE). Allowing applications to provide declarative
    guidance on the intended use of the network routing state, RSADE allows a network
    to compute compact, customized routing state abstraction beyond the existing services.</p>"
