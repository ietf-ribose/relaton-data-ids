abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax RFC 8152
    does\n   not define any direct methods for using hash algorithms.  There are\n
    \  however circumstances where hash algorithms are used: Indirect\n   signatures,
    where the hash of one or more external contents are\n   signed, or thumbprints,
    for identification of X.509 certificates or\n   other objects.  This document
    defines a set of hash algorithms that\n   are identified by COSE Algorithm Identifiers.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
