abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides an analysis and comparison of IPv4 and
    IPv6\nheader sizes under various circumstances.  The goal of this document\nis
    to provide hard evidence for use in frequent discussions regarding\ntransition,
    where header overhead comes up as an issue used to\nportray IPv6 depolyment as
    untenable.  The results show that for\nlinks that are not fully utilized, the
    IPv6 overhead would only add a\nfew percent to their load over what IPv4 implies,
    while for congested\nlinks, we note that header compression techniques for IPv6
    are at\nleast as effective as those for IPv4.  This demonstrates that the\nheader
    overhead argument against IPv6 is misinformed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
