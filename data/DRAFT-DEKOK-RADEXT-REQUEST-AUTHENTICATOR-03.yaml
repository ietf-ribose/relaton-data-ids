abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RADIUS uses a one-octet Identifier field to correlate requests
    and\n   responses, which limits clients to 256 \"in flight\" packets per\n   connection.
    \ This document removes that limitation by allowing\n   Request Authenticator
    to be used as an additional field for\n   identifying packets.  The capability
    is negotiated on a per-\n   connection basis, and requires no changes to the RADIUS
    packet\n   format, attribute encoding, or data types.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
