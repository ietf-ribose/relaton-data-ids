abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ability to compute constrained shortest Traffic Engineering
    (TE) \n   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    \n   and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has \n   been
    identified as a key requirement. This document specifies a \n   procedure for
    an inter-AS PCE to locate boundary node within its \n   domain dynamically, which
    is used for path computation. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
