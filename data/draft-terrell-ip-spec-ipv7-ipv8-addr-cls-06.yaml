abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This paper is a direct result, necessitated by the correction of
    themathematical anomaly that plague IPv4. Whose resolution also proposedan end
    to the disparities resulting from a shortage of available IPAddresses. However,
    the proposal did not seem to garner the unfledgingsupport through the suggestion
    of an alternate IP system of addressing. Which is nothing more than an exploitation
    of the presentIPv4 system. As presented in the paper entitled; 'The MathematicalReality
    of IP Addressing in IPv4 Questions the need for Another IPSystem of Addressing'.
    Needless to say, it is thought that a greater clarification of theunderlining
    foundation of this subject matter is that which isneeded. Notwithstanding my personal
    beliefs, that the promises madeby the IT Industry itself, will not be forth coming
    if an adequateIP System of Addressing is not employed. Nor the mention of the
    hidden cost the consumer is expected to pay, which is a direct result of their
    knowledge regarding a clear understanding of our presenttechnology, and the ability
    of the Technology to the IT Industry,which could reduce the overall cost today.
    All while fulfilling of thepromises they made to the consumer, which becomes the
    reality of afuture which benefits all mankind.</p>"
