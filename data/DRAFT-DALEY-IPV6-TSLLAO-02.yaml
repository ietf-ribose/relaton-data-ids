abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The proposed IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) Optimization\n
    \  \"Optimistic DAD\" defines a set of recoverable procedures which allow\n   a
    node to make use of an address before DAD completes.  Essentially,\n   Optimistic
    DAD forbids usage of certain Neighbour Discovery options\n   which could pollute
    active neighbour cache entries, while an address\n   is tentative.\n\n   This
    document defines a new option and procedures to replace cache\n   polluting options,
    in a way which is useful to tentative nodes.\n   These procedures are designed
    to be to backward compatible with\n   existing devices which support IPv6 Neighbour
    Discovery.\n\t </p>\n      "
