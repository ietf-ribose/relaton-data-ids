abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Open Trust Protocol (OTrP) is used to manage code and\n
    \  configuration data in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).  This\n   document
    specifies the HTTP transport for OTrP communication where a\n   Trusted Application
    Manager (TAM) service is used to manage TEEs in\n   devices that can initiate
    communication to the TAM.  An\n   implementation of this document can (if desired)
    run outside of any\n   TEE, but interacts with an OTrP implementation that runs
    inside a\n   TEE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
