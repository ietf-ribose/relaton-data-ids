abstract:
- content: "<p>A transport network is a server-layer network to provide connectivity
    services to its client. The topology and tunnel information in the transport layer
    has already been defined by Traffic-engineered models and OTN models, however,
    the access to the network has not been described. These information is useful
    to both client and provider. This draft describe how the client signals are carried
    over OTN and defined corresponding YANG data model which is required during configuration
    procedure. More specifically, several client signal (of OTN) models including
    ETH, STM-n, FC and so on, are defined in this draft.</p>"
