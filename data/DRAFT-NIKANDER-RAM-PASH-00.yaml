abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an incremental, network-based method
    for\n   deploying SHIM6 or HIP based identifier / locator separation, called\n
    \  Proxying Approach to SHIM6 and HIP (PASH).  This mechanism requires\n   no
    changes to host stacks and, when deployed with routable Endpoint\n   IDentifiers
    (EID), no changes to existing database infrastructures.\n   The proposed protocol
    can be implemented in a relatively small number\n   of routers, and deployed independently
    by ISPs.  At the same time, it\n   allows the network to gradually evolve towards
    full, host-based SHIM6   and/or HIP support, thereby making possible the larger
    architectural\n   benefits that the network-based \"jack-up\" approaches provide.\n\n
    \  This proposal has been on the mental roadmaps within the HIP\n   community
    for a number of years, but is properly documented only now\n   as a result of
    the problem statement effort at the Amsterdam IAB\n   Routing and Addressing Workshop
    (RAWS).\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
