abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The requirements of MPLS-TP in RFC 5654 include a requirement(R63)\n
    \  that requires MPLS-TP MUST be possible to provide protection for\n   MPLS-TP
    data plane without any IP forwarding capability and control\n   plane.If applying
    1:1 protection mechanism for the p2mp traffic in\n   rfc6718 , it must have a
    return path to coordinate switch state to\n   select the same path to receive
    and send traffic packet.For the above\n   problem,this document describes a kind
    of protection solution to\n   recovery and protect the p2mp traffic under the
    failure condition.\n\n\n\n\n   This document is a product of a joint Internet
    Task Force(IETF) /\n   International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications\n
    \  Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile
    within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and
    functionalities of a packet transport network as\n   defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\t
