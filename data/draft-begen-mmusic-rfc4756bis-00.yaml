abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) supports grouping media lines.SDP
    also has semantics defined for grouping the associated source andForward Error
    Correction (FEC)-based repair flows. However, thesemantics that were defined in
    RFC 4756 generally fail to provide thespecific grouping relationships between
    the source and repair flowswhen there are more than one source and/or repair flows
    in the samegroup. Furthermore, the existing semantics also do not supportadditive
    repair flows and prioritization among the repair flowsprotecting one or more source
    flows. This document addresses theseissues by introducing new FEC grouping semantics.</p>"
