abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The data model defined in RFC8345 introduces vertical layering\n
    \  relationships between networks that can be augmented to cover\n   network/service
    topologies.  This document defines a YANG model for\n   both Network Performance
    Monitoring and VPN Service Performance\n   Monitoring that can be used to monitor
    and manage network performance\n   on the topology at higher layer or the service
    topology between VPN\n   sites.\n\n   This model is designed as an augmentation
    to the network topology\n   YANG data model defined in RFC8345.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
