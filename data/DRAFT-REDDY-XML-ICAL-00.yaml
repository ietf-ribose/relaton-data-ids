abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>          The motivation for this proposal is the expanded scope
    and\n          diversity of the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web provides a\n
    \         simple and effective means for users to search, browse, retrieve,\n
    \         and publish information of their own available for others. Now\n          that
    Web browsers and servers are ubiquitous on the Internet, it\n          is worthwhile
    to use XML to encode calendar objects. The power\n          and extensibility
    of XML allows us to represent calendar data\n          objects as well-formed
    XML documents.\n \n          ICAL is an existing standard format for representing
    calendar\n          components. This draft explains how to represent calendar\n
    \         components in XML that are compatible and easily translatable to\n          the
    iCAL format.\n \n          Copyright (C) The Internet Society 1998. All Rights\n
    \         Reserved.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
