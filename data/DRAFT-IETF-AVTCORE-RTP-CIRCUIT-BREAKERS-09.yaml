abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony,\n
    \  video conferencing, and telepresence applications.  Such applications\n   are
    often run on best-effort UDP/IP networks.  If congestion control\n   is not implemented
    in the applications, then network congestion will\n   deteriorate the user's multimedia
    experience.  This document does not\n   propose a congestion control algorithm;
    instead, it defines a minimal\n   set of RTP \"circuit-breakers\".  Circuit-breakers
    are conditions under\n   which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting media
    data in order to\n   protect the network from excessive congestion.  It is expected
    that,\n   in the absence of severe congestion, all RTP applications running on\n
    \  best-effort IP networks will be able to run without triggering these\n   circuit
    breakers.  Any future RTP congestion control specification\n   will be expected
    to operate within the constraints defined by these\n   circuit breakers.\n\n\t
