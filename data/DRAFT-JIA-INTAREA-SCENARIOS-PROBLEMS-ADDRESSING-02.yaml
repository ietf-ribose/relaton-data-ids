abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological
    success\n   in information technology of the last half century.  As the Internet\n
    \  becomes pervasive, IP has been replacing communication technology for\n   many
    domain-specific solutions.  However, domains with specific\n   requirements as
    well as communication behaviors and semantics still\n   exist and represent what
    [RFC8799] recognizes as \"limited domains\".\n\n   This document describes well-recognized
    scenarios that showcase\n   possibly different addressing requirements, which
    are challenging to\n   be accommodated in the IP addressing model.  These scenarios\n
    \  highlight issues related to the Internet addressing model and call\n   for
    starting a discussion on a way to re-think/evolve the addressing\n   model so
    to better accommodate different domain-specific\n   requirements.\n\n   The issues
    identified in this document are complemented and deepened\n   by a detailed gap
    analysis in a separate companion document\n   [I-D.jia-intarea-internet-addressing-gap-analysis].\n\n\t
