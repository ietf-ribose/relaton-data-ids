abstract:
- content: "<p>There currently is not a standard mechanism for the reporting of mail
    system errors except for the limited set offered by SMTP and the system specific
    text descriptions sent in mail messages. There is a pressing need for a rich machine
    readable status code for use in delivery status notifications [DSN]. This document
    proposes a new set of status codes for this purpose. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
