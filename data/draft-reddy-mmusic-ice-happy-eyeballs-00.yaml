abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies requirements for algorithms that make ICE connectivity
    checks more aggressive to reduce delays in dual stack host connectivity checks
    when there is a path failure for the address family preferred by the application
    or by the operating system. As IPv6 is usually preferred, the procedures in this
    document helps avoid user-noticable delays wheen the IPv6 path is broken or excessively
    slow.</p>"
