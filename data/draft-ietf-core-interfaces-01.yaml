abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines well-known REST interface descriptions for Batch,
    Sensor, Parameter and Actuator types for use in contrained web servers using the
    CoRE Link Format. A short reference is provided for each type that can be efficiently
    included in the interface description attribute of the CoRE Link Format. These
    descriptions are intended to be for general use in resource designs or for inclusion
    in more specific interface profiles. In addition, this document defines the concepts
    of Function Set and Binding. The former is the basis element to create RESTful
    profiles and the latter helps the configuration of links between resources located
    on one or more endpoints.</p>"
