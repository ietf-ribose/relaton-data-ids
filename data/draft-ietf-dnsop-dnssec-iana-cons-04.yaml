abstract:
  content: <p>This document changes the review requirements needed to get DNSSEC algorithms
    and resource records added to IANA registries. It updates RFC 6014 to include
    hash algorithms for DS records and NSEC3 parameters. It also updates RFC 5155
    and RFC 6014, which have requirements for DNSSEC algorithms, and updates RFC 8624
    to say that algorithms that are described in RFCs that are not on standards track
    are only at the "MAY" level of implementation recommendation. The rationale for
    these changes is to bring the requirements for DS records and for the hash algorithms
    used in NSEC3 in line with the requirements for all other DNSSEC algorithms.</p>
