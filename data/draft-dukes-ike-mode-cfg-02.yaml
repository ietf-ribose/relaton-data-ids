abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new ISAKMP method that allows configuration
    items to be exchanged securely by using both push/acknowledge or request/reply
    paradigms. The authors currently intend this document to be published as an Informational
    RFC, not a standards-track document, so that the many IPsec implementations that
    have implemented to earlier drafts of this protocol can have a single stable reference.
    Comments regarding this draft should be sent to ietf-mode- cfg@vpnc.org or to
    the authors.</p>"
