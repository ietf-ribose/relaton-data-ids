abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This informational document describes and identifies the requirements
    \n   for a profile of a certificate management protocol to handle Public \n   Key
    Certificate (PKC) lifecycle interactions between Internet \n   Protocol Secuity
    (IPsec) Virtual Private Network (VPN) Systems using \n   IKE (versions 1 and 2)
    and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Systems. \n   These requirements are designed
    so that they meet the needs of \n   enterprise scale IPsec VPN deployments. It
    is intended that a \n   standards track profile will be created that fulfills
    these \n   requirements\n\t </p>\n      "
