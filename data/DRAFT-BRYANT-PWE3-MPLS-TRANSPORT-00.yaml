abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A need has been identified to identify a strict subset of the
    PWE3 \n  over MPLS pseudowire functionality suitable for the construction of \n
    \ transport networks. This draft describes the IETF recommended profile \n  for
    such cases. This document describes the IETF-recommended profile \n  for such
    a configuration. In particular the profile of an RFC4448 \n  PWE3 Ethernet pseudowire
    that can be used to address these \n  requirements is described.\n\t </p>\n      "
