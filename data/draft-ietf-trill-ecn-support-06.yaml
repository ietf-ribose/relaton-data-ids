abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit congestion notification (ECN) allows a forwarding element
    to notify downstream devices, including the destination, of the onset of congestion
    without having to drop packets. This can improve network efficiency through better
    congestion control without packet drops. This document extends ECN to TRILL (TRansparent
    Interconnection of Lots of Links) switches, including integration with IP ECN,
    and provides for ECN marking in the TRILL Header Extension Flags Word (see RFC
    7179).</p>"
