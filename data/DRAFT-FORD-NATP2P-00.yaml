abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes and recommends methods by which peer-to-peer\n(P2P)
    applications can operate efficiently in the presence of Network\nAddress Translation
    (NAT).  This document also provides\nrecommendations for the design of network
    address translators, in\norder for them to support P2P applications effectively
    without\ncompromising security or performance.  This memo focuses on the\ninteraction
    of P2P with NAT in the absence of any special proxy,\ngateway, or relaying protocols.
    \ While not intending to preclude the\nuse of such protocols, the goal of this
    memo is to enable P2P\napplications to function automatically without specific
    knowledge of\nthe type, location, or configuration of the NAT.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
