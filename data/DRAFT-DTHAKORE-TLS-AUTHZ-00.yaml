abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the use of DTCP certificate as an\n
    \  authorization extension in the Transport Layer Security Handshake\n   Protocol,
    according to guidelines in RFC 5878.  Extensions carried in\n   the client and
    server Hello messages confirm that both parties\n   support the desired authorization
    data types.  Then if supported by\n   both the client and server, DTCP certificates
    are exchanged in the\n   supplemental data handshake TLS handshake message as
    specified in\n   RFC4680.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
