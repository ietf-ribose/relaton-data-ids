abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   Most of MANET address autoconfiguration mechanisms introduce\n
    \  significant load like message flooding, or are dependent on the\n   underlying
    routing protocols. This document proposes a new mechanism\n   that is intended
    to minimize these drawbacks.  It is also designed to\n   be applicable for hybrid
    MANET, where a MANET is connected to\n   Internet through one or more MANET border
    routers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
