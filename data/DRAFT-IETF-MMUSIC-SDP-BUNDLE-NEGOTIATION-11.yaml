abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a new SDP Grouping Framework extension,\n
    \  'BUNDLE'.  The extension can be used with the Session Description\n   Protocol
    (SDP) Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a\n   single 5-tuple for
    sending and receiving media associated with\n   multiple SDP media descriptions
    (\"m=\").  This is referred to as\n   bundled media.  This specification also
    defines a new SDP attribute,\n   'bundle-only', which can be used to request that
    specific media is\n   only used if bundled.\n\n   This specification also updates
    sections 5.1, 8.1 and 8.2 of RFC\n   3264.  The update allows an answerer to assign
    a non-zero port value\n   to an \"m=\" line in an SDP answer, even if the \"m=\"
    line in the\n   associated SDP offer contained a zero port value.\n\n   This specification
    also defines a new RTP SDES item, and a new RTP\n   header extension, that can
    be used to carry a value that associates\n   RTP/RTCP packets with a specific
    media description.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
