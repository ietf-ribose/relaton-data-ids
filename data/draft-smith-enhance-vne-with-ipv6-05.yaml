abstract:
- content: "<p>A variety of network virtualization over layer 3 methods are currently
    being developed and deployed. These methods treat IPv4 and IPv6 as equivalent
    underlay network technologies. This memo suggests how IPv6's additional capabilities
    may be used to enhance Virtual Network encapsulation over an IPv6 Underlay Network.</p>"
