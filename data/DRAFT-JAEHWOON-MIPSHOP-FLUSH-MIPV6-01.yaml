abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is a protocol that allows a mobile
    node\n   (MN) to maintain connectivity with a correspondent node (CN) via\n   the
    Internet while changing its point of attachment. In MIPv6, a\n   MN cannot know
    which packet is the last packet with the previous\n   CoA (PCoA) as the destination
    address. In this draft, we define\n   the format and the usage of the Flush message,
    in order for the MN\n   to know the last packet with the PCoA as the destination
    address\n   sent by the home agent (HA) and/or a CN.\n\t </p>\n      "
