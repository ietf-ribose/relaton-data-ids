abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MessageVortex (referred to as Vortex) protocol achieves
    different\n   degrees of anonymity, including sender, receiver, and third-party\n
    \  anonymity, by specifying messages embedded within the existing\n   transfer
    protocols, such as SMTP or XMPP, sent via peer nodes to one\n   or more recipients.\n\n
    \  The protocol outperforms others by decoupling the transport from the\n   final
    transmitter and receiver.  No trust is placed into any\n   infrastructure except
    for that of the sending and receiving parties\n   of the message.  The creator
    of the routing block (Routing block\n   builder; RBB) has full control over the
    message flow.  Routing nodes\n   gain no non-obvious knowledge about the messages
    even when\n   collaborating.  While third-party anonymity is always achieved,
    the\n   protocol also allows for either sender or receiver anonymity.\n\n\t </p>\n
