abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo documents a proposal for a different method of validationfor
    DNSSEC aware resolvers. The key change is that by changing froma model of one
    Key Signing Key, KSK, at a time to multiple KSKs itwill be possible to increase
    the aggregated trust in the signedkeys by leveraging from the trust associated
    with the differentsignees. By having multiple keys to chose from validating resolvers
    get theopportunity to use local policy to reflect actual trust indifferent keys.
    For instance, it is possible to trust a single,particular key ultimately, while
    requiring multiple validsignatures by less trusted keys for validation to succeed.Furthermore,
    with multiple KSKs there are additional redundancybenefits available since it
    is possible to roll over different KSKsat different times which may make rollover
    scenarios easier tomanage.</p>"
