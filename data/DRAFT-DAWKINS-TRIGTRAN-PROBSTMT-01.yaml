abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When transport protocols are deployed over a path including a
    \nwireless sub-network, a wireless access device now has \nsignificantly better
    knowledge of the wireless portion of the \nconnection path characteristics than
    one or both endpoints. \nEnd-to-end mechanisms continue to work (see [PILC] and
    related \nspecifications), but must rely on communication over a sub-\nnetwork
    link that experiences outages and degradation. This \ndocument will set the framework
    for investigation of whether \nthis special knowledge from wireless access devices
    can be \nuseful to endpoint transports.  While the initial focus is on \nwireless
    links, other links will also be taken into account.\n\t </p>\n      "
