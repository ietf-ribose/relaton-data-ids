abstract:
  content: "<p>This document addresses the support of IPv6 QoS aware real-timeservices
    over IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] networks. In particular, itprovides a novel solution
    to overcome the limitations of the IEEE802.16-2004 [2] system to support real-time
    and dynamic environments.Specifically, this solution supports dynamic and fast
    access from theMobile Nodes to the network services and dynamic reservations andmodifications
    of services. These fast and dynamic reservations arecrucial to the support of
    fast mobility approaches. Moreover, theproposed solution is also able to provide
    IPv6 support and efficienttraffic differentiation for services running on the
    same MN.</p>"
