abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the issues involved in elevating RTP
    to the\n   status of protocol, equivalent to TCP or UDP. This will result in all\n
    \  RTP packets being explicitly labeled as such in the packet header.\n   This
    vastly simplifies the problem of classifying real time streams.\n   Such classification
    operations are essential for successful deploy-\n   ment of RTP header compression,
    differentiated services, and traffic\n   isolation. We define the format of the
    RTP protocol header, and dis-\n   cuss issues of backwards compatibility.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
