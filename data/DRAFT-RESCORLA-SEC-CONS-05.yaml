abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>All RFCs are required by [RFC1543] to contain a Security Considera-\ntions
    section. The purpose of this is both to encourage document\nauthors to consider
    security in their designs and to inform the\nreader of relevant security issues.
    This memo is intended to provide\nguidance to RFC authors in service of both ends.\nThis
    document is structured in three parts. The first is a combina-\ntion security
    tutorial and definition of common terms; the second is\na series of guidelines
    for writing Security Considerations; the third\nis a series of examples.\n\t </p>\n
