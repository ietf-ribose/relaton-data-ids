abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to establish a secure end-to-end
    channel\n   between two parties within a federation, where both client and server\n
    \  are mutually authenticated.  The trust relationship is based upon a\n   trust
    anchor held and published by the federation.  A federation is a\n   trusted third
    party that inter-connect different trust domains with a\n   common set of policies
    and standards.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
