abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document attempts to identify the requirements for a protocol
    \nframework to provide SIP user and device profiles to SIP user \nagents.  The
    objective is not to invent new special purpose \nprotocols, but to identify the
    requirements such that a rational \ndecision can be made as to what existing protocol(s)
    should be used \nto solve the problem of providing user and device profiles to
    SIP \nuser agents.  This document also contains an evaluation of a set of \napplicable
    protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
