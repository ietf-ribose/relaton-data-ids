abstract:
- content: <p>IP packets (both IPv4 and IPv6) are understood to contain a unit of
    data which becomes the retransmission unit in case of loss. Upper layer protocols
    such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) prepare data units known as "segments",
    with traditional arrangements including a single segment per packet. This document
    presents a new construct known as the "IP Parcel" which permits a single packet
    to carry multiple segments, essentially creating a "packet-of-packets". IP parcels
    provide an essential building block for accommodating larger Maximum Transmission
    Units (MTUs) in the Internet as discussed in this document.</p>
