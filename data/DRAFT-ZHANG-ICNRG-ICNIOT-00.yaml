abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of
    objects\n   to the Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in\n
    \  different domains, the current trend is to develop a common, \"thin\n   waist\"
    of protocols forming a horizontal unified, defragmented IoT\n   platform.  Such
    a platform will make objects accessible to\n   applications across organizations
    and domains.  Towards this goal,\n   quite a few proposals have been made to build
    an application-layer\n   based unified IoT platform on top of today's host-centric
    Internet.\n   However, there is a fundamental mismatch between the host-centric\n
    \  nature of todays Internet and the information-centric nature of the\n   IoT
    system.  To address this mismatch, we propose to build a common\n   set of protocols
    and services, which form an IoT platform, based on\n   the Information Centric
    Network (ICN) architecture, which we call\n   ICN-IoT.  ICN-IoT leverages the
    salient features of ICN, and thus\n   provides naming, security, seamless mobility
    support, scalability,\n   and efficient content and service delivery.\n\n   This
    draft describes representative IoT requirements, ICN challenges\n   and design
    considerations to realize a unified ICN-IoT framework.\n   Towards this, we first
    motivate ICN for IoT using specific use case\n   scenarios.  Then taking a general
    IoT perspective, we discuss the IoT\n   requirements generally applicable to many
    well known scenarios.  We\n   then discuss how the current application layer unified
    IoT\n   architecture fails to meet these requirements, followed by discussion\n
    \  on suitability of ICN for IoT.  Though we see most of the IoT\n   requirements
    can be met by ICN, we discuss specific design challenges\n   ICN has to address
    to satisfy them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
