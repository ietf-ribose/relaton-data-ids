abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a new mode operation for IS-IS.  In
    addition\n   to the existing LAN and point-to-point modes of operation, a point-\n
    \  to-multipoint mode is defined.  This mode is useful for operation\n   both
    on networks with more than two routers where multicast is\n   expensive in comparison
    to unicast, as well on networks where\n   creating a LAN pseudonode cannot adequately
    reflect metrics.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
