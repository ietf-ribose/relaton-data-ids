abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends the RFC5011 rollover strategy with timing\n
    \  advice that must be followed in order to maintain security.\n   Specifically,
    this document describes the math behind the minimum\n   time-length that a DNS
    zone publisher must wait before signing\n   exclusively with recently added DNSKEYs.
    \ It contains much math and\n   complicated equations, but the summary is that
    the key rollover /\n   revocation time is much longer than intuition would suggest.
    \ If you\n   are not both publishing a DNSSEC trust anchor, and using RFC5011
    to\n   update that trust anchor, you probably don't need to read this\n   document.\n\n
    \  This document also describes the minimum time-length that a DNS zone\n   publisher
    must wait after publishing a revoked DNSKEY before assuming\n   that all active
    RFC5011 resolvers should have seen the revocation-\n   marked key and removed
    it from their list of trust anchors.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
