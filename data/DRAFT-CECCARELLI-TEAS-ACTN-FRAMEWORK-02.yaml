abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traffic Engineered networks have a variety of mechanisms to\n
    \  facilitate the\n   separation of the data plane and control plane.  They also
    have a\n   range of management and provisioning protocols to configure and\n   activate
    network resources.  These mechanisms represent key\n   technologies for enabling
    flexible and dynamic networking.\n\n   Abstraction of network resources is a technique
    that can be applied\n\t </p>\n      "
