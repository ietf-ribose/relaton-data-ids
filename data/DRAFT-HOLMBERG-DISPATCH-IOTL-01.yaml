abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In telecommunication networks, the signalling path between
    a calling\n   user and a called user can be partioned into segments, referred
    to as\n   traffic legs.  Each traffic leg may span networks belonging to\n   different
    operators, and will have its own characteristics that can\n   be different from
    other traffic legs in the same call.  The\n   directionality in traffic legs relates
    to a SIP request creating a\n   dialogue and stand-alone SIP request.  A traffic
    leg might be\n   associated with multiple SIP dialogs, e.g. in case a B2BUA which\n
    \  modifies the SIP dialog identifier is located within the traffic leg.\n\n   This
    document defines a new SIP URI parameter, 'iotl', which can be\n   used in a SIP
    URI to indicate that the entity associated with the\n   address, or an entity
    responsible for the host part of the address,\n   represents the end of a specific
    traffic leg (or multiple traffic\n   legs).\n\n   The 'iotl' parameter is defined
    in order to fulfil requirements from\n   the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project
    (3GPP), but it can also be\n   used in other network environments.\n\n\t </p>\n
