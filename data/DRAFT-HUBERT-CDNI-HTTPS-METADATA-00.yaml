abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CDNI Metadata specification describes generic CDNI metadata\n
    \  objects and properties as well as mechanisms to extend the generic/\n   base
    objects and properties to support additional standardised and/or\n   proprietary
    capabilities.  This document is intended to \"test\" the\n   extensibility of
    the CDNI Metadata protocol by defining CDNI Metadata\n   for delivery of content
    over HTTPS that extends the existing generic\n   CDNI Metadata.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
