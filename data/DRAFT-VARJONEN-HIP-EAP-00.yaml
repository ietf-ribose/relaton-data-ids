abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies how to use Extensible Authentication Protocol\n(EAP)
    in HIP to incorporate user authentication in the IPsec tunnel\ncreation.  This
    document describes two new parameters for\ntransporting EAP messages inside HIP
    control packets.  The main focus\nof this document is to describe how to use these
    parameters to\ncombine needed EAP negotiation in order to authenticate the user.\nThis
    document also describes how on-path middleboxes can take part in\nthe negotiation
    as authenticators.\n\t </p>\n      "
