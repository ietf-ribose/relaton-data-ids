abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Distributed mobility management aims to distribute the mobility\n
    \  anchor to the access network level to avoid the centralized mobility\n   anchor
    problem.  By distributing the mobility anchor, the traffic can\n   be distributed
    in an optimal way.  There are many different proposals\n   for DMM solution, one
    of those types of solution is called \"dynamic\n   anchor\".  This document analyses
    the limitations of current dynamic\n   anchor solution and discusses the possible
    solution to overcome those\n   limitations.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
