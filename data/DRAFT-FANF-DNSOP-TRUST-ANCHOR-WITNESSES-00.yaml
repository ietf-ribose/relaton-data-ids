abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   At the moment the root DNSSEC key is a single point of trust
    and a\n   single point of failure for the whole system.  This memo describes a\n
    \  mechanism for dispersing trust in the root key.  Witnesses vouch for\n   the
    root trust anchor by publishing WS records in the DNS.\n   Validators only update
    their root trust anchors if multiple witnesses\n   agree.  The root-witnesses.arpa
    zone enables a validator to bootstrap\n   trust when it has no working trust anchors
    other than its witnesses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
