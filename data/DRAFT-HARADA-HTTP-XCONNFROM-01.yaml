abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        HTTP/1.1 defines a Connection header, allowing 'the sender\n
    \       to specify options that are desired for that particular\n        connection
    and MUST NOT be communicated by proxies over\n        further connections.'  Because
    HTTP/1.0 proxies would\n        normally forward the Connection header without
    obeying its\n        specification, a Connection header received in an HTTP/1.0\n
    \       message must normally be treated as if it had been\n        forwarded
    in error.  This document defines an X-Connfrom\n        header that identifies
    the sending host, and so is safe to\n        use in HTTP/1.0 messages.  This might
    be useful in\n        experimenting with HTTP/1.0 implementations of applications\n
    \       of the HTTP/1.1 Connection mechanism.\n\t </p>\n      "
