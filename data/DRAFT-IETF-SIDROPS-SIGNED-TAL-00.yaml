abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Trust Anchor Locators (TALs) [RFC7730] are used by Relying
    Parties in\n   the RPKI to locate and validate Trust Anchor certificates used
    in\n   RPKI validation.  This document defines an RPKI signed object\n   [RFC6488]
    for a Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) that can be published by\n   Trust Anchor to
    communicate a new TAL to already deployed Relying\n   Parties.  The two primary
    use cases for this are that 1) a Trust\n   Anchor may wish to change the locations
    where its TA certificate may\n   be found, and 2) a Trust Anchor may wish to perform
    a planned\n   migration to a new key.  Note that unplanned key rolls are considered\n
    \  out of scope for this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
