abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Adaptive DNS Discovery is chartered to define mechanisms that
    allow\n   clients to discover and select encrypted DNS resolvers.  This\n   document
    describes one common use case, namely that of clients that\n   connect to a network
    but where they cannot securely authenticate the\n   identity of that network.
    \ In such cases the client would like to\n   learn which encrypted DNS resolvers
    are designated by that network or\n   by the Do53 resolver offered by that network.
    \ It lists requirements\n   that any proposed discovery mechanisms should seek
    to address.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
