abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to transport CCNx packets inside
    an\n   encrypted session between peers that share a traffic secret, such as\n
    \  that which is derived from [CCNxKE].  The peers create an outer\n   naming
    context to identify the encryption session in one direction\n   between the consumer
    and the producer.  The consumer sends encrypted\n   Interest messages to the producer,
    who responds with encrypted\n   Content Objects.  Inside the outer context, the
    consumer sends\n   Interests with different names, which the producer may respond
    to or\n   may send InterestReturns for.  There does not need to be a naming\n
    \  relationship between the outer names and the inner names.  The inner\n   content
    is still protected by normal CCNx authentication mechanisms\n   and possiby encrypted
    under other schemes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
