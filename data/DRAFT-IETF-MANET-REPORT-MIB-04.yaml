abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n
    \  In particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous report\n   generation
    on any device that supports MIBs containing objects that\n   resolve to type Integer32
    (i.e., Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or\n   TimeTicks). to be used for performance
    monitoring.  This allows a\n   management station to instruct a device to build
    off-line reports to\n   be collected either through notifications to the management
    station\n   or queried asynchronously by the management station.  Hence, this\n
    \  capability allows network operators to reduce the SNMP polling\n   traffic
    burden on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Disruption Tolerant Networks\n   which is problematic
    of SNMP performance management applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
