abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     This  document  defines  the  ''PPP Authentication Operation''
    for LDAP.\n     This operation provides for PPP authentication in an LDAP  association\n
    \    and is defined in terms of an LDAP extended operation.\n \n     It  is  expected
    \ that this extended operation will be useful in inte-\n     grating authentication
    protocols such as RADIUS and TACACS+ with LDAP-\n     based  directory  services.
    \ Consolidation  of  information  stores is\n     desirable since it results in
    lessened administrative workload  and  a\n     consistent view of user information
    throughout the enterprise.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
