abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Group communication services exist in a large variety of flavors,
    and\ntechnical implementations at different protocol layers.  Multicast\ndata
    distribution is most efficiently performed on the lowest\navailable layer, but
    a heterogeneous deployment status of multicast\ntechnologies throughout the Internet
    requires an adaptive service\nbinding at runtime.  Today, it is difficult to write
    an application\nthat runs everywhere and at the same time makes use of the most\nefficient
    multicast service available in the network.  Facing\nrobustness requirements,
    developers are frequently forced to using a\nstable, upper layer protocol controlled
    by the application itself.\nThis document describes a common multicast API that
    is suitable for\ntransparent communication in underlay and overlay, and grants
    access\nto the different multicast flavors.  It proposes an abstract naming\nby
    multicast URIs and discusses mapping mechanisms between different\nnamespaces
    and distribution technologies.  Additionally, it describes\nthe application of
    this API for building gateways that interconnect\ncurrent multicast domains throughout
    the Internet.\n\t </p>\n      "
