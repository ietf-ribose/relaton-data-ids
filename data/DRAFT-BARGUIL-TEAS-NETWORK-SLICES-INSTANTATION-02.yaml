abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Slicing (NS) is an integral part of Service Provider\n
    \  networks.  The IETF has produced several YANG data models to support\n   the
    Software-Defined Networking and network slice architecture and\n   YANG-based
    service models for network slice (NS) instantiation.\n\n   This document describes
    the relationship between IETF Network Slice\n   models for requesting the IETF
    Network Slices and (e.g., Layer-3\n   Service Model, Layer-2 Service Model) and
    Network Models (e.g.,\n   Layer-3 Network Model, Layer-2 Network Model) used during
    their\n   realizations.  In addition, this document describes the communication\n
    \  between the IETF Network Slice Controller and the network controllers\n   for
    the realization of IETF network slices.\n\n   The IETF Network Slice YANG model
    provides the customer-oriented view\n   of the network slice.  Thus, once the
    IETF Network Slice controller\n   (NSC) receives a request, it needs to map it
    to accomplish the\n   specific parameters expected by the network controllers.
    \ The network\n   models are analyzed to satisfy the IETF Network Slice requirements,\n
    \  and the gaps in existing models are reported.\n\n   The document also provides
    operational and security considerations\n   when deploying network slices in Service
    Provider networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
