abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When a TLS session is resumed via an abbreviated handshake,
    the\n   knowledge of the master secret is used to implicitly mutually\n   authenticate
    the two peers.  However, an attacker can synchronize two\n   different TLS sessions,
    so that they share the same master secret,\n   breaking the resumption authentication
    property.  This specification\n   defines a TLS extension that cryptographically
    binds the resumption\n   abbreviated handshake with its original session, thus
    preventing this\n   attack.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
