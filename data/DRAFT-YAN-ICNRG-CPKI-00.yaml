abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the wide deployment of Named Data Networking (NDN), secure
    and\n   trustful content management architecture is needed in order to\n   authenticate
    the producer of the content and authorize the publisher\n   of the content.  This
    draft proposes the architecture of Content\n   Public Key Infrastructure (CPKI)
    for these motivations.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
