abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies two variants of the the two-message issuance
    protocol for Privacy Pass tokens: one that produces tokens that are privately
    verifiable, and another that produces tokens that are publicly verifiable. The
    privately verifiable issuance protocol optionally supports public metadata during
    the issuance flow.</p>"
