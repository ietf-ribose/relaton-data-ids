abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a deployment model for reconsidered validation\n
    \  [RFC8360] in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).\n\n   It stipulates
    that Relying Parties in the RPKI MUST support\n   reconsidered validation by 1
    July TBD-Year, and that Certificate\n   Authorities MAY use the reconsidered validation
    OIDs in CA\n   certificates that they issue from this date.  Furthermore Certificate\n
    \  Authorities should monitor whether the set of resources in CA\n   certificate
    they receive has shrunk, and make adjustments in the CA\n   certificates and/or
    other RPKI objects when appropriate.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
