abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) can be combined with Ethernet
    VPN\n   (EVPN) to deploy Ethernet Local Area Network (ELAN) services in large\n
    \  Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks (PBB-EVPN).  Single-\n   Active
    Multi-homing and per-ISID Load-Balancing can be provided to\n   access devices
    and aggregation networks.  In order to speed up the\n   network convergence in
    case of failures on Single-Active Multi-Homed\n   Ethernet Segments, PBB-EVPN
    defines a flush mechanism for Customer\n   MACs (CMAC-flush) that works for different
    Ethernet Segment Backbone\n   MAC (BMAC) address allocation models.  This document
    complements\n   those CMAC-flush procedures for cases in which no PBB-EVPN Ethernet\n
    \  Segments are defined (the attachment circuit is associated to a zero\n   Ethernet
    Segment Identifier) and a Service Instance Identifier based\n   (ISID-based) CMAC-flush
    granularity is required.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
