abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo discusses applicability for energy management features
    to\nvarious types of devices and buildings.  It describes the variety of\napplications
    that can use the EMAN energy framework and associated\nMIB modules.  P otential
    examples are building networks, home energy\ngateway, etc.  Finally, the document
    will also discuss relationships\nof the framework to other architectures and frameworks
    (such as\nsmartgrid).  The applicability statement will explain the\nrelationship
    between the work in this WG and the other existing\nstandards such as those from
    the IEC, ANSI, DMTF, and others.\n\t </p>\n      "
