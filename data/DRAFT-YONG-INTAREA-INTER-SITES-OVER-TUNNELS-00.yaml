abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies use of a set of IP tunnels to interconnect\n
    \  multiple network sites over IP backbone networks. The interconnected\n   network
    sites form 'virtual' private network(s). The networks at any\n   of those sites
    can be Layer 2 domains or/and Layer 3 subnets. The IP\n   backbone networks that
    the tunnels traverse through can be IPv4 or\n   IPv6. This document describes
    the special property (or features)\n   that those IP tunnels need to have in order
    to interconnect multiple\n   sites as if those sites are directly connected by
    wires.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
