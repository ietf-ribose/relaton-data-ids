abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to extend Path Computation Element
    (PCE)\n   Communication Protocol (PCEP) association mechanism introduced by the\n
    \  PCEP Association Group specification, to further associate sets of\n   LSPs
    with a higher-level structure such as a virtual network (VN)\n   requested by
    clients or applications. This extended association\n   mechanism can be used to
    facilitate virtual network control using PCE\n   architecture.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n
