abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo documents a proposal for exchanging EPP (ExtensibleProvisioning
    Protocol) messages as XML documents between a client anda server via SOAP (Simple
    Object Access Protocol), using the SOAPrequest/response communication model. An
    EPP message is encapsulatedin the SOAP Body, while the EPP session information
    is encoded in theSOAP header, enabling EPP session-oriented messaging over the
    SOAPprotocol. It is designed to work on top of any transport bindingsdefined for
    SOAP, taking advantage of the variety of SOAP softwaretools and environments available
    for web services.</p>"
