abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is now entering widespread\n
    \  deployment.  However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet\n   as
    mature and reliable as those for non-DNSSEC-related domain\n   administration
    tools and processes.  Negative Trust Anchors\n   (described in this document)
    can be used to mitigate DNSSEC\n   validation failures.\n\n   [ Editor note: This
    document was originally draft-livingood-negative-\n   trust-anchors-07 - renamved
    at the request of the DNSOP chairs ]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
