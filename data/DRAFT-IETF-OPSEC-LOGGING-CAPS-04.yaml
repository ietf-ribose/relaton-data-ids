abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document lists logging capabilities originally identified
    in\n   Operational Security Requirements for Large Internet Service Provider\n
    \  (ISP) IP Network Infrastructure [RFC3871] and needed to support\n   current
    operational practices, including those described in\n   Operational Security Current
    Practices In Internet Service Provider\n   Environments [RFC4778].  Logging is
    defined as the delivery of\n   messages about the device, the data passing through
    the device, or\n   the device's interaction with another device and has been\n
    \  traditionally provided via the syslog or SNMP protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
