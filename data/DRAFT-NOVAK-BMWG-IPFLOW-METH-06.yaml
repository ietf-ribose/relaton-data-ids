abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides methodology and framework for quantifying
    \nperformance impact of monitoring of IP flows on a network device and\nexport
    of this information to a collector. It identifies the rate at\nwhich the IP flows
    are created, expired and exported as the\nperformance metric. The metric is only
    applicable to the devices\ncompliant with the Architecture for IP Flow Information
    Export\n[RFC5470].\n\t </p>\n      "
