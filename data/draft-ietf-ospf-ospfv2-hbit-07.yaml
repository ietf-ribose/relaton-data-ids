abstract:
- content: "<p>The OSPFv2 specifies an SPF algorithm that identifies transit vertices
    based on their adjacencies. Therefore, OSPFv2 does not have a mechanism to prevent
    traffic transiting a participating node if it is a transit vertex in the only
    existing or shortest path to the destination. The use of metrics to make the node
    undesirable can only help to repel traffic if an alternative better route exists.
    This document defines the Host-bit functionality to prevent other OSPFv2 routers
    from using the router for transit traffic in OSPFv2 routing domains. This document
    updates the [RFC2328] by assigning a new bit (Host-bit) in the OSPF Router-LSA
    bit registry. If the Host- bit is set, the calculation of the shortest-path tree
    for an area, as described in [RFC2328], is modified by including a new check to
    verify that transit vertices have the Host-bit clear.</p>"
