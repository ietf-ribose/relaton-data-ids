abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Problem definition for route leaks and enumeration of types
    of route\n   leaks are provided in RFC 7908.  This document describes a solution\n
    \  for detection and mitigation route leaks which is based on conveying\n   route-leak
    protection (RLP) information in a Border Gateway Protocol\n   (BGP) community.
    \ The RLP information is carried in a new well-known\n   transitive BGP community,
    called the RLP community.  The RLP\n   community helps with detection and mitigation
    of route leaks at ASes\n   downstream from the leaking AS (in the path of the
    BGP update).  This\n   is an inter-AS (multi-hop) solution mechanism.  This solution\n
    \  complements the intra-AS (local AS) route-leak avoidance solution\n   that
    is described in ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy draft.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
