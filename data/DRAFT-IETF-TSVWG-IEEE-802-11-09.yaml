abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As internet traffic is increasingly sourced-from and destined-to\n
    \  wireless endpoints, it is crucial that Quality of Service be aligned\n   between
    wired and wireless networks; however, this is not always the\n   case by default.
    \ This document specifies a set of Differentiated\n   Services Code Point (DSCP)
    to IEEE 802.11 User Priority (UP) mappings\n   to reconcile the marking recommendations
    offered by the IETF and the\n   IEEE so as to maintain consistent QoS treatment
    between wired and\n   IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
