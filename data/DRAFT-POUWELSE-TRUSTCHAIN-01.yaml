abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Trustchain is a protocol for a networked datastructure, designed
    to\n   act as a trust ledger.  This protocol acts as a decentralized\n   alternative
    to platforms like eBay, Airbnb, and Uber.  It is\n   specifically designed to
    record transactions among strangers without\n   central control, support high
    transaction volumes, be application\n   neutral, and avoid vendor lock-in.  The
    protocol defines recording\n   transactions in an ordered list using an append-only
    datastructure, a\n   new communication overlay, and a horizontally scalable consensus\n
    \  protocol based on checkpoint consensus, called CHECO.  Trustchain has\n   resistance
    to traditional blockchain attacks, such as the 51 percent\n   majority attack.
    \ This is achieved by using a graph-based append-only\n   datastructure combined
    with a personal blockchain for each\n   participant with their own genesis block.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
