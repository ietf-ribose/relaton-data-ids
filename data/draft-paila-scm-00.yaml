abstract:
  content: "<p>Traditionally, multicast trees in the Internet are built bottom-up.The
    construction of multicast trees depends on the multicastreceivers's ability to
    inform their next hop multicast routers abouttheir multicast group memberships.
    There are cases, in which thetraditional host-driven way of building the multicast
    trees isinsufficient. To point out one, consider an access network withunidirectional
    links. In a mobile environment, this requires that thereceiving interface of a
    mobile node must also have the capabilitiesto send out MLD or IGMP responses.
    This is not possible for broadcastnetworks (e.g DVB-T and DAB), that provide high
    downstream datarates, but no uplink connectivity.This document presents Source
    Controlled Multicast as a proposalsolution to overcome the problems with unidirectional
    links. Itpresents a way to for source to control the multicast tree joiningprocess
    on behalf of mobile nodes behind unidirectional links.</p>"
