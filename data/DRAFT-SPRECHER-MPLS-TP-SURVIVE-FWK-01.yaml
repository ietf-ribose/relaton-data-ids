abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Network survivability is the network's ability to restore traffic\nfollowing
    failure or attack; it plays a critical factor in the\ndelivery of reliable services
    in transport networks. Guaranteed\nservices in the form of Service Level Agreements
    (SLAs) require a\nresilient network that detects facility or node failures very\nrapidly,
    and immediately starts to restore network operations in\naccordance with the terms
    of the SLA.\n\nThe Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP)
    is a\npacket transport technology that combines the packet experience of\nMPLS
    with the operational experience of transport networks like\nSONET/SDH. It provides
    survivability mechanisms such as protection\nand restoration, with similar function
    levels to those found in\nestablished transport networks such as in SONET/SDH
    networks. Some of\nthe MPLS-TP survivability mechanisms are data plane-driven
    and are\nbased on MPLS-TP OAM fault management functions which are used to\ntrigger
    protection switching in the absence of a control plane. Other\nsurvivability mechanisms
    utilize the MPLS-TP control plane.\n\nThis document provides a framework for MPLS-TP
    survivability.\n\t </p>\n      "
