abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Slicing is meant to enable creating (end-to-end) partitioned
    network infrastructure that may include the user equipment, access/ core transport
    networks, edge and central data center resources to provide differentiated connectivity
    behaviors to fulfill the requirements of distinct services, applications and customers.
    In this context, connectivity is not restricted to differentiated forwarding capabilities
    but it covers also advanced service functions that will be invoked when transferring
    data within a given domain. The purpose of this document is to focus on use cases
    that benefit from the use of network slicing.</p>"
