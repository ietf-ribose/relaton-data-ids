abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] defined the way of indicating resources
    on the\n   Web. This specification defines link relation types which may be used\n
    \  to express the relationships between a resource and an input form for\n   constructing
    entry submissions, or between any kind of entry and a\n   pre-populated input
    form for modifying the associated entry.\n\nEditorial Note (To be removed by RFC
    Editor)\n\n   Distribution of this document is unlimited.  Comments should be
    sent\n   to the IETF Apps-Discuss mailing list (see\n   &lt;https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/apps-discuss&gt;).\n\n\t
