abstract:
- content: "<p>Manifests are a critical cornerstone to the global Resource Public
    Key Infrastructure (RPKI). RFC 6486 describes a validation decision tree which
    introduced the notion of 'local policy', creating space for ambiguity. This ambiguity
    has led to various RPKI implementations producing different output when presented
    with the same input, but also leads to severe operational security implications.
    This document updates RFC 6486 and introduces the notion of a default policy for
    Manifest validation to encourage harmony between implementations.</p>"
