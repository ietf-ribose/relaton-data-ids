abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The developers of \"user level\" transports will benefit from
    a\n   standard implementation of authentication and encryption.  This can\n   be
    achieved using DTLS as a sub-transport.  Using DTLS enables\n   developers to
    benefit from the investment in TLS, and removes the\n   burden and the risks of
    re-creating similar technology.\n\n   There are several requirements to ensure
    that DTLS is a suitable sub-\n   transport: zero RTT setup, low overhead, and
    DOS prevention.  The IAB\n   SEMI workshop outlined other potential requirements:
    start/stop\n   indication, and ability to accept indications from the network.
    \ The\n   draft presents guidelines for meeting these requirements in a new\n
    \  version of DTLS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
