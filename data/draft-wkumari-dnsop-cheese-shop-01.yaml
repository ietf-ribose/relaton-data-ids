abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes a method to generate negative answers from
    NSEC records for the special case of the DNS root. This improves performance;
    the resolver can answer immediatly, and does not need to query the root. It also
    cuts down on the so-called "junk" queries. [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets
    ([]) is additional background information, answers to frequently asked questions,
    general musings, etc. They will be removed before publication.] [ This document
    is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-cheese-shop.
    The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available
    here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]</p>'
