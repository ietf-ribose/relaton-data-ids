abstract:
- content: <p>Formally, any DNS resource record may occur for any domain name. However
    some services have defined an operational convention, which applies to DNS leaf
    nodes that are under a DNS branch having one or more reserved node names, each
    beginning with an underscore. The underscore naming construct defines a semantic
    scope for DNS records that are associated with the parent domain, above the underscored
    branch. This specification explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines the
    "DNS Global Underscore Scoped Entry Registry" with IANA. The purpose of the Underscore
    registry is to avoid collisions resulting from the use of the same underscore-based
    name, for different services.</p>
