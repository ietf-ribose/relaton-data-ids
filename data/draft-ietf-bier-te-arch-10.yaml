abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes per-packet stateless strict and loose path steered
    replication and forwarding for Bit Index Explicit Replication packets (RFC8279).
    It is called BIER Tree Engineering (BIER-TE) and is intended to be used as the
    path steering mechanism for Traffic Engineering with BIER. BIER-TE introduces
    a new semantic for bit positions (BP) that indicate adjacencies, as opposed to
    BIER in which BPs indicate Bit- Forwarding Egress Routers (BFER). BIER-TE can
    leverage BIER forwarding engines with little changes. Co-existence of BIER and
    BIER-TE forwarding in the same domain is possible, for example by using separate
    BIER sub-domains (SDs). Except for the optional routed adjacencies, BIER-TE does
    not require a BIER routing underlay, and can therefore operate without depending
    on an Interior Gateway Routing protocol (IGP). As it operates on the same per-packet
    stateless forwarding principles, BIER-TE can also be a good fit to support multicast
    path steering in Segment Routing (SR) networks.</p>"
