abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the data model and Extensible Markup\n
    \  Language (XML) representation for the Extensible Configuration\n   Checklist
    Description Format (XCCDF) Version 1.1.4. An XCCDF\n   document is a structured
    collection of security configuration rules\n   for some set of target systems.
    The XCCDF specification is designed\n   to support information interchange, document
    generation,\n   organizational and situational tailoring, automated compliance\n
    \  testing, and compliance scoring. The specification also defines a\n   data
    model and format for storing results of security guidance or\n   checklist compliance
    testing. The intent of XCCDF is to provide a\n   uniform foundation for expression
    of security checklists and other\n   configuration guidance, and thereby foster
    more widespread\n   application of good security practices.\n\t </p>\n      "
