abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increase number of protocols and applications that rely on
    digital certificates to authenticate either the communication channel (TLS) or
    the data itself (PKIX), the need for providing an efficient revocation system
    is paramount. Although the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) [RFC6960]
    allows for efficient lookup of the revocation status of a certificate, the distribution
    of this information via HTTP or HTTPS is not particularly efficient for high volume
    websites without incurring in high distribution costs (e.g., CDN). In particular,
    this specification defines how to distribute OCSP responses over DNS and how to
    define OCSP-over-DNS URLs in certificates. The use of the DNS system to distribute
    such information is meant to lower the costs of providing revocation services
    and increase the availability of revocation information by using the distributed
    nature of the DNS infrastructure.</p>"
