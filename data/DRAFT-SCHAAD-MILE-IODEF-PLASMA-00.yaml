abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines
    a XML\n   representation for information about computer security incidents.\n
    \  The driver for the standardization effort for IODEF is the desire to\n   share
    the information as part of the cybersecurity response.  As the\n   security considerations
    of RFC5070 notes, the data can be sensitive\n   and should only be disclosed to
    appropriate parties.  This document\n   describes how to use the Plasma policy
    enforcement model to ensure\n   access to the IODEF data follows the appropriate
    policies in a\n   distributed environment and independent of the transports used
    to\n   share the information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
