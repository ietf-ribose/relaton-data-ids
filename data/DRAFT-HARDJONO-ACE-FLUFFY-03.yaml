abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a simplified key exchange protocol for
    the\n   establishment of a symmetric key shared between two devices or\n   entities
    within a constrained environment.  The pair-wise key\n   establishment is performed
    using the mediation of a trusted Simple\n   Key Distribution Center (SKDC) entity.
    \ The protocol also supports\n   the mediated distribution of a group-key among
    multiple devices or\n   entities for the purposes of protecting multicast messages.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
