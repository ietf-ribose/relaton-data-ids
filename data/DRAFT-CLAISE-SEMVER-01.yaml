abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the Internet engineering ecosystem, there is increasingly
    a need\n   for specifications that evolve over time, and which are encoded\n   directly
    in structured formats (e.g., YANG models).  Internet-Drafts\n   are a poor fit
    for working groups that want to produce structured\n   specifications, and publishing
    versions of an evolving specification\n   as RFC makes it difficult to track the
    specification over time.  This\n   document outlines recommendations for how working
    groups can provide\n   consistent, meaningful versions for specifications over
    time and work\n   directly on structured documents while still fitting within\n
    \  established IETF processes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
