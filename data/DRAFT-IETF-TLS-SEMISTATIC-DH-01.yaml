abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] specifies a signed Diffie-Hellman exchange
    modelled\n   after SIGMA [SIGMA].  This design is suitable for endpoints whose\n
    \  certified credential is a signing key, which is the common situation\n   for
    current TLS servers.  This document describes a mode of TLS 1.3\n   in which one
    or both endpoints have a certified DH key which is used\n   to authenticate the
    exchange.\n\nNote to Readers\n\n   Source for this draft and an issue tracker
    can be found at\n   https://github.com/ekr/draft-rescorla-tls13-semistatic-dh\n
