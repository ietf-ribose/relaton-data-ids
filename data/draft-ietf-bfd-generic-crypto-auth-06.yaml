abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
    (BFD) to allow the use of arbitrary cryptographic authentication algorithms in
    addition to the already-documented authentication schemes described in the base
    specification. This document adds the basic infrastructure that is required for
    supporting algorithm and key agility for BFD.</p>"
