abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We present our work on efficient scalable solutions to the hierarchical\nkey
    management and distribution problem for secure multicast sessions.\nWe take two
    rooted-tree based schemes that solve hierarchical key\nmanagement and distribution
    problem and then present ways of making\nthese schemes more efficient by reducing
    the tree center key storage\nwith an upper bound on key update communication.
    The objective of\nimproving efficiency is posed as a constrained optimization
    problem,\nwhich we further reduce to a fixed-point equation and find solutions.\nWe
    also provide a tree design algorithm, which allows the designer to\nspecify an
    upper key update communication bound and construct an\nefficient tree with minimal
    center storage while maintaining pre-\nexisting logarithmic scalability in time
    and space requirements. The\nchoice of update communication bound as a design
    factor is the recent\ndevelopment of multicast communication applications, which
    have energy\nor bandwidth as constraints, and these in turn being directly related\nto
    communication bounds.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
