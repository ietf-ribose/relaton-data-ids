abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Autonomic network infrastructure (ANI) is a generic platform
    for\n   tenant applications (i.e.  AFs).  As we will see in some examplery\n   use
    cases, AFs may not only require communication capability\n   supported from the
    infrastructure side, but also the capability the\n   infrastructure can hold and
    re-distribute information on-demand.\n   This document proposes a solution for
    information distribution in the\n   ANI.  Information distribution is categorized
    into two different\n   modes: 1) instantaneous distribution and 2) publication
    for\n   retrieval.  In the former case, the information is sent, propagated\n
    \  and disposed of after reception.  In the latter case, information\n   needs
    to be stored in the network.\n\n   The capability to distribute information is
    a basic and fundamental\n   need for an autonomous network ([RFC7575]).  This
    document describes\n   typical use cases of information distribution in ANI and
    requirements\n   to ANI, such that rich information distribution can be natively\n
    \  supported.  The document proposes extensions to the autonomic nodes\n   and
    suggests an implementation based on GRASP\n   ([I-D.ietf-anima-grasp]) extensions
    as a protocol on the wire.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
