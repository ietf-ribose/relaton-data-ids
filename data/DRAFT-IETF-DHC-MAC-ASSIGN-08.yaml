abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain environments, e.g., large scale virtualization\n
    \  deployments, new devices are created in an automated manner.  Such\n   devices
    may have their link-layer addresses assigned in an automated\n   fashion.  With
    sufficient scale, the likelihood of a collision using\n   random assignment without
    duplication detection is not acceptable.\n   Therefore an allocation mechanism
    is required.  This draft proposes\n   an extension to DHCPv6 that allows a scalable
    approach to link-layer\n   address assignments where preassigned link-layer address
    assignments\n   (such as by a manufacturer) are not possible or unnecessary.\n\n\t
