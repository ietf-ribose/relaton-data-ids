abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies protocol interfaces profiled by the
    US NSA\n   (United States National Security Agency) for NSS (National Security\n
    \  System) servers that provide public key certificates, CRLs\n   (Certificate
    Revocation Lists), and symmetric keys to NSS clients.\n   Servers that support
    these interfaces are referred to as SODP (Secure\n   Object Delivery Protocol)
    servers. The intended audience for this\n   profile comprises developers of client
    devices that will obtain key\n   management services from NSA-operated SODP servers.
    \ Interfaces\n   supported by SODP servers include: EST (Enrollment over Secure\n
    \  Transport) and its extensions as well as CMC (Certificate Management\n   over
    CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax)).\n\n   This profile applies to the capabilities,
    configuration, and\n   operation of all components of US National Security Systems
    (SP 800-\n   59). It is also appropriate for other US Government systems that\n
    \  process high-value information. It is made publicly available for use\n   by
    developers and operators of these and any other system\n   deployments.\n\n\t
