abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in\n
    \  conjunction with the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) in to provide\n   a
    variety of short-term and long-term reception statistics.  The\n   available reporting
    may include aggregate information across longer\n   periods of time as well as
    individual packet reporting.  This\n   document specifies a per-packet report
    metric capturing individual\n   packets discarded from the jitter buffer after
    successful reception.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
