abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>During migration scenarios it may be desirable to transfer the
    \n   ownership of a Label Switched Path (LSP) from the Management Plane \n   (MP)
    to the Control Plane (CP), or vice versa. If the LSP is carrying \n   traffic
    this change needs to be made \"in service,\" that is, without \n   affecting traffic.
    \n   This memo provides minor extensions to the Generalized Multi Protocol \n
    \  Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling protocol, GRSVP_TE (Generalized \n   Resource
    Reservation Protocol with Traffic Engineering Extensions), \n   to enable such
    transfer of ownership and describes the proposed \n   procedures.\n\t </p>\n      "
