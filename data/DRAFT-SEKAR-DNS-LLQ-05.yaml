abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS Long-Lived Queries (LLQ) is a protocol for extending the
    DNS\n   protocol to support change notification, thus allowing clients to\n   learn
    about changes to DNS data without polling the server.  From\n   2005 onwards,
    LLQ was implemented in Apple products including Mac OS\n   X, Bonjour for Windows,
    and AirPort wireless base stations.  In 2019,\n   the LLQ protocol was superseded
    by the IETF Standards Track RFC \"DNS\n   Push Notifications\", which builds on
    experience gained with the LLQ\n   protocol to create a superior replacement.\n\n
    \  The existing deployed LLQ protocol is documented here to give\n   background
    regarding the operational experience that informed the\n   development of DNS
    Push Notifications, and to help facilitate a\n   smooth transition from LLQ to
    DNS Push Notifications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
