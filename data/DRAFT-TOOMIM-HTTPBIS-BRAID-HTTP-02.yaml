abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Braid is a set of extensions that generalize HTTP from a state\n
    \  *transfer* protocol into a state *synchronization* protocol.  Braid\n   puts
    the power of Operational Transform and CRDTs on the web,\n   improving network
    performance and enabling natively peer-to-peer,\n   collaboratively-editable,
    offline-first web applications.\n\n   Braid is composed of four extensions to
    HTTP:\n\n\t </p>\n      "
