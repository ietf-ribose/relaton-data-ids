abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In IPv4, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) commonly provide
    IN-\n   ADDR.ARPA. information for their customers by prepopulating the zone\n
    \  with one PTR record for every available address.  This practice does\n   not
    scale in IPv6.  This document analyzes different approaches for\n   ISPs to manage
    the ip6.arpa zone for IPv6 address space assigned to\n   many customers.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
