abstract:
  content: "<p>When deploying IPv6, whether IPv6-only or dual-stack, routers areconfigured
    to send IPv6 Router Advertisements to convey informationto nodes that enable them
    to autoconfigure on the network. Thisinformation includes the implied default
    router address taken fromthe observed source address of the Router Advertisement
    (RA) message,as well as on-link prefix information. However, unintendedmisconfigurations
    by users or administrators, or possibly maliciousattacks on the network, may lead
    to bogus RAs being present, which inturn can cause operational problems for hosts
    on the network. Inthis draft we summarise the scenarios in which rogue RAs may
    beobserved and present a list of possible solutions to the problem. Wefocus on
    the unintended causes of rogue RAs in the text. The goal ofthis text is to be
    Informational, and as such to present a frameworkaround which solutions can be
    proposed and discussed.</p>"
