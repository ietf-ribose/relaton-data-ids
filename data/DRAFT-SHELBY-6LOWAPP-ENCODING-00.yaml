abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>For the resource constrained devices and networks of 6LowApp it
    is\nessential that the payload of messages are compact.  The use of XML\nto represent
    data in web applications has become almost universal.\nThe interoperability of
    6LowApp with these applications will require\nthat XML can also be carried over
    the embedded web.  This document\nintroduces and compares techniques for encoding
    or compressing XML\nfor use with 6LowApp including EXI, BXML and Fast Infoset.
    \ The\nperformance and requirements for using these encodings are analyzed\nin
    the scope of 6LowApp.  It is shown that these standard encodings\ncan represent
    XML in a compact form, with reasonable overhead, and\nrequire only Internet media
    type and content transfer encoding\nindication from the application protocol.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
