abstract:
  content: "<p>The Dynamic DNS Update Protocol assumes that the devices/applicationsperforming
    dynamic registration of the DNS records will delete therecords from the DNS database
    when the records become invalid. Initialdeployment of the devices supporting the
    Dynamic DNS Update protocol indicated that there are multiple legitimate scenarios
    when records dynamically registered in DNS are not removed from the database by
    the devices that originally registered them. This can result in a substantial
    number of stale records. This document describes a mechanism to clean up these
    stale records.</p>"
