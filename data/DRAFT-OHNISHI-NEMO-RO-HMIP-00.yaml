abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In a nested mobile network situation, the packet transfer route\nbetween
    a correspondent node(CN) and a mobile node(MN) may become\nmuch longer than in
    the simple Mobile IP case, because packets can\nreach endpoints through all of
    the home agents (HAs) to which the\nmobile routers (MRs) and the MN belong. The
    existing route\noptimization function of Mobile IPv6 cannot solve this problem,\nbecause
    while it can bypass an MN's HA, it cannot skip the MRs' HAs.\nFurthermore, there
    is no route optimization method for communication\nnodes without Mobile IPv6 functionality,
    which are the so-called\nlocal fixed nodes (LFNs) within a mobile network. This
    draft provides\nsolutions to achieve route optimization in these situations by
    using\nHMIP technology and proxy Mobile IP functions.\n\t </p>\n      "
