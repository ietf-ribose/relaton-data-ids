abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The  Point-to-Point  Protocol  (PPP) [RFC1661] provides  a  standard\nmethod
    for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point\nlinks.   PPP also
    \ defines  an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP),\nwhich can be used to negotiate
    authentication methods, as  well  as  an\nEncryption Control  Protocol  (ECP)
    [RFC1968],  used  to negotiate data\nencryption over PPP links, and a Compression
    Control Protocol  (CCP)\n[RFC1962],  used  to  negotiate compression  methods.
    \ The Extensible\nAuthentication Protocol (EAP) [EAP] is a PPP extension that
    provides\nsupport  for  additional  authentication methods within PPP.\n \nThe
    Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol [ISAKMP]\ncombined with
    the Oakley [Oakley] key exchange protocol enables secure,\nmutually authenticated
    security association exchanges between two\nendpoints.  This document describes
    how ISAKMP provides for these\nmechanisms within EAP.\n\t </p>\n      "
