abstract:
- content: <p>RC4 is extremely weak as shown by RFC 6649 and RFC 7457, is prohibited
    in TLS by RFC 7465, is prohibited in Kerberos by RFC xxxx and it needs to be prohibited
    in all IETF protocols. This document obsoletes RFC 4345 "Improved Arcfour Modes
    for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol" (note Arcfour and RC4 are
    synonymous). RFC 3501, RFC 4253, RFC 6649 and RFC 6733 are updated to note the
    deprecation of RC4 in all IETF protocols.</p>
