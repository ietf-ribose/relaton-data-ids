abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft presents extensions to Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP)\nto    enable RESTful Real-time Live Streaming for improving the Quality
    of Experience\n   (QoE) for delay-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
    The overall\n   architecture is termed ''Adaptive RESTful Real-time Live Streaming
    for Things\n(A-    REaLiST)''. It is particularly designed for applications which
    rely on\nreal-time    augmented vision through live First Person View (FPV) feed
    from constrained\nremote    agents like Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), etc. These
    extensions provide\nthe    necessary hooks to help solution designers ensure low-latency
    transfer of\nstreams    and, for contents like video, a quick recovery from freeze
    and corruption\nwithout    incurring undue lag. A-REaLiST is an attempt to provide
    an integrated approach\nto    maintain the balance amongst QoE, resource-efficiency
    and loss resilience.\nIt    provides the necessary hooks to optimize system performance
    by leveraging\n   contextual intelligence inferred from instantaneous information
    segments\nin    flight. These extensions equip CoAP with a standard for efficient
    RESTful\n   streaming for Internet of Things (IoT) contrary to HTTP-streaming
    in conventional\n   Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
