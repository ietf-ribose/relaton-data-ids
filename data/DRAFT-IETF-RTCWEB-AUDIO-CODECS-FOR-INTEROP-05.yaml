abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To ensure a baseline level of interoperability between WebRTC\n
    \  endpoints, a minimum set of required codecs is specified.  However,\n   to
    maximize the possibility to establish the session without the need\n   for audio
    transcoding, it is also recommended to include in the offer\n   other suitable
    audio codecs that are available to the browser.\n\n   This document provides some
    guidelines on the suitable codecs to be\n   considered for WebRTC endpoints to
    address the most relevant\n   interoperability use cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
