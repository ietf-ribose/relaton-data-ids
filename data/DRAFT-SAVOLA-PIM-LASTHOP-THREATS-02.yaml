abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>An analysis of security threats has been done for some parts of
    the\n   multicast infrastructure, but the threats specific to the last-hop\n   (\"Local
    Area Network\") attacks by hosts on the PIM routing protocol\n   have not been
    well described in the past.  This memo aims to fill\n   that gap.\n\t </p>\n      "
