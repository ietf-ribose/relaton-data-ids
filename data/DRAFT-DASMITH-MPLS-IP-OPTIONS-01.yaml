abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document imposes a new requirement on Label Edge Routers
    (LER)\nspecifying that when determining whether to MPLS encapsulate an IP\npacket,
    the determination is made independent of any IP options that\nmay be carried in
    the IP packet header.  Lack of a formal standard\nmay result in a different forwarding
    behavior for different IP\npackets associated with the same prefix-based Forwarding
    Equivalence\nClass (FEC).  While an IP packet with either a specific option type\nor
    no header option may follow the MPLS label switched path (LSP)\nassociated with
    a prefix-based FEC, an IP packet with a different\noption type but associated
    with the same prefix-based FEC may bypass\nMPLS encapsulation and instead be IP
    routed downstream.  IP option\npackets that fail to be MPLS encapsulated simply
    due to their header\noptions present a security risk against the MPLS infrastructure.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
