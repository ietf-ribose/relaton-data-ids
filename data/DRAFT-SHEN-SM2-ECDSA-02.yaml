abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discribles a set of public key cryptographic
    algorithms\n   based on elliptic curves which is invented by Xiaoyun Wang et al.\n
    \  These algorithms and recommended parameters are published by Chinese\n   Commercial
    Cryptography Administration Office ([SM2 Algorithms] and\n   [SM2 Algorithms Parameters])
    for the use of electronic authentication\n   service system.  This document gives
    IETF standard description of the\n   algorithms and parameters in [SM2 Algorithms]
    and [SM2 Algorithms\n   Parameters].\n\n   The document [SM2 Algorithms] published
    by Chinese Commercial\n   Cryptography Administration Office includes four parts:
    general\n   introdocution, Digital Signature Algorithm, Key Exchange Protocol
    and\n   Public Key Encryption Algorithm.\n\n   The document [SM2 Algorithms Parameters]
    gives a set of recommended\n   parameters.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
