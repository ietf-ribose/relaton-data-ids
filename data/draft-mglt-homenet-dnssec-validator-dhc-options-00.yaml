abstract:
- content: "<p>DNSSEC provides data integrity and authentication for DNSSEC validators.
    However, without valid trust anchor(s) and an acceptable value for the current
    time. DNSSEC validation cannot be performed. This leads to multiple exceptions
    where DNSSEC validation MUST NOT be performed. This list of exception is expected
    to become larger if DNSSEC is deployed this way. All conditions where DNSSEC is
    disable adds complexity to the implementation and increases the vectors that disables
    security. This document assumes that DNSSEC adoption by end devices requires that
    end devices can have DNSSEC always set today and in the future. This document
    describes DHCP Options to provision the DHCP Client with valid trust anchors and
    time so DNSSEC validation can be performed.</p>"
