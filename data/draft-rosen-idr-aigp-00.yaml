abstract:
  content: <p>Routing protocols that have been designed to run within a singleadministrative
    domain ("IGPs") generally do so by assigning a metricto each link, and then choosing
    as the installed path between twonodes the path for which the total distance (sum
    of the metric ofeach link along the path) is minimized. BGP, designed to providerouting
    over a large number of independent administrative domains("autonomous systems"),
    does not make its path selection decisionsthrough the use of a metric. It is generally
    recognized that anyattempt to do so would incur significant scalability problems,
    aswell as inter-administration coordination problems. However, thereare deployments
    in which a single administration runs severalcontiguous BGP networks. In such
    cases, it can be desirable, withinthat single administrative domain, for BGP to
    select paths based on ametric, just as an IGP would do. The purpose of this document
    is toprovide a specification for doing so.</p>
