abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the DIAMETER Dial-up User AuthenticationExtension
    that is used for ROAMOPS [4] purposes. This specificationwas carefully designed
    to ease the burden of servers that must act asRADIUS/DIAMETER gateways, by re-using
    the same address space thatRADIUS has defined [1]. Further, by re-using the same
    address space,it allows a single server to read the same dictiionary for bothDIAMETER
    and RADIUS. This backward compatibility will hopefullyfacilitate deployment of
    DIAMETER.</p>"
