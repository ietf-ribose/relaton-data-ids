abstract:
- content: "<p>[Editor's note - there was a comment that synonymous was not the right
    term because synonymous implied a greater degree of interchangeability than is
    actually the case (there is only one way interchangeability). I have looked for
    other terms, and so far I have only come up with enhanced and multi-purpose, but
    they are not quite right either. I plan to continue with the term unless anyone
    has a better idea.] This document describes a method of providing flow identification
    information when making RFC6374 performance measurements. This allows RFC6374
    measurements to be made on multi-point to point LSPs and allows the measurement
    of flows within an MPLS construct using RFC6374.</p>"
