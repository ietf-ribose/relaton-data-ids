abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Homenet Naming authority is responsible for making devices
    within\n   the home network accessible by name within the home network as well\n
    \  as from outside the home network (e.g. the Internet).  The names of\n   the
    devices accessible from the Internet are stored in the Public\n   Homenet Zone,
    served by a DNS authoritative server.  It is unlikely\n   that home networks will
    contain sufficiently robust platforms\n   designed to host a service such as the
    DNS on the Internet and as\n   such would expose the home network to DDoS attacks.\n\n
    \  This document describes a mechanism that enables the Home Network\n   Authority
    (HNA) to outsource the naming service to the Outsourcing\n   Infrastructure via
    a Distribution Master (DM).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
