abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF working group on Source Address Validation Improvements,\n
    \  SAVI, is chartered to design methods for IP source address validation\n   that
    complement ingress filtering with finer-grained protection.\n   This document
    summarizes the discussion in the SAVI working group and\n   design-related conclusions.
    \ The purpose of this is two-fold:  First,\n   to guide the design process in
    the working group with written\n   documentation of decisions and their rationale.
    \ Second, to provide a\n   measure for assessing the IP source address validation
    methods that\n   the working group will eventually deliver.\n\t </p>\n      "
