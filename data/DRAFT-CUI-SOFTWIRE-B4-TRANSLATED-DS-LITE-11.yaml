abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DS-Lite [RFC6333] describes an architecture for transporting
    IPv4\n   packets over an IPv6 network.  This document specifies an extension\n
    \  to DS-Lite called Lightweight 4over6 which moves the Network Address\n   Translation
    function from the DS-Lite AFTR to the B4, removing the\n   requirement for a Carrier
    Grade NAT function in the AFTR.  This\n   reduces the amount of centralized state
    that must be held to a per-\n   subscriber level.  In order to delegate the NAPT
    function and make\n   IPv4 Address sharing possible, port-restricted IPv4 addresses
    are\n   allocated to the B4s.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
