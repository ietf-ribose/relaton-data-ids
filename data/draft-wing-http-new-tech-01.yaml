abstract:
  content: <p>People like their computers to work quickly. During the transitionto
    new technology, both old and new technologies have to peacefullyco-exist. However,
    if users experience connection delays attributedto the new technology the new
    technology will be shunned.HTTP ("The Web") is one of the most visible and time-criticalapplications
    that is used by nearly every Internet user. It iscritical that new technologies
    which improve HTTP not impair or delaythe display of HTTP content. It is also
    important that users retainthe ability to share URIs amongst friends and colleagues,
    even if theother users have not upgraded to the new technology.This draft makes
    several recommendations to ensure user satisfactionand a smooth transition from
    HTTP's pervasive IPv4 to IPv6 and fromTCP to SCTP.The audience for this draft
    is application developers and contentproviders. This draft is discussed on the
    Applications Discussmailing list, https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/apps-discuss.</p>
