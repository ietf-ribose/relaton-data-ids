abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is toprovide
    guidance to applications, which have to select one or severalhosts from a set
    of candidates that are able to provide a desiredresource. Entities seeking guidance
    need to discover and possiblyselect an ALTO server to ask.This document proposes
    an ALTO-based scheme to select an ALTO serverthat can give guidance to a given
    ALTO client. Unlike some otherproposed ALTO discovery mechanisms, this solution
    works well if theclient seeks guidance from a set of ALTO servers that are operated
    byan entity which is not the operator of the access network.</p>"
