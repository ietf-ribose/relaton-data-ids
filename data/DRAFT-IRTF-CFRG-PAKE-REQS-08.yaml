abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Password-Authenticated Key Agreement (PAKE) schemes are interactive
    protocols that allow the participants to authenticate each other and derive shared
    cryptographic keys using a (weaker) shared password.  This document reviews different
    types of PAKE schemes.  Furthermore, it presents requirements and gives recommendations
    to designers of new schemes.  It is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group
    (CFRG).\n\t </p>\n      "
