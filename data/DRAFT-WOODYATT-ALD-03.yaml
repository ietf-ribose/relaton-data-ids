abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the protocol used by IPv6 nodes comprising\nstateful
    packet filters to discover the transport addresses of\nlistening applications
    (that is, application endpoints for which\nincoming traffic may be administratively
    prohibited).\n\nComments are solicited and should be sent to the author and the
    V6OPS\nResidential CPE Design Team mailing list at\n&lt;v6ops-residential-cpe-design-team@external.cisco.com&gt;.\n\t
