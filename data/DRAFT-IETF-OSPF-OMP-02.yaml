abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  OSPF may form multiple equal cost paths between points.  This
    is true\n  of any link state protocol.  In the absense of any explicit support\n
    \ to take advantage of this, a path may be chosen arbitrarily.  Tech-\n  niques
    have been utilized to divide traffic somewhat evenly among the\n  available paths.
    \ These techniques have been referred to as Equal Cost\n  Multipath (ECMP). An
    unequal division of traffic among the available\n  paths is generally preferable.
    \ Routers generally have no knowledge\n  of traffic loading on distant links and
    therefore have no basis to\n  optimize the allocation of traffic.\n  Optimized
    Mulitpath is a compatible extension to OSPF, utilizing the\n  Opaque LSA to distribute
    loading information, proposing a means to\n  adjust forwarding, and providing
    an algorithm to make the adjustments\n  gradually enough to insure stability yet
    provide reasonably fast ad-\n  justment when needed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
