abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network operators are facing the challenge of providing better\n
    \  network services for users.  As the ever developing 5G and industrial\n   verticals
    evolve, more and more services that have diverse network\n   requirements such
    as ultra-low latency and high reliability are\n   emerging, and therefore differentiated
    service treatment is desired\n   by users.  However, network operators are typically
    unaware of which\n   applications are traversing their network infrastructure,
    which means\n   that only coarse-grained services can be provided to users.  As
    a\n   result, network operators are only evolving their infrastructure to\n   be
    large but dumb pipes without corresponding revenue increases that\n   might be
    enabled by differentiated service treatment.  As network\n   technologies evolve
    including deployments of IPv6, SRv6, Segment\n   Routing over MPLS dataplane,
    the programmability provided by IPv6 and\n   Segment Routing can be augmented
    by conveying application related\n   information into the network.  Adding application
    knowledge to the\n   network layer allows applications to specify finer granularity\n
    \  requirements to the network operator.\n\n   This document analyzes the existing
    problems caused by lack of\n   application awareness, and outlines various use
    cases that could\n   benefit from an Application-aware Networking (APN) architecture.\n\n\n\t
