abstract:
- content: "<p>The Widely Hosted Object Data Protocol (WhoDP) exists to communicate
    the current location and state of large numbers of dynamic, relocatable objects.
    Initially and most commonly, these objects are people, and the groupings or spaces
    that people use to enable communication. Loosely patterned after HTTP, WhoDP implements
    a publish-and- subscribe model, with objects' location and identity specified
    via URLs. A WhoDP program ''subscribes'' to locate and receive information about
    an object; a WhoDP program ''publishes'' to control the location and visible state
    of an object.</p>"
