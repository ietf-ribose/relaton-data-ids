abstract:
- content: "<p>Existing security mechanisms for the Protocol Independent Multicast
    - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) routing protocol mandates to use IPsec to provide message
    authenticity and integrity. This draft proposes an embedded authentication mechanism
    to facilitate data origin authentication and integrity verification for PIM packets
    in the cases where IPsec is not applied.</p>"
