abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework and mapping of slices in 5G mobile
    systems to transport network slices in IP, Layer 2 or Layer 1 transport networks.
    Slices in 5G systems are characterized by latency bounds, reservation guarantees,
    jitter, data rates, availability, mobility speed, usage density, criticality and
    priority. These characteristics are mapped to transport network slice include
    bandwidth, latency and criteria such as isolation, directionality and disjoint
    routes. Mobile slice criteria are mapped to the appropriate transport slice and
    capabilities offered in backhaul, midhaul and fronthaul connectivity segments
    between radio side network functions and user plane function(gateway). This document
    describes how a mobile network slice is mapped to a slice in IP or Layer 2 transport
    network between 3GPP provisioning end points. The same mapping mechanisms apply
    during initial UE session setup and following UE mobility. Applicability of this
    framework and underlying transport networks, which can enable different slice
    properties are also discussed. This is based on mapping between mobile and transport
    underlays (L2, Segment Routing, IPv6, MPLS and IPv4).</p>"
