abstract:
  content: "\t <t>When a mobile node moves between two foreign networks it has to
    bereauthenticated. If the home network has multiple AAA servers thereauthentication
    request may not be received by the same AAAH asprevious authentication requests.In
    order for the new AAAH to be able to forward the request to thecorrect HA it has
    to know the identity of the HA. This documentdefines an extension that enables
    the HA to pass its identity to themobile node which can in turn pass it to the
    AAA server when changingpoint of attachment. This document specifies a NAI extension
    thatcan carry these NAIs.</p>"
