abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Various protocols are deployed in today's networks, such as
    BGP /\n   ISIS / OSPF etc.  Link neighbor state changes and protocol neighbor\n
    \  state changes are the most important network events that need to be\n   processed
    with the highest priority.  In particular, the SDN\n   controller needs to quickly
    sense the link neighbor &amp; protocol\n   neighbor state change information in
    the network.  Thus, the various\n   policies applied by the SDN controller to
    the network can quickly\n   match the current state of the network.  This document
    discusses some\n   possible scenarios and the relevant requirements.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
