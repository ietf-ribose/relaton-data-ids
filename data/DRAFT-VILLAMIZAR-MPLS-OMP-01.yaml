abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  MPLS ingress routers may establish one or more explicit paths
    to a\n  given egress to the MPLS domain.  Load can be balanced across a com-\n
    \ plex topology using MPLS and the technique referred to here as MPLS--\n  OMP
    (Multiprotocol Label Switching -- Optimized Multipath).  The tech-\n  nique requires
    the use of a link state interior gateway protocol (IGP)\n  such as OSPF or IS--IS
    with extensions to the link state protocol to\n  flood loading information.  It
    requires the ingress router be capa-\n  ble of computing a hash with a sufficiently
    fine level of granularity\n  based on the IP source and destination and selecting
    a forwarding\n  entry based on the outcome of the hash.\n \n  MPLS Optimized Mulitpath
    is an extension to MPLS. MPLS-OMP requires\n  no additions or modification to
    the MPLS protocols.  MPLS-OMP does\n  require that the IGP be capable of flooding
    loading information as\n  described in the OSPF-OMP and ISIS-OMP documents.  At
    the MPLS ingress\n  an algorithm is applied to select alternate paths where needed
    and\n  adjust forwarding.  Forwarding is adjusted gradually enough to insure\n
    \ stability yet fast enough to track long term changes in loading.  The\n  load
    adjustment algorithm itself is fully defined in a related docu-\n  ment describing
    OSPF--OMP. The application of this technique to MPLS\n  is described here.\n\n\t
