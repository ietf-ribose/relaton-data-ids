abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft proposes a modification todraft-lawrence-dispatch-sipforum-provider-alias
    (PAN). The PAN draftproposes a mechanism for a phone to take a short numeric identifierthat
    identifies a phone service provider and look it up in DNS tofind the address of
    the configuration server for that serviceprovider.The problem with PAN is that
    it requires a specific organization,sipforum.org, to become a registrar for the
    PAN. This will addsignifiant cost to obtaining them as the expected quantity of
    PAN islow. This draft proposes a minor modification to the PAN draft.Instead of
    using the sipforum as a new registrar, why not just usethe registrars that already
    exist for DNS names. This ensure a longterm stable unique allocation of PAN with
    the advantages of nothaving the IETF allocating a monopoly to one particular organization.</p>"
