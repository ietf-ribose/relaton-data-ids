abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a modification to draft-lawrence-dispatch-sipforum-provider-alias
    (PAN). The PAN draft proposes a mechanism for a phone to take a short numeric
    identifier that identifies a phone service provider and look it up in DNS to find
    the address of the configuration server for that service provider. The problem
    with PAN is that it requires a specific organization, sipforum.org, to become
    a registrar for the PAN. This will add signifiant cost to obtaining them as the
    expected quantity of PAN is low. This draft proposes a minor modification to the
    PAN draft. Instead of using the sipforum as a new registrar, why not just use
    the registrars that already exist for DNS names. This ensure a long term stable
    unique allocation of PAN with the advantages of not having the IETF allocating
    a monopoly to one particular organization.</p>"
