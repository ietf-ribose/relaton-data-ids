abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new DNS Resource Record called \"BNAME\",
    which\n   provides the capability to map itself and its subtree of the DNS name\n
    \  space to another domain.  It differs from the CNAME record which only\n   maps
    a single node of the DNS name space, from the DNAME which only\n   maps the subtree
    of the DNS name space to another domain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
