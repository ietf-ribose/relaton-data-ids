abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines terminology and requirements for Drone
    Remote\n   Identification Protocol (DRIP) Working Group solutions to support\n
    \  Unmanned Aircraft System Remote Identification and tracking (UAS RID)\n   for
    security, safety, and other purposes (e.g., initiation of\n   identity based network
    sessions supporting UAS applications).  DRIP\n   will facilitate use of existing
    Internet resources to support RID and\n   to enable enhanced related services,
    and will enable online and\n   offline verification that RID information is trustworthy.\n\n\t
