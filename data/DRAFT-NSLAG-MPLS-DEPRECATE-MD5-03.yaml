abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When the MPLS Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) was specified
    circa\n   1999, there were very strong requirements that LDP should use a\n   cryptographic
    hash function to sign LDP protocol messages.  MD5 was\n   widely used at that
    time, and was the obvious choices.\n\n   However, even when this decision was
    being taken there were concerns\n   as to whether MD5 was a strong enough signing
    option.  This\n   discussion was briefly reflected in section 5.1 of RFC 5036
    [RFC5036]\n   (and also in RFC 3036 [RFC3036]).\n\n   Over time it has been shown
    that MD5 can be compromised.  Thus, there\n   is a concern shared in the security
    community and the working groups\n   responsible for the development of the LDP
    protocol that LDP is no\n   longer adequately secured.\n\n   This document deprecates
    MD5 as the signing method for LDP messages.\n   The document also selects a future
    method to secure LDP messages -\n   the choice is TCP-AO.  In addition, we specify
    that the TBD\n   cryptographic mechanism is to be the default TCP-AO security
    method.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
