abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>NFSv4 [RFC3530] contains within it a mechanism for the delegation
    of\nfile data to a client.  The intent of this feature is to reduce the\nnecessary
    interaction between a client and server such that overall\nperformance is improved.
    \ The same type of mechanism does not exist\nfor directory contents and to determine
    validity of cached directory\ncontents an NFSv4 client is left with polling the
    server to determine\nif updates have occurred.\nThe proposal described here is
    for an NFSv4 minor version that would\nallow a client to register interest in
    a directory and to receive a\ncallback RPC upon update of that directory.  This
    type of interaction\nwould reduce or eliminate the polling that occurs between
    client and\nserver and improve scalability of the server's resources along with\nimproved
    performance for the client's directory content caching.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
