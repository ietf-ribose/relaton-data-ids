abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IP is good at addressing IP session continuity (hide of
    the IP \naddress change from transport layer perspective, as well as from the
    \ncorrespondent perspective) but certainly not optimal for mobility \nmanagement
    as would perform 3GPP systems providers that want to \nextend their services to
    IP access systems. This document only \ndescribes the problem and is not meant
    to provide any solution nor \nany requirement thereof. \n\t </p>\n      "
