abstract:
- content: "<p>The ALTO base protocol [RFC7285] uses HTTP/1.x as the transport protocol
    and hence ALTO transport includes the limitations of HTTP/1.x. ALTO/SSE [RFC8895]
    addresses some of the limitations, but is still based on HTTP/1.x. This document
    introduces ALTO new transport, which provides the transport functions of ALTO/SSE
    on top of HTTP/2, for more efficient ALTO transport.</p>"
