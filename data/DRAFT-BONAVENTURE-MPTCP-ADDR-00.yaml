abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath TCP [RFC6824] defines the ADD_ADDR option to allow
    a host\n   to announce its addresses to the remote host.  In this document we\n
    \  analyze some of the issues with the address advertisement technique\n   defined
    [RFC6824] and propose some modifications to mitigate these\n   problems.  We also
    show that the reverse DNS could be an excellent\n   alternative to advertise the
    stable addresses of a server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
