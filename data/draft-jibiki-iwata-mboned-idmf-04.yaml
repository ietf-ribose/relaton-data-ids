abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft proposes a new inter-domain multicast forwarding (IDMF)mechanism
    for PIM-SM multicast routing protocol. Although there havebeen various inter-domain
    multicast routing and forwarding protocols,they still have a limitation for handling
    policy routing, QoSrouting, accounting and security, which network administrators
    arewilling to use in their network. In order to solve this limitation,we propose
    a novel approach to create an inter-domain multicastforwarding tree (or routing
    table) among multiple PIM-SM domains withlogical unicast paths over which multicast
    packets are forwarded orflooded. The logical unicast paths are created by either
    IP-in-IPtunneling method , IP masquerade-like method, and MPLS label switchedpath
    (LSP) method, which can easily reuse policy routing and QoSrouting for unicast
    routing. These logical unicast paths areestablished among IDMF capable nodes or
    proxies, which are locatedwithin each PIM-SM domain, either manually or by a dynamic
    IDMP treeconstruction protocol. The IDMP capable nodes can also behave a proxysender
    of multicast packets. It can prevent a multicast receiver fromchanging a RP-tree
    into a global SP-tree, and also can help to reducevirtually the number of multicast
    sources for a particular multicastgroup. This property can be effectively used
    for accounting, securityand scalability enhancement required for interdomain communication.The
    proposed mechanism is a general framework for inter-domainmulticast forwarding
    and can be also used as a MSDP based forwardingmechanism.</p>"
