abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses the traditional model of security where endpoints
    in the network are protected by a variety of tools. It proposes a model for endpoints
    and then argues that the older, traditional approach is no longer sufficient for
    operational security at the endpoint. A series of operational examples are discussed
    in an Appendix.</p>"
