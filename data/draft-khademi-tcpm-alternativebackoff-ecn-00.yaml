abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo updates the TCP sender-side reaction to a congestion notification
    received via Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). The updated method reduces
    FlightSize in Congestion Avoidance by a smaller amount than the TCP reaction to
    loss. The intention is to achieve good throughput when the queue at the bottleneck
    is smaller than the bandwidth-delay-product of the connection. This is more likely
    when an Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism has used ECN to CE-mark a packet,
    than when a packet was lost. Future versions of this document will also describe
    a corresponding method for SCTP.</p>"
