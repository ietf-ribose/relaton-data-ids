abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify
    an\n   interface on a network device.  Routing protocols were developed\n   based
    on the assumption that a destination address had this semantic.\n\n   Over time,
    routing decisions were enhanced to route packets according\n   to additional information
    carried within the packets and dependent on\n   policy coded in, configured at,
    or signaled to the routers.\n\n   Many proposals have been made to add semantics
    to IP addresses.  The\n   intent is usually to facilitate routing decisions based
    solely on the\n   address and without the need to find and process information
    carried\n   in other fields within the packets.\n\n   This document describes
    the challenges to the existing routing system\n   that are introduced by the addition
    of semantics to IP addresses.  It\n   then summarizes the opportunities for research
    into new or modified\n   routing protocols to make use of new address semantics.\n\n
    \  This document is presented as study to support further research into\n   clarifying
    and understanding the issues.  It does not pass comment on\n   the advisability
    or practicality of any of the proposals and does not\n   define any technical
    solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
