abstract:
- content: "<p>This describes an experimental policy for use of the class D address
    space using 233/8 as the experimental statically assigned subset of the class
    D address space. This new experimental allocation is in addition to those described
    on [IANA] (e.g. [RFC2365]). This memo is a product of the Multicast Deployment
    Working Group (MBONED) in the Operations and Management Area of the Internet Engineering
    Task Force. Submit comments to &lt;mboned@ns.uoregon.edu&gt; or the authors.</p>"
