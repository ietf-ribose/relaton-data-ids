abstract:
  content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism thatallows
    a client to request that a particular protocol extension beused to process the
    request. The server declines the request if itdoes not support the extension.
    However, there is currently no wayfor a server to determine which extensions are
    supported by theclient. Knowing about client-supported extensions allows the serverto
    tailor its response accordingly. Furthermore, SIP does not definea way for a client
    to query a server about the extensions itsupports. This document defines a SIP
    extension that allows clientsto indicate, in a request, the set of extensions
    supported. We alsodefine a mechanism that allows clients, through an OPTIONS request,to
    determine the extensions supported by a server.</p>"
