abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo instructs IANA to restructure its IPv4 and IPv6 Special-
    Purpose Address Registries. Upon restructuring, the aforementioned registries
    will record all special-purpose address blocks, maintaining a common set of information
    regarding each address block. This memo updates RFC 5736 and RFC 4773, which define
    the current structure of the IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registries.
    It also obsoletes RFC 5735 and RFC 5156 which document special- purpose address
    blocks that are not currently, but will in the future, be recorded in the IPv4
    and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registries.</p>"
