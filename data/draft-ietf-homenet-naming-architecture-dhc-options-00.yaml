abstract:
- content: "<p>CPEs are usually constraint devices with reduced network and CPU capacities.
    As such, a CPE hosting on the Internet the authoritative naming service for its
    home network may become vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks. One way to
    avoid exposing CPE is to outsource the authoritative service to a third party.
    This third party can be the ISP or any other independent third party. Outsourcing
    the authoritative naming service to a third party requires setting up an architecture
    which may be unappropriated for most end users. To leverage this issue, this document
    proposes DHCP Options so any agnostic CPE can automatically proceed to the appropriated
    configuration and outsource the authoritative naming service for the home network.
    This document shows that in most cases, these DHCP Options make outsourcing to
    a third party (be it the ISP or any ISP independent service provider) transparent
    for the end user.</p>"
