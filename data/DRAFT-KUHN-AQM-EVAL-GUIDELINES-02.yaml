abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Unmanaged large buffers in today's networks have given rise
    to a slew\n   of performance issues.  These performance issues can be addressed
    by\n   some form of Active Queue Management (AQM), optionally in combination\n
    \  with a packet scheduling scheme such as fair queuing.  The IETF AQM\n   and
    packet scheduling working group was formed to standardize AQM\n   schemes that
    are robust, easily implemented, and successfully\n   deployed in today's networks.
    \ This document describes various\n   criteria for performing precautionary characterizations
    of AQM\n   proposals.  This document also helps in ascertaining whether any\n
    \  given AQM proposal should be taken up for standardization by the AQM\n   WG.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
