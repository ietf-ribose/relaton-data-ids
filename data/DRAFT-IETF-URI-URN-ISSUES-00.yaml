abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A number of schemes have been proposed over the past year or so
    for assigning and resolving Uniform Resource Names (URNs) and for associating
    meta-information with URNs.  The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Working Group
    is currently faced with the task of evaluating these schemes.  The schemes all
    claim to satisfy the functional requirements for URNs stated in RFC 1737.  A number
    of additional issues that will be helpful to consider for purposes of evaluation
    are listed and discussed in this draft.  Although this draft is long on questions
    and short on answers, it attempts to distill the issues on which consensus (even
    if it's agreement to disagree) needs to be reached before progress on standardization
    can be made.\n\t </p>\n      "
