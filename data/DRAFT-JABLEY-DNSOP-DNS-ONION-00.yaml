abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Domain Name System (DNS) has no inherent capability to
    protect\n   the privacy of end users.  The data associated with DNS queries and\n
    \  responses can be observed by intermediate systems, and such\n   observations
    could provide a source of metadata relating to end user\n   behaviour.\n\n   This
    document describes an approach which separates the data in DNS\n   queries and
    responses from the identity of the DNS resolver used by\n   DNS clients.\n\n   This
    approach does not address privacy concerns between a stub\n   resolver and a recursive
    resolver.\n\n   This approach imposes no requirement for modification of authority\n
    \  servers, and does not depend upon widespread deployment of DNSSEC\n   signing
    or validation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
