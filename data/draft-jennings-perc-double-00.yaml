abstract:
  content: <p>In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary
    to be able to manipulate some RTP parameters, while still providing strong end-to-end
    security guarantees. This document defines a SRTP procedures that uses two separate
    but related cryptographic contexts to provide "hop by hop" and "end to end" security
    guarantees. Both the end-to-end and hop-by-hop cryptographic transforms can utilizes
    an authenticated encryption with associated data scheme or take advantage of future
    SRTP transforms with different properties. SRTCP is encrypted hop-by-hop using
    an already-defined SRTCP cryptographic transform.</p>
