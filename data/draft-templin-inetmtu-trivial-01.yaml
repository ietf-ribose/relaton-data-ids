abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The nominal Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the Internet hasbecome
    1500 bytes, but existing IP/*/IP tunneling mechanisms imposean encapsulation overhead
    that can reduce the effective path MTU tosmaller values. Additionally, existing
    tunneling mechanisms arelimited in their ability to discover and utilize larger
    MTUs. Thisdocument specifies a trivial mechanism for tunnel MTU determinationthat
    addresses these issues.1. IntroductionThe nominal Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
    of today's Internet hasbecome 1500 bytes due to the preponderance of networking
    gear thatconfigures an MTU of that size. Since not all links in the Internetconfigure
    a 1500 byte MTU, however, packets can be dropped due to anMTU restriction on the
    path.Upper layers see IP/*/IP tunnels as ordinary links, but even forpackets no
    larger than 1500 bytes these links are susceptible tosilent loss (e.g., due to
    path MTU restrictions, lost error messages,layered encapsulations, reassembly
    buffer limitations, etc.)resulting in poor performance and/or communications failures[RFC2923][RFC4459][RFC4821][RFC4963].This
    document specifies a trivial mechanism for IP/*/IP tunnel MTUdetermination. It
    updates the functional specifications for TunnelEndpoints (TEs) found in existing
    tunneling mechanisms (see:Section 9).</p>"
