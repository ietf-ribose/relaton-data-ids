abstract:
- content: "<p>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
    operational and telemetry information in the data packet while the packet traverses
    a path between two nodes in the network. This document defines how IOAM data fields
    are transported with MPLS data plane encapsulation using new Generic Associated
    Channel (G-ACh).</p>"
