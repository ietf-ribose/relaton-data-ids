abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This paper extends Shanon's concept of a 'work factor' to provide
    an\n   objective measure of the practical security offered by a protocol or\n
    \  infrastructure design. Considering the hypothetical work factor based\n   on
    an informed estimate of the probable capabilities of an attacker\n   with unknown
    resources provides a better indication of the relative\n   strength of protocol
    designs than the computational work factor of\n   the best known attack.\n\n   The
    social work factor is a measure of the trustworthiness of a\n   credential issued
    in a PKI based on the cost of having obtained the\n   credential through fraud
    at a certain point in time. Use of the\n   social work factor allows evaluation
    of Certificate Authority based\n   trust models, peer to peer (Web of Trust) models
    to be evaluated in\n   the same framework. The analysis shows that each model
    has clear\n   benefits over the other for some classes of user but most classes
    of\n   user are served better by a combination of both.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
