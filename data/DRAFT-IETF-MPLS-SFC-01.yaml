abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service Function Chaining (SFC) is the process of directing
    packets\n   through a network so that they can be acted on by an ordered set of\n
    \  abstract service functions before being delivered to the intended\n   destination.
    \ An architecture for SFC is defined in RFC7665.\n\n   The Network Service Header
    (NSH) can be inserted into packets to\n   steer them along a specific path to
    realize a Service Function Chain.\n\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is
    a widely deployed forwarding\n   technology that uses labels placed in a packet
    in a label stack to\n   identify the forwarding actions to be taken at each hop
    through a\n   network.  Actions may include swapping or popping the labels as
    well,\n   as using the labels to determine the next hop for forwarding the\n   packet.
    \ Labels may also be used to establish the context under which\n   the packet
    is forwarded.\n\n   This document describes how Service Function Chaining can
    be achieved\n   in an MPLS network by means of a logical representation of the
    NSH in\n   an MPLS label stack.  It does not deprecate or replace the NSH, but\n
    \  acknowledges that there may be a need for an interim deployment of\n   SFC
    functionality in brownfield networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
