abstract:
- content: "<p>Trickle algorithm used in RPL routing protocol suffers from some issues
    related to power, network convergence time and overhead and load-distribution.
    To optimize this algorithm for Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), a new algorithm
    called Drizzle is introduced. Drizzle uses an adaptive suppression mechanism that
    permits the nodes to have different transmission probabilities, which are consistent
    with their transmission history. Compared to Trickle, Drizzle removes the listen-only
    period from Drizzle's intervals, thus, leading to faster convergence time. Furthermore,
    a new policy for setting the redundancy coefficient has been used to mitigate
    the negative effect of the short-listen problem presented when removing the listen-only
    period and to further boost the fairness in the network.</p>"
