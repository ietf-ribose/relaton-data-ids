abstract:
  content: "<p>IMAP clients operating over low-bandwidth or high-latency links,such
    as cellular telephones, need to be able to submit mail messagescontaining all
    or part of previously-received IMAP messages.Clients need to be able to do this
    without sloshing the bits bothways, that is, without being forced to download
    IMAP messages solelyto be able to upload the content in a submitted message.This
    document currently identifies the two main approaches to doingthis (called 'IMAP
    push' and 'IMAP pull'), one which adds submissionto IMAP, and another which adds
    the expansion of IMAP references tomessage submission. This version of the document
    attempts to layout the protocol mechanisms along with associated trade-offs andsecurity
    considerations of each. Once a decision has been made togo with a particular technique,
    this document will describe thespecifics of that choice as a standards-track proposal.</p>"
