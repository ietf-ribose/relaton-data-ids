abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document classifies connectivity disruptions along an
    end-to-end\n   path into four types and describes how standard TCP mechanisms
    can\n   lead to inefficient or over-aggressive sending behavior when\n   connectivity
    resumes.  The proposed techniques for TCP mobility\n   detection and response
    (LMDR) can improve behavior for some types of\n   disruptions.  This document
    describes another, complementary and\n   orthogonal modification to TCP's retransmission
    scheme that improves\n   performance for disruption types that TCP LMDR does not
    address.\n   This extension is based on connectivity indicators, i.e., generic\n
    \  network events that may indicate that end-to-end connectivity has\n   resumed.
    \ This document focuses on TCP modifications that use\n   connectivity indicators
    to increase performance, but does not define\n   the specifics of such connectivity
    indicators itself.\n\t </p>\n      "
