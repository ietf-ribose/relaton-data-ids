abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IPv4 Identification (ID) field enables fragmentation and\n
    \  reassembly, and as currently specified is required to be unique\n   within
    the maximum lifetime for all datagrams with a given\n   source/destination/protocol
    tuple. If enforced, this uniqueness\n   requirement would limit all connections
    to 6.4 Mbps. Because\n   individual connections commonly exceed this speed, it
    is clear that\n   existing systems violate the current specification. This document\n
    \  updates the specification of the IPv4 ID field in RFC791, RFC1122,\n   and
    RFC2003 to more closely reflect current practice and to more\n   closely match
    IPv6 so that the field's value is defined only when a\n   datagram is actually
    fragmented. It also discusses the impact of\n   these changes on how datagrams
    are used.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
