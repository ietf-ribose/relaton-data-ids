abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>MIPv6 defines the concept of Home Network for a MN, in opposition
    to\nthe foreign network where this entity may find itself.  A ``Home Link\nDetection''
    mechanism is also specified to allow the MN to detect\nwhen it is at home.\n\nMIPv6
    specification mandates the use of IPsec for protecting main\nsignaling traffic
    and also defines how IPsec can be used to protect\ndata traffic between the MN
    and its HA.  Even if optional, it is\nexpected that many deployments of MIPv6
    will use it by default for MN\nwhich may roam outside a trusted infrastructure
    (e.g. outside a\nmobile operator network).\n\nWhen a MN detects it is at home,
    it is expected to stop IPsec\nprotection for data traffic exchanged with its Home
    Agent.  That\nevent is the result of the Home Return procedure, triggered by the\nHome
    Link Detection mechanism.\n\nThis document discusses the possible threats and
    security impacts\nassociated with the use of this insecure NDP-based mechanism
    as a\ntrigger to drop IPsec protection of data traffic for the MN.  It also\nprovides
    some results on the implementation of the attacks against an\nexisting MIPv6 module.
    \ Possible solutions are suggested.\n\t </p>\n      "
