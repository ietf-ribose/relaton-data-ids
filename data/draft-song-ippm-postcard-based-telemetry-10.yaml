abstract:
- content: "<p>The document describes a packet-marking variation of the Postcard-
    Based Telemetry (PBT), referred to as PBT-M. Similar to the instruction-based
    PBT (i.e., IOAM DEX), PBT-M does not carry the telemetry data in user packets
    but send the telemetry data through a dedicated packet. Unlike the instruction-based
    PBT, PBT-M does not require an extra instruction header. PBT-M raises some unique
    issues that need to be considered. This document formally describes the high level
    scheme and cover the common requirements and issues when applying PBT-M in different
    networks. PBT-M is complementary to the other on-path telemetry schemes such as
    IOAM.</p>"
