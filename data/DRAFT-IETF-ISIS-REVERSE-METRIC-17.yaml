abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism to allow IS-IS routing to
    quickly and accurately shift traffic away from either a point-to-point or multi-access
    LAN interface during network maintenance or other operational events.  This is
    accomplished by signaling adjacent IS-IS neighbors with a higher reverse metric,
    i.e., the metric towards the signaling IS-IS router.\n\t </p>\n      "
