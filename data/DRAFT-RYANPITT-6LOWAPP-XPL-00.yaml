abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes an Extensible Presentation Language (XPL)
    and\nXPL Type Resolution Protocol to be used as the basis for building\nprotocols
    in the application area addressed by the IETF 6lowpan and\nproposed 6lowApp Working
    Groups.  This comprises applications for\nhighly resource-constrained devices
    over wireless networks, where the\ndevices are: power-constrained; ubiquitous;
    potentially very small;\nheterogeneous; have very short duty cycles (e.g. 0.1%);
    and are\ninstalled or used for many years on end, e.g. 'smart' electricity\nmeters,
    electric cars, etc.\n\t </p>\n      "
