abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for the
    global\n   (or local) DNS names of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as\n
    \  sensors, actuators, and in-vehicle units.  By this scheme, the DNS\n   name
    of an IoT device can be autoconfigured with the device's model\n   information
    in wired and wireless target networks (e.g., vehicle,\n   road network, home,
    office, shopping mall, and smart grid).  This DNS\n   name lets IoT users (e.g.,
    drivers, passengers, home residents, and\n   customers) in the Internet (or local
    network) easily identify each\n   device for monitoring and remote-controlling
    it in the target\n   network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
