abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With RPL - the \"IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-power Lossy
    Networks\" -\n   published as a Proposed Standard after a ~2-year development
    cycle,\n   this document presents an observation of the resulting protocol, of\n
    \  its applicability, and of its limits.  The documents presents a\n   selection
    of observations on the protocol characteristics, exposes\n   experiences acquired
    when producing various prototype implementations\n   of RPL, and presents results
    obtained from testing this protocol - by\n   way of network simulations, in network
    testbeds and in deployments.\n   The document aims at providing a better understanding
    of possible\n   limits of RPL, notably the possible directions that further protocol\n
    \  developments should explore, in order to address these.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
