abstract:
- content: "<p>Intent is an abstract, high-level policy used to operate the network.
    Intent-based management system includes an interface for users to input requests
    and an engine to translate the intents into the network configuration and manage
    their life-cycle. This document discusses mostly the concept of network intents,
    but other types of intents are also being considered. Specifically, it highlights
    stakeholder perspectives of intent, methods to classify and encode intent, the
    associated intent taxonomy, and defines relevant intent terms where necessary.
    This document provides a foundation for intent related research and facilitates
    solution development. This document is a product of the IRTF Network Management
    Research Group (NMRG and is not issued by the IETF and is not an IETF standard.</p>"
