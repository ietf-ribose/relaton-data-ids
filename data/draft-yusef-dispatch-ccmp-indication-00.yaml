abstract:
- content: "<p>The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol document defines
    away for a client to discover a conference control server that supports CCMP.
    However, it does not define a way for a client involved in a conference to determine
    if the conference focus supports CCMP. This information would allow a CCMP-enabled
    client that joins a conference using SIP to also register for the XCON conference
    event package and take advantage of CCMP operations on the conference. This draft
    describes few options to address the above limitation with the pros and cons for
    each approach.</p>"
