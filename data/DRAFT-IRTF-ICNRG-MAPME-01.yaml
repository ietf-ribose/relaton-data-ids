abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Consumer mobility is supported in ICN by design, in virtue
    of its\n   connectionless pull-based communication model; producer mobility\n
    \  through is not natively supported.  This document describes MAP-Me,\n   an
    anchor-less solution to manage micro-mobility of content producers\n   in the
    CCN (Content Centric Networking) and NDN (Named Data\n   Networking) architectures,
    with support for latency-sensitive\n   applications.  MAP-Me consists in the combination
    of two data plane\n   protocols, triggered by the producer movements, and leveraging
    ICN\n   named-based data plane.  The main protocol consists in a lightweight\n
    \  FIB update process, complemented by a mechanism of local notification\n   and
    scoped discovery suitable for low latency applications and fast\n   mobility.\n\n\t
