abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [I-D.tissa-lime-yang-oam-model] defines a Generic YANG data
    model for\n   Layer independent OAM Management.  This document proposes additional\n
    \  extension to this YANG module which is complementary to the one\n   defined
    in the [I-D.tissa-lime-yang-oam-model] and describes the\n   abstract notification
    and rpc command for Unified Management Plane\n   OAM to be used within IETF in
    a layer independent manner.  The\n   abstract notification and rpc command described
    in this document can\n   be applied to various network technologies and includes
    technology\n   independent configuration data and state data.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
