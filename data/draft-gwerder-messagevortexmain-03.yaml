abstract:
- content: "<p>The MessageVortex (referred to as Vortex) protocol achieves different
    degrees of anonymity, including sender, receiver, and third-party anonymity, by
    specifying messages embedded within existing transfer protocols, such as SMTP
    or XMPP, sent via peer nodes to one or more recipients. The protocol outperforms
    others by decoupling the transport from the final transmitter and receiver. No
    trust is placed into any infrastructure except for that of the sending and receiving
    parties of the message. The creator of the routing block has full control over
    the message flow. Routing nodes gain no non-obvious knowledge about the messages
    even when collaborating. While third-party anonymity is always achieved, the protocol
    also allows for either sender or receiver anonymity.</p>"
