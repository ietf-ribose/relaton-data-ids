abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft presents a use case of Application Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) with the emergence of Network Function Virtualization (NFV). The Application-Layer
    Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service provides network information (e.g., basic
    network location structure and preferences of network paths) with the goal of
    modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving
    application performance. The emerging Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV),
    as currently being in progress in ETSI NFV, leverages standard IT virtualisation
    technology to consolidate many network equipment types onto industry standard
    high volume servers, switches and storage.</p>"
