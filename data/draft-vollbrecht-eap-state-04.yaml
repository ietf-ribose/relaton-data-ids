abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a set of state machines for EAP Peer, EAPAuthenticator
    (supporting local, passthrough and backend), for EAPPassthrough method, and for
    'backend adapter' that adapts EAP trafficcarried by an AAA protocol such as RADIUS
    or Diameter to a BackendAuthenticator. This set of state machines shows how EAP
    can beimplemented to support deployment in either a Peer/AP or Peer/AP/AAAServer
    environmnet. The Peer and Authenticator machines areillustrative of how the EAP
    protocol defined in[I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis] may be implemented. The Passtrhoughmethod
    and 'backend adapter' illustrate how EAP protocol supportdefined in [I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis]
    may be implemented. Wherethere are differences [I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis]/[I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis]
    are authoritative.This document describes a state machine based on an EAP 'Switch'model.
    This model includes events and actions for the interactionbetween the EAP Switch
    and EAP methods. The State Machine andassociated model are informative only. Implementations
    may achievethe same results using different methods.A brief description of the
    EAP 'Switch' model is given in theIntroduction section.This document is still
    a work in progress. The authors believe itcorresponds to the current state of
    revisions to the defining[I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis]/[I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis]
    documents,but it has not been vetted by the EAP working group as a whole. Anappendix
    to this document points out issues the authors believe stillneed to be resolved
    between the documents. The intent is tosynchronize this document with [I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis]
    and[I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis] revisions when they are released andthen submit
    it as an RFC.</p>"
