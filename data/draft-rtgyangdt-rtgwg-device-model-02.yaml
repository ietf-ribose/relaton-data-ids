abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an approach for organizing YANG models in a
    comprehensive structure that may be used to configure and operate network devices.
    The structure is itself represented as a YANG model, with all of the related component
    models logically organized in a way that is operationally intuitive, but this
    model is not expected to be implemented. The identified component modules are
    expected to be defined and implemented on common network devices. This document
    also defines two modules that can be used to model the logical and virtual resource
    representations that may be present on a network device. Examples of common industry
    terms for logical resource representations are Logical Systems or Routers. Examples
    of of common industry terms for virtual resource representations are Virtual Routing
    and Forwarding (VRF) instances and Virtual Switch Instances (VSIs). This document
    is derived from work submitted to the IETF by members of the informal OpenConfig
    working group of network operators and is a product of the Routing Area YANG Architecture
    design team.</p>"
