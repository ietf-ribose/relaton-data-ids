abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Security events communicated within Security Event Tokens may
    support\n   a variety of identifiers to identify the subject and/or other\n   principals
    related to the event.  This specification formalizes the\n   notion of subject
    identifiers as named sets of well-defined claims\n   describing the subject, a
    mechanism for representing subject\n   identifiers within a [JSON] object such
    as a JSON Web Token (JWT)\n   [JWT] or Security Event Token (SET) [SET], and a
    registry for\n   defining and allocating names for these claim sets.\n\n\t </p>\n
