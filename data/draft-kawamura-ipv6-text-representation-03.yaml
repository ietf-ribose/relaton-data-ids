abstract:
  content: "\t <t>As IPv6 network grows, there will be more engineers and also non-engineers
    who will have the need to use an IPv6 address in text.While the IPv6 address architecture
    RFC 4291 section 2.2 depicts aflexible model for text representation of an IPv6
    address, thisflexibility has been causing problems for operators, systemengineers,
    and customers. This document will describe the problemsthat a flexible text representation
    has been causing. This documentalso recommends a canonical representation format
    that best avoidsconfusion. It is expected that the canonical format is followed
    byhumans and systems when generating an address to represent as text,but all implementations
    must accept any legitimate RFC4291 format.</p>"
