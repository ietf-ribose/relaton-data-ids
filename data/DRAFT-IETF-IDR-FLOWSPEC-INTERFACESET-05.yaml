abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BGP Flow Specification (flowspec) Network Layer Reachability\n
    \  Information (BGP NLRI) extension (draft-ietf-idr-rfc5575bis) is used\n   to
    distribute traffic flow specifications into BGP.  The primary\n   application
    of this extension is the distribution of traffic\n   filtering policies for the
    mitigation of distributed denial of\n   service (DDoS) attacks.\n\n   By default,
    flow specification filters are applied on all forwarding\n   interfaces that are
    enabled for use by the BGP flowspec extension.  A\n   network operator may wish
    to apply a given filter selectively to a\n   subset of interfaces based on an
    internal classification scheme.\n   Examples of this include \"all customer interfaces\",
    \"all peer\n   interfaces\", \"all transit interfaces\", etc.\n\n   This document
    defines BGP Extended Communities (RFC4360) that allow\n   such filters to be selectively
    applied to sets of forwarding\n   interfaces sharing a common group identifier.
    \ The BGP Extended\n   Communities carrying this group identifier are referred
    to as the BGP\n   Flowspec \"interface-set\" Extended Communities.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
