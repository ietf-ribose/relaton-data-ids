abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
    for\n   Persistent Web IDentifiers to web material in web archives using the\n
    \  'pwid' scheme name.  The purpose of the standard is to support\n   general,
    global, sustainable, humanly readable, technology agnostic,\n   persistent and
    precise web references for web materials.\n\n   The PWID URI can assist in two
    ways: First, by providing potential\n   resolvable precise and persistent reference
    scheme for documents,\n   which is not sufficiently covered by existing web reference\n
    \  practices.  Second, by providing a standardized way to specify web\n   elements
    in a web collection also known as web corpus.  Definitions\n   of web collections
    are often needed for extraction of data used in\n   production of research results,
    e.g. for evaluations in the future.\n   Current practices today are not persistent
    as they often use some CDX\n   version, which vary for different implementations.\n\n\t
