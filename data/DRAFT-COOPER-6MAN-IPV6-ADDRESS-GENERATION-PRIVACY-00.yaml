abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses privacy and security considerations
    for\n   several IPv6 address generation mechanisms, both standardized and\n   non-standardized.
    \ It evaluates how different mechanisms mitigate\n   different threats and the
    trade-offs that implementors, developers,\n   and users face in choosing different
    addresses or address generation\n   mechanisms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
