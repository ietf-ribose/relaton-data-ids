abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]
    is\n   an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a\n
    \  \"BIER domain\" without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any\n   multicast
    related per-flow state.  BIER also does not require any\n   explicit tree-building
    protocol for its operation.  Currently, the\n   data plane of BIER is apt to use
    BIER-MPLS encapsulation to transmit\n   multicast traffic.  However, this document
    tries to propose a\n   solution named BIER-Lite about how to extend IS-IS protocol
    to\n   support BIER forwarding in non-MPLS underlay network instead of MPLS\n
    \  underlay network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
