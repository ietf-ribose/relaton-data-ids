abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An Endorsement is defined by the RATS Architecture as a \"secure\n
    \  statement that some entity (typically a manufacturer) vouches for the\n   integrity
    of an Attester's signing capability\".  This documents\n   defines Claims to be
    used in CBOR Web Tokens in the same fashion\n   attestation Evidence can be represented
    via Entity Attestation Tokens\n   (EAT).  The defined Claims can be included in
    Endorsement Tokens.\n   Endorsement Tokens can be provided by a manufacturer or
    a third party\n   authority to vouch for the capabilities and characteristics
    of a\n   hardware component a RATS Attester is not capable to create Evidence\n
    \  about.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
