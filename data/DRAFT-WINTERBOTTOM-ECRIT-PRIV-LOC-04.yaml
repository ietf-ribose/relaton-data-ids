abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In many circumstances public LoST servers or a distributed
    network of\n   forest guides linking public LoST servers is not available.  In
    such\n   environments the general ECRIT calling models breakdown.  However,\n
    \  location servers operating in these areas are often privy to the\n   necessary
    information to reach emergency and other services.  This\n   document describes
    a solution where by the routing information may be\n   obtained from a location
    server using a simple extension to the HELD\n   protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
