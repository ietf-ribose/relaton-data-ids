abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes the current results of the author's investigations\ninto
    decisions required for security issues in IMPP protocol design.\nWe discuss possible
    options for methods of authentication and encryption\nappropriate to IMPP requirements.
    \ In particular, we propose our design\ndecisions for message integrity checking,
    user authentication, time\nstamping, and message confidentiality.  Moreover, we
    consider some ACL\nand firewall issues.  This memo attempts to complement the
    IMPP design\nbasis [Basis] by providing a discussion of privacy and security.\n\n\t
