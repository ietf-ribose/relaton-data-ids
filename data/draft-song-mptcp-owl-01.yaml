abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the One Way Latency (OWL) utilization for enhancing
    multipath TCP (MPTCP) transmission, which is a potential and beneficial technology
    in MPTCP Working Group (WG). Several representative usages of OWL, such as retransmission
    policy, crucial data scheduling, are analyzed. Two kind s of OWL measurement approaches
    are also provided and compared. We believe that more explorations related with
    OWL will be important for MPTCP.</p>"
