abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Within the DNS, there is no mechanism for authoritative servers
    to\n   advertise which transport methods they are capable of.  If secure\n   transport
    methods are adopted by authoritative operators, protocol\n   negotiation would
    be required.  This document provides two new\n   Resource Record Types, NS2 and
    NS2T, to facilitate that negotiation\n   by allowing zone owners to signal how
    the authoritative nameserver(s)\n   for their zone(s) may accept queries.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
