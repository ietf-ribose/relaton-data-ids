abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic MANET On-demand (AODVv2) routing protocol is intended for
    use by mobile routers in wireless, multihop networks. AODVv2 determines unicast
    routes among AODVv2 routers within the network in an on-demand fashion, offering
    on-demand convergence in dynamic topologies. This document specifies a simple
    modification to AODVv2 (and possibly other reactive routing protocols) enabling
    faster notifications to known sources of traffic upon determination that a route
    for such traffic's destination has become invalid.</p>"
