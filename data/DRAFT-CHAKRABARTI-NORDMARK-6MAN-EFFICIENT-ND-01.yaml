abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) protocol has been designed
    for\n   neighbor's address resolution, unreachability detection, address\n   autoconfiguration,
    router advertisement and solicitation.  With the\n   progress of Internet adoption
    on various industries including home,\n   wireless, m2m and Cellular(LTE) networks,
    there is a desire for\n   optimizing the legacy IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol.
    \ This\n   document describes a method of optimization by reducing multicast\n
    \  messages and introducing an IPv6 address Registration mechanism.\n   Efficient
    IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol is useful for energy-\n   efficient IPv6 networks
    and as well as Data Center and Home Networks.\n   The solution is capable of handling
    existing legacy IPv6 nodes in the\n   network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
