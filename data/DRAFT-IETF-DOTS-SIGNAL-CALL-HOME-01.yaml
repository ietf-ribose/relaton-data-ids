abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the DOTS signal channel Call Home service,\n
    \  which enables a DOTS server to initiate a secure connection to a DOTS\n   client,
    and to receive the attack traffic information from the DOTS\n   client.  The DOTS
    server in turn uses the attack traffic information\n   to identify the compromised
    devices launching the outgoing DDoS\n   attack and takes appropriate mitigation
    action(s).\n\n   The Call Home service is not specific to the home networks; the\n
    \  solution targets any deployment which requires to block DDoS attack\n   traffic
    closer to the source(s) of a DDoS attack.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
