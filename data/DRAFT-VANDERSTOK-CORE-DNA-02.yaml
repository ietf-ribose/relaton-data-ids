abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is a working document intended to focus discussion and
    refine\n   draft language for the CoAP protocol specification (or other proposed\n
    \  standards) in the areas of discovery, naming, and addressing.\n   Requirements
    on discovery are motivated.  Special emphasis is placed\n   on group definition
    and discovery.  Examples show how groups can be\n   represented in CoAP Resource
    Directories or DNS-SD.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
