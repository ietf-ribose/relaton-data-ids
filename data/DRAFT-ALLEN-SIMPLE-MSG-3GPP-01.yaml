abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is using SIP RFC
    3261\n[1] as the session establishment protocol for the 3GPP IP Multimedia\nCore
    Network Subsystem (IM CN Subsystem, IMS).  3GPP has recently\nstarted working
    on messaging over the IM CN Subsystem.  It is\nintended that this will utilize
    the IM CN Subsystem for delivery and\nmay be based on IETF protocols including
    the work being performed in\nthe SIMPLE working group.  In this document is provided
    an outline\nand areas of interest of the 3GPP work on IMS messaging for the\ninformation
    of the SIMPLE working group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
