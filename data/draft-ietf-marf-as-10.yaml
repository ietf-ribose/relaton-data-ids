abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5965 defines an extensible, machine-readable format intended for
    mail operators to report feedback about received email to other parties. This
    Applicability Statement describes common methods for utilizing this format for
    reporting both abuse and authentication failure events. Mailbox Providers of any
    size, mail sending entities, and end users can use these methods as a basis to
    create procedures that best suit them. Some related optional mechanisms are also
    discussed.</p>"
