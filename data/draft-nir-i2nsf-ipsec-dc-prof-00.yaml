abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents two profiles for configuring IPsec within a
    data center using an SDN controller and the YANG model described in the sdn-ipsec
    draft. Two profiles are described to allow both the IKE and IKE-less cases because
    some data centers may be required to use a standardized method of key exchange
    rather than SDN.</p>"
