abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the requirements for the transmission of network
    timing and synchronization across packet-switched networks using pseudo-wires.
    Such services enable the function of real-time, synchronous applications across
    the asynchronous packet switched network. In particular, it complements the emulation
    of TDM bit streams over the packet switched network.</p>"
