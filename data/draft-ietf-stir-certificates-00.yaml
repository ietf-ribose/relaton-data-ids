abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to prove ownership of telephone numbers on the Internet, some
    kind of public infrastructure needs to exist that binds cryptographic keys to
    authority over telephone numbers. This document describes a certificate-based
    credential system for telephone numbers, which could be used as a part of a broader
    architecture for managing telephone numbers as identities in protocols like SIP.</p>"
