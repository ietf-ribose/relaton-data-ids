abstract:
- content: "<p>A Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) in a fixed wireline access network
    is an Ethernet-centric IP edge router and the aggregation point for subscriber
    traffic. Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS) for such a BNG improves flexibility
    and scalability but requires various communication between the User Plane (UP)
    and the Control Plane (CP). China Mobile, Huawei Technologies, and ZTE have developed
    a simple CUPS control channel protocol to support such communication: the Simple
    Control and User Plane Separation Protocol (S-CUSP). S-CUSP is defined in this
    document. This document is not an IETF standard and does not have IETF consensus.
    S-CUSP is presented here to make its specification conveniently available to the
    Internet community to enable diagnosis and interoperability.</p>"
