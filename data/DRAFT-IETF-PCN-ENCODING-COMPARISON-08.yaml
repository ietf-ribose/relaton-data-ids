abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect
    the\n   quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain.\n
    \  On every link in the PCN domain, the overall rate of the PCN-traffic\n   is
    metered, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain\n   configured
    rates are exceeded.  Egress nodes provide decision points\n   with information
    about the PCN-marks of PCN-packets which allows them\n   to take decisions about
    whether to admit or block a new flow request,\n   and to terminate some already
    admitted flows during serious pre-\n   congestion.\n\n   The PCN Working Group
    explored a number of approaches for encoding\n   this pre-congestion information
    into the IP header.  This document\n   provides details of all those approaches
    along with an explanation of\n   the constraints that had to be met by any solution.\n\n\n\t
