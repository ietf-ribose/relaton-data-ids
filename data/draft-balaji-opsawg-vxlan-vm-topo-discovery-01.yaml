abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a method by which in a VXLAN environment the
    ARP tables of each VTEP having an active VM belonging to a particular tenant where
    such active VMs are distributed amongst several VTEPs in a data center or across
    data centers are walked through and the collation of the location of such active
    VMs and the VTEPs they are located in is found for management and network resource
    planning purposes.</p>"
