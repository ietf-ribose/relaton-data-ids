abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a topological addressing scheme, Native Short
    Address (NSA) that enables IP packet transmission over links where the transmission
    of a full length address may not be desirable. This document focuses on carrying
    IP packets across an LLN (Low power and Lossy Network), in which the topology
    is relatively static where nodes' location is fixed and the connection between
    nodes is rather stable. The changes in the logical topology are only caused by
    non- frequent disconnection in the link. The specifications details the NSA architecture,
    address allocation, forwarding mechanism, header format design, including length-variable
    fields, and IPv6 interconnection support.</p>"
