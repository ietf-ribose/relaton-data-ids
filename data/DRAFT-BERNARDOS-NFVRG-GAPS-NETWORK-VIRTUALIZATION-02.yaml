abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined
    Networking\n   (SDN) are changing the way the telecommunications sector will deploy,\n
    \  extend and operate their networks.  These new technologies aim at\n   reducing
    the overall costs by outsourcing communication services from\n   specific hardware
    in the operators' core to server farms scattered in\n   datacenters (i.e. compute
    and storage virtualization).  In addition,\n   the connecting networks are fundamentally
    affected in they way they\n   route, process and control traffic(i.e. network
    virtualization).\n\n   Virtualization is becoming a trend which is being adopted
    in many\n   scenarios for different purposes.  This document overviews existing\n
    \  efforts around virtualization at the IETF/IRTF, focusing on those\n   related
    to NFV and SDN.  These efforts are mapped to the most\n   relevant architectures
    being defined outside IETF, namely at the ETSI\n   NFV ISG, the ETSI MEC ISG and
    the ONF.\n\n   The main goal of this document is to serve as a survey of the\n
    \  different efforts that have been taken and are currently taking place\n   at
    IETF and IRTF in regards to network virtualization, putting them\n   into context
    considering efforts by other SDOs, and identifying\n   current gaps that can be
    tackled at IETF or researched at the IRTF.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
