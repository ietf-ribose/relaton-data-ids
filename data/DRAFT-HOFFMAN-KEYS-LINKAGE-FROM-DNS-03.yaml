abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>TLS and DTLS use certificates for authenticating the server.  Users\nwant
    their applications to verify that the certificate provided by\nthe TLS server
    is in fact associated with the domain name they\nexpect.  Instead of trusting
    a certificate authority to have made\nthis association correctly, the user might
    instead trust the\nauthoritative DNS server for the domain name to make that\nassociation.
    \ This document describes how to use secure DNS to\nassociate the TLS server's
    certificate with the the intended domain\nname.\n\t </p>\n      "
