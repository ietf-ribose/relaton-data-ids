abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Internet is in the early stages of what may be a protractedperiod
    of coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6. Network operators arechallenged with the task
    of activating IPv6 without negative impacton operating IPv4 networks and their
    customers. This draft is aninformational \"annotated bibliography\" compiled to
    help in theanalysis and development of basic guidelines and recommendations fornetwork
    operators. The goal of this document is to survey thecurrent state of RFCs, Internet-Drafts
    and external referencematerials that define the use cases, problem statements,
    protocols,transition mechanisms and coexistence tools that will be of interestto
    a network operator planning to turn on IPv6.</p>"
