abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Host Requirements RFC1122 states that an ICMP Echo Request destinedto
    an IP broadcast or IP multicast address MAY be silentlydiscarded. By discarding
    all broadcast ICMP Echo Requests, the enduser may lose valuable diagnostic capability.
    By forwarding somebroadcast ICMP Echo Requests, the host may be used as launchingplatform
    for Smurf Attacks[1]. This draft describes a solution forselectively dropping
    broadcast ICMP Echo Requests based on whetherthe source address is within the
    network or from outside thenetwork. Any host implementing this solution ensures
    that it doesnot participate in a Smurf attack irrespective of whether respondingto
    broadcast ICMP Echo Requests is enabled or disabled on it.</p>"
