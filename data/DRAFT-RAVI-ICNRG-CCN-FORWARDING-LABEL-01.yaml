abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The objective of this proposal is to enable ID and Locator
    namespace\n   split in the CCN protocol that has several applications such as\n
    \  towards Interest routing optimization, seamless mobility and\n   providing
    mobility as a service, conversational session support,\n   handling indirections
    in manifests, and routing scalability.  We\n   enable this through the notion
    of a forwarding-label object (FLO),\n   which is an optional hop-by-hop payload
    in the Interest message with\n   a topological name, which identifies a network
    domain, a router or a\n   host.  FLO can be inserted within the Interest message
    by the\n   applications or by the network.  FLO can be interpreted by the\n   network
    in multiple ways, for instance, to terminate the message or\n   to swap it with
    a new FLO based on the service context.  Furthermore,\n   depending on the application
    and trust context, FLO can be subjected\n   to policy based actions by the forwarders,
    such as invoking security\n   verification or enabling other service-centric FLO
    management\n   actions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
