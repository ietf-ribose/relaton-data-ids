abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet Draft proposes a mechanism for DNS resolvers
    to\n   discover support for TLS transport to authoritative DNS servers, to\n   validate
    this indication of support, and to authenticate the TLS\n   certificates involved.\n\n
    \  This requires that the name server _names_ are in a DNSSEC signed\n   zone.\n\n
    \  This also requires that the delegation of the zone served is\n   protected
    by [I-D.dickson-dnsop-ds-hack], since the NS names are the\n   keys used for discovery
    of TLS transport support.\n\n   Additional recommendations relate to use of various
    techniques for\n   efficiency and scalability, and new EDNS options to minimize
    round\n   trips and for signaling between clients and resolvers.\n\n\t </p>\n
