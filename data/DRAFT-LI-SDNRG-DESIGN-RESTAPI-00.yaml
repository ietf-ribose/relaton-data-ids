abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As stated in ONF SDN Architecture WG Charter [Arc2013], in
    the SDN\n   architecture, the control and data planes are decoupled, network\n
    \  intelligence and state are logically centralized, and the underlying\n   network
    infrastructure is abstracted from the applications. As a\n   result, network operators
    gain programmability, automation, and\n   network control, enabling them to build
    highly scalable, flexible\n   networks that readily adapt to changing business
    needs. In this\n   architecture, the Northbound API provides interfaces to the
    external\n   components where applicable.\n\n   As REST architectural style has
    gained more popularity in\n   implementing loosely-coupled systems, RESTful services
    are becoming\n   the style of choice for SDN Northbound API and gaining increasingly\n
    \  importance in SDN architecture, for example, the Floodlight\n   [Floodlight]
    has a Northbound API based on REST.\n\n   However, despite the recent advances
    made on RESTful web services,\n   there is a lack of guidelines for designing
    RESTful networking\n   protocols and communication web services, especially based
    on the\n   Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA) that further refines the REST\n
    \  principles. Many networking protocols that claim to be REST APIs are\n   not
    hypertext driven as prescribed by REST. This situation can lead\n   to REST networking
    APIs that are not as scalable, extensible,\n   maintainable, and interoperable
    as promised by REST.\n\n   This document describes the key rules and design patterns
    for the\n   SDN Northbound API in a truly RESTful manner, based on our\n   experiences
    with REST API designs in general and SDN Northbound API\n   design in particular.
    The rules and the design patterns illustrate\n   the solutions to the common API
    problems in REST API designs, using\n   the network virtualization API of OpenStack
    as an example.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
