abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document examines the problems and challenges associated
    with\n   the process of setting up secure interconnections between authorized\n
    \  network nodes.  The network nodes can be located anywhere in a\n   private
    or public network, directly connected or behind one or more\n   levels of NAT
    [NAT].  Setting up a secure interconnection in this\n   environment entails the
    resolution of various issues such as\n   authentication, peer discovery, virtual
    network address management,\n   and connection parameters determination.\n\n\t
