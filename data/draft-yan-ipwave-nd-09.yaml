abstract:
- content: "<p>For Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (C-ACC), platooning and other
    typical use cases in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), IPv6 communication
    between neighbor vehicles and between vehicle and server pose the following two
    issues: 1) how to discover a neighbor vehicle and the demanded service; and 2)
    how to discover the link- layer address and other metadata of the neighbor vehicle
    and selected server. This document presents a solution to these problems based
    on DNS-SD/mDNS [RFC6762][RFC6763].</p>"
