abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet-Draft proposes elimination of end-to-end IP addresses\nfrom
    the Internet, presenting a stronger embodiment of the end-to-end\nprinciple by
    elevating the end-to-end aspects of connectivity and\nrouting above the network
    to an operating system-like framework that\nimplements virtual network addressing
    and efficient translation to\nswitched paths, obviating end-to-end addressing
    at all levels. The\nresulting flexibility would allow, for example, piecewise
    transition\nto IPv6 and full access to the existing Internet for the emerging\nwireless
    services without allocating new addresses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
