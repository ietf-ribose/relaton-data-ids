abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to calculate congestion of a tunnel
    segment based on RFC 6040 recommendations, and a feedback protocol by which to
    send the measured congestion of the tunnel from egress to ingress . A basic model
    for measuring tunnel congestion and feedback is described, and a protocol for
    carrying the feedback data is outlined.</p>"
