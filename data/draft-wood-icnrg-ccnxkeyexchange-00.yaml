abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Version 1.0 of the CCNx Key Exchange (CCNxKE)
    protocol. The CCNxKE protocol allows two peers to establish a shared, forward-secure
    key for secure and confidential communication. The protocol is designed to prevent
    eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery between two peers. It is also designed
    to minimize the number of rounds required to establish a shared key. In the worst
    case, it requires two RTTs between a consumer and producer to establish a shared
    key. In the best case, one RTT is required before sending any application data.
    This document outlines how to derive the keys used to encrypt traffic for a session
    and shows how session information is exchanged between a consumer and producer
    using message encapsulation.</p>"
