abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.
    \ SR is\n   applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6\n
    \  (SRv6) data planes.  This document specifies procedure for sending\n   and
    processing probe query and response messages for Performance\n   Measurement (PM)
    in Segment Routing networks.  The procedure uses the\n   mechanisms defined in
    RFC 5357 (Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol\n   (TWAMP) Light) and Simple Two-Way
    Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)\n   for Delay Measurement, and also uses the
    mechanisms defined in this\n   document for Loss Measurement.  The procedure specified
    is applicable\n   to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and are used for both links
    and\n   end-to-end SR Policies.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
