abstract:
- content: '<p>The S/MIME protocols Message Specification (RFC 5751), Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (RFC 5652), S/MIME Certificate Handling (RFC 5750) and Enhanced
    Security Services for S/MIME (RFC 2634) specify a consistent way to securely send
    and receive MIME messages providing end to end integrity, authentication, non-repudiation
    and confidentiality. This document identifies a number of interoperability, technical,
    procedural and policy related issues that may result in end-to-end security services
    not being achievable. To resolve such issues, this document profiles domain-based
    signing and encryption using S/MIME, such as specifying how S/MIME signing and
    encryption can be applied between a Message Submission Agent (MSA) and a Message
    Delivery Agent (MDA) or between 2 Message Transfer Agents (MTA). This document
    is also registering 2 URI scheme: "smtp" and "submit" which are used for designating
    SMTP/SMTP Submission servers (respectively), as well as SMTP/Submission client
    accounts.</p>'
