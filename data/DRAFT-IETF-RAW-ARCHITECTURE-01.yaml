abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) provides for high reliability\n
    \  and availability for IP connectivity over a wireless medium.  The\n   wireless
    medium presents significant challenges to achieve\n   deterministic properties
    such as low packet error rate, bounded\n   consecutive losses, and bounded latency.
    \ This document defines the\n   RAW Architecture following an OODA loop that involves
    OAM, PCE, PSE\n   and PAREO functions.  It builds on the DetNet Architecture and\n
    \  discusses specific challenges and technology considerations needed to\n   deliver
    DetNet service utilizing scheduled wireless segments and\n   other media, e.g.,
    frequency/time-sharing physical media resources\n   with stochastic traffic.\n\n\t
