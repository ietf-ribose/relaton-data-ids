abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This contribution describes a registration protocol that can be
    used\nbetween gateways (GWs) and severs as well as among servers in intra-\nITAD
    communications environment. The registration protocol is used\nby a GW just to
    inform its transport address and reachable alias\naddresses including telephone
    numbers through it along with other\ninformation (e.g., capacity, cost, traffic,
    usage, QoS, GoS) to the\nServer and does not deal with any routes or path attributes.\nThe
    registration protocol is also used to negotiate capabilities\nbetween the peers.\n\t
