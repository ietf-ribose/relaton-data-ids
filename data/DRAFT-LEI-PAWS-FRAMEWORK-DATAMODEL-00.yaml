abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Portions of the radio spectrum that are allocated to a licensed,\n
    \  primary use but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and\n   times
    are defined as \"white space\".  In this document the framework\n   of PAWS is
    introduced, which includes framework of PAWS, protocol\n   stack, definition of
    interface, parameters and schema running over\n   interface, and security considerations.
    \ The realization of database\n   and the calculation of protected contour are
    not considered in this\n   framework draft.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
