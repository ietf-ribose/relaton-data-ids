abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes changes to [RFC2544], specifically to
    packet\n   throughput search methodology, by defining a new search algorithm\n
    \  referred to as Multiple Loss Ratio search (MLRsearch for short).\n   Instead
    of relying on binary search with pre-set starting offered\n   load, it proposes
    a novel approach discovering the starting point in\n   the initial phase, and
    then searching for packet throughput based on\n   defined packet loss ratio (PLR)
    input criteria and defined final\n   trial duration time.  One of the key design
    principles behind\n   MLRsearch is minimizing the total test duration and searching
    for\n   multiple packet throughput rates (each with a corresponding PLR)\n   concurrently,
    instead of doing it sequentially.\n\n   The main motivation behind MLRsearch is
    the new set of challenges and\n   requirements posed by NFV (Network Function
    Virtualization),\n   specifically software based implementations of NFV data planes.\n
    \  Using [RFC2544] in the experience of the authors yields often not\n   repetitive
    and not replicable end results due to a large number of\n   factors that are out
    of scope for this draft.  MLRsearch aims to\n   address this challenge in a simple
    way of getting the same result\n   sooner, so more repetitions can be done to
    describe the\n   replicability.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
