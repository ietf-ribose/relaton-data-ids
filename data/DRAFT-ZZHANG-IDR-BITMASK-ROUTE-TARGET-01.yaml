abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a new type of Route Target called Bitmask\n
    \  Route Target as a BGP Community Container.  The key element of a\n   Bitmask
    Route Target is a Bitmask.  Two Bitmask Route Targets are\n   considered equivalent
    for the purpose of controlling route\n   propagation (via Route Target Constraints)
    and importation if the\n   result of logical \"AND\" operation of the Bitmask
    of the two is non-\n   zero.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
