abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   PIM Sparse-Mode use a Rendezvous Point (RP) and shared trees
    to\n   forward multicast packets to Last Hop Routers (LHR).  After the first\n
    \  packet is received by the LHR, the source of the multicast stream is\n   learned
    and the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) can be joined.  This draft\n   proposes a solution
    to support PIM Sparse Mode (SM) without the need\n   for PIM registers, RPs or
    shared trees.  Multicast source information\n   is distributed via Bootstrap Router
    [RFC5059] messages and flooded\n   throughout the Multicast domain.  By removing
    the need for RPs and\n   shared trees, the PIM-SM procedures are simplified, improving
    router\n   operations, management and making the protocol more robust.\n\n\t </p>\n
