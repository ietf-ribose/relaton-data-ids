abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cloud Computing has been attracting a lot of attention from
    the\n   networking industry. Some of the most publicized requirements are\n   related
    to the evolution of the Cloud Networking Infrastructure to\n   accommodate a large
    number of tenants, efficient network utilization,\n   scalable loop avoidance,
    and Virtual Machine Mobility.\n\n   This draft describes a framework for cloud
    networking, highlighting\n   the applicability of existing work in various IETF
    Working Groups\n   (e.g., RFCs and drafts developed in IETF L2VPN and L3VPN Working\n
    \  Groups) to cloud networking, and the gaps and problems that need to\n   be
    further addressed. That is, the goal is to understand what may be\n   re-used
    from the current protocols and call out requirements specific\n   to the Cloud
    space that need to be addressed by new standardization\n   work with proposed
    solutions in certain cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
