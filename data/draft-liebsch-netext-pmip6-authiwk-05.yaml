abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6, the IETF's protocol for network-based mobility management,
    requires a completed and successful authentication of the mobile node before it
    is registered at the mobility anchor. This document describes inter-working between
    access authentication mechanisms, such as IEEE 802.1X, and the Proxy Mobile IPv6
    protocol to enable trusted WiFi access to a network-based mobility management
    domain. Furthermore, the use of authentication method specific identifiers for
    unique identification of mobile nodes during setup and maintenance of their mobility
    session is described, following recommendations of related standards organizations,
    such as 3GPP and the WiMAX Forum.</p>"
