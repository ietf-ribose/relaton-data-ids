abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an IPv6 extension header called the\nCryptographically
    Generated Address (CGA) Extension Header.  The CGA\nExtension Header holds the
    CGA parameters associated with the source\nCGA of an IPv6 packet.  This information
    can be used to validate that\na particular packet was sent by the node associated
    with a specific\nCGA, enabling secure IPv6 address-based access control mechanisms.\n\t
