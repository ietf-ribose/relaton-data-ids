abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The DNS protocol defines a 4-bit RCODE field in the header of
    the DNS\n   envelope.  This field is used to indicate the completion status of\n
    \  requests.  Defined values exist to describe successful completion as\n   well
    as a variety of error conditions that could result from DNS\n   server operations.
    \ As DNS has been expanded to perform additional\n   functions, the number of
    possible error conditions has increased\n   significantly, and the field no longer
    has space for new error codes\n   to be added.  To address this problem, a new
    RR type is defined.\n \n   The Error Record contains a machine-readable extended
    error value, as\n   well as an optional human-readable ASCII text string.  Additionally,\n
    \  it contains a domain-name source field to identify the entity\n   generating
    the error condition.  This RR may also be used in non-\n   error conditions to
    provide extended information about server\n   responses, such as security information
    on specific records in the\n   response.\n\t </p>\n      "
