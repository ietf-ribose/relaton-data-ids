abstract:
  content: "<p>This proposal allows host configuration to be split between twodifferent
    address servers, potentially under differentadministration.This ability may be
    useful to satisfy specific regulatory,operational or business model requirements,
    as well as toprovide support for secondary address servers. This draftproposes
    a new DHCP option called the DHCP Next Server option.A DHCP server can use this
    option to redirect clients to asecondary server.</p>"
