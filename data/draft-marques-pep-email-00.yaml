abstract:
- content: "<p>The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) propositions for email are based upon
    already existing email and encryption formats (i.e., PGP/MIME) and designed to
    allow for easy implementable and interoperable opportunistic encryption: this
    ranging from key distribution to mechanisms of subject encryption. The goal of
    pEp for email is to automatize operations in order to make email encryption usuable
    by a wider range of Internet users, such that practices for confidentiality and
    privacy can be achieved in reality. In this document, basic operations of pEp's
    approach towards email and two PGP/MIME formats (pEp Email Format 1 and 2) providing
    certain security guarantees are described. The proposed operations and and formats
    are targeted to Opportunistic Security scenarios and are already implemented in
    several applications of pretty Easy privacy (pEp).</p>"
