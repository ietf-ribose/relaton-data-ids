abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Modern IPv4 home networks are often configured with multi-level
    of\n   NATs and Residential gateways to separate islands of networks used\n   for
    different purposes.  With the introduction of IPv6 home networks\n   we'd like
    to be able to maintain the same topological freedom as we\n   have with IPv4 but
    without requiring any IPv6 NATs.  This document\n   specifies the topological
    restrictions for what we term Basic Home\n   Networks and specifies how DHCPv6
    Prefix Delegation can be used to\n   autoconfigure IPv6 address prefixes in such
    networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
