abstract:
- content: "<p>Users want to control how their DNS queries are handled by DNS servers
    so they can configure their system to use DNS servers that comply with their privacy
    expectations. This document defines a mechanism for a DNS server to communicate
    its privacy policy to a DNS client. This communication is cryptographically signed
    to attest to its authenticity. By evaluating the DNS privacy policy and the signatory,
    the DNS client can choose a DNS server that best supports its desired privacy
    policies. The privacy assertion token is particularly useful for DNS-over-TLS
    and DNS-over-HTTPS servers, both public resolvers and those discovered on the
    local network.</p>"
