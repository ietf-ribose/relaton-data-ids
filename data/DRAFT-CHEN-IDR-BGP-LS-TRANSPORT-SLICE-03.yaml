abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft defines extensions to BGP-LS protocol in order to\n
    \  advertise Network Resource Partition SR segments that share the same\n   IGP
    computed forwarding path but offer a forwarding treatment (e.g.\n   scheduling
    and drop policy) that is associated with a specific\n   Network Resource.  The
    draft is applicable to both SR-MPLS and SRv6\n   dataplanes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
