abstract:
- content: "<p>The traditional WHOIS protocol has several important shortcomings,
    and over the past few years several approaches to a better Registration Data Access
    Protocol (RDAP) have been discussed and proposed. It is worth noting that the
    term WHOIS is sometimes used interchangeably to mean either (a) the registration
    data itself or (b) the protocol used to access registration data Among these shortcomings,
    different registries operate different WHOIS services. For users this means that
    several WHOIS queries to different registries may be necessary in order to obtain
    data for a given resource. This document describes a redirection service for RDAP
    queries. This service allows clients to query a single RDAP service and expect
    either an authoritative answer or a redirection hint pointing to another, possibly
    authoritative, RDAP server. The solution implemented proposed here applies to
    Regional Internet Registries(RIRs) and Domain Name Registries(DNRs).</p>"
