abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Deterministic Networking (DetNet), as defined in RFC 8655,
    is aimed\n   to provide a bounded end-to-end latency on top of the network\n   infrastructure,
    comprising both Layer 2 bridged and Layer 3 routed\n   segments.  This document's
    primary purpose is to detail the specific\n   requirements of the Operation, Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM)\n   recommended to maintain a deterministic network.  With
    the\n   implementation of the OAM framework in DetNet, an operator will have\n
    \  a real-time view of the network infrastructure regarding the\n   network's
    ability to respect the Service Level Objective, such as\n   packet delay, delay
    variation, and packet loss ratio, assigned to\n   each DetNet flow.\n\n\t </p>\n
