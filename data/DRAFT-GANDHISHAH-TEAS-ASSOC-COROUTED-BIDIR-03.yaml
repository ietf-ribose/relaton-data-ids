abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) association signaling
    can be\n   used to bind two unidirectional LSPs into an associated bidirectional\n
    \  LSP.  In packet transport networks, there are requirements where the\n   reverse
    unidirectional LSP of an associated bidirectional LSP needs\n   to follow the
    same path as its forward unidirectional LSP.  In\n   addition, the associated
    bidirectional LSP needs to maintain\n   co-routed-ness even after a failure event
    in the network.  This\n   document describes fast reroute procedures for associated\n
    \  bidirectional LSPs that ensure the traffic flows on a co-routed path\n   after
    a failure event for single-sided provisioning model.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
