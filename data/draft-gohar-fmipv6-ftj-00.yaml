abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft describes a fast handover mechanism to provide seamlessmulticast
    services in the wireless/mobile networks based on the FastMobile IPv6 (FMIPv6).
    When a mobile node (MN) moves from one accessrouter to another, it may encounter
    data loss. In the tree joiningcase of the existing scheme, there is a problem
    of buffer overflowduring the packet forwarding from Previous Access Router (PAR)
    to NewAccess Router (NAR), in which many packet losses may occur due to thebuffer
    overflow. In order to reduce this buffer overflow and theconcerned packet losses,
    we propose a new scheme of a fast tree joinfor seamless multicast handover, which
    allows the NAR to join themulticast tree before the FMIPv6 handover is completed.
    In theproposed scheme, we consider the two specific cases: 1) the shorttree joining
    time, in which no packet forwarding will be required andthus NAR can receive the
    multicast data from an upstream multicastrouter before the FMIPv6 handover is
    completed, 2) the long treejoining time, in which the packet forwarding will be
    required andthus NAR will receive the multicast data after the FMIPv6 handover.</p>"
