abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document contains a rough outline of a potential solution
    to\nIPv6 multihoming in order to stimulate discussion.\n\nThis proposed solution
    uses 126 bit identifiers which are hashes of\npublic keys (know as Cryptographically-based
    Identifiers) which are\ncreated in an autonomous fashion by every node.  When
    there is a need\nto verify whether a new locator should be used with an identifier\nthan
    a public-key based challenge-response is used.\n\nThe proposal allows locator
    rewriting by (border) routers, and\nensures that the upper layer protocols can
    operate unmodified in a\nmultihomed setting using the stable identifiers.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
