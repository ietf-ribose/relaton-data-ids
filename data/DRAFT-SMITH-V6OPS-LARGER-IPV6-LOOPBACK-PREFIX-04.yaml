abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   During the development and testing of a network application,
    it can\n   be useful to run multiple instances of the application using the same\n
    \  transport layer protocol port on the same development host, while\n   also
    having network access to the application instances limited to\n   the local host.
    \ Under IPv4, this has commonly been possible by using\n   different loopback
    addresses within 127/8.  It is not possible under\n   IPv6, as the loopback prefix
    of ::1/128 only provides a single\n   loopback address.  This memo proposes a
    new larger loopback prefix\n   that will provide many IPv6 loopback addresses.
    \ The processing rules\n   for this new larger loopback prefix also allow sending
    or forwarding\n   of packets containing these addresses beyond the originating
    router\n   under certain circumstances.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
