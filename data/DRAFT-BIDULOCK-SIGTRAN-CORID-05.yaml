abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This Internet-Draft describes Correlation Id and Heartbeat\n
    \ procedures to support lossless fail-over between SCTP [SCTP]\n  associations
    for SS7 [Q.700] Signalling User Adaptation Protocols\n  [M2UA], [M3UA], [SUA],
    [ISUA], [TUA] supporting the concept of a\n  Routing Context or Interface Identifier.
    \ These procedures permit\n  lossless fail-over between Application Server Processes
    (ASPs) at a\n  Signalling Gateway (SG) and fail-over between Signalling Gateway\n
    \ Processes (SGPs) and Signalling Gateways (SGs) at an Application\n  Server Process
    (ASP).  Lossless fail-over permits these fail-overs to\n  occur without loss or
    duplication of UA-User messages.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
