abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document we discuss mobility extensions to current
    IP layer \n   multicast solutions. Problems arising from mobile group communication
    \n   in general, in the case of multicast listener mobility and for mobile \n
    \  Any Source Multicast as well as Source Specific Multicast senders are \n   documented.
    Characteristic aspects of multicast routing and \n   deployment issues are summarized.
    The principal approaches to the \n   multicast mobility problems are outlined
    subsequently. \n\t </p>\n      "
