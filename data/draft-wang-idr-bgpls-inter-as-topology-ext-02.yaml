abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the process to build BGP-LS key parameters
    in Native IP multi-domain scenario and defines some new inter-AS TE related TLVs
    for BGP-LS to let SDN controller retrieve the network topology automatically under
    various environments. Such process and extension can expand the usage of BGP-LS
    protocol to multi- domain, enable the network operator to collect the connection
    relationship between different AS domains and then calculate the overall network
    topology automatically based on the information provided by BGP-LS protocol.</p>"
