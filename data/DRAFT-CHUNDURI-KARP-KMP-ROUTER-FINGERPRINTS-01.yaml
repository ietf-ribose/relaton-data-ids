abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the usage of Router Fingerprint\n   Authentication
    (RFA) with public keys as a potential peer\n   authentication method with KARP
    Key Management Protocol (KMP).  The\n   advantage of RFA is, neither it requires
    out-of-band, mutually\n   agreeable symmetric keys nor a full PKI based system
    (trust anchor or\n   CA certificates) for mutual authentication of the peers with
    KARP KMP\n   deployments.  Usage of Router Fingerprints give a significant\n   operational
    improvement from symmetric key based systems and yet\n   provide a secure authentication
    technique.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
