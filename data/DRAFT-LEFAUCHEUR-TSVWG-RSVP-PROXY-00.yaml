abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RSVP signaling can be used to make end-to-end resource reservations\n
    \  in an IP network in order to guarantee the QoS required by certain\n   flows.
    \ With RSVP, both the data sender and receiver of a given flow\n   take part in
    RSVP signaling.  Yet, there are many use cases where\n   resource reservation
    is required, but the receiver, the sender, or\n   both, is not RSVP-capable.  This
    document defines RSVP Proxy\n   behaviors allowing RSVP routers to perform RSVP
    signaling on behalf\n   of a receiver or a sender that is not RSVP-capable.  This
    allows\n   resource reservations to be established on parts of the end-to-end\n
    \  path.\n\t </p>\n      "
