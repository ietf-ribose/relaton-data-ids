abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p> In Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), as also in IEEE Bridged
    \n Networks, the switches simply flood multicast traffic on all ports in \n the
    LAN by default. IGMP Snooping is commonly deployed to ensure \n multicast traffic
    is not forwarded on ports without IGMP receivers. \n The procedures and recommendations
    for IGMP Snooping are defined in \n [IGMP-SNOOP]. But when any protocol other
    than IGMP is used, the \n common practice is to simply flood multicast traffic
    to all ports. \n PIM-SM, PIM-SSM, PIM-BIDIR are widely deployed routing protocols.
    PIM \n Snooping procedures are important to restrict multicast traffic to \n only
    the routers interested in receiving such traffic. \n\n While most of the PIM Snooping
    procedures defined here also apply to \n IEEE Bridged Networks, VPLS demands certain
    special procedures due to \n the split-horizon rules that require the Provider
    Edge (PE) devices \n to co-operate. This document describes the procedures and
    \n recommendations for PIM-Snooping in VPLS to facilitate replication to \n only
    those ports behind which there are interested PIM routers and/or \n IGMP hosts.
    \n  \n This document also describes procedures for PIM Proxy. PIM Proxy is \n
    required on PEs for VPLS Multicast to work correctly when Join \n suppression
    is enabled in the VPLS. PIM Proxy also helps scale VPLS \n Multicast much better
    than just PIM Snooping. \n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
