abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 5586 generalized the applicability of the pseudowire Associated
    Channel Header (PW-ACH) into the Generic Associated Channel G-Ach. However, registries
    and allocations of G-ACh parameters had been distributed throughout different,
    sometimes unrelated, registries. This document coalesces these into a new "Generic
    Associated Channel (G-ACh)" registry under the "Multiprotocol Label Switching
    Architecture (MPLS)" heading. This is an update to RFC 5586 [RFC5586]. This document
    also updates RFC 6374, RFC 6428, RFC 6378, RFC 6427, RFC-ietf-mpls-gach-adv-08,
    and RFC-ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing-08.</p>
