abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some network operators implementing Diffserv are purported
    to remark\n   some IP packets with non-zero DSCP values to the default DSCP value\n
    \  '000000' at their ingress network boundaries.  This behavior is often\n   not
    strictly necessary to protect an operator's network resources,\n   and it impedes
    end-to-end experimentation of new differentiated\n   services.  This document
    recommends that Diffserv network operators\n   refrain from remarking packets
    received with an EXP/LU DSCP value\n   [RFC2474][RFC8436] that is not in use within
    the operator's network,\n   and recommends that operators forward these packets
    at each Diffserv\n   node (DS-node) using the Default \"best-effort\" PHB.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
