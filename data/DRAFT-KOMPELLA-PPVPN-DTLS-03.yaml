abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS, also known as Transparent LAN\nService)
    is a useful Service Provider offering.  A common scenario\nwhere this offering
    is made is in the metro area, where several\nMulti-Tenant buildings are connected
    to an Office, and several\nOffices are connected by a metro area network.  The
    Service Provider\nplaces a simple, low-cost box (MTU) in each building; these
    MTUs have\nuplinks to some box (PE) in one or more Offices.  In such a scenario,\nit
    is useful to decouple the functions needed to offer VPLS across\nthe MTU and PE;
    this document proposes one way of accomplishing that.\n\t </p>\n      "
