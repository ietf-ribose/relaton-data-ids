abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply
    mobility\n   management for mobile nodes (MN) in a local small area. If the\n
    \  multihomed MN attaches to multiple MAGs by multiple links, then the\n   mobility
    session in each link is independent. As the ongoing\n   communication interface
    breaking down, the mobility session in the\n   link is also broke and the traffic
    packets are lost. This document\n   mainly proposes a fault tolerant scheme. When
    an interface of the\n   multihomed MN broke down, the fault tolerant scheme can
    be used to\n   handover the interface and realize the flow migration and maintain\n
    \  the integrity of data transmission During the handover process.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
