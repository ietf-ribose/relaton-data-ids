abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture to construct a Point-to- Multipoint
    (P2MP) tree to deliver Multi-point services in a Segment Routing domain. A SR
    P2MP tree is constructed by stitching a set of Replication segments together.
    A SR Point-to-Multipoint (SR P2MP) Policy is used to define and instantiate a
    P2MP tree which is computed by a PCE.</p>"
