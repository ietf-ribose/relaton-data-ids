  content: "\t <t>There is no requirement for identities asserted by a UA in a SIPmessage
    to be anything other than the user's desired alias.A Network Asserted Identity
    is an identity initially derived by a SIPnetwork intermediary as a result of an
    authentication process. Thisdraft describes short term requirements for the exchange
    of NetworkAsserted Identities within networks of securely interconnectedtrusted
    nodes and to User Agents securely connected to such networks.</p>"
