abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>One of the potential problems with the \"map-and-encapsulate\"\napproaches
    to routing architecture is that there is a significant\nchance of packets being
    dropped while a mapping is being retrieved.\nSome approaches pre-load ingress
    tunnel routers with at least part of\nthe mapping database.  Some approaches try
    to solve this by providing\nintermediate \"default\" routers which have a great
    deal more knowledge\nthan a typical ingress tunnel router.  This document proposes
    a\nscheme which does not drop packets yet does not require a great deal\nof knowledge
    in any router.  However, there are still some issues\nthat need to be worked out.\n\t
