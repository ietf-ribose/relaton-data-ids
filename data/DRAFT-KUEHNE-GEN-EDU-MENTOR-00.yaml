abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Education and newcomer orientation activities have existed
    in the\n   IETF in various forms from the early 1990s (if not earlier). As the\n
    \  IETF and the world around us evolves, we are now rethinking what\n   types
    of activities are best suited for the future. A mentoring\n   program also exists
    at IETF that matches newcomers with experienced\n   IETF participants.  Mentoring
    is confined to on-site attendees.  This\n   draft proposes a merger of the mentoring
    and EDU functions as well as\n   potential new activities such as videos, webcasts,
    and remote\n   participation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
