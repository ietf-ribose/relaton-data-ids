abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) is a new MPLS paradigm in which each SR-capable\n
    \  router is required to advertise global MPLS labels or Segment IDs\n   (SID
    ) for its attached prefixes by using link-state IGPs, e.g., IS-\n   IS.  One major
    challenge associated with such global MPLS label or\n   SID advertisement mechanism
    is how to avoid a given global MPLS label\n   or SID from being allocated by different
    routers to different\n   prefixes.  Although such global label or SID allocation
    collision\n   problem can be addressed through manual allocation , it is error-\n
    \  prone and nonautomatic therefore may not be suitable in large-scale\n   SR
    network environments.  This document proposes an alternative\n   approach for
    allocating and advertising global MPLS labels or SIDs\n   via IS-IS so as to eliminate
    the potential risk of label allocation\n   collision.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
