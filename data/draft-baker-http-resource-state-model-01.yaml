abstract:
  content: "<p>The documented semantics of HTTP 1.1 methods, in particular POST,are
    not well understood, as demonstrated by debates such as whetherIPP should have
    used POST or a new method, how to properly bind SOAPto HTTP, and the ever more
    common use of POST for tunneling newprotocols such as XML-RPC. This note attempts
    to define an abstractmodel for the state of HTTP URI scheme addressable resourcesconsistent
    with HTTP 1.1, but hopefully more descriptive.</p>"
