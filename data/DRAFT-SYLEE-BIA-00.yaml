abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a mechanism of dual stack hosts using
    the\ntechnique called 'Bump-in-the-API' which allows for the hosts to\ncommunicate
    with other IPv6 hosts using existing IPv4 applications.\nThe goal of this mechanism
    is the same as the Bump-in-the-stack\nmechanism [BIS], but this mechanism provides
    the translation method\nbetween the IPv4 APIs and IPv6 APIs. So that the goal
    is achieved\nsimply without IP header translation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
