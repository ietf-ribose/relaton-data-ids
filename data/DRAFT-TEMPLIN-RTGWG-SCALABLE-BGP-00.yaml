abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) has well-known limitations
    in terms\n   of the numbers of routes that can be carried and stability of the\n
    \  routing system.  This is especially true when mobile nodes frequently\n   change
    their network attachment points, which in the past has\n   resulted in excessive
    announcements and withdrawals of de-aggregated\n   prefixes.  This document discusses
    a means of accommodating scalable\n   de-aggregation of IPv6 prefixes for overlay
    networks using BGP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
