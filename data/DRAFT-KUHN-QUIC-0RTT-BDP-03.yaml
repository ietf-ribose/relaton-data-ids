abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The time-to-service duration depends on both peers and the
    peer\n   initiating the connection may not be the peer actually sending data.\n
    \  Moreover, clients may be resource-limited, behind a low bandwidth or\n   a
    long-RTT network and may need adaptations to improve data\n   transmission or
    reception.  While each client and server can have its\n   dedicated solution to
    store path parameters, having a standard way of\n   exchanging this information
    helps in providing symmetrical control of\n   the optimisation and reducing protocol
    ossification.  QUIC may not be\n   limited to HTTP3: it can be used as a substrate
    for proxying and\n   tunneling.\n\n   This memo discusses a solution where the
    client is informed about\n   path parameters: both the client and the server can
    contribute to the\n   reduction of the time-to-service for subsequent connections.
    \ This\n   would improve symmetrical transmission of data and reduce\n   ossification
    of the protocol.  To improve the time-to-service of\n   subsequent 0-RTT reconnection
    the server currently sets in the\n   early_data extension the maximum volume of
    egress data the client is\n   allowed to send when reconnecting.  This memo proposes
    BDP_metadata,\n   an additional extension, to also inform the client about path\n
    \  parameters.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
