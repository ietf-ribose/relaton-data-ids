abstract:
- content: "<p>Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Networks
    Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN)
    is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer serves as the downstream
    CDN (dCDN). This document proposed extensions to the RFC8006 Metadata Model by
    way of a set of GenericMetadata objects that address extend the original CDNI
    capabilities to meet the more general needs of the CDN and Open Caching industry.
    Extensions to RFC8008 are also introduced to allow a dCDN to advertise support
    for these extended metadata capabilities.</p>"
