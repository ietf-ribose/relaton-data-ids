abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a methodology for benchmarking the Session\n
    \  Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance of devices.  Terminology\n   related
    to benchmarking SIP devices is described in the companion\n   terminology document.
    \ Using these two documents, benchmarks can be\n   obtained and compared for different
    types of devices such as SIP\n   Proxy Servers, Registrars and Session Border
    Controllers.  The term\n   \"performance\" in this context means the capacity
    of the device-under-\n   test (DUT) to process SIP messages.  Media streams are
    used only to\n   study how they impact the signaling behavior.  The intent of
    the two\n   documents is to provide a normalized set of tests that will enable
    an\n   objective comparison of the capacity of SIP devices.  Test setup\n   parameters
    and a methodology are necessary because SIP allows a wide\n   range of configuration
    and operational conditions that can influence\n   performance benchmark measurements.\n\n\t
