abstract:
  content: "<p>Digital signatures are used to sign messages, X.509 certificates and
    CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists). This document describes the conventions for
    using the SHAKE function family in Internet X.509 certificates and CRLs as one-way
    hash functions with the RSA Probabilistic signature and ECDSA signature algorithms.
    The conventions for the associated subject public keys are also described.</p>"
