abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is an implementation report for the Shortest
    Path\n   Routing Extensions to BGP protocol as defined in\n   [I-D.ietf-lsvr-bgp-spf].
    \ The authors did not verify the accuracy of\n   the information provided by respondents.
    \ The respondents are experts\n   with the implementations they reported on, and
    their responses are\n   considered authoritative for the implementations for which
    their\n   responses represent.  The respondents were asked to only use the\n   \"YES\"
    answer if the feature had at least been tested in the lab.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
