abstract:
  content: "<p>Online traffic load distribution for a single class of service hasbeen
    explored extensively given that extensions to IGP can provideloading information
    to network nodes. To perform trafficengineering of load distribution for multi-service
    networks, or offline traffic engineering of single service networks, a controlmechanism
    for provisioning bandwidth according to some policy mustbe provided. This draft
    identifies the mechanisms that affect loaddistribution and the controls for mechanisms
    that affect loaddistribution to enable policy based traffic engineering of the
    loaddistribution to be performed. This draft identifies the mechanismsthat affect
    load distribution and the control for those mechanismsto enable policy based traffic
    engineering of load distribution.This draft also presents guidelines for the use
    of these loaddistribution mechanisms in the context of single IP networkadministration.</p>"
