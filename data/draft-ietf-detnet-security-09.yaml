abstract:
- content: "<p>A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance guarantees
    to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency.
    As a result, securing a DetNet implies that in addition to the best practice security
    measures taken for any mission-critical network, additional security measures
    may be needed whose purpose is exclusively to secure the intended operation of
    these novel service properties. This document addresses specifically those security
    considerations, with the assumption that the reader is already familiar with network
    security best practices for the data plane technologies underlying a given DetNet
    implementation. This document defines a threat model and a taxonomy of relevant
    attacks, including their potential impacts and mitigations. A given DetNet may
    require securing only certain aspects of DetNet performance, for example extremely
    low data loss rates but not necessarily bounded latency. Therefore this document
    provides an association of threats against various use cases by industry, and
    also against the individual service properties as defined in the DetNet Use Cases.
    This document also addresses common DetNet security considerations related to
    the IP and MPLS data plane technologies (the first to be identified as supported
    by DetNet), thereby complementing the Security Considerations sections of the
    various DetNet Data Plane (and other) DetNet documents.</p>"
