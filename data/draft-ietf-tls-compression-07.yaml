abstract:
- content: "<p>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol (RFC 2246) includes features
    to negotiate selection of a lossless data compression method as part of the TLS
    Handshake Protocol and to then apply the algorithm associated with the selected
    method as part of the TLS Record Protocol. TLS defines one standard compression
    method which specifies that data exchanged via the record protocol will not be
    compressed. This document describes an additional compression method associated
    with a lossless data compression algorithm for use with TLS, and it describes
    a method for the specification of additional TLS compression methods. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
