abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There is an strong demand from IP network operators to obtain amethod
    to control the network resource and enhance networkperformance. The answer for
    this is Traffic Engineering. It isderived through the effort in MPLS wg. But current,
    the concept ofTraffic Engineering seems to be limited to a few keywords, namelyload
    balancing and restoration.The aim of this document is to enhance the concept of
    trafficengineering and point out some aspects of what it is capable of. Thegoal
    of this document is accomplished if this document couldenlighten the perspective
    of IP Traffic Engineering and show apossible direction.</p>"
