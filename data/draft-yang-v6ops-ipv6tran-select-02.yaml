abstract:
- content: "<p>Nowadays, many IPv6 transition technologies has been proposed, such
    as Dual-Stack, DS-Lite, 6rd and so on. An CPE may support some of them instead
    of only one. But ISPs usually deploy just an unique transition technology in an
    area, for example, under a BRAS/SR or in a MAN. So they must control all the CPEs
    to ues the exact transition tech through the CPEs' management system or configuring
    them before issuing to the customers. Another question is that if subscriber buy
    a new CPE from supermarket to substitute the one received from the ISP, he may
    not access internet because of the wrong configuration. To solve these problems,this
    document defines a new DHCP/DHCPv6 option named TRAN_TYPE which can control CPEs
    to select the appropriate IPv6 transition technology which ISP deployed instend
    of the CPEs' default configration. This method can also solve the configurating
    problem when various CPEs work together without a uniform configuration in advance.</p>"
