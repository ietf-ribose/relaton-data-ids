abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an Automatic Extended Route Optimization\n
    \  (AERO) service for IP internetworking over Overlay Multilink Network\n   (OMNI)
    interfaces.  AERO/OMNI use an IPv6 link-local address format\n   that supports
    operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol\n   and links ND to IP
    forwarding.  Prefix delegation/registration\n   services are employed for network
    admission and to manage the routing\n   system.  Secure multilink operation, mobility
    management, multicast,\n   quality of service (QoS) signaling and route optimization
    are\n   naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates.  AERO is\n
    \  a widely-applicable mobile internetworking service especially well-\n   suited
    to aviation services, intelligent transportation systems,\n   mobile Virtual Private
    Networks (VPNs) and many other applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
