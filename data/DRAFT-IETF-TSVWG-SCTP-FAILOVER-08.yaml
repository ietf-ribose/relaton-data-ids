abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the major advantages of SCTP is that it supports multi-homed\n
    \  communication.  A multi-homed SCTP end-point has the ability to\n   withstand
    network failures by migrating the traffic from an inactive\n   network to an active
    one.  However, if the [RFC4960] specified\n   failover operation is followed there
    can be a significant delay in\n   the migration to the active destination addresses,
    thus severely\n   reducing the effectiveness of SCTP multi-homed operation.\n\n
    \  The memo complements RFC4960 by the introduction of the Potentially\n   Failed
    state and associated new Quick Failover operation to apply\n   during network
    failure and specifies for SCTP senders to support this\n   more performance optimal
    failover procedure as an add-on to the\n   [RFC4960] failover operation.  The
    memo in addition complements\n   [RFC4960] by introduction of alternative switchover
    operation modes\n   for the data transfer path management after a failover.  These\n
    \  operation modes offer for more performance optimal operation in some\n   network
    environments.  From the perspective of this memo the\n   implementation of the
    additional switchover operation modes is\n   considered optional.\n\n   The procedures
    defined require only minimal modifications to the\n   current specification.  The
    procedures are sender-side only and do\n   not impact the SCTP receiver.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
