abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Route Reflection based Traffic Steering (RRTS) is an idea that\n
    \  leverages the BGP route reflection mechanism to realize traffic\n   steering
    in the network, therefore the operators can conduct their\n   traffic to transmit/receive
    through specific nodes, domains and/or\n   planes as demand.  This document introduces
    the requirements and use\n   cases of RRTS.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
