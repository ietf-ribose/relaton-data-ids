abstract:
- content: "<p>Model driven service and network management provides a programmatic
    and standards-based way of representing virtual services or networks and configuration
    to the network device that are used to construct the service. It can be used at
    various phases of service and network management life cycle such as service instantiation,
    service provision, optimization, monitoring, and diagnostic. Also, it can be designed
    to automate network management and provide closed-loop control for the sake of
    agile service creation, delivery and maintenance. This document provides a framework
    that describes and discusses an architecture for service and network management
    automation with YANG Modeling technologies. An applicability of YANG data model
    to automation of virtualized network service is also investigated.</p>"
