abstract:
- content: "<p>Perhaps the most common use of IPsec is in providing virtual private
    networking capabilities. One very popular use of VPNs is to provide tele-commuter
    access to the corporate Intranet. Today NATs are widely deployed in home gateways,
    as well as in other locations likely to be used by tele-commuters, such as hotels.
    The result is that IPsec-NAT incompatibilities have become a major barrier to
    deployment of IPsec in one of its principal uses. This draft describes known incompatibilities
    between NAT and IPsec, and describes the requirements for addressing them.</p>"
