abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Due to the way the IRC protocol is implemented, it may occur that
    a\nserver sends incomplete messages to a client, so called continuation\nmessage
    lines.\nThere seems to exist confusion about how to handle continuation\nmessage
    lines; many implementations are broken and do not respect\nthem at all. Others
    rely on timers to complete continuation lines,\nwhich is not recommended due to
    the asyncronous nature of IRC\ncommunications.\nThis Memo proposes an algorithm
    to handle continuation lines received\nfrom an IRC connection in such way that
    no timers are needed, and is\nintended as a supplement to the existing RFC 1459
    which describes the\nInternet Relay Chat protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
