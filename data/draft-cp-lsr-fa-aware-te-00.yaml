abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo]proposes a solution that allows IGPs themselves
    to compute constraint based paths over the network, and it also specifies a way
    of using Segment Routing (SR) Prefix-SIDs and SRv6 locators to steer packets along
    the constraint-based paths. [RFC8570] describes IS-IS extensions to distribute
    network- performance information (such as residual bandwidth, and available bandwidth).
    This draft describes the IGP extensions to advertise the corresponding network-performance
    information of the Flex-Algorithm.</p>"
