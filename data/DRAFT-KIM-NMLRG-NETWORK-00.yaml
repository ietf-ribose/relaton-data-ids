abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes agent reinforcement learning (RL) in
    a\n   distributed environment to transfer or share information for\n   autonomous
    shortest path-planning over a communication network.  The\n   centralized node,
    which is the main node to manage agent workflow in\n   hybrid peer-to-peer environment,
    provides a cumulative reward for\n   each action that a given agent takes with
    respect to an optimal path\n   based on a to-be-learned policy over the learning
    process.  A reward\n   from the centralized node is reflected when an agent explores
    to\n   reach its destination for autonomous shortest path-planning in\n   distributed
    nodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
