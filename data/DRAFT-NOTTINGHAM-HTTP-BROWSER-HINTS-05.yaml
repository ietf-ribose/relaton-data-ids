abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Over time, HTTP clients -- especially Web browsers -- have
    adapted\n   how they use the protocol based upon common server configurations
    and\n   behaviours.  While this is necessary in the common case, it can be\n   detrimental
    for performance and interoperability.\n\n   This document establishes a mechanism
    whereby both origin servers and\n   intermediaries can make hints available to
    clients about their\n   preferences and capabilities, without imposing undue overhead
    on\n   their interactions or requiring support for them.\n\n   This is intended
    to allow clients to safely optimise connections to\n   servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
