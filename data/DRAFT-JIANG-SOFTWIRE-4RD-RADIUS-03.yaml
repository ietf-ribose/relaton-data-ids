abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv4 Residual Deployment via IPv6 (4rd) is a stateless mechanism
    for\n   running IPv4 over IPv6-only infrastructure. It provides both IPv4 and\n
    \  IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-\n   existing
    period. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6\n   (DHCPv6) 4rd options
    has been defined to configure 4rd Customer Edge\n   (CE). However, in many networks,
    the configuration information may be\n   stored in Authentication Authorization
    and Accounting (AAA) servers\n   while user configuration is mainly from Broadband
    Network Gateway\n   (BNG) through DHCPv6 protocol. This document defines a Remote\n
    \  Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries\n   4rd
    configuration information from AAA server to BNG. The 4rd RADIUS\n   attribute
    are designed following the simplify principle. It provides\n   just enough information
    to form the correspondent DHCPv6 4rd option.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
