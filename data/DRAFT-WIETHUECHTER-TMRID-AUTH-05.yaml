abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to include trust into the proposed
    ASTM\n   Remote ID specification defined in WK65041 by the F38 Committee under\n
    \  a Broadcast Remote ID (RID) scenario.  It defines a few different\n   message
    schemes (based on the authentication message) that can be\n   used to assure past
    messages sent by a UA and also act as an\n   assurance for UA trustworthiness
    in the absence of Internet\n   connectivity at the receiving node.\n\n\t </p>\n
