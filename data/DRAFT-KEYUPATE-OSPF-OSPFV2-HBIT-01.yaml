abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OSPFv3 [RFC5340] defines an option field for router-LSAs known
    as a\n   R-bit.  If the R-bit is clear, an OSPFv3 router can participate in\n
    \  OSPF topology distribution without acting as a forwarder to forward\n   the
    transit traffic.  In such cases, an OSPF router would only accept\n   traffic
    intended for local delivery.  This draft defines R-bit\n   functionality for OSPFv2
    defined in [RFC2328].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
