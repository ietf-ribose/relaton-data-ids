abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In IPv6 networks Router Advertisements can be used for providing\n
    \  common configuration information to nodes that are attached.  There\n   are
    some scenarios where it is advantageous for routers to provide\n   their uplink
    access technology information to attached hosts.  This\n   document describes
    a neighbor discovery option that will allow the\n   routers to do so.\n\n\t </p>\n
