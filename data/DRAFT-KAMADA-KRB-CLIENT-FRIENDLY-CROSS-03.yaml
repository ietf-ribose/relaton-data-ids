abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a cross-realm traversal model, which
    is\n   suitable for resource-limited clients, for Kerberos Version 5.  This\n
    \  model relieves the clients of the traversal cost by two means.  One\n   moves
    the cost of consecutive Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) exchanges\n   from clients
    to Key Distribution Centers (KDCs).  The other reduces\n   the traversal cost
    itself by generating a direct inter-realm\n   relationship between two realms.
    \ The document describes behavior of\n   clients and KDCs, but does not specify
    any wire format, which need to\n   be specified separately.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
