abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)and RESTCONF provides\n
    \  mechanisms to manipulate configuration datastores.  NMDA introduces\n   additional
    datastores for systems that support more advanced\n   processing chains converting
    configuration to operational state.\n   However, client applications are not able
    to be aware of common\n   events in these additional datstores of the management
    system, such\n   as a intended configuration state change in NETCONF server or\n
    \  RESTCONF server, that may impact management applications,especially\n   when
    a server is managed by multiple clients or management\n   applications.  This
    document define a YANG module that allows a\n   client to receive additional notifications
    for some common system\n   events pertaining to the Network Management Datastore
    Architecture\n   (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
