abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet of Things (IoT) technology promises to connect
    billions\n   of objects to Internet.  Today, the IoT landscape is very fragmented\n
    \  from both the technology and service perspectives.  As a consequence,\n   it
    is difficult to integrate and cross-correlate data coming from the\n   heterogeneous
    contexts and build value-added services on top.  This\n   reason has motivated
    the current trend to develop a unified de-\n   fragmented IoT architecture so
    that objects can be made accessible to\n   applications across organizations and
    domains.  Several proposals\n   have been made to build a unified IoT architecture
    as an overlay on\n   top of today's Internet.  Such overlay solutions, however,
    inherit\n   the existing limitations of the IP protocol: mobility, security,\n
    \  scalability, and communication reliability.  To address this problem,\n   A
    unified IoT architecture based on the Information Centric\n   Networking (ICN)
    architecture, which we call ICN-IoT [1] has been\n   proposed.  ICN-IoT leverages
    the salient features of ICN, and thus\n   provides seamless device-to-device (D2D)
    communication, mobility\n   support, scalability, and efficient content and service
    delivery.\n   Furthermore, in order to guarantee the real diffusion of ICN-IoT\n
    \  architecture it is fundamental to deal with self-configuring features\n   such
    as device onboarinding and discovery, service discovery,\n   scalability, security
    and privacy requirements, content\n   dissemmination since the IoT system will
    comprise of diverse\n   applications with heterogenous requirements including
    connectivity,\n   resource constraints and mobility.  Towards this, the draft\n
    \  elaborates on a set of middleware functions to enable large operation\n   of
    an ICN-IoT deployment.\n\n   This draft begins by motivating the need for an unified
    ICN-IoT\n   architecture to connect heterogeneous IoT systems.  We then propose\n
    \  an ICN-IoT system architecture and middleware components which\n   includes
    device/network-service discovery, naming service, IoT\n   service discovery, data
    discovery, user registration, and content\n   delivery.  For all of these components,
    discussions for secure\n   solutions are offered.  We also provide discussions
    on inter-\n   connecting heterogeneous ICN-IoT domains.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
