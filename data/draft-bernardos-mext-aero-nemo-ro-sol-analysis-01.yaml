abstract:
  content: "<p>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roamand
    attach to different access networks without disrupting theongoing sessions that
    nodes of the mobile network may have. Byextending the Mobile IPv6 support to Mobile
    Routers, nodes of themobile network are not required to support any kind of mobility,since
    packets go through the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA) bi-directional tunnel.
    Data packets belonging to communications ofnodes of the mobile network have to
    traverse the Home Agent, andtherefore resulting paths are likely to be suboptimal.
    Additionally,the solution adds packet overhead, due to the use of encapsulationbetween
    the Mobile Router and the Home Agent.There are currently a set of well defined
    NEMO Route Optimizationrequirements for Operational Use in Aeronautics and SpaceExploration,
    which potential solutions should meet. This documentanalyses how the problem of
    NEMO RO for Aeronautics Mobile Networksmight be tackled, in a way as generic as
    possible, trying to identifythose open questions and deployment considerations
    that need to beaddressed.The main goal of this document is to foster the discussion
    aboutaeronautics NEMO RO solution space within the MEXT WG.</p>"
