abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used for interactive multimedia
    communication applications. A congestion control algorithm is typically required
    by these applications. To ensure seamless and robust user experience, a well-designed
    RTP-based congestion control algorithm should work well across all access network
    types. This document describes test cases for evaluating performances of such
    congestion control algorithms over LTE and Wi-Fi networks.</p>"
