abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Given the open nature of the Internet today, application protocols\nrequire
    strong security.  IPsec's wire protocols appear to meet the\nrequirements of many
    protocols.  The lack of a common model for\napplication-layer interfaces has complicated
    use of IPsec by upper-\nlayer protocols.  This document provides an overview of
    facilities\nwhich a host IPsec implementation should provide to applications to\nallow
    them to both observe and influence how IPsec protects their\ncommunications.\n\t
