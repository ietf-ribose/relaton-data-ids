abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes making the transition to IPv6 in Third
    \nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) General Packet Radio Service \n(GPRS)
    packet networks. The focus is on analyzing different \ntransition scenarios, applicable
    transition mechanisms and finding \nsolutions for those transition scenarios.
    In these scenarios, the \nUser Equipment (UE) connects to nodes in other networks,
    e.g. in \nthe Internet, and IPv6/IPv4 transition mechanisms are needed.\n\t </p>\n
