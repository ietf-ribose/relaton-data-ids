abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines a profile of the Automatic Certificate Management\n
    \  Environment (ACME) protocol by which the owner of an identifier\n   (e.g.,
    a domain name) can allow a third party to obtain an X.509\n   certificate such
    that the certificate subject is the delegated\n   identifier while the certified
    public key corresponds to a private\n   key controlled by the third party.  A
    primary use case is that of a\n   Content Delivery Network (CDN, the third party)
    terminating TLS\n   sessions on behalf of a content provider (the owner of a domain\n
    \  name).  The presented mechanism allows the owner of the identifier to\n   retain
    control over the delegation and revoke it at any time.  A key\n   property of
    this mechanism is it does not require any modification to\n   the deployed TLS
    ecosystem.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
