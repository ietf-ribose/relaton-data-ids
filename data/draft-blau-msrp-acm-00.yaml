abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an alternative connection model for MSRP UAs.
    The model differs from the standard MSRP model, as defined in RFC4975 and RFC4976,
    in that it uses SDP in a more conventional way when it comes to conveying endpoint
    address information, and also uses mainstream mechanisms for NAT traversal instead
    of using MSRP relays.</p>"
