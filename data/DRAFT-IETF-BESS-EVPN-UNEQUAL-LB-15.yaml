abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EVPN enables all-active multi-homing for a CE device connected
    to two\n   or more PEs via a LAG, such that bridged and routed traffic from\n
    \  remote PEs to hosts attached to the Ethernet Segment can be equally\n   load
    balanced (it uses Equal Cost Multi Path) across the multi-homing\n   PEs.  EVPN
    also enables multi-homing for IP subnets advertised in IP\n   Prefix routes, so
    that routed traffic from remote PEs to those IP\n   subnets can be load balanced.
    \ This document defines extensions to\n   EVPN procedures to optimally handle
    unequal access bandwidth\n   distribution across a set of multi-homing PEs in
    order to:\n\n   *  provide greater flexibility, with respect to adding or removing\n
    \     individual multi-homed PE-CE links.\n\n   *  handle multi-homed PE-CE link
    failures that can result in unequal\n      PE-CE access bandwidth across a set
    of multi-homing PEs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
