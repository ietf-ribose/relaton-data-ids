abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network administrators typically provision QoS policies for
    their\n   application traffic (such as voice, video) based on SLAs negotiated\n
    \  with their providers, and translate those SLAs to vendor specific\n   configuration
    language.  Both learning of SLA, either thru SLA\n   documents or via some other
    out-of-band method, and translating them\n   to vendor specific configuration
    language is a complex, many times\n   manual, process and prone to errors.  This
    document proposes an in-\n   band method of SLA signaling which can help to simplify
    some of the\n   complexities.\n\n   This document defines an operational transitive
    attribute to signal\n   SLA details in-band, across administrative boundaries
    (considered as\n   Autonomous Systems (AS)), and thus simplify/speed-up some of
    the\n   complex tasks.\n\n   Though the use-case with the proposed attribute is
    explicitly defined\n   in this document, purpose of this attribute is not limited
    to this\n   use-case only.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
