abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents edge-assisted marked flow termination (EMFT)\n
    \  for PCN.  It assumes packet-size independent excess marking, i.e.\n   packets
    exceeding the supportable rate (SR) of a link are marked as\n   \"excess-traffic\"
    (ET).  EMFT terminates only flows with at least one\n   ET-marked packet.  The
    problem is to avoid that all flows with ET-\n   marked packets are terminated.
    \ This draft proposes two solutions.\n   Flow-based EMFT (F-EMFT) considers single
    flows separately and\n   terminates them when sufficiently many packets of them
    have been\n   received by the PCN egress node with an ET-mark.  Aggregate-based\n
    \  EMFT (A-EMFT) considers ingress-egress-aggregates and terminates\n   flows
    thereof sufficiently many ET-marked packets have been received\n   for that aggregate.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
