abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In developing a solution for CDN Internetworking it is necessary
    to \ndefine and accommodate requirements for Authentication, Authorization,\nand
    Accounting. Since the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting\n(AAA) working
    group is already focused on defining these requirements, \nthis document attempts
    to leverage that work. It contains the \nrequirements that would have to be supported
    by a AAA service to \nformulate a solution for CDN peering.\n\t </p>\n      "
