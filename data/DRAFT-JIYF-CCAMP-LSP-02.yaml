abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the increment of network scale, optical networks need to
    be\n   partitioned into multi-layer and multi-domain networks for the\n   purpose
    of better management.  Meanwhile, as the variety of user\n   requests, different
    LSPs need to be established.  In order to meet\n   different requirements of users,
    the LSP establishment performance is\n   necessary to be measured in multi-layer
    and multi-domain networks.\n   For this reason, typical performance measurement
    metrics need to be\n   proposed.  In this document, the LSP establishment delay
    and bit\n   error ratio (BER), which are both as the performance measurement\n
    \  metrics, are illustrated, and the definition and methodologies are\n   proposed.\n\n\t
