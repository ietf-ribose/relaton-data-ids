abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The AFS-3 protocol supports file locks, but only on whole \nfiles,
    only in advisory mode. Efficient support for byte-range \nfile locking, together
    with the stronger semantics with which \nthey are associated, are required to
    improve the suitability of \nAFS as a LAN file-sharing protocol for both Unix
    and Windows \nclients. Applications on the Windows platform, in particular \n(e.g.,
    Microsoft Office), actually require byte-range locking \nto function correctly.
    Emulation in the client has alleviated \nmost serious problems, albeit, with reduced
    semantics. We \npropose protocol enhancements facilitating server-coordinated
    \nbyte-range locks, atomic lock up/down-grade support, improved \nsemantics for
    files under byte-range lock control, protocol \nsupport for wait-on-lock with
    fairness, and mandatory lock \nenforcement for clients on request. The delegation
    proposal, \nincluded within this document in previous drafts, has been \nsplit
    out into a separate proposal, based on feedback from \nreviewers.\n\t </p>\n      "
