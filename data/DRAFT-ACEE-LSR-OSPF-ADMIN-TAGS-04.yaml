abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain
    to be\n   able to associate tags with prefixes.  Previously, OSPFv2 and OSPFv3\n
    \  were relegated to a single tag for AS External and Not-So-Stubby-Area\n   (NSSA)
    prefixes.  With the flexible encodings provided by OSPFv2\n   Prefix Attribute
    Advertisement and OSPFv3 Extended LSAs, multiple\n   administrative tags may advertised
    for all types of prefixes.  These\n   administrative tags can be used for many
    applications including route\n   redistribution policy, selective prefix prioritization,
    selective IP\n   Fast-ReRoute (IPFRR) prefix protection, and many others.\n\n
    \  The ISIS protocol supports a similar mechanism that is described in\n   RFC
    5130.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
