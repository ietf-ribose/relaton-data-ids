abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>All IP mobility protocols currently proposed on the IETF assume
    that \nthe mobile nodes always have a mobility-aware IP stack, which is \nstill
    a scenario that can seldom be found nowadays. Most terminals, \nincluding the
    laptops and PDAs which most would benefit of the \nmobility support, still use
    legacy IP stacks, limiting their use to \nlayer-2 mobility within a single IP
    subnet.  \nThis document presents Terminal Independent Mobile IP (TIMIP), which
    \nsupports IP micro-mobility of all possible existing legacy IP \nterminals, while
    fully interoperating with Mobile IP to provide \nmacromobility across IP subnets
    for all terminals. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
