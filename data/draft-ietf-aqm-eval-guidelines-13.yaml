abstract:
- content: "<p>Unmanaged large buffers in today's networks have given rise to a slew
    of performance issues. These performance issues can be addressed by some form
    of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism, optionally in combination with a packet-scheduling
    scheme such as fair queuing. This document describes various criteria for performing
    characterizations of AQM schemes that can be used in lab testing during development,
    prior to deployment.</p>"
