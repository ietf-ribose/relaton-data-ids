abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses and defines a framework for cyberspace resource
    property description, which is suitable for the unified classification organization
    and description of multi-source network resource measurement information. Now,
    there is no unified description framework for network resource property. The objective
    of this draft is to establish a general model based on cyberspace identification
    reference, and implement the reuse of survey data in different users and occasions.
    Then discuss the basic methodology and propose a less mature framework for further
    complement and improvement</p>"
