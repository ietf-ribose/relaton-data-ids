abstract:
- content: "<p>Current location configuration protocols are capable of provisioning
    an Internet host with a location URI that refers to the host's location. These
    protocols lack a mechanism for the target host to inspect or set the privacy rules
    that are applied to the URIs they distribute. This document extends the current
    location configuration protocols to provide hosts with a reference to the rules
    that are applied to a URI, so that the host can view or set these rules.</p>"
