abstract:
- content: "<p>This document intends to find out the size of an IP packet at which
    VoIP applications will produce the best result. It emphasizes the physical phenomenon
    because of which ATM networks perform better than the IP switch based networks
    and tries to come out with an approach by which IP switch based network can perform
    as good as ATM network for the processing of real time traffic.</p>"
