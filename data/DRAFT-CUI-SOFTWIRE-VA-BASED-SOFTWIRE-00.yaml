abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The increasing deployment of IPv6 networks in both customer networks\nand
    ISP networks leads to two common traversing transition scenarios:\nin the first
    scenario, an IPv6-only backbone network needs to provide\nIP connectivity between
    IPv4 networks, we call it IPv4-over-IPv6\nscenario; In the second scenario, IPv6
    networks need to be\ninterconnected over an IPv4 transit network, we call it IPv6-over-\nIPv4
    scenario.  In both scenarios, the ISP operating the transit\nnetwork of one address
    family must offer transit services for\nattached client networks of the other
    address family.  The Softwire\nWG has defined softwire mesh mechanism [RFC5565]
    for the two\ntraversing scenarios.  Softwire mesh uses automatic softwire tunnels\nemploying
    multi-protocol BGP extensions for distributing E-IP routes,\nwhere both BGP peers
    and tunnels between PEs forms a full-mesh\narchitecture.\n\nInspired by the Virtual
    Aggregation approach [I-D.ietf-grow-va] to\nIPv4 routing scalability, in this
    draft we proposed a scalable\nmechanism for distributing E-IP routes over the
    transit network.  Our\nsolution can significantly reduce the forwarding information
    base\n(FIB) size at Address Family Border Routers (AFBRs) as well as the\ntotal
    amount of routing updates, and offers the ISP an easy way to\nmanage the transit
    service.\n\t </p>\n      "
