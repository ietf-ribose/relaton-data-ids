abstract:
  content: "<p>IMAP4 is being used to serve rich media content in environmentsthat
    extend beyond traditional text-based e-mail. One example is acellular telephone
    that can retrieve and send MIME-encoded audiodata through IMAP4. While this type
    of content can be exchangednatively using IMAP4, some applications will work better
    if themessage content can be manipulated using schemes external to theIMAP4 connection.
    In our cellular telephone example, it might bepreferable for the telephone client
    to retrieve the audio datausing RTSP. This specifications defines a mechanism
    for an IMAP4client to request message content from a server through an externalscheme.</p>"
