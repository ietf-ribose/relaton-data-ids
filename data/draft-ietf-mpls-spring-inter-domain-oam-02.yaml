abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) architecture leverages source routing and tunneling
    paradigms and can be directly applied to the use of a Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) data plane. A network may consist of multiple IGP domains or multiple ASes
    under the control of same organization. It is useful to have the Label switched
    Path (LSP) Ping and traceroute procedures when an SR end-to-end path spans across
    multiple ASes or domains. This document describes mechanisms to facilitae LSP
    ping and traceroute in inter-AS/inter-domain SR-MPLS networks in an efficient
    manner with simple Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocol
    extension which uses dataplane forwarding alone for sending echo reply.</p>"
