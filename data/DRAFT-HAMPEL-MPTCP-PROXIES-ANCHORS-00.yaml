abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MPTCP proxies and anchors are network-based functions, which
    support\n   MPTCP connections.  The MPTCP proxy provides multipath support for\n
    \  MPTCP-capable hosts on behalf of their MPTCP-unaware peers.  This\n   facilitates
    incremental deployment of MPTCP.  The MPTCP anchor\n   permits subflow establishment
    for MPTCP connections when direct\n   interaction between end hosts fails.  This
    permits tolerance to local\n   IP protocol restrictions and it provides robustness
    in case of break-\n   before-make mobility events.  MPTCP proxies and anchors
    are\n   especially suited for wireless access environments.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
