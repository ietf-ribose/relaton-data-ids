abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SMTP STARTTLS option, used in negotiating transport-level\n
    \  encryption of SMTP connections, is not as useful from a security\n   standpoint
    as it might be because of its opportunistic nature;\n   message delivery is prioritized
    over security.  This document\n   describes a complementary SMTP service extension,
    REQUIRETLS.  If the\n   REQUIRETLS option is used when sending a message, it asserts
    a\n   request on the part of the message sender to override the default\n   negotiation
    of TLS, either by requiring that TLS be negotiated when\n   the message is relayed,
    or by requesting that policy mechanisms such\n   as SMTP STS and DANE be ignored
    when relaying a high priority\n   message.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
