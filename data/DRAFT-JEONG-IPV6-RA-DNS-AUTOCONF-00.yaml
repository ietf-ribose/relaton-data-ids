abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the steps a node takes in deciding how
    to \nautoconfigure its domain name per interface in IP version 6 and the \naddress
    of recursive DNS server.  The autoconfiguration process \nincludes a node's creating
    a domain name for its global address, \nverifying the uniqueness of the name in
    the domain where it is placed \nand registering both the regular domain name and
    inverse domain name \ninformation of the node with DNS server automatically.  Also,
    it \nautoconfigures the address of recursive DNS server for DNS name \nresolution.
    \n\t </p>\n      "
