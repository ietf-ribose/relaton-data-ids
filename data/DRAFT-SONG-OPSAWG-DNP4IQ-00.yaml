abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the motivation and requirements for\n
    \  supporting interactive network queries and data collection through a\n   mechanism
    called Dynamic Network Probes (DNP).  Network applications\n   and OAM have various
    data requirements from the data plane.  The\n   unpredictable and interactive
    nature of the query for network data\n   analytics asks for dynamic and on-demand
    data collection\n   capabilities.  As user programmable data plane is becoming
    a reality,\n   it can be enhanced to support interactive query through DNPs.  DNP\n
    \  supports node, path, and flow-based data preprocessing and\n   collection.
    \ For example, in-situ OAM (iOAM) with user-defined flow-\n   based data collection
    can be programmed and configured through DNP.\n   DNPs serve as a building block
    of an integrated network data\n   telemetry and analytics platform which involves
    the network data\n   plane as an active component for user-defined data collection
    and\n   preparation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
