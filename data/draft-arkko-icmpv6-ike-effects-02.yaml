abstract:
  content: "<p>The ICMPv6 protocol provides many functions which in IPv4 were eithernon-existent
    or provided by lower layers. IPv6 architecture alsomakes it possible to secure
    all IP packets using IPsec, even ICMPv6messages. IPsec architecture has a Security
    Policy Database thatspecifies which traffic is protected, and how. It turns out
    that thespecification of policies in the presence of ICMPv6 traffic is hard,particularly
    with ICMPv6 packets related to Neighbor Discovery.Sound looking policies may easily
    lead to loops: The establishment ofsecurity requires Neighbor Discovery messages
    which can not be sentsince security has not been established yet. The purpose
    of thisdraft is to inform system administrators and IPsec implementors inwhich
    manner they can handle the ICMPv6 messages. Commonunderstanding of the way that
    these messages are handled is alsonecessary for interoperability, in case vendors
    hardcode such rulesin to products.</p>"
