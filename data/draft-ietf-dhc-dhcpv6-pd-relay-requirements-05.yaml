abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes operational problems that are known to occur
    when using DHCPv6 relays with prefix delegation. These problems can prevent successful
    delegation and result in routing failures. To address these problems, this document
    provides necessary functional requirements for operating DHCPv6 relays with prefix
    delegation. It is recommended that any network operator using DHCPv6 prefix delegation
    with relays ensure that these requirements are followed on their networks.</p>"
