abstract:
  content: "<p>Consider a situation which will arise in many IPv6 transitionscenarios,
    where Network A, to which a host is attached, supports oneIP version, but the
    host and Network B support a different IPversion. Suppose that the host wishes
    to access a multicast groupwhich is rooted or sourced in Network B. This document
    specifies astateful translation mechanism whereby the host can obtain itsdesired
    access using the native multicast capabilities of Network A.</p>"
