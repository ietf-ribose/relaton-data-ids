abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a mechanism
    to load\n   balance traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).  An ingress Label\n
    \  Switching Router (LSR) cannot insert ELs for packets going into a\n   given
    tunnel unless an egress LSR has indicated via signaling that it\n   has the capability
    of processing ELs, referred to as Entropy Label\n   Capability (ELC), on that
    tunnel.  In addition, it would be useful\n   for ingress LSRs to know each LSR's
    capability of reading the maximum\n   label stack depth, referred to as Readable
    Label-stack Depth (RLD),\n   in the cases where stacked LSPs are used for whatever
    reasons.  This\n   document defines mechanisms to signal these two capabilities
    using\n   OSPF.  These mechanisms are useful when the label advertisement is\n
    \  also done via OSPF.  In addition, this document introduces the Router\n   Non-OSPF
    Functional Capabilities TLV for advertising OSPF router's\n   actual non-OSPF
    functional capabilities.  ELC is one of such non-OSPF\n   functional capabilities.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
