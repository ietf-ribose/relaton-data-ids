abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OpenPGP transferable public keys are composite certificates,
    made up\n   of primary keys, user IDs, identity certifications (\"signature\n
    \  packets\"), subkeys, and so on.  They are often assembled by merging\n   multiple
    certificates that all share the same primary key, and\n   distributed in public
    keystores.\n\n   Unfortunately, since any third-party can add certifications with
    any\n   content to any OpenPGP certificate, the assembled/merged form of a\n   certificate
    can become unwieldy or undistributable.\n\n   This draft documents techniques
    that an archive of OpenPGP\n   certificates can use to mitigate the impact of
    these third-party\n   certificate flooding attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
