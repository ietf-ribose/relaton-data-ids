abstract:
  content: "<p>There has been discussion within the IETF IPv6 community for sometime
    regarding whether or not to define Centrally Assigned UniqueLocal Addresses (ULA-Cs).
    Although many arguments both for andagainst the definition of ULA-Cs have been
    raised and repeated, ourdiscussions have not resulted in consensus about whether
    or not todefine this new address type. This document will summarize thearguments
    for and against the allocation of ULA-Cs, in an attempt tohelp the IETF IPv6 community
    reach a decision on this issue.</p>"
