abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The concept of \"make-before-break (MBB)\" while rerouting
    MPLS RSVP-TE\n   tunnels is discussed in [RFC3209].  In the procedure that is\n
    \  outlined, the behaviour of downstream label assignment for the new\n   LSP
    (new tunnel instance) is not well defined.  As a general\n   practice, a different
    label is assigned by each downstream router and\n   advertised to the upstream
    router in the RESV message for the new\n   LSP; this results in a separate end-to-end
    data-plane path for the\n   new LSP (with the exception of PHP LSPs or UHP LSP
    with explicit\n   label on the last hop).  The consequence of this practice is
    that the\n   label entry gets added/deleted in the LFIB at every non-ingress\n
    \  router along the LSP path during MBB.  Also, the ingress router would\n   need
    to update all the applications using this LSP when switching to\n   the new tunnel
    instance, as the new tunnel instance uses different\n   outgoing label.  This
    in turn may also cause other elements of the\n   network which are dependant on
    the LSP to do the update.\n\n   Such network churn can be avoided or reduced if
    the same label can\n   be re-used (kept intact) wherever it is affecting neither
    the routing\n   functionalities nor the data path verification of each instance.\n
    \  This document proposes a set of procedures to facilitate label reuse\n   when
    there is a total or partial path overlap between the two tunnel\n   instances
    during MBB.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
