abstract:
- content: "<p>Source address spoofing remains a significant challenge in today's
    Internet. Although source address validation (SAV) mechanisms, such as ingress
    filtering [RFC2827], unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF)[RFC3704], and the
    Enhanced Feasible-Path Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (EFP-uRPF) [RFC8704], have
    been proposed for a long time, none of them have been widely deployed due to their
    technical limitations, lack of incentive, or other problems. This document specifically
    explains the incentive problem of existing SAV mechanisms and clarifies the incentive
    that SAVNET hopes to achieve.</p>"
