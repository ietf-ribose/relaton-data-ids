    filtering in IPv6 environment. These include slight ambiguityin the IPv6 specification,
    problems parsing packets beyond unknownExtension Headers and Destination Options,
    and introduction of end-to-end encrypted traffic and peer-to-peer applications.
    There mayalso be need to extend packet matching to include some ExtensionHeader
    or Destination Option fields. This draft discusses theseissues to raise awareness
    and proposes some tentative solutions orworkarounds.</p>"
