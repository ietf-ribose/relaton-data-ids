abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Resource reservation needs to accommodate the rapidly growing sizeand
    increasing service diversity of the Internet. This memo firstdefines the scaling
    problem in today's Internet backbone, and brieflydiscusses several existing resource
    management approaches. Then wewill present a distributed approach and introduce
    a protocol, calledthe Border Gateway Reservation Protocol (BGRP), for inter-domainresource
    reservation that can scale in terms of message processingload, state storage and
    control message bandwidth.The main idea of our approach is to build a sink tree
    for each domainnetwork. Each sink tree aggregates reservations from all datasources
    in the network. Sink tree initiation, maintenance andtermination involve only
    backbone border routers. Within each domain,the network service providers manage
    network resource and direct usertraffic independently. At the border routers,
    the service providerscan use BGRP to setup domain-level reservation trunks base
    on bi-lateral agreement. Since routers only maintain the sink treeinformation,
    the total number of reservation states at each routerscales, in the worst case,
    linearly with the number of domains in theInternet.For bandwidth reservation,
    BGRP relies on differentiated services fordata forwarding. As a result, the number
    of packet classifier entriesis small. To reduce the protocol message traffic,
    routers mayreserve domain bandwidth beyond the current load so that sources canjoin
    or leave the tree or change their reservation without having tosend messages all
    the way to the root for every such change.</p>"
