abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework and information model for the definition
    of northbound interfaces for a security policy controller. The interfaces are
    based on user-intent instead of vendor-specific or device-centric approaches that
    would require deep knowledge of vendor products and their security features. The
    document identifies the common interfaces needed to enforce the user-intent-based
    policies onto network security functions (NSFs) irrespective of how those functions
    are realized. The function may be physical or virtual in nature and may be implemented
    in networking or dedicated appliances.</p>"
