abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of this Internet Draft is  to  start  discussion
    \ on  the\n   issues  involved  in  Internet Call Waiting Service (ICW), as part
    of\n   interconnecting IP and Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN)  with\n
    \  the  intent  of providing ICW service that is much needed by numerous\n   dial-up
    Internet users.  Interworking of the  IP  network  and  GSTN,\n   based  on  open
    well-defined protocols, will promote interoperability\n   of both the networks
    and systems built by different  vendors.    This\n   Internet   Draft   is   submitted
    \  with  the  goal  of  becoming  an\n   informational RFC. \n\n  The rest of
    this document is as follows:\n \n   Section  2  briefly  describes  the  services
    \ offered  to  the   end\n   Subscriber. It is the support of these services that
    necessitates the\n   proposed internetworking project. \n  \n   Section  3 describes
    the scope of the proposed project by introducing\n   its  overall  architecture,
    \ identifying   the   interfaces   to   be\n   standardized, describing experience
    with SIP for ICW. \n  \n   Sections  4,  5,  and 6 respectively address security
    considerations,\n   supply references, and provide the authors address,  as  required
    \ by\n   [1]. \n  \n   Section  7  acknowledges  individuals  providing  assistance
    \ in  the\n   creation of this document. \n  \n   Section 8 is the Appendix, which
    contains IN Tutorial and Figure A.\n  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
