abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the most common scenarios of connecting
    an\n   enterprise network to multiple ISPs using an address space assigned\n   by
    an ISP.  The problem of enterprise multihoming without address\n   translation
    of any form has not been solved yet as it requires both\n   the network to select
    the correct egress ISP based on the packet\n   source address and hosts to select
    the correct source address based\n   on the desired egress ISP for that traffic.
    \ The \"ietf-rtgwg-\n   enterprise-pa-multihoming\" document proposes a solution
    to this\n   problem by introducing a new routing functionality (Source Address\n
    \  Dependent Routing) to solve the uplink selection issue and using\n   Router
    Advertisements to influence the host source address selection.\n   While the above-mentioned
    document focuses on solving the general\n   problem and on covering various complex
    use cases, this document\n   adopts the approach proposed in the \"ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-\n
    \  multihoming\" draft to provide a solution for a limited number of\n   common
    use cases.  In particular, the focus is on scenarios where an\n   enterprise network
    has two Internet uplinks used either in primary/\n   backup mode or simultaneously
    and hosts in that network might not yet\n   properly support multihoming as described
    in RFC8028.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
