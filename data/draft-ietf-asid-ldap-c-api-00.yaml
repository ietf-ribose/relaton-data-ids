abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a C language application program interface to
    the lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP). This document replaces the previous
    definition of this API, defined in RFC 1823, updating it to include support for
    features found in version 3 of the LDAP protocol. New extended operation functions
    were added to support LDAPv3 features such as controls. In addition, other LDAP
    API changes were made to support information hiding and thread safety. The C LDAP
    API is designed to be powerful, yet simple to use. It defines compatible synchronous
    and asynchronous interfaces to LDAP to suit a wide variety of applications. This
    document gives a brief overview of the LDAP model, then an overview of how the
    API is used by an applica- tion program to obtain LDAP information. The API calls
    are described in detail, followed by an appendix that provides some example code
    demon- strating the use of the API. This document provides information to the
    Internet community. It does not specify any standard.</p>"
