abstract:
- content: "<p>The operator of the TURN server might want to have fine grained control
    on the clients usage of the server resources for providing features such as limiting
    the bandwidth usage, number of allocations and so on. This document proposes a
    generic mechanism for the operator to introspect the access token to retrieve
    any policy restrictions imposed by the authorization server on the TURN server
    resources assigned to the client.</p>"
