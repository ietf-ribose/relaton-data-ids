abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selectedmailbox.
    A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and aclient that wishes to support
    this must issue a series of SELECT andSEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete
    before moving on to thenext. This extension allows a client to search multiple
    mailboxeswith one command, limiting the round-trips and waiting for varioussearches
    to complete. This also introduces named searches, allowinga client to pipeline
    the searches if it chooses.</p>"
