abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document depicts a standard set of information to be \n(dynamically)
    negotiated between a customer and an IP service \nprovider or between service
    providers, by means of instantiated \nService Level Specifications (SLS). It also
    specifies the \ncorresponding semantics of such information, so that it might
    be \nappropriately modeled and processed by the above-mentioned parties in \nan
    automated fashion. \n\t </p>\n      "
