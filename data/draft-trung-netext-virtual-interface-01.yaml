abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Proxy Mobile IPv6 supports a mobile node to perform inter-technology
    handover as well as multihoming. However the inter-technology handover requires
    the new interface to use the samenetwork prefix with the old one and all the IP
    address/prefix at theold interface are removed. These requirements disable multihomingfunction
    which requires different network prefixes for differentinterfaces. In this Internet
    draft we address this problem andsuggest the necessary changes in PMIPv6 operations
    to support amobile node to perform multihoming as well as seamless intertechnology
    handover with virtual interface.</p>"
