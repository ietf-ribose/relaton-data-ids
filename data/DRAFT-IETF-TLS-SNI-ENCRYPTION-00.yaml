abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes the general problem of encryption of the
    Server\n   Name Identification (SNI) parameter.  The proposed solutions hide a\n
    \  Hidden Service behind a Fronting Service, only disclosing the SNI of\n   the
    Fronting Service to external observers.  The draft starts by\n   listing known
    attacks against SNI encryption, discusses the current\n   \"co-tenancy fronting\"
    solution, and then presents two potential TLS\n   layer solutions that might mitigate
    these attacks.\n   The first solution is based on TLS in TLS \"quasi tunneling\",
    and the\n   second solution is based on \"combined tickets\".  These solutions
    only\n   require minimal extensions to the TLS protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
