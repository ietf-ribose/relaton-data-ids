abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Routing protocols often use cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate\n
    \  data being received from a neighboring router has not been modified\n   in
    transit, and actually originated from the nrighboring router\n   purporting to
    have originating the data.  Most of the cryptographic\n   mechanisms rely on hash
    algorithms applied to the data in the routing\n   protocol packet, which means
    the data is transported, in the clear,\n   along with the has signature based
    on the data itself.  These\n   mechanisms rely on the manual configuration of
    the keys used to seed,\n   or build, these hash based sigantures.  This document
    outlines some\n   of the problems with manual keying of these cryptographic algorithms.\n\t
