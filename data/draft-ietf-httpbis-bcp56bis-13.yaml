abstract:
  content: "<p>Applications often use HTTP as a substrate to create HTTP-based APIs.
    This document specifies best practices for writing specifications that use HTTP
    to define new application protocols. It is written primarily to guide IETF efforts
    to define application protocols using HTTP for deployment on the Internet, but
    might be applicable in other situations. This document obsoletes [RFC3205].</p>"
