abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The provision of emergency calling services (e.g., 911, 112) has
    been\na critical component in the regulation of telecommunications\nnetworks.
    \ The technical architectures used by modern Voice-over-IP\n(VoIP) systems mean
    that if telecommunications regulators wish to\nextend emergency calling requirements
    to VoIP, it will likely be\nnecessary to reconsider the ways in which such requirements
    are\napplied, both in terms of what specific mandates are imposed and\nwhich entities
    are subject to them.  This document dicusses the\nfundamental technical requirements
    for emergency services, how these\nrequirements can be met within the framework
    of VoIP, and how these\nsolutions approaches create possibilities and limitations
    for\nregulatory involvement.\n\t </p>\n      "
