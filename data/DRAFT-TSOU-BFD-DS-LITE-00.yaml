abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In DS-Lite, the tunnel is not associated with any state information,\n
    \  which makes it difficult to manage and diagnose.  Bidirectional\n   Forwarding
    Detection (BFD) can be used in this case to detect the\n   state of the IPv4-in-IPv6
    tunnel by creating a BFD session between\n   the DS-Lite CPE and the Address Family
    Transitional Router (AFTR).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
