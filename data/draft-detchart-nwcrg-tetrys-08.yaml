abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a product of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications
    Research Group (NWCRG). It conforms to the directions found in the NWCRG taxonomy
    [RFC8406] . This document describes Tetrys, an On-The-Fly Network Coding (NC)
    protocol that can be used to transport delay and loss-sensitive data over a lossy
    network. Tetrys can recover from erasures within an RTT-independent delay, thanks
    to the transmission of coded packets. It can be used for both unicast, multicast
    and anycast communications.</p>"
