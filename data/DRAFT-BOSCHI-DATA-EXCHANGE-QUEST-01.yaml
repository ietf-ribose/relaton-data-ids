abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>      This document has been created to raise the question of
    inter-\n      domain measurements and data exchange between ISPs. The goal of
    \n      this questionnaire is to find out what the main concerns are, \n      and
    whether and how an inter-domain collaboration would be \n      beneficial for
    the ISP community itself. \n\t </p>\n      "
