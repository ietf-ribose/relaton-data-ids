abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent research work has explored the deployment characteristics
    and\n   configuration of the Domain Name System (DNS).  This document\n   summarizes
    the conclusions from these research efforts and offers\n   specific, tangible
    considerations or advice to authoritative DNS\n   server operators.  Authoritative
    server operators may wish to follow\n   these considerations to improve their
    DNS services.\n\n   It is possible that the results presented in this document
    could be\n   applicable in a wider context than just the DNS protocol, as some
    of\n   the results may generically apply to any stateless/short-duration,\n   anycasted
    service.\n\n   This document is not an IETF consensus document: it is published
    for\n   informational purposes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
