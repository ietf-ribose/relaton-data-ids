abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes two application scenarios where Network\n
    \  Service Header (NSH) and Segment Routing (SR) can be deployed\n   together
    to support Service Function Chaining (SFC) in an efficient\n   manner while maintaining
    separation of the service and transport\n   planes as originally intended by the
    SFC architecture.\n\n   In both scenarios, SR is responsible for steering packets
    between\n   SFFs along a given Service Function Path (SFP) while NSH is\n   responsible
    for maintaining the integrity of the service plane, the\n   SFC instance context,
    and any associated metadata.\n\n   These application scenarios demonstrate that
    NSH and SR can work\n   jointly and complement each other leaving the network
    operator with\n   the flexibility to use whichever transport technology makes
    sense in\n   specific areas of their network infrastructure, and still maintain
    an\n   end-to-end service plane using NSH.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
