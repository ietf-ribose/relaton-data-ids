abstract:
- content: "<p>In support of Segment Routing (SR) for an MPLS data plane routing protocols
    advertise a variety of identifiers used to define the segments which direct forwarding
    of packets. In cases where the information advertised by a given protocol instance
    is either internally inconsistent or conflicts with advertisements from another
    protocol instance a means of achieving consistent forwarding behavior in the network
    is required. This document defines the policies used to resolve these occurrences.</p>"
