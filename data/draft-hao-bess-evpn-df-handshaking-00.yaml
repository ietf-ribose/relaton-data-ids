abstract:
- content: "<p>In [EVPN], DF election process on each PE connecting to same ESI is
    triggered by independent timer expiring, DF and non-DF PEs can't ensure that unblocking
    and blocking action take effect at the same time, sometimes long time traffic
    disruption will occur. Handshaking mechanism for DF election is introduced in
    this draft, it can effectively reduce traffic disruption and avoid potential issues
    of packet duplication and loop in all-active access scenario.</p>"
