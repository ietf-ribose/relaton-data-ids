abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv4/IPv6 co-existence and transition is topic or great discussion
    and interest. In order to deal with IPv4 depletion ISPs have some techniques at
    their disposal such as Carrier Grade NAT , DS-Lite and 6rd. As this techniques
    get deployed, they change the topology of the network by creating gateways or
    overlays which in the end affect how ALTO might work. This draft discusses such
    impacts and possible solutions.</p>"
