abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Mobile Application Part (MAP) protocol is a signaling protocolfor
    cellular networks. The MAP Security (MAPSEC) protocol providesa secure way to
    transport MAP messages. To use MAPSEC, however,Security Associations (SAs) are
    needed. This document defines howsuch SAs can be created automatically. We use
    the InternetSecurity Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) as aframework
    for managing SAs and establishing keys. The frameworkcan be specialized to a particular
    task. Such a specialization iscalled a Domain of Interpretation (DOI), and this
    document definesthe MAPSEC DOI. This specialization is very similar to theInternet
    Key Exchange protocol and the ISAKMP specialization forIP Security, except that
    non-IP protocols are being negotiated.</p>"
