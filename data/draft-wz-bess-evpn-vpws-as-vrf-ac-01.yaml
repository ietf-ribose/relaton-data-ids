abstract:
- content: <p>When a VRF Attachment Cirucit (VRF-AC) is far away from its IP-VRF instance,
    we can deploy an EVPN VPWS ([RFC8214]) between that VRF-AC and its IP-VRF instance.
    From the viewpoint of the IP-VRF instance, a local virtual interface takes the
    place of that remote "VRF-AC". The intended IP address for that VRF-AC is now
    configured to the virtual interface, in other words, the virtual interface is
    the actual VRF-AC of the IP-VRF instance. The virtual interface is also the AC
    of that VPWS instance, in other words, the virtual interface is cross-connected
    to that remote "VRF-AC" by the VPWS instance. This document proposes an extension
    to [RFC7432] to support this scenario.</p>
