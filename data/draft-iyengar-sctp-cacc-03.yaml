abstract:
  content: <p>SCTP [RFC2960] supports IP multihoming at the transport layer. SCTPallows
    an association to span multiple local and peer IP addresses,and allows the application
    to dynamically change the primarydestination during an active association. We
    present a problem in thecurrent SCTP specification that results in unnecessary
    retransmissionsand "TCP-unfriendly" growth of the sender's congestion window duringcertain
    changeover conditions. We present the problem and propose analgorithm called the
    Split Fast Retransmit Changeover Aware CongestionControl algorithm (SFR-CACC)
    as a solution. We recommend the additionof SFR-CACC to the SCTP specification
    [RFC2960].</p>
