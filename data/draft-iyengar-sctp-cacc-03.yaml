abstract:
- content: <p>SCTP [RFC2960] supports IP multihoming at the transport layer. SCTP
    allows an association to span multiple local and peer IP addresses, and allows
    the application to dynamically change the primary destination during an active
    association. We present a problem in the current SCTP specification that results
    in unnecessary retransmissions and "TCP-unfriendly" growth of the sender's congestion
    window during certain changeover conditions. We present the problem and propose
    an algorithm called the Split Fast Retransmit Changeover Aware Congestion Control
    algorithm (SFR-CACC) as a solution. We recommend the addition of SFR-CACC to the
    SCTP specification [RFC2960].</p>
