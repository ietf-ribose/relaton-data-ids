abstract:
  content: "<p>The Message Session Relay Protocol(MSRP) does not allow privacy andtopology
    hiding, such that MSRP users can hide the IP Address oftheir systems. This limitation
    is due to the fact that MSRP Pathheaders contain physical IP addresses. This document
    describes amechanism which adds a level of indirection to allow privacy andtopology
    hiding, to prevent remote parties and a man-in-the-middlefrom learning the IP
    Address and port information of the MSRP client.It also defines the option tag
    msrp-opaque, to indicate such support.</p>"
