abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications
    Research Group (NWCRG). It conforms to the directions found in the NWCRG taxonomy
    [RFC8406]. Thus, the scope of the document is network coding as a linear combination
    of packets in and above the network layer. Physical and MAC layer coding are beyond
    the scope of the document. The draft focuses on a multi-gateway satellite system
    and identifies the use-cases where network coding provides significant performance
    improvements. The objective is to contribute to a larger deployment of network
    coding techniques in SATCOM to complement already implemented loss recovery mechanisms.
    The draft also identifies open research issues related to the deployment of network
    coding in SATCOM systems.</p>"
