abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents necessary clarifications and corrections concerning
    features related to the use of attributes in NFSv4.1 related to file system location.
    These revised features include migration, which transfers responsibility for a
    file system from one server to another, and include facilities to support trunking
    by allowing discovery of the set of network addresses to use to access a file
    system. This document updates RFC5661.</p>"
