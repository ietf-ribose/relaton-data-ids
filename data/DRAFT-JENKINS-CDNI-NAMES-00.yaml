abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As part of the development of protocols and solutions for CDNI
    it\nwill be necessary to agree on common mechanisms for how to identify\nand name
    the data objects that are to be interchanged between\ninterconnected CDNs, as
    well as how to describe which policy should\nbe used when doing so.\n\nThis document
    presents some thoughts on the naming and referencing of\ndata types/objects within
    a CDNI solution.\n\t </p>\n      "
