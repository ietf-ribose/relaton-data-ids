abstract:
  content: "<p>In traditional GSTN-based fax, a coverpage is often sent before theactual
    document. Some of the uses for a coverpage are:o routing the document to the correct
    recipiento identifying the sendero providing comments to the recipient about the
    documento page counto transmission dateCurrent fax-over-SMTP aware applications
    do not have a standard wayto indicate that a coverpage has been included with
    a message, or thatthere is a good possibilty that a coverpage is part of the message.This
    memo provides a mechanism to indicate that a coverpage has beenincluded or has
    probably incluced in a message.</p>"
