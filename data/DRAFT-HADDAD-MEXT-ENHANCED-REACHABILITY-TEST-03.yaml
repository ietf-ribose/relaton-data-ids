abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo aims to improve Mobile IPv6 protocol security by enabling\nan
    enhanced care-of address rechability test for the home agent.  The\nmain goals
    are to discourage a rogue mobile node from misleading its\nhome agent to flood
    a targeted foreign network and to empower the\nlatter to thwart this type of attack
    if launched at a later stage.\n\t </p>\n      "
