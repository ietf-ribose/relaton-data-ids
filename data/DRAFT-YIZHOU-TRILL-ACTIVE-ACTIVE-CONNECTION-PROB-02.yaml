abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n
    \  protocol provides support for flow level multi-pathing with rapid\n   failover
    for both unicast and multi-destination traffic in networks\n   with arbitrary
    topology between TRILL switches. Active-active at the\n   TRILL edge is the extension
    of these characteristics to end stations\n   that are multiply connected to a
    TRILL campus. This informational\n   document discusses the high level problems
    and goals when providing\n   active-active connection at the TRILL edge.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
