abstract:
- content: "<p>When a Tenant System is not collocated with Network Virtualization
    Edges (NVEs), it's possible for this Tenant System to connect to a group of NVEs
    or a single NVE with multiple underlay IP addresses to use the active-active multihoming
    L2/L3 service provided by these NVEs. This document defines the YANG data model
    that can be used to configure NVEs of a NVO3 network to achieve active-active
    multi- homing.</p>"
