abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates requirements for IPv6 Destination and
    Hop-by-\n   Hop Options. The requirements that option type and option length\n
    \  cannot change en route, as well as the requirements that options\n   cannot
    be added or removed, are made explicit. The meaning and\n   requirements of a
    Destination Option marked as changeable are\n   clarified. Finally, the requirement
    that all destinations listed in a\n   Routing header must process options in a
    Destination Options header\n   preceding the Routing header is relaxed.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
