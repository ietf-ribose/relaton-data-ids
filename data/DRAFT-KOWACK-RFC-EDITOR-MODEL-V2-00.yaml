abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The RFC Editor publishes the Internet's archival series of technical\n
    \  and informational documents.  RFC 5620 defines RFC Editor Model\n   Version
    1, whose implementation began in January 2010.  Model 1\n   divides RFC Editor
    activities into a number of components, including\n   the RFC Series Editor (RSE).
    \ During 2010, a \"Transitional RFC Series\n   Editor\" performed and evaluated
    the RSE role.  Based on direct\n   experience, extensive discussions with the
    community, and research,\n   the TRSE provides this updated version of RFC 5620.
    \ This draft\n   revises the RSE job description, and makes recommendations for
    the\n   search and selection process for a permanent RSE.  This memo also\n   clarifies
    RFC Editor and RSE activities using established approaches\n   of management and
    oversight of a publication service, tailored for\n   the style of the Internet
    technical community.  Careful attention is\n   paid to ensuring stable operations.
    \ This document observes that RSE\n   responsibilities demand a very high level
    of editorial and managerial\n   expertise.\n\t </p>\n      "
