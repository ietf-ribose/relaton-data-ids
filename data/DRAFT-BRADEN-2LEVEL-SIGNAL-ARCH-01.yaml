abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines an architectural framework for a wide variety
    of\nInternet signaling protocols.  This framework has a two-level\norganization:
    a common lower layer 'transport' protocol together with\na suite of upper-level
    signaling protocols.  The common lower level\nprotocol CSTP (Common Signaling
    Transport Protocol) provides a\ntransport-like service that may include reliable
    delivery and soft\nstate management.  The upper layer protocols, which implement\nalgorithms
    and data structures specific to particular signaling\napplications, are generically
    called ULSPs (Upper-layer Signaling\nProtocols).  This memo motivates the two-level
    design and describes\nthe service model, API, and operation of the lower level
    CSTP.\n\t </p>\n      "
