abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document extends VRRP mechanism to support fast transition
    of\nnon-master router to master when the original master router (is not\nfunctioning
    or) becomes unavailable.  Through introducing another\nstate of router, named
    alternate state, when the failure of master\nrouter is detected by alternate router
    with fast detection\ntechnology, such as BFD, it will transmit to master immediately.\nThen
    the new master will inform other routers in its VRRP group to\nelect a new alternate
    router, and a fast detection session will be\nestablished between alternate and
    master routers, through which the\navailability of the master can be detected
    by alternate router.\n\t </p>\n      "
