abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>MPLS fast reroute [3] is considered as a possible solution to
    protect\ntraffic against link and node failures by re-directing the traffic\nlocally
    to a backup LSP. A backup LSP can be either a detour LSP or a\nbypass tunnel.
    This document describes two methods to optimize the\nrouting of detour LSPs such
    that they merge faster, a distributed\nmethod and a centralized method. The distributed
    method uses the\nBackup Record Route Object (BRRO) and the centralized method
    uses the\nBackup Explicit Route Object (BERO). The latter can also be used for\nbypass
    tunnels.\n\t </p>\n      "
