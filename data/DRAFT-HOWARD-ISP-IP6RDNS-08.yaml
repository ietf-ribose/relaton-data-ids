abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In IPv4, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) commonly provide
    IN-\n   ADDR.ARPA information for their customers by prepopulating the zone\n
    \  with one PTR record for every available address.  This practice does\n   not
    scale in IPv6.  This document analyzes different approaches and\n   considerations
    for ISPs in managing the ip6.arpa zone for IPv6\n   address space assigned to
    many customers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
