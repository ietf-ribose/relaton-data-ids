abstract:
- content: "<p>S/MIME uses certificates for authenticating and encrypting messages.
    Users want their mail user agents to securely associate a certificate with the
    sender of an encrypted and/or signed message. DNSSEC provides a mechanism for
    a zone operator to sign DNS information directly. This way, bindings of certificates
    to users within a domain are asserted not by external entities, but by the entities
    that operate the DNS. This document describes how to use secure DNS to associate
    an S/MIME user's certificate with the intended domain name. IMPORTANT NOTE: This
    draft is intentionally sketchy. It is meant as a possible starting point for the
    DANE WG if it wants to consider making a protocol similar to TLSA, as described
    in draft-ietf-dane-protocol, but that applies to S/MIME. The WG may or may not
    want to adopt such work, or if it does, may want to use a very different scheme
    from the one described here.</p>"
