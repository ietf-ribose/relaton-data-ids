abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this document is to begin a discussion that will determine
    the level of interest at the IETF in documenting how multiple recovery techniques
    can successfully be combined to protect a set of network resources and the various
    interactions between these recovery techniques. Potential outcome of this work
    could be to define new MIBs and/or OAM techniques devoted to such interactions.</p>"
