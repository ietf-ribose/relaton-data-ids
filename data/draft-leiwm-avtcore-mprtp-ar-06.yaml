abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, most multimedia applications utilize a combination of real-time
    transport protocol (RTP) and user datagram protocol (UDP). Application programs
    at the source end format payload data into RTP packets using RTP specifications
    and dispatch them using unreliable UDP along a single path. Multipath transport
    is an important way to improve the efficiency of data delivery. In order to apply
    the framework of multipath transport system based on application-level relay (MPTS-AR)
    to RTP-based multimedia applications, this document defines a multipath real-time
    transport protocol based on application-level relay (MPRTP-AR), which is a concrete
    application-specific multipath transport protocol (MPTP). Packet formats and packet
    types of MPRTP-AR follow the common rules specified in MPTP profile. Based on
    MPRTP-AR, RTP-based multimedia applications can make full use of the advantages
    brought by MPTS-AR.</p>"
