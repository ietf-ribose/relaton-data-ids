abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a rate adaptation algorithm for conversational\n
    \  video services.  The solution conforms to the packet conservation\n   principle
    and uses a hybrid loss and delay based congestion control\n   algorithm.  The
    algorithm is evaluated over both simulated Internet\n   bottleneck scenarios as
    well as in a LTE (Long Term Evolution) system\n   simulator and is shown to achieve
    both low latency and high video\n   throughput in these scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n
