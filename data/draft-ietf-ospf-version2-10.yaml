abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents version 2 of the OSPF protocol. OSPF is a link-state
    routing protocol. It is designed to be run internal to a single Autonomous System.
    Each OSPF router maintains an identical database describing the Autonomous System's
    topology. From this database, a routing table is calculated by constructing a
    shortest-path tree. OSPF recalculates routes quickly in the face of topological
    changes, utilizing a minimum of routing protocol traffic. OSPF provides support
    for equal-cost multipath. An area routing capability is provided, enabling an
    additional level of routing protection and a reduction in routing protocol traffic.
    In addition, all OSPF routing protocol exchanges are authenticated. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
