abstract:
  content: "<p>TKEY [RFC2930] provides methods of setting up shared secret keys forTSIG
    [RFC2845] other than manual exchange. But TKEY itself cannotcontrol timing of
    key renewal very well though it can add or deleteshared keys. Since continuing
    to sign messages with old keyspermanently is not safe, hosts which make use of
    TSIG should payattention to the time limit of secret usage.</p>"
