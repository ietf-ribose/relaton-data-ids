abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo examines practical problems in the use of the ICANN
    generic\ntop-level domains, in particular that they fail to provide a stable\nnamespace
    that is required by some protocols.  The practical problems\nare traced to underlying
    problems in domain name allocation policy in\nthose domains.  Possible solutions
    to the problem are discussed,\nincluding the possibility of a new top-level domain
    to be managed in\naccordance with IANA assigned-numbers principles.\n\t </p>\n
