abstract:
- content: <p>This document updates RFC6761 by requiring that the domain "localhost."
    and any names falling within ".localhost." resolve to loopback addresses. This
    would allow other specifications to join regular users in drawing the common-sense
    conclusions that "localhost" means "localhost", and doesn't resolve to somewhere
    else on the network.</p>
