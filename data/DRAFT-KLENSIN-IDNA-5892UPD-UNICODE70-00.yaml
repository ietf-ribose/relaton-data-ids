abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current version of the IDNA specifications anticipated
    that each\n   new version of Unicode would be reviewed to verify that no changes\n
    \  had been introduced that required adjustments to the set of rules\n   and,
    in particular, whether new exceptions or backward compatibility\n   adjustments
    were needed.  That review was conducted for Unicode 7.0.0\n   and identified a
    problematic new code point.  This specification\n   updates RFC 5982 to disallow
    that code point and provides information\n   about the reasons why that exclusion
    is appropriate.  It also applies\n   an editorial clarification that was the subject
    of an earlier\n   erratum.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
