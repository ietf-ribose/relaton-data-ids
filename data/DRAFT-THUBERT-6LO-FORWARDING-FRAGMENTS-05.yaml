abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Considering that an LLN link-layer frame can have a payload
    below 100\n   bytes, an IPv6 packet might be fragmented more than 10 fragments
    at\n   the 6LoWPAN layer.  In a 6LoWPAN mesh-under mesh network, the\n   fragments
    can be forwarded individually across the mesh, whereas a\n   route-over mesh network,
    a fragmented 6LoWPAN packet must be\n   reassembled at every hop, which causes
    latency and congestion.  This\n   draft introduces a simple protocol to forward
    individual fragments\n   across a route-over mesh network, and, regardless of
    the type of\n   mesh, recover the loss of individual fragments across the mesh
    and\n   protect the network against bloat with a minimal flow control.\n\n\t </p>\n
