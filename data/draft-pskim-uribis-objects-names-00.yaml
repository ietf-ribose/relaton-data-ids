    has been considered to support the future Internet for mobile environment. The
    suggested name space considers a host-centric for the current stage as well as
    an object-centric for the next stage. To consider scalability and distributed
    architecture, the format of the name space consists of object category, local
    name, domain name, and parameters.</p>"
