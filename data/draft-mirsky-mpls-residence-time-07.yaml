abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies G-ACh based Residence Time Measurement and
    how it can be used by time synchronization protocols being transported over MPLS
    domain. Residence time is the variable part of propagation delay of timing and
    synchronization messages and knowing what this delay is for each message allows
    for a more accurate determination of the delay to be taken into account in applying
    the value included in a PTP event message.</p>"
