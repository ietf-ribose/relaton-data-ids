abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes two fully-specified FEC Schemes for
    Sliding\n   Window Random Linear Codes (RLC), one for RLC over GF(2) (binary\n
    \  case), a second one for RLC over GF(2^^8), both of them with the\n   possibility
    of controlling the code density.  They are meant to\n   protect arbitrary media
    streams along the lines defined by FECFRAME\n   extended to sliding window FEC
    codes.  These sliding window FEC codes\n   rely on an encoding window that slides
    over the source symbols,\n   generating new repair symbols whenever needed.  Compared
    to block FEC\n   codes, these sliding window FEC codes offer key advantages with
    real-\n   time flows in terms of reduced FEC-related latency while often\n   providing
    improved erasure recovery capabilities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
