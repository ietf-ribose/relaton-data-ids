abstract:
  content: "\t <t>HYDRO is a hybrid routing protocol for Lossy and Low power Networks(L2Ns)
    that embraces centralized and distributed routing mechanisms.Through the use of
    standard ICMP Route Advertisements and RouteSolicitations, Node Routers build
    Default Routes to Border Routers.These routes, which maintain multiple options
    per each Node Routerwhen available, are maintained through data-driven link estimation.Node
    Routers periodically report a high-quality subset of theirDefault Route Table
    to Border Routers, which then form a global viewof the topology. When a Node Router
    attempts to route to anotherNode Router in the network, if no matching entry exists
    in the NodeRouter's Flow Table, it forwards the packet to a Border Router, whichthen
    installs the correct Flow Table Entries in the network to enablemore efficient
    subsequent routing.</p>"
