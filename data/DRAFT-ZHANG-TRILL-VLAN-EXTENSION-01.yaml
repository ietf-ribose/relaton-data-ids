abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL is originally designed for customer networks. When it
    is used\n   as a provider network to interconnect multiple separate users, the\n
    \  space of current Inner VLAN becomes insufficient. As an easy way, a\n   new
    VLAN ID field is added to the Inner Ethernet frame. The new VLAN\n   ID can be
    use in conjunction with the previous defined Inner VLAN.\n   This mechanism is
    usually known as stacked VLANs(802.1ad, or QinQ).\n   The stacked VLANs mechanism
    is analyzed in this document. The method\n   to introduce a single longer VLAN
    field to current TRILL header is\n   also analyzed in this document.  In addition,
    a novel MAC address\n   rewriting mechanism is also brought forward to break the
    space\n   limitation of the Inner VLAN. The MAC addresses of the native frame\n
    \  are not used for forwarding process in transit RBridges. When the\n   packet
    enters the TRILL network, the ingress RBridge (Appointed\n   Forwarder) uses a
    Virtual MAC (VMAC) address to replace the real MAC\n   and embedded the native
    VLAN ID into this virtual MAC address. When a\n   packet egresses from the TRILL
    network, the egress RBridge will use\n   the real MAC address to replace the virtual
    MAC address and deliver\n   it to the destination on the local link.\n\n\t </p>\n
