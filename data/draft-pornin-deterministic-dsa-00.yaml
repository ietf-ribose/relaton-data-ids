abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a deterministic digital signature generation
    procedure. Such signatures are compatible with standard DSA and ECDSA digital
    signatures, and can be processed with unmodified verifiers, which need not be
    aware of the procedure described therein. Deterministic signatures retain the
    cryptographic security features associated with digital signatures, but can be
    more easily implemented in various environments since they do not need access
    to a source of high quality randomness.</p>"
