abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bufferbloat is a phenomenon where excess buffers in the network
    cause\n   high latency and jitter. As more and more interactive applications\n
    \  (e.g. voice over IP, real time video streaming and financial\n   transactions)
    run in the Internet, high latency and jitter degrade\n   application performance.
    There is a pressing need to design\n   intelligent queue management schemes that
    can control latency and\n   jitter; and hence provide desirable quality of service
    to users.\n\n   We present here a lightweight design, PIE (Proportional Integral\n
    \  controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average\n   queueing
    latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical\n   analysis and Linux
    testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low\n   latency and achieve high
    link utilization under various congestion\n   situations. The design does not
    require per-packet timestamp, so it\n   incurs very small overhead and is simple
    enough to implement in both\n   hardware and software.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
