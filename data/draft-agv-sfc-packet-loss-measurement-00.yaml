abstract:
- content: "<p>Service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on the capability
    to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet loss. The common reasons
    for packet drop are Link Congestion, Device (Router/Switch/Firewall/etc.) Performance,
    Software issues (bugs) on a network device, Faulty Hardware or Cabling and Service
    Function processing errors. Packet Loss Measurement capability also provides operators
    with greater visibility into the performance characteristics of their networks,
    thereby facilitating planning, troubleshooting, and network performance evaluation.
    This document specifies best possible efficient and accurate mechanism for passive
    packet loss measurement for Service Function Chains (SFCs) for a SFC network domain.</p>"
