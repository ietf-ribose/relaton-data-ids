abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes behavior of signaling intermediaries
    in Real-\n   Time Communication (RTC) deployments, sometimes referred to as\n
    \  Session Border Controllers (SBCs), when performing Hosted NAT\n   Traversal
    (HNT).  HNT is a set of mechanisms, such as media relaying\n   and latching, that
    such intermediaries use to enable other RTC\n   devices behind NATs to communicate
    with each other.\n\n   This document is non-normative, and is only written to
    explain HNT in\n   order to provide a reference to the IETF community, as well
    as an\n   informative description to manufacturers, and users.\n\n   Latching,
    which is one of the components of the HNT components, has a\n   number of security
    issues covered here.  Because of those, and unless\n   all security considerations
    explained here are taken into account and\n   solved, the IETF advises against
    use of latching mechanism over the\n   Internet and recommends other solutions
    such as the Interactive\n   Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n
