abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In a variety of conferencing scenarios, a local communication channelis
    desirable for conference-related information exchange between co-located but otherwise
    independent application entities, for examplethose taking part in application
    sessions that belong to the sameconference. In loosely coupled conferences such
    a mechanism allowsfor coordination of applications entities to e.g. implementsynchronization
    between media streams or to configure entitieswithout user interaction. It can
    also be used to implement tightlycoupled conferences enabling a conference controller
    to enforceconference wide control within a end system.This document defines application
    scenarios and requirements for acoordination infrastructure that provides local
    coordination within aconferencing end system.This document is intended for discussion
    in the Multiparty MultimediaSession Control (MMUSIC) working group of the Internet
    EngineeringTask Force. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to theworking
    group's mailing list at confctrl@isi.edu and/or the authors.</p>"
