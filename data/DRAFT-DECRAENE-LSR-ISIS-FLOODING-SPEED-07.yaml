abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a mechanism to adjust IS-IS flooding
    speed\n   between two adjacent routers by adjusting the sender flooding speed\n
    \  to the capability of the receiver.  This helps improving the flooding\n   throughput,
    reducing LSPs losses and retransmissions due to receiver\n   overload, and avoiding
    manual tuning of flooding parameters by the\n   network operator.  This document
    defines a new TLV for Hello\n   messages.  This TLV may carry a set of parameters
    indicating the\n   performance capacity to receive LSPs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
