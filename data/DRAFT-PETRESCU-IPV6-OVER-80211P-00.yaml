abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to transmit IPv6 packets on IEEE 802.11p networks
    there is a\n   need to define a few parameters such as the recommended Maximum\n
    \  Transmission Unit size, the header format preceding the IPv6 base\n   header,
    the Type value within it, and others.  This document\n   describes these parameters
    for IPv6 and IEEE 802.11p networks; it\n   portrays the layering of IPv6 on 802.11p
    similarly to other known\n   802.11 and Ethernet layers, by using an existing
    Ethernet Adaptation\n   Layer.\n\n   In addition, the document attempts to list
    what is different in\n   802.11p compared to more 'traditional' 802.11a/b/g/n
    layers, layers\n   over which IPv6 protocols run ok.  Most notably, the operation\n
    \  outside the context of a BSS (OCB) has impact on IPv6 handover\n   behaviour
    and on IPv6 security.\n\n   An example of an IPv6 packet captured while transmitted
    over an IEEE\n   802.11p link is given.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
