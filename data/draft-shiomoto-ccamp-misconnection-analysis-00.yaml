abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this memo is to describe and analyze the occurrence
    of misconnections in GMPLS networks. We present a problem statement, and describe
    some scenarios under which misconnections may happen. We then outline some common
    causes of misconnections and discuss some solutions to address them. Our goal
    is to facilitate further discussions of this issue and the associated solutions
    within the CCAMP Working Group.</p>"
