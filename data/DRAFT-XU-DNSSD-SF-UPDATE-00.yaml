abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a Service Function Chaining (SFC)-enabled domain, the Domain
    Name\n   System (DNS) can be used as a mechanism for Service Function (SF)\n   auto-discovery
    [I-D.xu-dnssd-sf-discovery].  Since the information\n   associated with SF instances
    (e.g., capacity and current load) would\n   change dynamically, the information
    associated with SF instances\n   which is stored in the DNS sever needs to be
    updated accordingly.\n   This document describes how to use the DNS UPDATE mechanism
    [RFC2136]\n   to dynamically update the corresponding Resource Records (RRs) for
    SF\n   instances.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
