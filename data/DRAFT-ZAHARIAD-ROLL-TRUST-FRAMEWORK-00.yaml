abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents a trust framework, which may improve the\nsecurity
    and reliability of routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks\n(LLN), against an
    increased set of attacks. The development of the\nframework builds upon previous
    work on trust and secure routing,\nadapting the trust assessments to the issues
    and constraints specific\nto LLNs.\n\nThe proposed trust management scheme is
    based on direct and indirect\ninteractions with neighboring nodes, to compute
    their trust value and\nthus select the most trusted path or forwarding node. To
    reduce the\noverhead of nodes' communication during the indirect trust value\nretrieval
    procedure, indirect trust information is requested from a\nlimited number of neighbors,
    which respond only when they have highly\nreliable trust information\n\t </p>\n
