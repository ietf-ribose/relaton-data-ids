abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OpenPGP is a message format for email (and file) encryption
    that\n   lacks a standardized lookup mechanism to securely obtain OpenPGP\n   public
    keys.  This document specifies a method for publishing and\n   locating OpenPGP
    public keys in DNS for a specific email address\n   using a new OPENPGPKEY DNS
    Resource Record.  Security is provided via\n   Secure DNS, however the OPENPGPKEY
    record is not a replacement for\n   verification of authenticity via the \"Web
    of Trust\" or manual\n   verification.  The OPENPGPKEY record can be used to encrypt
    an email\n   that would otherwise have to be send unencrypted.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
