abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In interpersonal messaging end-to-end encryption means for
    public key\n   distribution and verification of its authenticity are needed; the\n
    \  latter to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n\n   This document proposes
    a new method to easily verify a public key is\n   authentic by a Handshake process
    that allows users to easily\n   authenticate their communication channel.  The
    new method is targeted\n   to Opportunistic Security scenarios and is already
    implemented in\n   several applications of pretty Easy privacy (pEp).\n\n\t </p>\n
