abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In recent years we have begun to see a convergence of Internet
    \ntechnologies with traditional media formats such as video and audio. \nIt is
    therefore likely that movies and television with surround \nsound capabilities
    are soon to be dispersed around the Internet.  \nAC-3 is standard multi-channel
    compression format for HDTV, DVD, and \nother video formats, but there is no uniform
    MIME type for these \nfiles\n\t </p>\n      "
