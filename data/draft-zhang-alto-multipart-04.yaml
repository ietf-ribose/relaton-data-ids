abstract:
- content: "<p>Many ALTO use cases involve multiple ALTO information resources like
    different network maps, cost maps and property maps to achieve their own specific
    goals. To make the ALTO client query them one by one is not only inefficient but
    also error-prone. The inconsistent responses can be performed because of the unstable
    communication environment, and finally conduct the unexpected traffic optimization.
    Further more, some ALTO information resources may have correlation, which means
    one's input parameters may depends on another one's response. To address those
    issues, some advanced query schema is required. This document proposes an ALTO
    extension to support the multiple ALTO resources query in the single request using
    the HTTP multipart message and the existing JSON query languages.</p>"
