abstract:
  content: "<p>Network traffic has shown the combination of few very high bit rateflows
    (large flow) and a huge amount of very low bit rate flows(small flow), which causes
    uneven load balance over ECMP or LAG.Differentiating large flow and small flow
    packets in IP/MPLSnetworks enables an enhanced ECMP transport. Enhanced ECMP appliesdifferent
    distribution methods to large flow packets and small flowpackets to improve the
    load balance and congestion control. Thisdraft proposes large flow classification
    scheme for flow awarenesstransport in PSN.</p>"
