abstract:
- content: "<p>Network traffic has shown the combination of few very high bit rate
    flows (large flow) and a huge amount of very low bit rate flows (small flow),
    which causes uneven load balance over ECMP or LAG. Differentiating large flow
    and small flow packets in IP/MPLS networks enables an enhanced ECMP transport.
    Enhanced ECMP applies different distribution methods to large flow packets and
    small flow packets to improve the load balance and congestion control. This draft
    proposes large flow classification scheme for flow awareness transport in PSN.</p>"
