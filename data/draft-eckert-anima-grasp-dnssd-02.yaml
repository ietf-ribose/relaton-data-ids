abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) defines a framework for applications
    to announce and discover services. This includes service names, service instance
    names, common parameters for selecting a service instance (weight or priority)
    as well as other service-specific parameters. For the specific case of autonomic
    networks, GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) intends to be used for
    service discovery in addition to the setup of basic connectivity. Reinventing
    advanced service discovery for GRASP with a similar set of features as DNS-SD
    would result in duplicated work. To avoid that, this document defines how to use
    GRASP to announce and discover services relying upon DNS-SD features while maintaining
    the intended simplicity of GRASP. To that aim, the document defines name discovery
    and schemes for reusable elements in GRASP objectives.</p>"
