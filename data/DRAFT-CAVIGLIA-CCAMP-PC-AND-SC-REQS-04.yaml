abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>From a Carrier perspective, the possibility of turning a Permanent
    \n   Connection (PC) into a Soft Permanent Connection (SPC) and vice \n   versa,
    without actually affecting Data Plane traffic being carried \n   over it, is a
    valuable option. In other terms, such operation can be \n   seen as a way of transferring
    the ownership and control of an \n   existing and in-use Data Plane connection
    between the Management \n   Plane and the Control Plane, leaving its Data Plane
    state untouched.    This memo sets out the requirements for such procedures within
    a \n   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) network.\n\t </p>\n      "
