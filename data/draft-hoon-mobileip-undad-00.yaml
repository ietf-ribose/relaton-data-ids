abstract:
  content: "<p>The Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure detailed by NeighborDiscovery
    Protocol (NDP) requires nodes to wait for a quantified timeinterval during which
    the configured address is checked forduplication in the connected link. This delay
    affects normalcommunication in a Mobile Node (MN) during the DAD time intervalthereby
    hampering Fast Handoff. The expected use of Mobile IP on awide scale and the need
    for a minimal time delay during the handoffprocess require alternate mechanisms
    for overcoming the DAD timeinterval. This draft presents a mechanism wherein the
    Access Router's(AR) Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) is used to minimize the delayassociated
    with the DAD procedure.</p>"
