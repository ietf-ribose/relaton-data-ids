abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An increasing number of hosts and networks are connected to
    the\n   Internet through multiple interfaces, some of which may provide\n   multiple
    ways to access the internet by means of multiple IPv6 prefix\n   configurations.\n\n
    \  This document describes a way for hosts to retrieve additional\n   information
    about their network access characteristics.  The set of\n   configuration items
    required to access the Internet is called a\n   Provisioning Domain (PvD).  The
    PvD is identified by a Fully\n   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).  This identifier,
    retrieved using a new\n   Router Advertisement (RA) option, is associated with
    the set of\n   information included within the RA and may later be used to retrieve\n
    \  additional information associated with the PvD by way of an HTTP-\n   over-TLS
    request.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
