abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network Service Header (NSH) specification defines two
    possible\n   methods of including metadata (MD): MD Type 0x1 and MD Type 0x2.
    \ MD\n   Type 0x1 uses a fixed-length Context Header.  The allocation of this\n
    \  Context Header, i.e., its structure and semantics, has not been\n   standardized.
    \ This memo presents an allocation for the fixed Context\n   Headers of NSH, which
    incorporates the packet's timestamp, a sequence\n   number, and a source interface
    identifier.\n\n   Although the allocation that is presented in this document has
    not\n   been standardized by the IETF it has been implemented in silicon by\n
    \  several manufacturers and is published here to allow other\n   interoperable
    implementations and to facilitate debugging if it is\n   seen in the network.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
