abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC7575 defines Intent as an abstract high-level policy used to operate
    the network. Intent management system includes an interface for users to input
    requests and an engine to translate the intents into the network configuration
    and manage their lifecycle. Up to now, there is no commonly agreed definition,
    interface or model of intent. This document discusses what intent means to different
    stakeholders, describes different ways to classify intent, and an associated taxonomy
    of this classification. This is a foundation for discussion intent related topics.</p>"
