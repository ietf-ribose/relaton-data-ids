abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   draft-ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls defines how to transport CoAP
    messages\n   on reliable transports such as TCP, TLS, or WebSockets.\n\n   All
    these underlying protocols have ways to set up connection\n   properties and manage
    the connection.  In many cases, these ways\n   cannot be used very well for managing
    CoAP's use of the connection.\n\n   Signaling messages are a way to signal information
    that is about the\n   connection.  They form a third basic kind of messages in
    CoAP, beyond\n   requests and responses.  Message class 7 is used for signaling\n
    \  messages.\n\n   Signaling messages are only relevant for the connection they
    appear\n   in.  The present draft assumes reliable, sequence-preserving\n   connections.
    \ It is for further study whether signaling messages are\n   needed or useful
    for DTLS connections.\n\n   The present draft, when adopted, would resolve CoRE
    tickets #400\n   (message sizes), #388 (by providing a foundation for a mechanism
    for\n   version negotiation, once that is needed), #390 (connection close\n   reason),
    #391 (server name indication), #394 (ping/pong).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
