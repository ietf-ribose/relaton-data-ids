abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines new HTTP headers (and query parameters)\n
    \  allowing a client to inform the server of the exact data it needs:\n\n   *
    \ \"Preload\" informs the server that relations of the main requested\n      resource
    will be necessary.  The server can then reduce the number\n      of round-trips
    by sending the related resources ahead of time\n      using HTTP/2 [RFC7540] Server
    Push.  When using Server Push isn't\n      possible (resources served by a different
    authority, client or\n      server not supporting HTTP/2...), the server can hint
    the client\n      to fetch those resources as early as possible by using the\n
    \     \"preload\" link relation [W3C.CR-preload-20190626] and the \"103\"\n      status
    code [RFC8297].\n\n   *  \"Fields\" informs the server of the list of fields of
    the retrieved\n      resources that will be used.  In order to improve performance
    and\n      reduce bandwidth usage, the server can omit the fields not\n      requested.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
