abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes Generic UDP Encapsulation (GUE), which
    is a scheme for using UDP to encapsulate packets of different IP protocols for
    transport across layer 3 networks. By encapsulating packets in UDP, specialized
    capabilities in networking hardware for efficient handling of UDP packets can
    be leveraged. GUE specifies basic encapsulation methods upon which higher level
    constructs, such as tunnels and overlay networks for network virtualization, can
    be constructed. GUE is extensible by allowing optional data fields as part of
    the encapsulation, and is generic in that it can encapsulate packets of various
    IP protocols.</p>"
