abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a mechanism for creating
    shared,\n   secret, random bits.  This document describes extensions to the IKEv2\n
    \  protocol to use random bits created via QKD as keys for IPsec.  The\n   Diffie-Hellman
    key agreement mechanism is replaced with QKD.  The use\n   of QKD-generated keys
    with standard IPsec will extend the lifetime of\n   privacy guarantees for IPsec-protected
    data: future technological\n   advances that break Diffie-Hellman key exchange
    will not disclose\n   data until such time as the encryption algorithm used for
    the IPsec\n   tunnel is broken.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
