abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) defines a tree of names\n
    \  starting with root, \".\", immediately below which are top level\n   domain
    (TLD) names such as \".com\" and \".us\". In June 1999 RFC2606\n   reserved a
    small number of TLD names for use in documentation\n   examples, private testing,
    experiments, and other circumstances in\n   which it is desirable to avoid conflict
    with current or future\n   actual TLD names in the DNS.\n\n   There has been significant
    evolution of Internet engineering and\n   operation practices since RFC2606 was
    published. In February 2013\n   RFC6761 defined criteria and procedures for reserving
    a domain name\n   for special use, and established an IANA registry for such names.\n
    \  This document reserves eight domain name labels for special use in\n   accordance
    with the criteria and procedures of RFC6761: localdomain,\n   domain, lan, home,
    host, corp, mail, and exchange.\n\n   It is important to note that TLD names may
    be reserved, in other\n   contexts, for policy, political, or other reasons that
    are distinct\n   from the IETF's concern with Internet engineering and operations.\n
    \  This document reserves TLD names only for operational and\n   engineering reasons.\n\n\t
