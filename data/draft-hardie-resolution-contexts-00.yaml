abstract:
- content: "<p>The effort to register .onion [RFC7686] in the IANA special names registry[RFC6761]
    has given rise to considerable discussion of how the namespace associated with
    the DNS relates to other namespaces used on the Internet. A brief history of this
    has been set out in [I-D.lewis-domain-names]. This document focuses on the question
    of how to signal resolution context within a unified namespace that contains both
    DNS and non-DNS names.</p>"
