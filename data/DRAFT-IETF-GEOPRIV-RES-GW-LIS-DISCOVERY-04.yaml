abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The residential gateway is a device that has become an integral
    part\n   of home networking equipment.  Discovering a Location Information\n   Server
    (LIS) is a necessary part of acquiring location information\n   for location-based
    services.  However, discovering a LIS when a\n   residential gateway is present
    poses a configuration challenge,\n   requiring a method that is able to work around
    the obstacle presented\n   by the gateway.\n\n   This document describes a solution
    to this problem.  The solution\n   provides alternative domain names as input
    to the LIS discovery\n   process based on the network addresses assigned to a
    Device.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
