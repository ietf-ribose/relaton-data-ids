abstract:
- content: "<p>Network slicing is an approach to provide separate virtual network
    based on service requirements, and it's a key feature of the 5G. 3GPP has standardized
    the specifications for network slicing in the 5GS, but there are still some problems
    for realization of end-to-end network slices. For complementing the lacks or expanding
    the usability, several organizations are proceeding standardization. However,
    the definitions and scopes of network slicing vary to some degree from one organization
    to another. This document provides classification of provisioning models of network
    slice for clarifying the differences on the definitions and scopes.</p>"
