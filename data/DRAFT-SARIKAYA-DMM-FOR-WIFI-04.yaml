abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As networks are moving towards flat architectures, a distributed\n
    \  approach is needed to mobility management.  This document defines a\n   distributed
    mobility management protocol called Distributed Mobility\n   Management for Wi-Fi
    protocol.  The protocol is based on mobility\n   aware virtualized routing system
    with software-defined network\n   support.  Routing is in Layer 2 in the access
    network and in Layer 3\n   in the core network.  Smart phones access the network
    over IEEE\n   802.11 (Wi-Fi) interface and can move in home, hotspot and enterprise\n
    \  buildings.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
