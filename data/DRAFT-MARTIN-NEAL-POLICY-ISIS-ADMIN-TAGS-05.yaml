abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an extension to the IS-IS protocol to
    add\noperational capabilities that allow for ease of management and\ncontrol over
    IP prefix distribution within an IS-IS domain.  The IS-\nIS protocol is specified
    in [1], with extensions for supporting IPv4\nspecified in [2] and further enhancements
    for Traffic Engineering [4]\nin [3] and [6].\nThis document enhances the IS-IS
    protocol by extending the\ninformation that a Intermediate System (IS) [router]
    can place in\nLink State Protocol Data Units (LSPs) as specified in [2].  This\nextension
    will provide operators with a mechanism to control IP\nprefix distribution throughout
    multi-level IS-IS domains.\nAdditionally, the information can be placed in LSPs
    that have TLVs as\nyet undefined, if this information is used to convey the same
    meaning\nin such future TLVs as it is used in the currently defined TLVs.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
