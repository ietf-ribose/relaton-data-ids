abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document includes an analysis of multiple interfaces in a
    host\nand a description of scenarios of multiple interfaces with the\nrespect
    of the relationship between layer 2 connection and layer 3\nconnection.  The current
    TCP/IP mechanism and networking methods are\nsuitable for single network interface.
    \ When a host has multiple\ninterfaces, the current TCP/IP mechanism and networking
    methods\ncannot directly be used for them.  A network interface establishes\nlayer
    2 connection to layer 2 entity (e.g., WLAN Access Point) and it\ndoes not mean
    providing proper layer 3 connection.  So every active\nnetwork interfaces do not
    guarantee successful IP layer operations.\nIn this document, we describe some
    problems for a host which has\nmultiple interfaces as an aspect of host's operations
    and usage\nscenarios of multiple interfaces in a host.\n\t </p>\n      "
