abstract:
- content: "<p>Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip times
    to the closest DNS root server. Some DNS recursive resolver operators want to
    prevent snooping of requests sent to DNS root servers by third parties. Such resolvers
    can greatly decrease the round-trip time and prevent observation of requests by
    running a copy of the full root zone on a loopback address (such as 127.0.0.1).
    This document shows how to start and maintain such a copy of the root zone that
    does not pose a threat to other users of the DNS, at the cost of adding some operational
    fragility for the operator. This draft will update RFC 7706. See Section 1.1 for
    a list of topics that will be added in the update. [ Ed note: Text inside square
    brackets ([]) is additional background information, answers to freqently asked
    questions, general musings, etc. They will be removed before publication.] [ This
    document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-kh-dnsop-7706bis.
    The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available
    here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]</p>"
