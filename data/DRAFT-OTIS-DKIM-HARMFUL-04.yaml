abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring SMTP clients can
    be\n   identified by an authenticated domain.  Unfortunately many hope to\n   use
    DKIM as an alternative, but it is independent of intended\n   recipients and domains
    accountable for having sent the message.  This\n   means DKIM is poorly suited
    at establishing abuse assessments of\n   unsolicited commercial email otherwise
    known as SPAM, nor was this\n   initially DKIM's intent.  DKIM lacks message context
    essential to\n   ensure fair assessment and to ensure this assessment is not poisoned\n
    \  (Who initiated the transaction and to whom).\n\n   DKIM was instead intended
    to establish increased levels of trust\n   based upon valid DKIM signatures controlling
    acceptance and what a\n   user sees within the FROM header field.  But DKIM failed
    to guard\n   against pre-pended header fields where any acceptance based on valid\n
    \  DKIM signatures is sure to exclude header field spoofing, especially\n   that
    of the FROM.  This weakness allows malefactors to exploit DKIM\n   signature acceptance
    established by high-volume DKIM domains to spoof\n   ANY other domain, even when
    prohibited within the Signer's network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
