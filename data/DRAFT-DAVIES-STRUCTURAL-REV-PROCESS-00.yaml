abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document suggests a possible process to address the\nstructural
    problems identified in the IETF Problem Statement as\nrequested in Version 02
    of the IETF Problem Resolution draft.\nThe process proposes that the IESG delegate
    responsibility for\ncoordinating, moderating and synthesising proposals for solutions\nto
    parts of the structural problems to a Synthsis and Action Panel\n(SAP) selected
    through a variant of the nomcom selection process.\nThe SAP should, if possible,
    deliver an integrated set of\nproposals for changes derived from community input,
    both\nunsolicited and, if necessary, solicited. The SAP would act as a\nmoderator
    between authors of alternative propoasals in attempting\nto achieve a proposal
    on which the community could agree. The\nagreed plan be would be delivered to
    the IESG for final approval \nand action.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
