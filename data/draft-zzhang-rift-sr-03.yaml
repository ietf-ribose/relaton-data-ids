abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies signaling procedures for Segment Routing in
    RIFT. Each node's loopback address, Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB) and Node
    Segment Identifier (Node-SID), which are typically assigned by a configuration
    management system and distibuted by routing protocols, are distributed southbound
    from the Top Of Fabric (TOF) nodes via RIFT's Key-Value distribution mechanism,
    so that each node can compute how to reach a segment represented by the active
    SID in a packet. An SR controller signals SR policies to ingress nodes so that
    they can send packets with a desired segment list to steer traffic.</p>"
