abstract:
  content: "\t <t>After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminatedby
    the emergency caller or normally by the call-taker) it is possiblethat the call-taker
    feels the need for further communication or for aclarification. For example, the
    call may have been dropped byaccident without the call-taker having sufficient
    information aboutthe current situation of a wounded person. A call-taker may triggera
    callback towards the emergency caller using the contact informationprovided with
    the initial emergency call. This callback could, undercertain circumstances, then
    be treated like any other call and as aconsequence, it may get blocked by authorization
    policies or may getforwarded to an answering machine.The IETF emergency services
    architecture addresses callbacks in alimited fashion and thereby covers a couple
    of scenarios. Thisdocument discusses some shortcomings and raises the question
    whetheradditional solution techniques are needed.</p>"
