abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a YANG model for TCP on devices that
    are\n   configured by network management protocols.  The YANG model defines a\n
    \  container for all TCP connections and groupings of some of the\n   parameters
    that can be imported and used in TCP implementations or by\n   other models that
    need to configure TCP parameters.  The model\n   includes definitions from YANG
    Groupings for TCP Client and TCP\n   Servers (I-D.ietf-netconf-tcp-client-server).
    \ The model is NMDA (RFC\n   8342) compliant.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
