abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is to specify the requirements to compress headers
    of\nIP/SCTP package and how ROHC mechanism compresses SCTP.  Streaming\nControl
    Transport Protocol is new generation IP transport protocol\nwhich has been published
    in RFC2960 and updated by RFC4960.  SCTP can\nmaintain association among multiple
    peers, thus supports multiple\nhoming and multiple streaming, while inherits most
    functions of TCP.\nSCTP as transport protocol has been used to carry signaling
    or\npossible user plane data in turbulence network which needs to save\nspectrum
    resource by compressing IP headers.\n\t </p>\n      "
