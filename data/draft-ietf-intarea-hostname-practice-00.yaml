abstract:
- content: "<p>Giving a hostname to your computer and publishing it as you roam from
    network to hot spot is the Internet equivalent of walking around with a name tag
    affixed to your lapel. The practice can significantly compromise your privacy,
    and should stop. There are several possible remedies, such as fixing a variety
    of protocols or avoiding disclosing a hostname at all. This document studies another
    possible remedy, which is to replace the static hostnames by frequently changing
    randomized values. This idea obviously needs more work.</p>"
