abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CoAP protocol needs to be implemented in such a way that
    it does\n   not cause persistent congestion on the network it uses.  Congestion\n
    \  control is a complex issue -- the proper rationale for the congestion\n   control
    mechanisms chosen in CoAP is probably more material than the\n   CoAP protocol
    specification itself.  This informational document\n   attempts to pull out the
    background material and more extensive\n   considerations behind the CoAP congestion
    control mechanisms, while\n   leaving the basic MUSTs and MUST NOTs in the main
    spec.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
