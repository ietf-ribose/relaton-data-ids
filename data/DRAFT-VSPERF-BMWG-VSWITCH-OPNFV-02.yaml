abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes the progress of the Open Platform for NFV
    (OPNFV)\n   project on virtual switch performance \"VSWITCHPERF\".  This project\n
    \  intends to build on the current and completed work of the\n   Benchmarking
    Methodology Working Group in IETF, by referencing\n   existing literature.  The
    Benchmarking Methodology Working Group has\n   traditionally conducted laboratory
    characterization of dedicated\n   physical implementations of internetworking
    functions.  Therefore,\n   this memo begins to describe the additional considerations
    when\n   virtual switches are implemented in general-purpose hardware.  The\n
    \  expanded tests and benchmarks are also influenced by the OPNFV\n   mission
    to support virtualization of the \"telco\" infrastructure.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
