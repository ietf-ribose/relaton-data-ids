abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a framework for coupling the Active
    Queue\n   Management (AQM) algorithms in two queues intended for flows with\n
    \  different responses to congestion.  This provides a way for the\n   Internet
    to transition from the scaling problems of standard TCP\n   Reno-friendly ('Classic')
    congestion controls to the family of\n   'Scalable' congestion controls.  These
    achieve consistently very Low\n   queuing Latency, very Low congestion Loss and
    Scaling of per-flow\n   throughput (L4S) by using Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN) in a\n   modified way.  Until the Coupled DualQ, these L4S senders could
    only\n   be deployed where a clean-slate environment could be arranged, such\n
    \  as in private data centres.  The coupling acts like a semi-permeable\n   membrane:
    isolating the sub-millisecond average queuing delay and\n   zero congestion loss
    of L4S from Classic latency and loss; but\n   pooling the capacity between any
    combination of Scalable and Classic\n   flows with roughly equivalent throughput
    per flow.  The DualQ\n   achieves this indirectly, without having to inspect transport
    layer\n   flow identifiers and without compromising the performance of the\n   Classic
    traffic.  The solution has low complexity and requires no\n   configuration for
    the public Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
