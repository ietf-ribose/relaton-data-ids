abstract:
  content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support formultiple
    authentication methods. This document defines the TunneledExtensible Authentication
    Method (TEAM), which provides an encryptedand authenticated tunnel based on transport
    layer security (TLS) thatencapsulates EAP authentication mechanisms. TEAM uses
    TLS to protectagainst rogue authenticators, protect against various attacks on
    theconfidentiality and integrity of the inner EAP method exchange andprovide EAP
    peer identity privacy. TEAM also provides support forchaining multiple EAP mechanisms,
    cryptographic binding betweenauthentications performed by inner EAP mechanisms
    and the tunnel,exchange of arbitrary parameters (TLVs), and fragmentation andreassembly.</p>"
