abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an alternative 6rd deployment model
    to that of\n   RFC 5969.  The basic 6rd model allows IPv6 hosts to gain access
    to\n   IPv6 networks across an IPv4 access network using 6-in-4 tunnels. 6rd\n
    \  requires support by a device (the 6rd-CE) on the customer site, which\n   must
    also be assigned an IPv4 address.  The alternative model\n   described in this
    document initiates the 6-in-4 tunnels from an\n   operator-owned gateway collocated
    with the operator's IPv4 network\n   edge, rather than from customer equipment.
    \ The advantages of this\n   approach is that it requires no modification to customer
    equipment\n   and avoids assignment of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment.  The\n
    \  latter point means less pressure on IPv4 addresses in a high-growth\n   environment.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
