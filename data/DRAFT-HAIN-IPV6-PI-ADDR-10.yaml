abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an IPv6 Provider-Independent global unicast
    \naddress format for use in the Internet.  The address format defined \nin this
    document is consistent with the IPv6 Protocol [1] and the \n\"IPv6 Addressing
    Architecture\" [2].  It is designed to facilitate \nscalable Internet routing
    when sites attach to multiple service \nproviders, by using a prefix based on
    a geographic reference to the \nsite. A natural byproduct of this address allocation
    mechanism is \nthat all addresses are fixed allowing sites to change providers
    at \nwill without requiring their network to renumber. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
