abstract:
  content: "<p>Mobile-IP, together with several other supporting standards suchas
    Reverse Tunneling and the Challenge-Response extensions, haveall been recently
    revised. Although such revisions are for themost part backward compatible with
    the original versions,sometimes static configuration of Mobile Nodes and Mobility
    Agentsis required to ensure smooth transition and avoid any possibleconflict between
    different standard versions implemented byalready-deployed equipment. In this
    draft we define compatibilityextensions for Mobile-IP Agent Advertisement, Registration
    Requestand Registration Reply messages that allow all Mobile-IPv4entities to dynamically
    synchronize their 'compatibilityversions', defined as the versions of the Mobile-IP
    standards thata particular node is able to support. This solution offers adynamic
    mechanism which informs all entities involved in aMobile-IP exchange of the version
    of the standard they support,therefore reducing the need to statically configure
    suchinformation at Mobile Nodes or Mobility Agents</p>"
