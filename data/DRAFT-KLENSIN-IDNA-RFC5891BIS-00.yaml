abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IDNA specifications for internationalized domain names
    combine\n   rules that determine the labels that are allowed in the DNS without\n
    \  violating the protocol itself and an assignment of responsibility,\n   consistent
    with earlier specifications, for determining the labels\n   that are allowed in
    particular zones.  Conformance to IDNA by\n   registries and other implementations
    requires both parts.  Experience\n   strongly suggests that the language describing
    those responsibility\n   was insufficiently clear to promote safe and interoperable
    use of the\n   specifications and that more details and some specific examples
    would\n   have been helpful.  This specification updates the earlier ones to\n
    \  provide that guidance and to correct some technical errors in the\n   descriptions.
    \ It does not alter the protocols and rules themselves\n   in any way.\n\n\t </p>\n
    \     "
