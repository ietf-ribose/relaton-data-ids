abstract:
  content: <p>Internet Service Providers (operators) are facing problems wherelocalized
    congestion prevents full utilization of the path betweensender and receiver at
    today's "broadband" speeds. Operators desireto control this congestion, which
    often appears to be caused by asmall number of users consuming a large amount
    of bandwidth.Building out more capacity along all of the path to handle thiscongestion
    can be expensive and may not result in improvements forall users so network operators
    have sought other ways to managecongestion. The current mechanisms all suffer
    from difficultymeasuring the congestion (as distinguished from the total traffic).The
    ConEx Working Group is designing a mechanism to make congestionalong any path
    visible at the Internet Layer. This documentdescribes example cases where this
    mechanism would be useful.</p>
