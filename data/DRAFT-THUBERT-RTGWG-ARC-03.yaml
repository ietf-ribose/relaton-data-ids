abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft introduces the concept of ARC, a two-edged routing\n
    \  construct that forms its own fault isolation and recovery domain.\n   The new
    paradigm can be leveraged to improve the network utilization\n   and resiliency
    for unicast and multicast traffic in multiple\n   environments, and is optimized
    to compute short reroute paths in case\n   of breakages.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
