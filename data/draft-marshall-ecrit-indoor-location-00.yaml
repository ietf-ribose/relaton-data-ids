abstract:
- content: "<p>The application of summoning emergency assistance by using a phone
    to call 9-1-1 in North America has been ingrained in society for 40+ years. A
    successful emergency response to a caller in need, is dependent upon the responders
    receiving accurate location information to effect timely action. Traditional wireline
    telephony is able to utilize the location of the physical wires as a source of
    information for caller location, whereas wireless technologies require more exotic
    mechanisms to locate a 9-1-1 caller. Mechanisms for locating a cellular caller
    dialing 9-1-1 is based on 20 year old technology, which was designed for outdoor
    environments, and does not perform sufficiently when used to locate an emergency
    caller from within a home or office building environment. With growing trends
    in mobile cellular usage, large portions of subscribers are relying solely on
    their mobile phones to make emergency calls. Emergency response time suffers when
    that caller is located indoors. This document defines the problem statement and
    solutions for expanding the current set of methods used to locate a cellular caller
    to 9-1-1. The expansion of the methods includes connections to services that are
    outside the normal administrative domain of the cellular provider, hence both
    the privacy and security aspects of connecting these systems are taken into consideration.</p>"
