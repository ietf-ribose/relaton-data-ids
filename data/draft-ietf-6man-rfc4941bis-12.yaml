abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
    that causes hosts to generate temporary addresses with randomized interface identifiers
    for each prefix advertised with autoconfiguration enabled. Changing addresses
    over time limits the window of time during which eavesdroppers and other information
    collectors may trivially perform address-based network-activity correlation when
    the same address is employed for multiple transactions by the same host. Additionally,
    it reduces the window of exposure of a host as being accessible via an address
    that becomes revealed as a result of active communication. This document obsoletes
    RFC 4941.</p>"
