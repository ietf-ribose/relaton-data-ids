abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPsec gateways and servers maintaining SAs with large number
    of\n   clients can quickly recover from failover using the protocols and\n   procedures
    specified in this document.  These techniques also\n   facilitate IPsec clients
    to move from one gateway to another and\n   resume operation without having to
    rerun IKEv2.  The idea is to\n   maintain IKEv2 and IPsec SA state at either the
    client or one or more\n   backup servers to reduce the communication and computation
    overhead\n   associated with reestablishing the SAs from scratch.  Client to\n
    \  server SA state storage retrieval mechanisms and client-initiated or\n   server-initiated
    failover recovery protocols are specified.  This\n   document, however, does not
    define an inter-gateway transport\n   mechanism to transfer the state across entities
    at the backend.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
