abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In mobile IPv6 networks, a mobile node must register its new care
    of \naddress with its home agent after changing its attachment point, so \nthat
    it can maintain connectivity with peers. In the deployment of \nMIPv6, there may
    be multiple home agents for load balancing and/or \nreliability. In the case of
    load balancing, some mobile nodes may \nregister their care of addresses with
    one home agent, and other \nmobile nodes may register their care of addresses
    with other home \nagents. Some applications may need to query the MIPv6 service
    status \nof a mobile node from home agents, such as the care of address, the \nlife
    time of binding, or other information associated with mobile \nnode that is stored
    on home agents. In order to satisfy this \nrequirement, the first step is to locate
    which home agent the mobile \nnode belongs to, that is to say to confirm which
    home agent to query. \nThis document describes a protocol which can be used to
    locate the \nhome agent that a mobile node belongs to. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
