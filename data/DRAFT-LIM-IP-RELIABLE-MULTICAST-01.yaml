abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo presents IP extension for recovering multicast packets
    from\ncongestion. Dropped packets can be recovered far faster by IP routers\nwith
    extension of this memo than by group member end-hosts. Because\nnecessary interactions
    are limited among adjacent routers, this scheme\nsubstantially reduces overall
    signaling overhead among group members\nfor packet recovery.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
