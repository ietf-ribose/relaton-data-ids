abstract:
- content: <p>The XML Patch media type "application/xml-patch+xml" defines an XML
    document structure for expressing a sequence of patch operations that are applied
    to an XML document. The XML Patch document format's foundations are defined in
    RFC 5261, this specification defines a document format and a media type registration,
    so that XML Patch documents can be labeled with a media type, for example in HTTP
    conversations. Note to Readers This draft should be discussed on the apps-discuss
    mailing list [1]. Online access to all versions and files is available on github
    [2].</p>
