abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>DNSSEC is trying to be deployed everywhere.  Many are afraid of\nDNSSEC
    deployment, which are too heavy to be deployed.  There is a\nhuge gap between
    the resources we need to deploy DNSSEC and the\nbenefits or security we can get
    from the DNSSEC.  This document\nproposes a lightweight DNSSEC mechanism to make
    the DNSSEC to be\ndeployed easily while getting the similar security with the
    heavy\nDNSSEC.\n\t </p>\n      "
