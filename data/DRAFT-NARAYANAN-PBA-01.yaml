abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A cryptographically generated address (CGA) is an IPv6 address\ngenerated
    by applying a hash function over the public key of a node\nand some additional
    parameters.  CGA ownership can be asserted only\nby the node claiming the address,
    but is readily verifiable using the\npublic-key of that node by any other entity.
    \ Such address\nauthorization is also plausible using symmetric keys, where a
    node\ngenerating the self-identifying address shares a key with the\nverifier
    or its agent.  This document specifies symmetric-key based\naddress (SBA) generation.
    \ The infrastructure support comes with\nseveral advantages including proxy-mode
    operation; the symmetric key\nusage results in efficient operation; and finally
    the use of keyed\nhashing provides security advantages over CGAs.\n\t </p>\n      "
