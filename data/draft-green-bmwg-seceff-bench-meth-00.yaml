abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a methodology for evaluating the ability of content-aware
    network devices to correctly detect and block malicious or administratively disallowed
    traffic flows. This benchmark addresses the issue of classification accuracy under
    well defined conditions. It is not concerned with measuring forwarding performance
    which is covered by other BMWG documents.</p>"
