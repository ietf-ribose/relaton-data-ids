abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft considers a packet distribution scheme for bandwidth\naggregation
    on the mobile network with a multi-interfaced mobile \nrouter (MMR). In the proposed
    scheme, the MMR with multiple \nheterogeneous wireless network interfaces effectively
    and fairly \ndistributes packets over end-to-end multi-path through multiple \nnetwork
    interfaces. Each network interface is considered to have a \ndistribution counter
    associated with corresponding end-to-end path. \nThis distribution counter varied
    by both weighted capacity and \ndistributed packets is used to determine if a
    network interface has \nenough credits to distribute incoming packets on multiple
    paths. The \ncapacity unit is shown to be a useful design parameter to make the
    \nperformance of the proposed scheme as good as possible.\n\t </p>\n      "
