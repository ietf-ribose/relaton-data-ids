abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a Secure Internet Group Management
    Protocol\n   (SIGMP), which is an extension to IGMP to enforce receiver access\n
    \  control for secured multicast groups.  In SIGMP, only the hosts\n   operated
    by authorized end users are permitted to report their\n   interest in secured
    groups.  IPsec is used to filter the messages\n   that report or query the interest
    in secured groups.  SIGMP provides\n   two working modes that are fully compatible
    with IGMP v2 and IGMP v3\n   respectively.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
