abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes CPace which is a protocol for two parties\n
    \  that share a low-entropy secret (password) to derive a strong shared\n   key
    without disclosing the secret to offline dictionary attacks.\n   This method was
    tailored for constrained devices, is compatible with\n   any group of both prime-
    and non-prime order, and comes with a\n   security proof providing composability
    guarantees.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
