abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Today's Internet is a product of its history.  TCP is the main\ntransport
    protocol responsible for sharing out bandwidth and\npreventing a recurrence of
    congestion collapse while packet drop is\nthe primary signal of congestion at
    bottlenecks.  Since packet drop\n(and increased delay) impacts all their customers
    negatively, network\noperators would like to be able to distinguish between overly\naggressive
    congestion control and a confluence of many low-bandwidth,\nlow-impact flows.
    \ But they are unable to see the actual congestion\nsignal and thus, they have
    to implement bandwidth and/or usage limits\nbased on the only information they
    can see or measure (the contents\nof the packet headers and the rate of the traffic).
    \ Such measures\ndon't solve the packet-drop problems effectively and are leading
    to\ncalls for government regulation (which also won't solve the problem).\n\nWe
    propose congestion exposure as a possible solution.  This allows\npackets to carry
    an accurate prediction of the congestion they expect\nto cause downstream thus
    allowing it to be visible to ISPs and\nnetwork operators.  This memo sets out
    the motivations for congestion\nexposure and introduces a strawman protocol designed
    to achieve\ncongestion exposure.\n\t </p>\n      "
