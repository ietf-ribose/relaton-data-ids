abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery. This
    extension is designed for low-power and lossy network environments and it supports
    multi-hop operation. Nodes supporting this extension compute a Cryptographically
    Unique Interface ID and associate it with one or more of their Registered Addresses.
    The Cryptographic ID (Crypto-ID) uniquely identifies the owner of the Registered
    Address. It is used in place of the EUI-64 address that is specified in RFC 6775.
    Once an address is registered with a Cryptographic ID, only the owner of that
    ID can modify the state information of the Registered Address in the 6LR and 6LBR.</p>"
