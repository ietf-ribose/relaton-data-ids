abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new protocol value "CDIV" for the Reason Header
    field and a new IANA Registry for registering Call Forwarding service reasons.
    This new value enables signaling that a request has been retargeted as a result
    of a Call Forwarding service invocation.</p>
