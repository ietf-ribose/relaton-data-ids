abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Provider-Provisioned Virtual Private Network (PPVPN)[RFC4110] usessome
    forms of IP tunneling schemes to tunnel VPN traffic. Possiblecandidates are GRE,
    IP-in-IP, IPsec and MPLS. The candidatetunneling scheme should provide multiplexing
    capability, as well asdynamic tunnel setup and maintenance capability. Additionally,security
    is required if the VPN traffic is traversing public Internetor across Service
    Provider domains. Each above candidate by itselfis not sufficient to meet all
    these requirements. This documentdescribes a method of using IPsec signaling (i.e,
    IKE) to setup a GREtunnel. This IPsec GRE tunnel may be used as the candidate
    tunnelingscheme in PPVPN network or remote access compulsory VPN. Thisdocument
    also defines a way how the Key field in GRE header is usedin IPsec GRE tunnel
    setup.</p>"
