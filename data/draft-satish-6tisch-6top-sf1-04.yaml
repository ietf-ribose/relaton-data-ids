abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a 6top Scheduling Function called "Scheduling
    Function One" (SF1) to reserve, label and schedule the end-to-end resources hop-by-hop
    through the Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE). SF1
    uses the 6P signaling messages with a global TrackID to add or delete the cells
    in L2-bundles of isolated traffic flows.</p>
