abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes minimal version of the Internet Key Exchange\nversion
    2 (IKEv2) protocol.  IKEv2 is a component of IPsec used for\nperforming mutual
    authentication and establishing and maintaining\nSecurity Associations (SAs).
    \ IKEv2 includes several optional\nfeatures, which are not needed in minimal implementations.
    \ This\ndocument describes what is required from the minimal implementation,\nand
    also describes various optimizations which can be done.  The\nprotocol described
    here is compliant with full IKEv2 with exception\nthat this document only describes
    shared secret authentication (IKEv2\nrequires support for certificate authentication
    in addition to shared\nsecret authentication).\n\nThis document does not update
    or modify RFC 5996, but provides more\ncompact description of the minimal version
    of the protocol.  If this\ndocument and RFC 5996 conflicts then RFC 5996 is the
    authoritative\ndescription.\n\t </p>\n      "
