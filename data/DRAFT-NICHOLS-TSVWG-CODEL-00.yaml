abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The \"persistently full buffer\" problem has been discussed
    in the IETF\n   community since the early 80's [RFC896]. The IRTF's End-to-End\n
    \  Working Group called for the deployment of active queue management to\n   solve
    the problem in 1998 [RFC2309]. Despite the awareness and\n   recommendations,
    the \"full buffer\" problem has not gone away, but on\n   the contrary has become
    worse as buffers have grown in size and\n   proliferated and today's networks
    proved intractable for available\n   AQM approaches. The overall problem is presently
    known as\n   \"bufferbloat\" [TSVBB2011, BB2011] and has become increasingly\n
    \  important, particularly at the consumer edge.\n\n   This document describes
    a recently developed AQM, Controlled Delay\n   (CoDel) algorithm, which was designed
    to work in modern networking\n   environments and can be deployed as a major part
    of the solution to\n   bufferbloat [CODEL2012].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
