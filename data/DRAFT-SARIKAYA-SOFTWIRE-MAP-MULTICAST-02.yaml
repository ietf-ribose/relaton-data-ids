abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies MAP-E's multicast component so that IPv4
    hosts\n   can receive multicast data from IPv4 servers over an IPv6 network.\n
    \  In the encapsulation solution for encapsulation variant of Mapping of\n   Address
    and Port (MAP), MAP-E, IGMP Proxy at the MAP-E Customer Edge\n   router uses IPv4-in-IPv6
    tunnel established by MAP-E to exchange IGMP\n   messages to establish multicast
    state at MAP-E Border Relay so that\n   MAP-E Border Relay can tunnel IPv4 multicast
    data to IPv4 hosts\n   connected to MAP-E Customer Edge device.  In the Translation\n
    \  Multicast solution for the translation variant of MAP, MAP-T and 4rd,\n   IGMP
    messages are translated into MLD messages at the CE router which\n   is IGMP/MLD
    Proxy and sent to the network in IPv6.  MAP-T/4rd Border\n   Relay does the reverse
    translation and joins IPv4 multicast group for\n   MAP-T/4rd hosts.  Border Relay
    as multicast router receives IPv4\n   multicast data and translates the packet
    into IPv6 multicast data and\n   sends downstream on the multicast tree.  Member
    CEs receive multicast\n   data, translate it back to IPv4 and transmit to the
    hosts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
