abstract:
- content: "<p>In interpersonal messaging end-to-end encryption means for public key
    distribution and verification of its authenticity are needed; the latter to prevent
    man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This document proposes a new method to easily
    verify a public key is authentic by a Handshake process that allows users to easily
    authenticate their communication channel. The new method is targeted to Opportunistic
    Security scenarios and is already implemented in several applications of pretty
    Easy privacy (pEp).</p>"
