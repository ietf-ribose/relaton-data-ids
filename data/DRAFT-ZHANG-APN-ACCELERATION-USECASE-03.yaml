abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the development of the Internet, game industry has risen\n
    \  rapidly, from handheld game consoles to PC games and mobile games.\n   The
    types of games are diversified, while the number of game users is\n   increasing
    year by year.  The game market is maturing quickly.\n\n   Nowadays, the scale
    of game users is large and they belong to the\n   easy-to-consume groups.  Among
    all the games, those require frequent\n   interactions and involve video streaming
    usually have highly\n   demanding requirements on the network in terms of guaranteed
    network\n   latency and reliability.  Therefore, from the aspect of ensuring\n
    \  better gaming experience, it is desirable of differentiating the\n   particular
    gaming application flows and providing high-priority\n   network services for
    those demanding gamers.\n\n   This document describes the game acceleration scenarios
    using\n   Application-aware Networking (APN) technology.  In these scenarios,\n
    \  APN can identify the specific requirements of particular gaming\n   applications,
    steer the flows to the game processors close to the\n   users, and provide SLA
    guaranteed network services such as low\n   latency and high reliability.\n\n\n\t
