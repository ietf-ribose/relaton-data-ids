abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC
    may not\n   have a normative reference to another standards track document at
    a\n   lower maturity level or to a non standards track specification (other\n
    \  than specifications from other standards bodies).  For example, a\n   standards
    track document may not have a normative reference to an\n   informational RFC.
    \ Exceptions to this rule are sometimes needed as\n   the IETF uses informational
    RFCs to describe non-IETF standards or\n   IETF-specific modes of use of such
    standards.  This document defines\n   the procedure used in these circumstances.\n\n
    \  This document merges and updates, and thus obsoletes, RFC 3967, RFC\n   4897,
    and RFC 8067.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
