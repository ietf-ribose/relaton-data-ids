abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    Since digital multichannel TV broadcasting services have been\n
    \   started in many areas, low cost digital data receivers are\n    available.
    They can be used for not only TV broadcasting service but\n    also any kind of
    data communication services.\n \n    A low cost receiver can receive high bandwidth
    traffic from a feed,\n    while no bandwidth from the receiver to the feed is
    provided.\n    Therefore the connection between the feed and the receiver is\n
    \   unidirectional. Current routing protocols stand on a fact that any\n    links
    are bidirectional even if the bandwidth in each direction may\n    be different.
    They can not handle unidirectional links.\n \n    This document defines an idea
    to use unidirectional links (UDLs)\n    routing without any modifications of current
    routing protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
