abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The standard means within the Domain Name System protocol for\n
    \  maintaining coherence among a zone's authoritative name servers\n   consists
    of three mechanisms.  Incremental Zone Transfer (IXFR) is\n   one of the mechanisms
    and originally was defined in RFC 1995.\n\n   This document aims to provide a
    more detailed and up-to-date\n   specification of the IXFR mechanism and to align
    it with the current\n   specification of the primary zone transfer mechanism,
    AXFR, given in\n   RFC 5936.  Further, based on operational experience, this document\n
    \  juxtaposes to the original IXFR query a new query type, IXFR-ONLY,\n   that
    will likely be preferred over IXFR in specific deployments.\n\n   This document
    obsoletes and replaces RFC 1995.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
