abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines access to local Routing\n
    \  Information Bases (RIBs).  This document updates BMP (RFC 7854) by\n   adding
    access to the Local Routing Information Base (Loc-RIB), as\n   defined in RFC
    4271.  The Loc-RIB contains the routes that have been\n   selected by the local
    BGP speaker's Decision Process.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
