abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The flooding algorithm is one of the most important parts of any
    linkstate routing protocol. It ensures that all routers within a linkstate domain
    converge on the same topological information within afinite period of time. To
    ensure reliability, typical implementationsof the flooding algorithm send new
    information via all interfacesother than the one the new piece of information
    was received on. Thisredundancy is necessary to guarantee that flooding is performedreliably,
    but implies considerable overhead of utilized bandwidth andCPU time if neighboring
    routers are connected with more than onelink. This document describes a method
    that reduces this overhead.</p>"
