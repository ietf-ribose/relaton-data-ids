abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes a method for improving the quality of
    experience\n   (QoE) for real-time video and other multimedia services using\n
    \  features and functions of the end-point only, that is, without\n   requiring
    any upgrade to the network transport infrastructure.  Any\n   upgrade to the network
    transport infrastructure not only incurs\n   significant costs, these are also
    time consuming and technology-\n   dependent.  Therefore, these QoE improvement
    mechanisms are\n   significantly more attractive to both network operators and
    service\n   providers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
