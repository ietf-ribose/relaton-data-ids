  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo documents an exploration of a possible Security Automation\n
    \  and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) architecture.  This work is built\n   upon
    [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid], and is predicated upon information\n   gleaned from
    SACM Use Cases and Requirements ([RFC7632] and [RFC8248]\n   respectively), and
    terminology as found in\n   [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
