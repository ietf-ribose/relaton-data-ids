abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics\n
    \  compared with traditional wired and ad-hoc networks. Low Latency\n   Deterministic
    Networks(LLDN) is specified in IEEE 802.15.4e which is\n   for deterministic applications
    in the industrial environment. Some\n   routing metrics and constraints has been
    described in [RFC6551],\n   [RFC5867] [RFC5826], [RFC5673], and [RFC5548]. There
    are several\n   special characteristics and requirements in the industrial\n   environment.
    This document defines a new Link Metric/Constraint\n   Object-Scheduling Waiting
    Time to make RPL support deterministic\n   scheduling mechanism, which could improve
    the determinacy and\n   reliability of the LLNs in industrial environment.\n\n\n\t
