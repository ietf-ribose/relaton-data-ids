abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services\n
    \  mechanisms to support the next generation of the pan European in-\n   vehicle
    emergency call service defined under the eSafety initiative\n   of the European
    Commission (generally referred to as \"eCall\"). eCall\n   is a standardized and
    mandated system for a special form of emergency\n   calls placed by vehicles,
    providing real-time communications and an\n   integrated set of related data.\n\n
    \  This document also registers MIME media types and an Emergency Call\n   Additional
    Data Block for the eCall vehicle data and metadata/control\n   data, and an INFO
    package to enable carrying this data in SIP INFO\n   requests.\n\n   Although
    this specification is designed to meet the requirements of\n   European next-generation
    eCall, it is specified generically such that\n   the technology can be re-used
    or extended to suit requirements across\n   jurisdictions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
