abstract:
  content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 defines a return-routability procedure for secure use ofroute
    optimization between unacquainted nodes. Unfortunately, thisprocedure is known
    to have undesired impacts on handoff latency.This document specifies extensions
    to Mobile IPv6 that eliminate thelatency of the return-routability procedure.
    The extensions thusprovide a basis for more efficient reactive as well as proactivehandoff
    management. They are optional and fully backward-compatible.</p>"
