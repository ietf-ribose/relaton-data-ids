abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft provides an overview of the various terms that are used
    when discussing bootstrapping of IoT devices. We document terms that have been
    used within the IETF as well as other standards bodies. We investigate if the
    terms refer to the same phenomena or have subtle differences. We provide recommendations
    on the applicability of terms in different contexts. Finally, this document presents
    a survey of secure bootstrapping mechanisms available for smart objects that are
    part of an Internet of Things (IoT) network. The survey does not prescribe any
    one mechanism and rather presents IoT developers with different options to choose
    from, depending on their use-case, security requirements, and the user interface
    available on their IoT devices.</p>"
