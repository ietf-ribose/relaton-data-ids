abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
    for\n   IPv6.  It is version three (3) of the protocol.  It is based on the\n
    \  original version of VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in\n   RFC2338.\n\n
    \  VRRP specifies an election protocol that dynamically assigns\n   responsibility
    for a virtual router to one of the VRRP routers on a\n   LAN.  The VRRP router
    controlling the IP address(es) associated with\n   a virtual router is called
    the Master, and forwards packets sent to\n   these IP addresses.  The election
    process provides dynamic fail over\n   in the forwarding responsibility should
    the Master become\n   unavailable.  The advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6
    is a\n   quicker switch over to back up routers than can be obtained with\n   standard
    IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [ND] mechanisms.\n\t </p>\n      "
