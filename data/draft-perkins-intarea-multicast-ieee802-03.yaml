abstract:
- content: "<p>Performance issues have been observed when multicast packet transmissions
    of IETF protocols are used over IEEE 802 wireless media. Even though enhamcements
    for multicast transmissions have been designed at both IETF and IEEE 802, there
    seems to exist a disconnect between specifications, implementations and configuration
    choices. This draft describes the different issues that have been observed, the
    multicast enhancement features that have been specified at IETF and IEEE 802 for
    wireless media, as well as the operational chioces that can be taken to improve
    the performace of the network. Finally, it provides some recommendations about
    the usage and combination of these features and operational choices.</p>"
