abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multihomed mobile nodes are capable of simultaneous attachment
    to\nmultiple access networks.  In this case, a PMIPv6-enabled local\nmobility
    anchor should distribute the application traffic to a proper\naccess network which
    the mobile nodes wish to receive from.  This\ndocument specifies how mobile nodes
    send their desire to the attached\nmobile access gateway, which then relays it
    to a local mobility\nanchor.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft is
