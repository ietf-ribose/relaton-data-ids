abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A bidirectional Pseudowire (PW) service currently uses two\n
    \  unidirectional PWs each carried over a unidirectional LSP.  Each end\n   point
    of a PW or segment of multi-segment PW (MS-PW) independently\n   selects the LSP
    to use to carry the PW for which it is the head end.\n\n   Some transport services
    may require that bidirectional PW traffic\n   follows the same paths through the
    network in both directions.\n   Therefore, PWs may be required to use LSP with
    the same paths.  Co-\n   routed bidirectional LSPs or unidirectional LSPs with
    the same route\n   (links and nodes) allow this service to be provided.\n\n   This
    document specifies an optional extension to LDP that allows both\n   ends of a
    PW (or segment of a MS-PW) to select and bind to the same\n   co-routed bidirectional
    LSP or two unidirectional LSPs with the same\n   route.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
