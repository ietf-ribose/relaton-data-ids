abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends PASSporT, which conveys cryptographically- signed
    information about the people involved in personal communications, to include an
    indication that a call has been diverted from its originally destination to a
    new one. This information can greatly improve the decisions made by verification
    services in call forwarding scenarios.</p>"
