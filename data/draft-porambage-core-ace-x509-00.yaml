abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a web transfer protocol
    designed for resource limited nodes in constrained networks. For securing the
    protocol, CoAP defines a binding to Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) with
    four security modes. One of them is the Certificate mode where the device has
    an asymmetric key pair with an X.509 certificate. However, the intrinsic properties
    of x.509 certificates impede the application on the resource constrained nodes.
    This draft describes the necessary adjustments and derives a modified profile
    for X.509 certificates to cope with the resource limitations of low-power low-performing
    devices</p>"
