abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SCIM 2.0 Core API defines a simple profile for searching
    for\n   specific resource types using filters and qualifiers in combination\n
    \  with the HTTP GET verb.  The Token Search specification defines the\n   following
    additional features:\n\n   o  Specification of search terms within an HTTP POST
    verb to avoid\n      accidental leakage of confidential information via HTTP GET
    URLs,\n\n   o  An optional result set token enabling clients to page through\n
    \     results in a state consistent fashion, and\n\n   o  The ability to search
    across multiple resource types (endpoints)\n      and return one or more resource
    types.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
