abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  This document describes a method by which a Service Provider
    may \n  deploy IPv6 multicast service in BGP/MPLS IPv6 VPNs. Multicast in \n  IPv4
    BGP/MPLS VPN has been in operation for several years and related \n  drafts are
    on RFC standard track . IPv6 infrastructure is under    \n  construction and new
    application based on IPv6 is being developing \n  now. Multicast will act an important
    role in the future IPv6 \n  environment. This document reuses and extends the
    method defined in \n  draft-ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast-01 to support multicast traffic
    in \n  IPv6 VPNs. Specially, both IPv6 core and IPv4 core are considered in \n
    \ this document. \n\n  The inter-working between an IPv4 site and an IPv6 sited
    is \n  outside the scope of this document. \n\t </p>\n      "
