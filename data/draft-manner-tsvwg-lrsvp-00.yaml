abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Guaranteed QoS for multimedia applications is based on reservedresources
    in each node on the end-to-end path. Even if thecorrespondent node does not support
    QoS, it would be useful to beable to reserve at least local resources at the access
    network, e.g.,wireless link resources. Additionally, for mobile nodes thecontinuity
    of QoS is disturbed due to end-to-end signaling or slowre-reservations of resources
    after each handover. This draft proposesa simple enhancement to RSVP, so that
    initial resource reservationsand re-reservations, e.g., due to host mobility can
    be done locallyin an access network.</p>"
