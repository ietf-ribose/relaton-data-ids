abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network slicing provides the ability to partition a physical
    network\n   into multiple logical networks of varying sizes, structures, and\n
    \  functions so that each slice can be dedicated to specific services or\n   customers.
    \ Network slices need to operate in parallel while\n   providing slice elasticity
    in terms of network resource allocation.\n   The Differentiated Service (Diffserv)
    model allows for carrying\n   multiple services on top of a single physical network
    by relying on\n   compliant nodes to apply specific forwarding treatment (scheduling\n
    \  and drop policy) on to packets that carry the respective Diffserv\n   code
    point.  This document adopts the Diffserv principles and\n   proposes a scalable
    approach to realize network slicing in IP/MPLS\n   networks.  The solution does
    not mandate Diffserv to be enabled in\n   the network to provide a specific forwarding
    treatment, but can co-\n   exist with and complement it when enabled.\n\n\t </p>\n
