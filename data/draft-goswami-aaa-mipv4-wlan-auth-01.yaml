abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a single way to perform both Mobile-IPv4 and
    802.11 authentication and key exchanges. Diameter Mobile-IPv4 Application can
    be used to consummate message sequences for both 802.11 and Mobile IPv4. It is
    possible to replace the currently proposed 802.1x Authentication/key-exchange
    with Diameter Mobile-IPv4 Application.</p>"
