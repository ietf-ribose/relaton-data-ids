abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As operators deploy and operate multi-layer networks and diverse\n
    \  transport technologies, layer independent Operations, Maintenance &amp;\n   Administration
    Management (OAM) would be beneficial for monitoring\n   and troubleshooting operations
    of network and service infrastructure.\n\n   This document identifies and discusses
    the key use-cases and high-\n   level requirements for layer independent Operations,
    Administration,\n   and Maintenance management to facilitate operations and maintenance\n
    \  in multi-layer and multi-domain networks utilizing a wide variety of\n   heterogeneous
    networking technologies.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
