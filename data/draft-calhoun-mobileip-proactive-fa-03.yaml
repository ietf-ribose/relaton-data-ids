abstract:
  content: "<p>The Mobile IP protocol allows a Mobile Node to continue using thesame
    home address even after changing its point of attachment to theInternet. This
    provides transparency to most existing applicationsthat assume a fixed address
    and a fixed point of attachment.However, new applications, such as voice-over-IP,
    have additionalreal-time requirements such that a change in the point of attachmentwill
    cause a noticeable degradation of service unless additionalsteps are taken to
    reduce the latency of a handoff event.This specification proposes extensions to
    the Mobile IP protocol thatmay be used by Foreign Agents to set up a Mobile Node's
    visitorentry, and forward its packets, prior to receiving a formalRegistration
    Request from the Mobile Node. This enables a very rapidestablishment of service
    at the new point of attachment so that theeffect of the handoff on real-time applications
    is minimized.</p>"
