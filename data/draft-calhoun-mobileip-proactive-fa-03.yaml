abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mobile IP protocol allows a Mobile Node to continue using the same
    home address even after changing its point of attachment to the Internet. This
    provides transparency to most existing applications that assume a fixed address
    and a fixed point of attachment. However, new applications, such as voice-over-IP,
    have additional real-time requirements such that a change in the point of attachment
    will cause a noticeable degradation of service unless additional steps are taken
    to reduce the latency of a handoff event. This specification proposes extensions
    to the Mobile IP protocol that may be used by Foreign Agents to set up a Mobile
    Node's visitor entry, and forward its packets, prior to receiving a formal Registration
    Request from the Mobile Node. This enables a very rapid establishment of service
    at the new point of attachment so that the effect of the handoff on real-time
    applications is minimized.</p>"
