abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) has been
    extended with a Leasequery capability that allows a requestor to request information
    about DHCPv6 bindings. That mechanism is limited to queries for DHCPv6 binding
    data updates prior to the time the DHCPv6 server receives the Leasequery request.
    Continuous update of an external requestor with Leasequery data is sometimes desired.
    This document expands on the DHCPv6 Leasequery protocol, and allows for active
    transfer of real-time DHCPv6 binding information data via TCP. This document also
    extends DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery by adding new options.</p>"
