abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Designated Forwarder (DF) in (PBB-)EVPN networks is the
    PE\n   responsible for sending multicast, broadcast and unknown unicast\n   traffic
    to a multi-homed CE, on a given Ethernet Tag on a particular\n   Ethernet Segment
    (ES). The DF is selected based on the list of PEs\n   that advertise the Ethernet
    Segment Identifier (ESI) to the EVPN\n   network. While PE node or link failures
    trigger the DF re-election\n   for a given &lt;ESI, EVI&gt;, individual Attachment
    Circuit (AC) or MAC-VRF\n   failures do not trigger such DF re-election and the
    traffic may\n   therefore be permanently impacted, even though there is an\n   alternative
    path. This document improves the DF election algorithm so\n   that the AC status
    can influence the result of the election and this\n   type of \"logical\" failures
    can be protected too.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
