abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Considering that an LLN frame can have a MAC payload below
    100 bytes,\n   an IPv6 packet might be fragmented into more than 10 fragments
    at the\n   6LoWPAN layer.  In a 6LoWPAN mesh-under network, the fragments can
    be\n   forwarded individually across the mesh, whereas a route-over mesh\n   network,
    a fragmented 6LoWPAN packet must be reassembled at every\n   hop, which causes
    latency and congestion.  This draft introduces a\n   simple protocol to forward
    individual fragments across a route-over\n   mesh network, and, regardless of
    the type of mesh, recover the loss\n   of individual fragments across the mesh
    and protect the network\n   against bloat with a minimal flow control.\n\n\t </p>\n
