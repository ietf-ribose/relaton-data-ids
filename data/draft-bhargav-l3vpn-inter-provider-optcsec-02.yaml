abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain models of inter-provider Multi-Protocol-Label-Switching
    based Virtual Private Networks (MPLS-VPNs), spoofing attacks against VPN sites
    is a key concern. Unidirectional attacks towards VPN sites can compromise servers
    at the VPN sites and cause Denial-of-Service (DoS) situations. Currently, the
    inner labels associated with VPN sites are not encrypted during transmission.
    The Provider Edge (PE) router at the end to which the VPN customer is attached
    accepts any data packet with a valid label. This enables a man-in-the-middle attacker
    to spoof a packet to a specific site of a VPN. In this paper, we propose some
    secure techniques which provide security against such label-spoofing. These techniques
    ensure that an attacker would not be able to spoof labeled data packets. In order
    to make the proposed scheme robust, some additional steps are proposed over and
    above the initial steps specified. This makes the attacker to spend non-linear
    time to guess the right label for his unidirectional attacks to succeed. Our proposed
    technique can be applied to a specific type of inter-provider Border Gateway Protocol(BGP)
    based MPLS VPN and other existing variant where Multi-Protocol exterior- BGP (MP-eBGP)
    multi-hop is used. In future, if any other variant is proposed to use MP-eBGP
    multi-hop, our scheme can be used to protect against spoofing attacks.</p>"
