abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the usage of the Session Initiation
    Protocol\n   (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of location presence.\n
    \  Presence is defined as the willingness and ability of a user to\n   communicate
    with other users on the network.  Presence data is\n   general information about
    the state of a user like \"on-line\" and\n   \"off-line\".  Location presence
    extends conventional presence by\n   taking the physical location of a user into
    account.  Location\n   presence is information about the geographical position
    of a user.\n   Subscriptions and notifications of location presence are supported
    by\n   defining an event package within the general SIP event notification\n   framework.
    \ This protocol is also compliant with the Common Presence\n   Profile (CPP) framework.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
