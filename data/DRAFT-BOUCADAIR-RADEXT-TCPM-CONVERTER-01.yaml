abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Because of the lack of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) support at the
    server\n   side, some service providers now consider a network-assisted model\n
    \  that relies upon the activation of a dedicated function called\n   Converters.
    \ Network-assisted MPTCP deployment models are designed to\n   facilitate the
    adoption of MPTCP for the establishment of multi-path\n   communications without
    making any assumption about the support of\n   MPTCP by the communicating peers.
    \ Converters located in the network\n   are responsible for establishing multi-path
    communications on behalf\n   of endpoints, thereby taking advantage of MPTCP capabilities
    to\n   achieve different goals that include (but are not limited to)\n   optimization
    of resource usage (e.g., bandwidth aggregation), of\n   resiliency (e.g., primary/backup
    communication paths), and traffic\n   offload management.\n\n   This document
    specifies a new Remote Authentication Dial-In User\n   Service (RADIUS) attributes
    that carry the IP addresses that will be\n   returned to authorized users to reach
    one or multiple Converters.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
