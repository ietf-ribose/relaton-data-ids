abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet mail defines the RFC5322.From field to indicate the author
    of the message's content and the RFC5322.Sender field to indicate who initially
    handled the message. The RFC5322.Sender field is optional, if it has the same
    information as the RFC5322.From field. That is, when the RFC5322.Sender field
    is absent, the RFC5322.From field has conflated semantics, with both a handling
    identifier and a content creator identifier. This was not a problem, until development
    of stringent protections on use of the RFC5322.From field. It has prompted Mediators,
    such as mailing lists, to modify the RFC5322.From field, to circumvent mail rejection
    caused by those protections. This affects end-to-end behavior of email, between
    the author and the final recipients, because mail from the same author is not
    treated the same, depending on what path it followed. In effect, the RFC5322.From
    field has become dominated by its role as a handling identifier. The current specification
    augments use of the RFC5322.From field, by enhancing DMARC to also use the RFC5322.Sender
    field. This preserves the utility of RFC5322.From field while also preserving
    the utility of DMARC.</p>"
