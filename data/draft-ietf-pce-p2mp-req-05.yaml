abstract:
- content: <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. Extensions to the MPLS and GMPLS signaling
    and routing protocols have been made in support of point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
    Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). The use of PCE in MPLS networks
    is already established, and since P2MP TE LSP routes are sometimes complex to
    compute, it is likely that PCE will be used for P2MP LSPs. Generic requirements
    for a communication protocol between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs
    are presented in RFC 4657, "Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol
    Generic Requirements". This document complements the generic requirements and
    presents a detailed set of PCC-PCE communication protocol requirements for point-to-multipoint
    MPLS/GMPLS traffic engineering. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>
