abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes enhancements of bootstrapping a remote
    secure\n   key infrastructure (BRSKI, [RFC8995] ) to also operate in domains\n
    \  featuring no or only timely limited connectivity between involved\n   components.
    \ Further enhancements are provided to perform the BRSKI\n   approach in environments,
    in which the role of the pledge changes\n   from a client to a server . This changes
    the interaction model from a\n   pledge-initiator-mode to a pledge-responder-mode.
    \ To support both\n   use cases, BRSKI-AE relies on the exchange of authenticated
    self-\n   contained objects (signature-wrapped objects) also for requesting and\n
    \  distributing of domain specific device certificates.  The defined\n   approach
    is agnostic regarding the utilized enrollment protocol\n   allowing the application
    of existing and potentially new certificate\n   management protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n
