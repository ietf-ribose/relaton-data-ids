abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Misissued public-key certificates can prevent TLS clients from\n
    \  appropriately authenticating the TLS server.  Several alternatives\n   have
    been proposed to detect this situation and prevent a client from\n   establishing
    a TLS session with a TLS end point authenticated with an\n   illegitimate public-key
    certificate, but none is currently in wide\n   use.\n\n   This document proposes
    to extend TLS with opaque pinning tickets as a\n   way to pin the server's identity.
    \ During an initial TLS session, the\n   server provides an original encrypted
    pinning ticket.  In subsequent\n   TLS session establishment, upon receipt of
    the pinning ticket, the\n   server proves its ability to decrypt the pinning ticket
    and thus the\n   ownership if the pinning protection key.  The client can now
    safely\n   conclude that the TLS session is established with the same TLS server\n
    \  as the original TLS session.  One of the important properties of this\n   proposal
    is that no manual management actions are required.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
