abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DMAP Message Access Protocol, Version 1 allows a client
    to access\n   and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server, without\n   revealing
    too much information about messages being accessed to the\n   server.  DMAP permits
    manipulation of mailboxes (remote message\n   folders) in a way that is functionally
    equivalent to local folders.\n   DMAP also provides the capability for an offline
    client to\n   resynchronize with the server and for message submission.  DMAP\n
    \  supports discovery of keys (signets) belonging to other users the\n   client
    can communicate to.  Syncronization and publication of keys\n   (private key,
    might include certificates) and signets (public part,\n   certificate).\n\n   DMAP
    includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming\n   mailboxes, checking
    for new messages, permanently removing messages,\n   setting and clearing flags,
    RFC 5322 and RFC 2045 parsing, and\n   selective fetching of message attributes,
    texts, and portions\n   thereof.  Messages in DMAP are accessed by the use of
    numbers.  These\n   numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers.\n\n
    \  Note: This document is a very early draft and omission of specific\n   syntax
    is intentional.  It is intended to stimulate discussions about\n   specific protocol
    syntax and general design.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
