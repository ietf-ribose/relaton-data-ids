abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an application-layer protocol, the Scoped\nAddress
    Discovery Protocol (SADP), for discovering the scoped\nmulticast address(es) associated
    with a session at particular scopes\nwithin a hierarchically nested set of multicast
    scopes.  SADP is\ndesigned to work within the context of Multicast Address Allocation\nArchitecture
    [MAAA]. It is intended that SADP will provide the\nnecessary general services
    for reliable multicast and searching\napplications to use expanding-scope searches
    in lieu of the well\nknown, but less efficient expanding-ring search.\n\t </p>\n
