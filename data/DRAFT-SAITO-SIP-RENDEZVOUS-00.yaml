abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Home servers are becoming more common and people expect to still\naccess
    them even when they are outside their home.  However, there\nare several requirements
    to realize remote access to the home such as\nname resolution, NAT/Firewall traversal,
    and authentication/\nauthorization.  This document describes what technologies
    can be used\nto solve these issues and analyzes the utility of SIP as a rendezvous\nmechanism
    for this use case.Conventions used in this document\n\nThe key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",
    \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted
    as described in [RFC2119].\n\t </p>\n      "
