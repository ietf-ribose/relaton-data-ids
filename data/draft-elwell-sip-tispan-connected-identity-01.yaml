abstract:
- content: "<p>ETSI TISPAN has presented Next Generation Network (NGN) requirements
    for the delivery of two identities for the caller and two identities for the callee
    in a SIP INVITE-initiated dialog. Although the solution for this in SIP is relatively
    straightforward for caller identity, the delivery of callee identity presents
    some additional problems. This document discusses the issues and suggests some
    candidate solutions. This work is being discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing
    list.</p>"
