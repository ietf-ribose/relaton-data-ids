abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Classical multicast multi-sources applications use the Deering's
    [1]\nASM group communication model where anyone, including non-members,\ncan send
    packets with one local operation to a group identifier G\nwith best effort guarantees
    that its packet will be transmitted to\nall group members: the network duplicates
    packets and manages the\ndynamics of source and receivers.  With the new Holbrook's
    [3] SSM\nmodel it is the responsibility of applications to tell the network\nwho
    are their sources of interest.  As a consequence, the SSM model\nis well suited
    for TV-like (one to many) applications because there\nis only one source to discover
    and it's supposed to be well known.\nBut there is still missing an SSM session
    layer or middleware for\napplications helping multi-sources applications to discover
    the\npresence/leaving source in case of SSM model.  We give here a\npossible implementation
    for this Source discovery session layer\naccording to the protocol defined in
    [5].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
