abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>STD numbers are assigned to IETF Standards Track specifications
    in\norder to provide a stable reference even when RFCs are revised and\nthe underlying
    documents change.  However, the numbers are only\nassigned when the specifications
    reach Full Standard maturity level,\nsignificantly reducing their utility in the
    contemporary world in\nwhich few specifications advance beyond the first standardization\nmaturity
    level.  For that reason, one recent proposal suggested\neliminating the numbers
    entirely.  This document argues that stable\nreferences for Standards Track specifications
    are actually useful and\nthat the solution is not to abolish the numbers but to
    change the\npoint at which they are assigned.\n\t </p>\n      "
