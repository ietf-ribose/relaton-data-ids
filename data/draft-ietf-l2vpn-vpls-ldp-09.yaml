abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) solution
    using pseudowires, a service previously implemented over other tunneling technologies
    and known as Transparent LAN Services (TLS). A VPLS creates an emulated LAN segment
    for a given set of users; i.e., it creates a Layer 2 broadcast domain that is
    fully capable of learning and forwarding on Ethernet MAC addresses and that is
    closed to a given set of users. Multiple VPLS services can be supported from a
    single Provider Edge (PE) node. This document describes the control plane functions
    of signaling pseudowire labels using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), extending
    RFC 4447. It is agnostic to discovery protocols. The data plane functions of forwarding
    are also described, focusing in particular on the learning of MAC addresses. The
    encapsulation of VPLS packets is described by RFC 4448. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
