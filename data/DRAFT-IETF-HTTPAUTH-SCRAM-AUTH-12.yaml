abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used
    by\n   Internet application protocols is the transmission of clear-text\n   passwords
    over a channel protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS).\n   There are some
    significant security concerns with that mechanism,\n   which could be addressed
    by the use of a challenge response\n   authentication mechanism protected by TLS.
    \ Unfortunately, the HTTP\n   Digest challenge response mechanism presently on
    the standards track\n   failed widespread deployment, and have had success only
    in limited\n   use.\n\n   This specification describes a family of HTTP authentication\n
    \  mechanisms called the Salted Challenge Response Authentication\n   Mechanism
    (SCRAM), which addresses security concerns with HTTP Digest\n   and meets the
    deployability requirements.  When used in combination\n   with TLS or an equivalent
    security layer, a mechanism from this\n   family could improve the status-quo
    for HTTP authentication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
