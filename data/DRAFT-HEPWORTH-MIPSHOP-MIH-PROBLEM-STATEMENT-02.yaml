abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are on-going activities in the networking community to develop\nsolutions
    that aid in IP handover mechanisms between heterogeneous\nwired and wireless access
    systems including, but not limited to, IEEE\n802.21.  Intelligent access selection,
    taking into account link layer\nattributes, requires the delivery of a variety
    of different\ninformation types to the terminal from different sources within
    the\nnetwork and vice-versa.  The protocol requirements for this\nsignalling have
    both transport and security issues that must be\nconsidered.  The signalling must
    not be constrained to specific link\ntypes, so there is at least a common component
    to the signalling\nproblem which is within the scope of the IETF.  This draft
    presents a\nproblem statement for this core problem.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
