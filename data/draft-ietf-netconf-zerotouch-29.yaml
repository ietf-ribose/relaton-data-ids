abstract:
  content: "<p>This document presents a technique to securely provision a networking
    device when it is booting in a factory-default state. Variations in the solution
    enable it to be used on both public and private networks. The provisioning steps
    are able to update the boot image, commit an initial configuration, and execute
    arbitrary scripts to address auxiliary needs. The updated device is subsequently
    able to establish secure connections with other systems. For instance, a device
    may establish NETCONF (RFC 6241) and/or RESTCONF (RFC 8040) connections with deployment-specific
    network management systems.</p>"
