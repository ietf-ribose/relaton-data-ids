abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the use of the Constrained Application\n
    \  Protocol (CoAP) for group communication, including the use of UDP/IP\n   multicast
    as the default underlying data transport.  Both unsecured\n   and secured CoAP
    group communication are specified.  Security is\n   achieved by use of the Group
    Object Security for Constrained RESTful\n   Environments (Group OSCORE) protocol.
    \ The target application area of\n   this specification is any group communication
    use cases that involve\n   resource-constrained devices or networks that support
    CoAP.  This\n   document replaces RFC 7390, while it updates RFC 7252 and RFC
    7641.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
