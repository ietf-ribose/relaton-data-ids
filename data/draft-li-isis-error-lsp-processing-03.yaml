abstract:
  content: "<p>Recommendations for Interoperable Networks using Intermediate Systemto
    Intermediate System (IS-IS) [RFC3719] highlights a number ofdifferences between
    the IS-IS protocol as described in ISO 10589 andthe protocol as it is deployed
    today.This document outlines a number of differences found in the ChinaMobile
    backbone network, which is constructed using routers fromseveral manufacturers.
    These differences include LSP checksumcalculation, zero checksum LSP processing,
    zero remaining lifetimeLSP processing, and corrupt LSP processing. This document
    isintended to provide best current practices to facilitateinteroperability and
    maintain network stability.</p>"
