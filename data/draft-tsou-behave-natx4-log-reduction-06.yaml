abstract:
- content: "<p>Various IPv6 transition strategies require the introduction of large-
    scale NATs (e.g., AFTR and NAT64) to share the limited supply of IPv4 addresses
    available in the network until transition is complete. There has recently been
    debate over how to manage the sharing of ports between different subscribers sharing
    the same IPv4 address. One factor in the discussion is the operational requirement
    to log the assignment of transport addresses to subscribers. It has been argued
    that dynamic assignment of individual ports between subscribers requires the generation
    of an excessive volume of logs. This document suggests a way to achieve dynamic
    port sharing while keeping log volumes low.</p>"
