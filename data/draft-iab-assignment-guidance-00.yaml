abstract:
- content: "<p>The IAB suggests that while RFC 1597 establishes reserved IP address
    space for the use of private networks which are isolated and will remain isolated
    from the Internet, any enterprise which anticipates external connectivity to the
    Internet should apply for a globally unique address from an Internet registry
    or service provider. This memo provides information for the Internet community.
    This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
