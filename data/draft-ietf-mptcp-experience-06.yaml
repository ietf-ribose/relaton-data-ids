abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses both use cases and operational experience with
    Multipath TCP in real world networks. It lists several prominent use cases for
    which Multipath TCP has been considered and is being used. It also gives insight
    to some heuristics and decisions that have helped to realize these use cases.</p>"
