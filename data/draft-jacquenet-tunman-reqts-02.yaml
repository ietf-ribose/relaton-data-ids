- content: "<p>In today's Internet, tunnels are established and activated to provide
    a facility for conveying a specific traffic from one point to another, or from
    one point to several others. This draft aims at describing the requirements for
    the specification and the standardization of the configuration information that
    will be used to define, establish, activate and maintain such facilities.</p>"
