abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] defines stateful extensions for
    Path\n   Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).  A Path\n   Computation
    Client (PCC) can synchronize an LSP state information to\n   a Path Computation
    Element (PCE).  [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] allows\n   for PCE redundancy where
    a PCC can have redundant PCEP sessions\n   towards multiple PCEs.  In such a case,
    a PCC gives control on a LSP\n   to only a single PCE, and only one PCE is responsible
    for path\n   computation for this delegated LSP.  There are some use cases where\n
    \  path computation for a particular LSP is linked to another: the most\n   common
    use case is path disjointness.  The set of LSPs that are\n   dependant to each
    other may start from different head-ends.  In such\n   a case, we cannot guarantee
    that at any time all the head-ends\n   (acting as PCCs) will delegate their LSP
    to the same PCE.  This\n   scenario where a group of dependant LSPs are delegated
    to multiple\n   PCEs is called a split-brain scenario.  This split-brain scenario
    may\n   lead to computation loops between PCEs.  This document proposes a\n   solution
    to enhance redundant stateful PCE architecture to overcome\n   those issues.\n\n\n\t
