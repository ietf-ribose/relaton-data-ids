abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Vehicular Mobility Management (VMM) scheme
    for IP-based vehicular networks. The VMM scheme takes advantage of a vehicular
    link model based on a multi-link subnet. With a vehicle's mobility information
    (e.g., position, speed, acceleration/ deceleration, and direction) and navigation
    path (i.e., trajectory), it can provide a moving vehicle with proactive and seamless
    handoff along with its trajectory.</p>"
