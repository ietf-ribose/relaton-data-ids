abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable
    carrier-grade packet transport. This document discusses and specifies the P2MP
    framework primarily related to OAM and related management in MPLS-TP networks.
    This document mainly refers to RFC5654 and RFC6371. The main focus is on the details
    that are not covered or not clarified in relevant RFCs such as RFC5654, RFC5860,
    RFC5921, RFC5951, RFC6371, and RFC7167. Note: This I-D was made and updated including
    the discussions in ITU-T SG15, which were described in Liaison Statements such
    as (https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1235/) This document is a product of
    a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications
    Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of a packet transport network.</p>"
