abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft defines two extensions for the existing session
    resumption\n   mechanisms of TLS that specifically apply to Datagram TLS (DTLS)
    in\n   constrained network environments.  Session resumption type\n   negotiation
    enables the client and the server to explicitly agree on\n   the session resumption
    mechanism for subsequent handshakes, thus\n   avoiding unnecessary overheads occurring
    with the existing\n   specifications.  Session resumption without client-side
    state\n   additionally enables a constrained DTLS client to resume a session\n
    \  without the need to maintain state while the session is inactive.\n   The extensions
    defined in this draft update [RFC5077] and [RFC5246].\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
