abstract:
- content: "<p>DM (Distribution Master) is used to transfer zone file data between
    the registry and the authoritative server. The centralized DM system has the risk
    of a single point of failure. The distributed DM architecture allows nodes to
    join and exit at any time to solve the single point of failure problem.</p>"
