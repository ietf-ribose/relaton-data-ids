abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the architecture of the eduroam service
    for\n   federated (wireless) network access in academia.  The combination of\n
    \  IEEE 802.1X, EAP and RADIUS that is used in eduroam provides a\n   secure,
    scalable and deployable service for roaming network access.\n   The successful
    deployment of eduroam over the last decade in the\n   educational sector may serve
    as an example for other sectors, hence\n   this document.  In particular the initial
    architectural and standards\n   choices and the changes that were prompted by
    operational experience\n   are highlighted.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
