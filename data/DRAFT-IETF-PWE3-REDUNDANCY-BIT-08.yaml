abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for signaling the active
    and\n   standby status of redundant pseudowires (PWs) between their\n   termination
    points. A set of redundant PWs is configured between\n   provider edge (PE) nodes
    in single-segment pseudowire (SS-PW)\n   applications, or between terminating
    provider edge (T-PE) nodes in\n   multi-segment pseudowire (MS-PW) applications.\n\n
    \  In order for the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW to use\n   for
    forwarding PW packets to one another, a new status bit is\n   defined. This bit
    indicates a preferential forwarding status with a\n   value of Active or Standby
    for each PW in a redundant set.\n\n   In addition, a second status bit is defined
    to allow peer PE nodes\n   to coordinate a switchover operation of the PW.\n\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
