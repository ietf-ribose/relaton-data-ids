abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates the 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol
    defined in RFC 6775 and RFC 8505. The new extension is called Address Protected
    Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND) and it protects the owner of an address against address
    theft and impersonation attacks in a low-power and lossy network (LLN). Nodes
    supporting this extension compute a cryptographic identifier (Crypto-ID) and use
    it with one or more of their Registered Addresses. The Crypto-ID identifies the
    owner of the Registered Address and can be used to provide proof of ownership
    of the Registered Addresses. Once an address is registered with the Crypto-ID
    and a proof-of-ownership is provided, only the owner of that address can modify
    the registration information, thereby enforcing Source Address Validation.</p>"
