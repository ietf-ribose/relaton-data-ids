abstract:
- content: <p>In addition to being used for forwarding, an MPLS label stack may also
    be used as an entropy source to perform load balancing computation in various
    ways. RFC 4928 and RFC 6790 describe this mechanism in great detail. However,
    those two RFCs differ in the use of MPLS special purpose labels (previously referred
    to as "reserved labels") for computation of load balancing. This document addresses
    this difference in specifications by providing a more comprehensive set of recommendations.
    This document updates RFC 4928 and RFC 6790.</p>
