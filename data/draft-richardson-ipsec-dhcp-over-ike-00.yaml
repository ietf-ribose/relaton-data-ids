abstract:
  content: "<p>IPsec technology is frequently used for remote access scenarios. Atunnel
    is established from a mobile node (such as a laptop) and anIPsec gateway located
    at the Enterprise. The mobile node's tunnelouter address is potentially any IP
    address on the Internet. Themobile node's tunnel inner address should be an address
    from withinthe enterprise. The assignment of this address should ideally bedone
    dynamically.This document specifies a configuration mode called 'DHCP over IKE'.The
    document specifies that the payload of a DHCP exchange should becarried over an
    IKE phase 1 exchange.</p>"
