abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The BGP4 protocol specifies the selection and propagation of a singlebest
    path for each prefix. As defined today BGP has no mechanisms todistribute paths
    other then best path between it's speakers. Thisbehavior results in number of
    disadvantages for new applications andservices.This document presents an alternative
    mechanism for solving theproblem based on the concept of parallel route reflector
    planes. Italso compares existing solutions and proposed ideas that enabledistribution
    of more paths than just the best path.This proposal does not specify any changes
    to the BGP protocoldefinition. It does not require upgrades to provider edge or
    corerouters nor does it need network wide upgrades. The authors believethat the
    GROW WG would be the best place for this work.</p>"
