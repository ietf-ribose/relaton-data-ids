abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Robocalling has become an increasing problem in the Public
    Switched\n   Telephone Network (PSTN).  While techniques like verified caller
    ID\n   can help reduce its impact, ultimately robocalling will continue\n   until
    economically it is no longer viable.  This document proposes a\n   new type of
    cryptocurrency, called SIPCoin, which is used to create a\n   tax - in the form
    of computation - that must be paid before placing\n   an inter-domain call on
    the SIP-based public telephone network.\n   SIPCoin maintains complete anonymity
    of calls, is non-transferable\n   between users avoiding its usage as an exchangeable
    currency, causes\n   minimal increase call setup delays, and makes use of traditional\n
    \  certificate authority trust chains to validate proofs of work.\n   SIPCoin
    is best used in concert with whitelist based techniques to\n   minimize costs
    on known valid callers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
