abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defined a Home Agent initiated Bootstrap solution
    as a\n   complementarity to current Bootstrap solutions.  In home agent\n   reliability
    problem, current bootstrap solution is not appropriate\n   because sometimes mobile
    node would be infeasible to initiate the\n   bootstrap procedure.  However, a
    Home Agent initiated bootstrap\n   solution would be suitable in this case.\n\t
