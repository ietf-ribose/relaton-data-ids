abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Where the source and/or destination node of an IPv6 communication
    is\n   multi-addressed, a mechanism is required for the initiating node to\n   select
    the most appropriate address pair for the communication.  RFC\n   3484 (IPv6 Default
    Address Selection) [RFC3484] defines such a\n   mechanism for nodes to perform
    source and destination address\n   selection.  While RFC3484 recognised the need
    for implementations to\n   be able to change the policy table, it did not define
    how this could\n   be achieved.  Requirements have now emerged for administrators
    to be\n   able to configure and potentially dynamically change RFC 3484 policy\n
    \  from a central control point, and for (nomadic) hosts to be able to\n   obtain
    the policy for the network that they are currently attached to\n   without manual
    user intervention.  This text discusses considerations\n   for such policy changes,
    including examples of cases where a change\n   of policy is required, and the
    likely frequency of such policy\n   changes.  This text also includes some discussion
    on the need to also\n   update RFC 3484, where default policies are currently
    defined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
