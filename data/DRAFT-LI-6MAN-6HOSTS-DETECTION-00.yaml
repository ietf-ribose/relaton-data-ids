abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The management of hosts and risks is important for enterprises
    that\n   have large scale IP space.  For IPv4, it won't take too long even to\n
    \  scan the entire Internet address space.  For IPv6, further\n   consideration
    is needed.  A narrow range of IPv6 address is preferred\n   for scanning.  And
    in order to shorten the time for IPv6 scanning, a\n   very specific IPv6 address
    list is highly needed.\n\n   This document proposes a solution to solve the problem.
    \ At first,\n   append the information of the collection point address to the
    Router\n   Advertisement packet sent by the router, and announce this address\n
    \  information to all nodes in the subnet.  Then, each host node report\n   its
    own IPv6 address information to the designated collection point\n   by using Echo
    Reply message.  After that, the corresponding\n   collection point device should
    save these information.  In this way,\n   online IPv6 address information in the
    current network can be quickly\n   collected on the collection point device.\n\n\n\t
