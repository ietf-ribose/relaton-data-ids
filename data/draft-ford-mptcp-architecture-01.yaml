abstract:
- content: "<p>Often endpoints are connected by multiple paths, but the nature of
    TCP/IP restricts communications to a single path per socket. Resource usage within
    the network would be more efficient were these multiple paths able to be used
    concurrently. This should enhance user experience through improved resilience
    to network failure and higher throughput. This document outlines architectural
    guidelines for the development of a Multipath Transport Protocol, with references
    to how these architectural components come together in the Multipath TCP (MPTCP)
    protocol. This document also lists certain high level design decisions that provide
    foundations for the MPTCP design, based upon these architectural requirements.</p>"
