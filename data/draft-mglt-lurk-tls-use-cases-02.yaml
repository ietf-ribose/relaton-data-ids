abstract:
- content: "<p>TLS as been designed to setup and authenticate transport layer between
    a TLS Client and a TLS Server. In most cases, the TLS Server both terminates the
    TLS Connection and owns the authentication credentials necessary to authenticate
    the TLS Connection. This document provides use cases where these two functions
    are split into different entities, i.e. the TLS Connection is terminated on an
    Edge Server, while authentication credentials are generated by a Key Server, that
    owns the Private Key.</p>"
