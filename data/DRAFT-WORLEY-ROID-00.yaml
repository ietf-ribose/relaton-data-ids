abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Information-centric networking (ICN) is an approach to evolve
    the\n   Internet infrastructure to access data by unique names.  ROID\n   (\"Resolver
    for OIDs\") is an experimental protocol to support simple\n   implementation of
    ICN.  ROID defines a simple model for mapping data\n   names -- in the form of
    URNs of the \"oid\" scheme -- into URLs which\n   can be used to access the data
    objects.  This experimental version of\n   ROID provides the resolution information
    via DNS records that can be\n   served by a standard DNS server (named a/k/a Bind).
    \ This structure\n   is designed for easy deployment of ROID in existing environments
    in\n   order to support proof-of-concept implementations of ICN.\n\n\t </p>\n
