abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The selection of a downstream CDN by an upstream CDN is based
    on\n   multi-dimensional criteria such as the number of hops, the\n   performance
    of the connections between the user-agent and downstream\n   CDNs, the availability
    of downstream CDNs resources and business\n   policies.  Various protocols, such
    as BGP or ALTO, may be used by a\n   downstream CDN to expose content routing
    information and\n   interconnection preferences to an upstream CDN.  This draft
    specifies\n   the parameters of an ALTO session between two interconnected CDNs.\n\n\n\t
