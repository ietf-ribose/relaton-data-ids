abstract:
- content: "<p>The Parallel Network File System (pNFS) allows a separation between
    the metadata (onto a metadata server) and data (onto a storage device) for a file.
    The flexible file layout type is defined in this document as an extension to pNFS
    to allow the use of storage devices in a fashion such that they require only a
    quite limited degree of interaction with the metadata server, using already existing
    protocols. Client side mirroring is also added to provide replication of files.</p>"
