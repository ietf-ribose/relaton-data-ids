abstract:
  content: "\t <t>As one works on internationalization issues for DNS, email, and
    otherprotocols, it becomes clear that the various encodings andtransformations
    required, while not intrinsically difficult, can bean impediment to rapid conversion
    of applications to internationalform and to rapid prototyping of new applications.
    This documentproposes a new, lightweight, protocol that can be used to make suchconversions,
    rather than incorporating the needed tables andalgorithms into each application.</p>"
