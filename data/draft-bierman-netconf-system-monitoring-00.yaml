abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The NETCONF protocol provides mechanisms to manipulate configurationdatastores.
    However, client applications often need to examinesystem information to determine
    the appropriate configurationrequirements. In addition, common system events such
    as a change insystem capabilities may impact management applications. Standardmechanisms
    are needed to support the monitoring of the managed systemsupported by a NETCONF
    server. This document defines a YANG modulefor the monitoring of system information,
    which allows a NETCONFclient to identify system properties and receive notifications
    forsystem events.</p>"
