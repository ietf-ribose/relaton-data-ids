abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is much interest in \"Internet of Things (IoT)\" and
    multiple\n   standards following the REST architectural style are under\n   development.
    \ In a RESTful interaction, IoT devices need to\n   understand each other's resource
    representations, both the semantic\n   meaning and the syntactic form, to interact
    properly.  For\n   interoperability among different standards, it is helpful for
    CoAP\n   endpoints to indicate the resource models they support.  This\n   document
    presents a scheme for IoT devices to exchange their resource\n   model information
    and requests from IANA new Internet media types and\n   CoAP Content-Format identifier
    for resource model indication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
