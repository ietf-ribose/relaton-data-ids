abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The arrangements relating to administrative support for the
    IETF were\n   created more than ten years ago.  Since then, there has been\n   considerable
    change in the tasks and in our own expectations.  The\n   IETF community has discussed
    these changes and the problems they\n   cause.  The community has some sense of
    the properties they expect\n   from future arrangements, including those related
    to structure,\n   organization, personnel, and transparency.\n\n   This document
    is a product of a design team, focused on providing\n   additional information
    to the community about solution options, as\n   well as supporting analysis of
    the implications of those options.  To\n   be clear, the community is responsible
    for adopting any\n   recommendations or making any final decisions.\n\n\t </p>\n
