abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering
    Label\n   Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and\n
    \  Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been\n   identified
    as a key requirement.  In this context, a domain is a\n   collection of network
    elements within a common sphere of address\n   management or path computational
    responsibility such as an Interior\n   Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous
    Systems (AS).  This\n   document specifies a standard representation and encoding
    of a\n   Domain-Sequence, which is defined as an ordered sequence of domains\n
    \  traversed to reach the destination domain to be used by Path\n   Computation
    Elements (PCEs) to compute inter-domain shortest\n   constrained paths across
    a predetermined sequence of domains . This\n   document also defines new subobjects
    to be used to encode domain\n   identifiers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
