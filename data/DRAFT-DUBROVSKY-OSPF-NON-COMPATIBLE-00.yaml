abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a generic mechanism that facilitates
    the\n   deployment of non-backward-compatible changes in OSPF protocol.  This\n
    \  mechanism allows the OSPF routers to advertise the capability of non-\n   backward-compatible
    functionality and to make the functionality\n   operational only when supported
    by all participating routers.\n   Depending on the functionality scope, capability
    advertisements must\n   be propagated across a link, area or autonomous system
    (AS).  For\n   link and area scope functionality, Router Information Link State\n
    \  Advertisement (LSA) is utilized to propagate the capability\n   information.
    \ For the cases when compatibility must be maintained\n   across the whole OSPF
    autonomous system, new Area Information (AI)\n   LSA is introduced.  The AI LSA
    is a TLV-based analog of Indication-\n   LSA that is used for demand circuit functionality
    and described in\n   RFC1793.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
