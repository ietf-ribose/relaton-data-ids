abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Work has been progressing in the Common Control and MeasurementProtocol
    (CCAMP) working group on the application of MPLS technologyto non-packet switching
    networks. Development of the GeneralizedMPLS (GMPLS) signaling draft [1] has allowed
    for Optical, SONET/SDH,and spatial switching systems to be controlled using IP
    protocols.In a GMPLS network, the path that a TDM connection will use isdeveloped
    using constraint based routing. The developed routeutilizes TDM link state information
    announced via OSPF or IS-IS byother nodes in the network. However, a node cannot
    advertise theexistence of a link without first identifying the remote nodeconnected
    to the link and the capabilities of the neighboring node.In a packet network,
    this function would typically be accomplishedusing OSPF or IS-IS Hello messages
    repeated every 10 or so seconds.However, the TDM link cannot transmit similar
    messages because theport terminating the link cannot be shared between a TDM serviceuser
    and the OSPF/IS-IS termination function.</p>"
