abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a protocol for sending notifications over HTTPS.
    YANG modules for configuring publishers are also defined. Examples are provided
    illustrating how to configure various publishers. This document requires that
    the publisher is a "server" (e.g., a NETCONF or RESTCONF server), but does not
    assume that the receiver is a server.</p>
