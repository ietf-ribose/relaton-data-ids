abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As multicast networks start to get deployed in large number, it
    \nbecomes very important that, proper mechanisms are in place for \ntrouble shooting
    error conditions and informing other failure \nsituations. Since multicasting
    has little support from IP in this\nmatter (since ICMP does not support multicasting
    and broadcasting) it\nbehooves that, multicast routing protocols, embed these
    features in \nthemselves. This draft presents some ideas about how this can be
    done\nusing PIM protocol suite as example, since PIMSSM and PIMSM are \nprobably
    most widely used multicast routing protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
