abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for\n
    \  multiple authentication methods.  This document defines the EAP-NOOB\n   authentication
    method for nimble out-of-band (OOB) authentication and\n   key derivation.  The
    EAP method is intended for bootstrapping all\n   kinds of Internet-of-Things (IoT)
    devices that have no pre-configured\n   authentication credentials.  The method
    makes use of a user-assisted\n   one-directional OOB message between the peer
    device and\n   authentication server to authenticate the in-band key exchange.
    \ The\n   device must have an input or output interface, such as a display,\n
    \  microphone, speakers or blinking light, which can send or receive\n   dynamically
    generated messages of tens of bytes in length.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
