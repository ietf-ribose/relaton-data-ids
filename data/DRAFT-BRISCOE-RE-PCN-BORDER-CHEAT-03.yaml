abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Scaling per flow admission control to the Internet is a hard problem.\nThe
    approach of combining Diffserv and pre-congestion notification\n(PCN) provides
    a service slightly better than Intserv controlled load\nthat scales to networks
    of any size without needing Diffserv's usual\noverprovisioning, but only if domains
    trust each other to comply with\nadmission control and rate policing.  This memo
    claims to solve this\ntrust problem without losing scalability.  It provides a
    sufficient\nemulation of per-flow policing at borders but with only passive bulk\nmetering
    rather than per-flow processing.  Measurements are\nsufficient to apply penalties
    against cheating neighbour networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
