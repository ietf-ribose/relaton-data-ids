abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many IPv6 transition technologies has been proposed, such\n
    \  as Dual-Stack, 6rd and so on.  An CPE may support some of\n   them instead
    of only one.  But the ISPs always support different kinds\n   of transition technologies.
    \ So they must control all the CPEs to\n   match the exact transition tech through
    the CPEs' management system\n   or configuring them before issuing to the customers.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
