abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A taxonomy of textual representations for four-octet Autonomous\n
    \  System (AS) numbers is defined.  The 'asdot' textual representation\n   is
    recommended.  The syntax chosen avoids ambiguity with Border\n   Gateway Protocol
    (BGP) community string representation of AS numbers.\n   It is recommended that
    this textual representation be used by all\n   documents, systems and user interfaces
    referring to four-octet AS\n   numbers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
