abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes some practical usages of address selection\n
    \  policy distribution mechanism defined in another document.  Address\n   selection
    policies are originated by ISPs or by network\n   administrators and are delivered
    to each end host.  These policies\n   are stored at end hosts in the form of default
    address selection\n   policy table.  This mechanism enables central control of
    address\n   selection policy at end hosts, so it is essential or helpful in many\n
    \  cases, such as IPv4 and IPv6 dual-stack environment and ULA and\n   Global
    address parallel-use environment.\n\t </p>\n      "
