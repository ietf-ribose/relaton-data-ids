abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification updates RFC 6775 -- the Low-Power Wireless Personal
    Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery specification -- to clarify the role
    of the protocol as a registration technique and simplify the registration operation
    in 6LoWPAN routers, as well as to provide enhancements to the registration capabilities
    and mobility detection for different network topologies, including the Routing
    Registrars performing routing for host routes and/or proxy Neighbor Discovery
    in a low-power network.</p>"
