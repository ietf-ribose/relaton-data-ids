abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In large presence systems deployed in multiservice networks, presenceinformation
    is often known by the network in addition to, or insteadof the presentity's devices
    (endpoints). Examples of suchinformation include location and availability for
    various kinds ofsession establishment. Even if devices know the information, thenetwork
    often has more bandwidth and better scale to keep thepresence server up to date.
    A Presence Network Agent (PNA) canpublish presence information to a Presence Server(PS).
    When donelarge scale, the basic publish operation can be inefficient. Whenthe
    network has millions of subscribers, only some of which havewatchers, blind Publish
    operations are unecessary. WINFO can be usedto determine watchers, but the efficiency
    of maintaining WINFO persubscriber, and the size of the messages involved, make
    that solutionunattractive. The PNA would prefer to have the Presence Serversimply
    tell it when there was at least one watcher.This document describes an XML document
    stored on the PS by which thePNA maintains a list of subscribers it can provide
    presence for as aSIP event package that tells the PNA when the number of watchers
    fora presentity on the list (or a specific presence element for apresentity) goes
    from 0 to at least 1 or from 1 to 0.</p>"
