abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies requirements for implementation of Internet
    \nMedia Guide (IMG) over Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) because \nthere are
    still different concepts about applications and technical \nimplementation of
    IMG. Triple Play Services (TPS) for IPTV need more \nefficient and integrated
    IMG than existent IMG for ordinary TV. Such \nvariations raise not only the question
    of compatibility between \ndifferent vendors of IMG systems, but bring the confusion
    at consumer \nside: which one system is most suitable to viewers and what are
    the \ncriteria for suitability of IPTV IMG system for viewers. These \nrequirements
    are designed to guide choice and development of IMG \nfeature.\n\t </p>\n      "
