abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IP+optical is a cross-layer collaboration technology for unified\n
    \  management of IP and optical networks.  Based on framework proposed\n   in
    [ACTN-FWK][I-D.ietf-teas-actn-framework], this draft presents\n   specific information
    about the IP+optical solution: hierarchical\n   controllers + disabled GMPLS UNIs.
    \ This solution does not involve\n   UNI tunnel objects.  Therefore, the mapping
    between IP links and\n   transport services is key point of this solution.  This
    draft\n   provides a YANG model for the RESTCONF/NETCONF protocol.  This YANG\n
    \  module defines NBIs for the IP+optical super controller.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
