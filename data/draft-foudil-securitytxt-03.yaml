abstract:
- content: "<p>When security risks in web services are discovered by independent security
    researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they often lack the channels
    to disclose them properly. As a result, security issues may be left unreported.
    security.txt defines a standard to help organizations describe the process for
    security researchers to disclose security vulnerabilities securely.</p>"
