abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Current Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure will not
    be able to\n   deal with the next future traffic increase.  As such traffic is
    being\n   offloaded on alternate networks like WLAN.  Contrary to RAN, WLAN MAY\n
    \  not be trusted networks, so the End User has to secure offloaded\n   communications.
    \ Current offload architectures consist in tunneling\n   the End User traffic
    to a Security Gateway.  Alternatively, ISPs MAY\n   provide End-to-End security
    and connect directly the End User to the\n   Server.  Because WLAN network are
    not managed by ISPs, WLAN Access\n   Points MAY not be reliable making End User
    willing to benefit from\n   multiple connections.\n\n   This draft presents the
    Security Requirements for an offloaded End\n   User with multiple interfaces.
    \ From the Security Requirements, the\n   draft explains why IPsec is the most
    appropriated security protocol,\n   and points the Multihoming feature current
    IKEv2 Extension MOBIKE are\n   lacking.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
