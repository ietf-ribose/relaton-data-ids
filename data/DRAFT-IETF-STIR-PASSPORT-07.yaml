abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a canonical string object or 'token'
    including\n   a digital signature for verifying the author of the token, their\n
    \  authority to author the token and the information asserted in the\n   token,
    minimally, the originating identity or 'persona' corresponding\n   specifically
    to the originator of 'personal communications', or\n   signalled communications
    between a set of parties with identities.\n   The PASSporT token is cryptographically
    signed to protect the\n   integrity of the identify the originator of a personal
    communications\n   session (e.g. the telephone number or URI) and verify the assertion\n
    \  of the identity information at the destination.  The cryptographic\n   signature
    is defined with the intention that it can confidently\n   verify the originating
    persona even when the signature is sent to the\n   destination party over an insecure
    channel.  PASSporT is particularly\n   useful for many personal communications
    applications over IP networks\n   and other multi-hop interconnection scenarios
    where the originating\n   and destination parties may not have a direct trusted
    relationship.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
