abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When certain RSVP-TE optimizations are implemented, ingress
    LSRs can\n   receive RSVP RESV messages before forwarding state has been installed\n
    \  on all downstream nodes.  According to the RSVP-TE specification, the\n   ingress
    LSR can forward traffic through an LSP as soon as it receives\n   a RESV message.
    \ However, if the ingress LSR forwards traffic through\n   the LSP before forwarding
    state has been installed on all downstream\n   nodes, traffic can be lost.\n\n
    \  This memo describes LSP Self-ping.  When an ingress LSR receives an\n   RESV
    message, it can invoke LSP Self-ping procedures to ensure that\n   forwarding
    state has been installed on all downstream nodes.\n\n   LSP Self-ping is an extremely
    light-weight mechanism.  It does not\n   consume control plane resources on transit
    or egress LSRs.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
