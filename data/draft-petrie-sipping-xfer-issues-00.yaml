abstract:
- content: "<p>Transfer features in SIP have been enabled via the REFER method and
    Replaces header. These constructs have been around for a while now with stable
    definitions for how they work. However, there appear to be a small set of edge
    cases and requirements that are not yet satisfied. This draft attempts to define
    some of those cases and requirements. This is intended to spark discussion to
    whether these are legitimate requirements on which further standards work is appropriate.</p>"
