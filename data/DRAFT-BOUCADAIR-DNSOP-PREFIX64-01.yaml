abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)\n
    \  option to convey the IPv6 prefix used to build IPv4-converted IPv6\n   addresses.
    \ When conveyed in a DNS query, the option communicates the\n   IPv6 prefix used
    in the network from which the query was originated.\n   Such a network is assumed
    to enable a Network Address and Protocol\n   Translation from IPv6 clients to
    IPv4 servers (NAT64) function.\n   DNS64-capable servers will use that prefix
    to build synthesized AAAA\n   records, rather than relying on a preconfigured
    prefix.  When\n   conveyed in a DNS reply, the option conveys the IPv6 prefix
    that is\n   used by a DNS64-capable server to synthesized AAAA records.  Such\n
    \  information helps to automatically detect mismatches between the\n   local
    NAT64 configuration and the one enforced at the DNS64 server.\n   Also, security-aware
    and validating hosts may use the new EDNS0\n   option to signal the presence of
    a NAT64 function.  That signal is\n   used by the DNS server to fill the additional
    section of the AAAA\n   reply in order to supply A RRs of the target.  Dual queries
    and\n   delays are thus avoided.\n\n   This document updates RFC 6147.\n\n\t </p>\n
