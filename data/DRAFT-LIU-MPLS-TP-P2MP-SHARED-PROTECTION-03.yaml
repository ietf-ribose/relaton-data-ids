abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document will describle two protection solutions to support\n
    \  protection of failures in p2mp path in MPLS-TP.  According to the\n   protection
    Requirements in RFC 5654, there are requirements for\n   MPLS-TP to support sharing
    of protection resources such that\n   protection paths that are known not to be
    required concurrently can\n   share the same protection resources.  In addition,
    there is a\n   requirement for MPLS-TP to support unidirectional 1:n protection
    for\n   p2mp paths.  These requirements are further addressed in\n   draft-ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk
    . so this draft will present proposed\n   solutions .\n\n\n   This document is
    a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task\n   Force(IETF) / International
    Telecommunications Union\n   Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T)
    effort to include\n   an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3
    architectures\n   to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet
    transport\n   network as defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
