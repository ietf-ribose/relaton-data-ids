abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In a network comprising thousands of BGP peers exchanging millions
    ofroutes, many routes are reachable via more than one next-hop. Giventhe large
    scaling targets, it is desirable to restore traffic afterfailure in a time period
    that does not depend on the number of BGPprefixes. In this document we proposed
    an architecture by whichtraffic can be re-routed to ECMP or pre-calculated backup
    paths in atimeframe that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. Theobjective
    is achieved through organizing the forwarding datastructures in a hierarchical
    manner and sharing forwarding elementsamong the maximum possible number of routes.
    The proposed techniqueachieves prefix independent convergence while ensuring incrementaldeployment,
    complete automation, and zero management and provisioningeffort. It is noteworthy
    to mention that the benefits of BGP PrefixIndependent Convergence (BGP-PIC) are
    hinged on the existence of morethan one path whether as ECMP or primary-backup.</p>"
