abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP Reason header field is defined for carrying ISDN User Part
    (ISUP) cause values as well as SIP response codes. Some services in SIP networks
    may need to know the ISUP location where the call was released in the PSTN network
    to correctly interpret the reason of release. This document will update [RFC3326].</p>"
