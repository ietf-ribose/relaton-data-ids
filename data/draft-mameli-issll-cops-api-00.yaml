abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document focuses on the Admission Control functionality performedby
    the Edge Router in the IntServ/DiffServ interworking scenariodescribed in [COPS-ISDS].
    More precisely it describes the interactionbetween the RSVP and the COPS protocols
    in the Edge Router andintroduces an API (Application Programming Interface) aimed
    at allowingthe intercommunication between them. Anyway, the API described here
    isdesigned as a flexible interface, and should be able to supportcommunication
    between a generic application and the COPS Client Typedescribed in [COPS-ODRA].</p>"
