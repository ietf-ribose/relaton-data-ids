abstract:
- content: <p>SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism framework
    that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols and attributes. This
    framework has been extended with a media capabilities negotiation mechanism that
    allows endpoints to negotiate additional media-related capabilities. This negotiation
    is embedded into the widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures. This memo extends
    the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow endpoints to negotiate two additional
    SDP capabilities. In particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate titles
    ("i=" line for each session or media) and bandwidth ("b=" line).</p>
