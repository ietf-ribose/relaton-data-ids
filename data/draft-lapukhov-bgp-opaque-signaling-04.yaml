abstract:
- content: "<p>Border Gateway Protocol with multi-protocol extensions (MP-BGP) enables
    the use of the protocol for dissemination of virtually any information. This document
    proposes a new Address Family/Subsequent Address Family to be used for distribution
    of opaque data. This functionality is intended to be used by applications other
    than BGP for exchange of their own data on top of BGP mesh. The structure of such
    data SHOULD NOT be interpreted by the regular BGP speakers, rather the goal is
    to use BGP purely as a convenient and scalable communication system.</p>"
