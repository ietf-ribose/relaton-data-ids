abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method
    by\n   which a hearing persons can communicate with deaf/Hard of Hearing\n   user
    using an interpreter (\"Communications Assistant\") connected via\n   a videophone
    to the deaf/HoH user and an audio telephone call to the\n   hearing user.  The
    CA interprets using sign language on the\n   videophone link and voice on the
    telephone link.  Often the\n   interpreters may be supplied by a company or agency
    termed a\n   \"provider\" in this document.  The provider also provides a video\n
    \  service that allows users to connect video devices to their service,\n   and
    subsequently to CAs and other deaf/HoH users.  It is desirable\n   that the videophones
    used by the deaf/HoH/H-I user conform to a\n   standard so that any device may
    be used with any provider and that\n   video calls direct between deaf/HoH users
    work.  This document\n   describes the interface between a videophone and a provider.\n\n\t
