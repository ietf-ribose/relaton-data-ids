abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The proposed [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] defines DNS records that advertise\nthe
    extent to which a domain employs [RFC4871] to sign [RFC2822]\nmessages, and defines
    how other hosts can access these\nadvertisements.  Its laudable goal is to allow
    domains control over\nthe use of the From header field.  When a message is not
    adequately\nsigned, advertised assertions, referenced by a domain in the From\nheader
    field, assist in resolving the message's intended disposition.\n\nRather than
    dealing with keys that impose a restriction on the \"on-\nbehalf-of\" identity
    as a separate security consideration to be\nhandled independently from an assertion
    that a domain signs their\nmessages, [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] instead employs a flawed
    two-stage\nsignature validation process that works in conjunction with\nadvertised
    practices.  The two-stage approach will most likely occur\nafter message acceptance,
    and impairs the range of authentication\nassertions permitted by a single signature.
    \ The limitations on\nauthentication assertions inhibits tactics needed to deal
    with replay\nabuse.\n\nAs currently structured, advertised practices not only
    assert whether\na signature should be expected, they also constrain the\n\"on-behalf-of\"
    identity applied by signing agents that are not\notherwise so restricted by [RFC4871].
    \ By constraining the \"on-\nbehalf-of\" identity for all signing agents, the
    draft neglects the\npredominate role of the domain as a point of trust, and incorrectly\nassumes
    the signature is limited to supporting assertions regarding\nthe identity of the
    author.  By limiting the DKIM signature's \"on-\nbehalf-of\" value to being representative
    of only the message's\nauthor, the draft goes well beyond the working group's
    charter and\nappears to infringe on S/MIME's and OpenPGP's role.\n\n[I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp]
    impairs security in other ways as well, such as\nthe only directly actionable
    practice is defined using a term likely\nto negatively impact the integrity of
    delivery status.  Fortunately\nminor changes to the definition of a compliant
    signature can remedy\nthe impairment created, where the critical security issues
    are best\nhandled independent of any [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] assertion.\n\t </p>\n
