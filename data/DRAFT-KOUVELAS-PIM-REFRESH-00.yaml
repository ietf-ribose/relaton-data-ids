abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This proposal extends the PIM-DM [1] protocol specification
    by intro-\n   ducing the PIM State-Refresh control message.\n \n   When an (S,G)
    entry is created in a router for a directly connected\n   source, if the interface
    directly connected to the source is the\n   incoming interface for the entry,
    a new timer is started: the State-\n   Refresh-Timer [SRT(S,G)]. The State-Refresh-Timer
    controls periodic\n   transmission of the PIM State-Refresh message, which is
    propagated\n   hop-by-hop down the (S,G) RPF tree. When received by a router on
    the\n   RPF interface, the State-Refresh message causes existing prune state\n
    \  to be refreshed.\n \n   Addition of this heartbeat message solves many of the
    current\n   problems with PIM-DM. It prevents the periodic timeout of prune state\n
    \  in routers, greatly reducing the re-flooding of multicast traffic\n   down
    the pruned branches that expire periodically. It also causes\n   topology changes
    to be realised quicker than the traditional 3 minute\n   timeout.\n\n\t </p>\n
