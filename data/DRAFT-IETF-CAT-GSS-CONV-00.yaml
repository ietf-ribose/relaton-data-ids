abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Traditionally, the GSSAPI specification has not included in its
    scope\nthe acquisition of initial credentials, or mechanisms which have\nrequired
    interaction with the user in the course of the security\ncontext.  This has limited
    the applicability of the GSSAPI\nspecification.\nThis specification allows an
    application program to register a\ncallback function so that a GSSAPI mechanism
    can request conversation\nservices from the application program. The application
    program is\nresponsible for displaying messages to the user and requesting input\nfrom
    the user via the callback function.\nThe goal of this specification is to allow
    certain low-\ninfrastructure-requiring mechanisms to prompt the user for a\nusername,
    password, SecureID response, etc.  It might also be used by\nmechanisms such as
    Kerberos when the GSSAPI library wishes to obtain\ninitial credentials itself,
    instead of assuming that they are already\npresent in the process.\n\t </p>\n
