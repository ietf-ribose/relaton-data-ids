abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Current Information-Centric Networking protocols such as CCNx
    and NDN\n   have a wide range of useful applications in content retrieval and\n
    \  other scenarios that depend only on a robust two-way exchange in the\n   form
    of a request and response (represented by an _Interest-Data\n   exchange_ in the
    case of the two protocols noted above).  A number of\n   important applications
    however, require placing large amounts of data\n   in the Interest message, and/or
    more than one two-way handshake.\n   While these can be accomplished using independent
    Interest-Data\n   exchanges by reversing the roles of consumer and producer, such\n
    \  approaches can be both clumsy for applications and problematic from a\n   state
    management, congestion control, or security standpoint.  This\n   specification
    proposes a _Reflexive Forwarding_ extension to the CCNx\n   and NDN protocol architectures
    that eliminates the problems inherent\n   in using independent Interest-Data exchanges
    for such applications.\n   It updates RFC8569 and RFC8609.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
