abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The objective of this draft is to present a set of requirements
    to\naddress requests by users of authorized emergency communications for\nbetter
    than best effort service for elastic service.  We stress the\nword 'request' versus
    guarantee, and we do NOT advocate broad\nsweeping changes to elastic applications.
    \ This document provides\nbackground information on emergency communications and
    presents\nsuggested do's and don'ts in addressing the issue of requirements\nfor
    elastic services.  Finally, examples of requirements for specific\napplications
    are presented.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
