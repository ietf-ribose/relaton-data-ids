abstract:
- content: "<p>The data model defined in RFC 8345 introduces vertical layering relationships
    between networks that can be augmented to cover network and service topologies.
    This document defines a YANG module for both network performance monitoring (PM)
    and VPN service performance monitoring that can be used to monitor and manage
    network performance on the topology at higher layer or the service topology between
    VPN sites. The YANG model defined in this document is designed as an augmentation
    to the network topology YANG model defined in RFC 8345 and draws on relevant YANG
    types defined in RFC 6991, RFC 8345, and RFC 8532.</p>"
