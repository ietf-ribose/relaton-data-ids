abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a protocol, BMP, that can be used to monitor
    BGP sessions. BMP is intended to provide a convenient interface for obtaining
    route views. Prior to introduction of BMP, screen-scraping was the most commonly-used
    approach to obtaining such views. The design goals are to keep BMP simple, useful,
    easily implemented, and minimally service-affecting. BMP is not suitable for use
    as a routing protocol.</p>"
