abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft defines a method (serve-stale) for recursive resolvers
    to\n   use stale DNS data to avoid outages when authoritative nameservers\n   cannot
    be reached to refresh expired data.  One of the motivations\n   for serve-stale
    is to make the DNS more resilient to DoS attacks, and\n   thereby make them less
    attractive as an attack vector.  This document\n   updates the definitions of
    TTL from RFC 1034 and RFC 1035 so that\n   data can be kept in the cache beyond
    the TTL expiry, updates RFC 2181\n   by interpreting values with the high order
    bit set as being positive,\n   rather than 0, and suggests a cap of 7 days.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
