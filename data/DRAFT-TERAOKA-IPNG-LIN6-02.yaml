abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>LIN6 is a protocol supporting mobility and multi-homing in IPv6.
    \ LIN6\nintroduces the node id, not the interface id, for each node.  Each node\ncan
    be identified by its node id no matter where the node is connected\nand no matter
    how many interfaces the node has.  In the IPv6 layer,\n64-bit node id called LIN6
    ID is used while 128-bit node-id called LIN6\ngeneralized ID is used above the
    Transport layer.  TCP connections and\nsecurity associations can be preserved
    even if the node moves to another\nsubnet or the node changes the using interface
    in a multi-homing\nenvironment without modifying TCP or IPsec.  In comparison
    with Mobile\nIPv6, LIN6 has several advantages in terms of header overhead and
    fault\ntolerance.\n\t </p>\n      "
