abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The delegation of certain strings as generic Top Level Domains\n
    \  (gTLDs) may cause stability and security issues if such strings have\n   been
    used in private environments prior to their delegation.  Test\n   delegations
    can be used to enable empirical research on the extent of\n   the potential for
    name collision.  This document describes one such\n   approach to an empirical
    testing framework for name collision, and\n   considers the applicability of this
    approach to detect other forms of\n   name collision.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
