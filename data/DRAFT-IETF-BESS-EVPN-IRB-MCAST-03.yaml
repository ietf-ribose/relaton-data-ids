abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides a service that allows a single
    Local\n   Area Network (LAN), comprising a single IP subnet, to be divided into\n
    \  multiple \"segments\".  Each segment may be located at a different\n   site,
    and the segments are interconnected by an IP or MPLS backbone.\n   Intra-subnet
    traffic (either unicast or multicast) always appears to\n   the endusers to be
    bridged, even when it is actually carried over the\n   IP or MPLS backbone.  When
    a single \"tenant\" owns multiple such LANs,\n   EVPN also allows IP unicast traffic
    to be routed between those LANs.\n   This document specifies new procedures that
    allow inter-subnet IP\n   multicast traffic to be routed among the LANs of a given
    tenant,\n   while still making intra-subnet IP multicast traffic appear to be\n
    \  bridged.  These procedures can provide optimal routing of the inter-\n   subnet
    multicast traffic, and do not require any such traffic to\n   leave a given router
    and then reenter that same router.  These\n   procedures also accommodate IP multicast
    traffic that needs to travel\n   to or from systems that are outside the EVPN
    domain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
