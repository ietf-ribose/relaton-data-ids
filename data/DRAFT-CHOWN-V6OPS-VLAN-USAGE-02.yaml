abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Ethernet VLANs are quite commonly used in enterprise networks
    for the\n   purposes of traffic segregation.  This document describes how such\n
    \  VLANs can be readily used to deploy IPv6 networking in an enterprise,\n   including
    the scenario of early deployment prior to availability of\n   IPv6-capable switch-router
    equipment, where IPv6 may be routed in\n   parallel with the existing IPv4 in
    the enterprise and delivered at\n   Layer 2 via VLAN technology.  The IPv6 connectivity
    to the enterprise\n   may or may not enter the site via the same physical link.\n\t
