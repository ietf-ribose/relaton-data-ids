abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   According to RFC7908 [RFC7908], Route leaks refer to case that
    the\n   delivery range of route advertisements is beyond the expected range.\n
    \  For many current security protection solutions, the ISPs (Internet\n   Service
    Providers) are focusing on finding ways to detect the\n   happening of route leaks.
    \ However, the real-time route leak\n   detection if any occurs is important as
    well.  This document extends\n   the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) [RFC7854] to
    provide a routing\n   security scheme suitable for ISPs to detect BGP route leaks
    within\n   their own networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
