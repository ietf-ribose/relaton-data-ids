abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes in detail the WCOR (\"Welcomed\nCorrespondence\",
    or WCor/WC for short) extension to ESMTP.\n\n\"Welcomed Correspondence\" is explained
    in detail in Internet-Draft\ndraft-szego-wcor-overview-00.txt [WCor-Overview].
    This extension is\nbased on the standard SMTP \"Service Extensions\" described
    in RFC 1869\n[RFC1869]. ESMTP extensions themselves are not formally described
    here.\nWelcomed Correspondence capabilities are identified by the X-WCOR (while\nthis
    document is in draft state) and eventually the WCOR keyword (when\nand if accepted
    to standards state) in the ESMTP commands list presented\nby a compliant ESMTP
    server implementation in response to an EHLO\ngreeting.\n\t </p>\n      "
