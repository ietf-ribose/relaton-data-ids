abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is now reaching technological\n
    \  maturity after many years of fundamental research and\n   experimentation.
    \ This document provides a number of deployment\n   considerations in the interest
    of helping the ICN community move\n   forward to the next step of live deployments.
    \ The major deployment\n   configurations for ICN are first described including
    the main overlay\n   and underlay approaches.  Then proposed deployment migration
    paths\n   are outlined to address major practical issues such as network and\n
    \  application migration.  Next, selected ICN trial experiences are\n   summarized.
    \ Finally, protocol areas that require further\n   standardization are identified
    to facilitate future interoperable ICN\n   deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
