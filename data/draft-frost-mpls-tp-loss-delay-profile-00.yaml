abstract:
- content: "<p>Procedures for the measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughput
    in MPLS networks are defined in RFC XXXX. This document describes a profile, i.e.
    a simplified subset, of these procedures that suffices to meet the specific requirements
    of MPLS-based transport networks. This document is a product of a joint Internet
    Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within
    the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support
    the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined
    by the ITU-T. [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC
    and insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published RFC
    has IETF consensus.]</p>"
