abstract:
  content: "<p>Procedures for the measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughputin
    MPLS networks are defined in RFC XXXX. This document describes aprofile, i.e.
    a simplified subset, of these procedures that sufficesto meet the specific requirements
    of MPLS-based transport networks.This document is a product of a joint Internet
    Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunication Union TelecommunicationStandardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS TransportProfile within the IETF MPLS
    and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge(PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalitiesof a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.[RFC
    Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC andinsert the correct
    Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the publishedRFC has IETF consensus.]</p>"
