abstract:
  content: "<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-
    level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.
    This document defines HTTP/1.1 conditional requests, including metadata header
    fields for indicating state changes, request header fields for making preconditions
    on such state, and rules for constructing the responses to a conditional request
    when one or more preconditions evaluate to false. This document obsoletes RFC
    7232.</p>"
