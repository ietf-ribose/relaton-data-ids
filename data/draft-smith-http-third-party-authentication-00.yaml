abstract:
- content: "<p>Existing HTTP authentication schemes require knowledge of the secret
    used to establish the client's identity be known in some manner by the site requiring
    the authentication. Some situations exist in which a site has a legitimate reason
    to authenticate a client but cannot be trusted with the information required to
    authenticate that client. The authentication scheme defined in this document allows
    a site to authenticate a client via a trusted third-party.</p>"
