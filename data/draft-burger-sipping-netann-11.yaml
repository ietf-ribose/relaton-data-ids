abstract:
- content: "<p>In SIP-based networks, there is a need to provide basic network media
    services. Such services include network announcements, user interaction, and conferencing
    services. These services are basic building blocks, from which one can construct
    interesting applications. In order to have interoperability between servers offering
    these building blocks (also known as Media Servers) and application developers,
    one needs to be able to locate and invoke such services in a well defined manner.
    This document describes a mechanism for providing an interoperable interface between
    Application Servers, which provide application services to SIP-based networks,
    and Media Servers, which provide the basic media processing building blocks. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
