abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>[RFC5220] describes the possible problems which an end host may\nexperience,
    if the end host has multiple prefixes in a single\nphysical link. This document
    proposes a solution of so-called \"try\nand error\" type about these problems
    originated in \"Source Address\nSelection\" which is described in [RFC5220]. A
    new mechanism to\nsettle almost all of these problems is described in this document,\nbut
    actually it is not effective in some particular cases. Thus it is\nnecessary for
    every end user/host to be able to select on/off of this\nmechanism.\n\t </p>\n
