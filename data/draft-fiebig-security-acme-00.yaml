abstract:
- content: "<p>Most Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX) certificates are issued
    via the ACME protocol. Recently, several attacks against domain validation (DV)
    have been published, including IP-use-after-free and (forced) on-path attacks.
    These attacks can often be mitigated by (selectively) requiring additional challenges,
    such as DNS validation, proof of ownership of a prior certificate, and by being
    more diligent in operating a certificate authority. This document provides a list
    of currently known attacks and describes mitigations and operational procedures
    to prevent issuing a certificate to an unauthorized party.</p>"
