abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Instead of forwarding to a specific device or to all devices
    in a\n   group, anycast addresses, let network devices forward a packet to (or\n
    \  steer it through) one or more topologically nearest devices in a\n   specific
    group of network devices.  [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing]\n   extended the
    use of anycast addresses to a SPRING network, wherein a\n   group of SPRING-capable
    devices can represent a anycast address, by\n   having the same SRGB label block
    provisioned on all the devices and\n   each one of them advertising the same anycast
    prefix segment (or\n   Anycast SID).\n\n   This document describes a proposal
    for implementing anycast prefix\n   segments in SPRING, without the need to have
    the same SRGB block\n   (label ranges) provisioned across all the member devices
    in the\n   group.  Each node can be provisioned with a separate SRGB from the\n
    \  label range supported by the specfic hardware platform.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
