abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a solution for Site Multihoming of stub\n
    \  networks in a real IP environment. Each user interface in a customer\n   network
    will have as many global unicast addresses as many service\n   providers as it
    is connected with. Users can establish multiple\n   connections through different
    service providers simultaneously. A\n   customer network can maintain private
    address space to communicate\n   within its users and can share its load while
    maintaining VPN\n   services. Customer networks can provide IP mobility services
    as well.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
