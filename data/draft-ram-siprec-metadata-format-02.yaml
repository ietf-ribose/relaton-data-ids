abstract:
- content: "<p>Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
    environments such as call centers and financial trading. In some of these environments,
    all calls must be recorded for regulatory, compliance and consumer protection
    reasons. Recording of a session is typically performed by sending a copy of a
    media stream to a recording device. This document focuses on the Recording metadata
    format which describes the communication session.</p>"
