abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The  SPIRITS  physical  architecture  and  the  relevant   background\nexplanation
    \ of  the  mechanism for interactions between the PSTN and\nSPIRITS are provided
    in [1].  This document is attempted  to  take  a\nnext  step  and  to  describe
    all the SPIRITS interfaces necessary to\nsupport the following services defined
    in the  WG  charter:  Internet\nCall  Waiting  (the  leading  SPIRITS  benchmark
    \ service),  Internet\nCaller-ID Delivery, and  Internet  Call  Forwarding.  The
    \ end-to-end\nimplementation  of  charter  services  will  require cooperation
    with\nITU-T on the total protocol development.   To  this  end  this  draft\nraises
    \ the  discussion  of  the  'ownership' of protocols per SPIRIT\ninterface.\n\t
