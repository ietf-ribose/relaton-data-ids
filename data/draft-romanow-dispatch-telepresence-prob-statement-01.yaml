abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Telepresence systems create a \"being there\" conferencing experience.A
    number of issues need to be solved largely by manipulating multipleaudio and video
    streams. Different systems take differentapproaches, employ different techniques,
    and convey information byusing different vocabularies, making interoperability
    extremelychallenging. This problem statement describes the typical issuesthat
    must be solved and uses examples to illustrate the kind ofdiversity that makes
    interworking problematic.</p>"
