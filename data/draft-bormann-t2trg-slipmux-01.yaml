abstract:
  content: <p>Many research and maker platforms for Internet of Things experimentation
    offer a serial interface. This is often used for programming, diagnostic output,
    as well as a crude command interface ("AT interface"). Alternatively, it is often
    used with SLIP (RFC1055) to transfer IP packets only. The present report describes
    how to use a single serial interface for diagnostics, configuration commands and
    state readback, as well as packet transfer.</p>
