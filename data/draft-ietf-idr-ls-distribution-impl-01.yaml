    Distribution protocol as defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution]. The editors
    did not verify the accuracy of the information provided by respondents. The respondents
    are experts with the implementations they reported on, and their responses are
    considered authoritative for the implementations for which their responses represent.
    Respondents were asked to only use the YES answer if the feature had at least
    been tested in the lab.</p>"
