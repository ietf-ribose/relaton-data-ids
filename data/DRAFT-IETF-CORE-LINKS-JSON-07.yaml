abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   JavaScript Object Notation, JSON (RFC7159) is a text-based
    data\n   format which is popular for Web based data exchange.  Concise Binary\n
    \  Object Representation, CBOR (RFC7049) is a binary data format which\n   has
    been optimized for data exchange for the Internet of Things\n   (IoT).  For many
    IoT scenarios, CBOR formats will be preferred since\n   it can help decrease transmission
    payload sizes as well as\n   implementation code sizes compared to other data
    formats.\n\n   Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way to represent links between
    Web\n   resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes\n
    \  of such a link.  In constrained networks, a collection of Web links\n   can
    be exchanged in the CoRE link format (RFC6690).  Outside of\n   constrained environments,
    it may be useful to represent these\n   collections of Web links in JSON, and
    similarly, inside constrained\n   environments, in CBOR.  This specification defines
    a common format\n   for this.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
