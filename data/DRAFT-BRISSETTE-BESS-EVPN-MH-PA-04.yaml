abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) technology
    enables\n   the establishment of a logical link-aggregation connection with a\n
    \  redundant group of independent nodes. The purpose of multi-chassis\n   LAG
    is to provide a solution to achieve higher network availability,\n   while providing
    different modes of sharing/balancing of traffic. EVPN\n   standard defines EVPN
    based MC-LAG with single-active and all-active\n   multi-homing load-balancing
    mode. The current draft expands on\n   existing redundancy mechanisms supported
    by EVPN and introduces\n   support of port-active load-balancing mode. In the
    current document,\n   port-active load-balancing mode is also referred to as per
    interface\n   active/standby.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
