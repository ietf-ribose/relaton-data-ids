abstract:
  content: "\t <t>As the complexity of distributed applications increases, anincreasing
    amount of processing is done using distributed processes,which typically execute
    without the direct supervision of an enduser. The user must poll these processes
    periodically to check ifthey are completed successfully or not. This polling results
    inunnecessary wastage of network bandwidth as well as computingresources. The
    user generally cannot see intermediate results orprogress reports for long running
    processes, they must wait till theprocess is completely finished before viewing
    the results.Thus the problem of monitoring events is central in distributedapplications
    and protocols. A repeated need in such applications isreceive notifications when
    a resource property value changes orevent state changes. Current database systems
    provides mechanismslike constraints, triggers and active database rules. Thesefacilities
    provides an automated means to ensure the databaseintegrity or perform specific
    action when data changes. Need forsuch kind of requirement is fundamental is network
    applications</p>"
