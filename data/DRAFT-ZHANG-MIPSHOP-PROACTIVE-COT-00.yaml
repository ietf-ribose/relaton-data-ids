abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a practical scheme to run the care-of
    address\n   test (part of the Return Routability test for Mobile IPv6 route\n
    \  optimization) in a proactive way in the context of the Fast Handovers\n   for
    Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) protocol, so that the latency caused by the\n   care-of address
    test after movements can be removed or reduced.\n   Proactive care-of address
    test can make the Return Rroutability\n   protocol more suitable for delay sensitive
    applications especially\n   when it is applied in conjunction with other Return
    Routability\n   optimization schemes.\n\t </p>\n      "
