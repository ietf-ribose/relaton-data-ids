abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an idea for a special DNS query whose
    use is\n   to get the IPv6 address representing an IPv4 address in a 464xlat\n
    \  environment.\n\n   The query can also be used to force the IPv4 client to connect
    to the\n   server via IPv6 by returning the \"real\" IPv6 address of a dual-stack\n
    \  server instead of the IPv6 address used to connect to the server's\n   IPv4
    address using NAT64.\n\n   The query is supposed to be compatible to the existing
    DNS system so\n   no changes to the DNS protocol or DNS servers need to be done.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
