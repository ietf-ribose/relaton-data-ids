- content: "<p>We propose a general service centric homenet architecture, which can
    handle the diversity of devices, services, applications and context. Especially,
    we focus on building an overall home network topology, routing and naming structures,
    to fit SCN into a home network. In the future, we will discuss homenet caching,
    mobility and security in details.</p>"
