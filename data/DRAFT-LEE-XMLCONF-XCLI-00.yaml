abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Currently, there is an ongoing activity in the IETF to define
    a\nstandard, XML-based protocol to manage the configuration of networks\nand networking
    equipments. Defining initial requirements are underway\nand one important requirement
    among them is co-existence with the\nCLI. This document suggests a possible mechanism
    for this\nrequirement.  It identifies some characteristics of CLI commands, and\nprovides
    the syntax of XML template which models such characteristics\nof CLI commands.
    X-CLI is an API to manipulate XML templates in an\neasy and robust way.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
