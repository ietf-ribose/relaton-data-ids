abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes PAX Pattern Description Language (PDL).
    PAX is a\nspecial purpose language for definitions of filters (recognizers) for\nsequential
    inputs. The language is suitable for describing pattern\nmatching criteria in
    policy-based networking devices such as QoS routers\nand switches, packet filters,
    RMON probes, traffic shapers, etc. It pro-\nvides consistent means of programming
    policy-based networking devices\nbased on different hardware and software platforms.
    \ Programs written in\nPAX can be built incrementally, where elementary patterns
    can be used as\nbuilding blocks for more complex ones. The language encourages
    modular\nand object-oriented design.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
