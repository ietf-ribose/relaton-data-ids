abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the SIP P-Private-Network-Indication P-header.
    The use of this private network indication extension is only applicable inside
    an administrative domain with previously agreed-upon policies for generation,
    transport and usage of such information. A private network indication allows nodes
    in such a domain to treat private network traffic according to a different set
    of rules than the set applicable to public network traffic. The indication also
    distinguishes traffic from one private network from another private network.</p>"
