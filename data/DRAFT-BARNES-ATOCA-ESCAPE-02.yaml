abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recipients of emergency alerts need to be able to verify that
    an\n   alert they receive was issued by an authorized source.  The Common\n   Alerting
    Protocol (CAP) provides a standard way of encoding alert\n   information.  This
    document describes a security wrapper for Common\n   Alerting Protocol objects
    to allow alerts to be signed by alert\n   originators.\n\n   Please send feedback
    to the atoca@ietf.org mailing list.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
