abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document introduces a new client type (COPS-ODRA) for the
    COPS\n\nprotocol to support dynamic DiffServ admission control. The Policy\n\nDecision
    Point (PDP) acts as a 'Bandwidth Broker' for the Policy\n\nEnforcement Point (PEP)
    which is requesting resources. The use of the\n\ndefined mechanism is suited for
    (but it is not limited to) the\n\nIntegrated Services operation over Diffserv
    networks.\n\nThis document represents the updated version of draft-salsano-issll-\n\ncops-odra-00.txt
    and is issued only for reference. Another new client\n\ntype called COPS-DRA (Diffserv
    Resource Allocation) includes all the\n\nfunctionality of COPS-ODRA adding the
    support of combined Outsourcing\n\nand Provisioning model.\n\t </p>\n      "
