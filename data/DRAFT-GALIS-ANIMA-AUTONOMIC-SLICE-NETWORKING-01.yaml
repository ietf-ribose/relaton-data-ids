abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the technical requirements and the
    related\n   reference model for the intercommunication and coordination among\n
    \  devices in Autonomic Slicing Networking.  The goal is to define how\n   the
    various elements in a network slicing context work and\n   orchestrate together,
    to describe their interfaces and relations.\n   While the document is written
    as generally as possible, the initial\n   solutions are limited to the chartered
    scope of the WG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
