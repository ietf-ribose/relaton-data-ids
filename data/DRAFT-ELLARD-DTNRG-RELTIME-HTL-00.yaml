abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft presents two extensions to the DTN bundle protocol.
    \ The\nfirst extension is the use of relative time rather than absolute time\nto
    address situations where the DTN nodes cannot achieve loosely\nsynchronized clocks,
    as required by the current DTN bundle protocol.\nThe second extension is the addition
    of a \"hops-to-live\" field to the\nbundle header, which specifies how many node-to-node
    hops each\ninstance of a bundle is permitted to make before it expires.\n\nThese
    two extensions are separable; either may be used independently\nof the other.
    \ Used together, however, they provide a powerful way to\nconstrain resources
    consumed by the handling of a DTN bundle despite\nthe absence of synchronized
    clocks or the presence of incomplete\nknowledge of the network topology (which
    may lead to the presence of\nhazards such as routing loops).\n\t </p>\n      "
