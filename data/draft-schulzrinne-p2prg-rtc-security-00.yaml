abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks offer higher robustness against failure,easier
    configuration and are generally more economical than theirclient-server counterparts.
    It has therefore become reasonable forresource consuming and typically centralized
    applications like Voiceover IP (VoIP) and, in general, realtime communication
    to adapt andexploit the benefits of P2P. Such a migration needs to address a newset
    of P2P specific security problems. This document describes someof the known issues
    found in common P2P networks, analyzing therelevance of such issues and the applicability
    of existing solutionswhen using P2P architectures for realtime communication.</p>"
