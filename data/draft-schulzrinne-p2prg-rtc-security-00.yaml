abstract:
- content: "<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks offer higher robustness against failure,
    easier configuration and are generally more economical than their client-server
    counterparts. It has therefore become reasonable for resource consuming and typically
    centralized applications like Voice over IP (VoIP) and, in general, realtime communication
    to adapt and exploit the benefits of P2P. Such a migration needs to address a
    new set of P2P specific security problems. This document describes some of the
    known issues found in common P2P networks, analyzing the relevance of such issues
    and the applicability of existing solutions when using P2P architectures for realtime
    communication.</p>"
