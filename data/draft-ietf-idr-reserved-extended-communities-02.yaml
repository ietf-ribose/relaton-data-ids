abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two IANA registries in order to assign transitive
    and non-transitive extended communities from. These are similar to the existing
    well-known BGP communities defined in RFC 1997 but provide an easier control of
    inter-AS community advertisement as a community could be chosen as transitive
    or non- transitive across ASes. For that purpose, this document defines the use
    of the reserved AS number 0 for the transitive and non-transitive generic four-octet
    AS specific extended community types.</p>"
