abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Interworking between regions with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS has been\nconsidered
    in G.709.  Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing would\nbe desirable to facilitate
    the introduction of new ODU0 and ODUflex\nsignals to an existing network without
    having to upgrade every node\nin the network.  So ODU0/ODUflex can be mapped into
    ODU1/ODU2/ODU3\nand transit across the 2.5G TS region.\n\nMulti stages multiplexing/demultiplexing
    are also used to support the\nmulti-domain OTN applications based on the tunnel
    design.  If there\nare a large number of circuits that share the same endpoints
    (or even\npart of an overall path), it may be convenient from a management\nperspective
    to first multiplex those ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex into ODU2\nor ODU3 to minimize
    the number of connections that need to be made in\nintermediate nodes.  The ODU2/ODU3
    effectively creates a tunnel\nthrough the ODU4 network that the ODU0, ODU1 and
    ODUflex can use.\n\nThis document describes the requirement of multi stages multiplexing\nconfiguration
    assocaited with some specific scenarios in G.709\nOptical Transport Network.\n\t
