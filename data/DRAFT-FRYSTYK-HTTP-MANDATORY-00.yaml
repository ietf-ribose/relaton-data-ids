abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       HTTP is used increasingly in applications that need more
    facilities\n       than the standard version of the protocol provides, ranging
    from\n       distributed authoring, collaboration, and printing, to various remote\n
    \      procedure call mechanisms. This document proposes the use of a\n       mandatory
    extension mechanism designed to address the tension between\n       private agreement
    and public specification and to accommodate\n       extension of applications
    such as HTTP clients, servers, and proxies.\n       The proposal associates each
    extension with a URI[2], and use a few\n       new RFC 822[1] style header fields
    to carry the extension identifier\n       and related information between the
    parties involved in an extended\n       transaction.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
