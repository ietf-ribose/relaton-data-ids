abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>L2TP is a connection-oriented protocol that has shared state between
    \nactive endpoints. Some of this shared state is vital for operation but \nmay
    be rather volatile in nature, such as packet sequence numbers used \non the L2TP
    Control Connection. When failure of one side of a control\nconnection occurs,
    a new control connection is created and associated \nwith the old connection by
    exchanging information about the old \nconnection. Such a mechanism is not intended
    as a replacement for an \nactive fail over with some mirrored connection states,
    but as an aid \njust for those parameters that are particularly difficult to have
    \nimmediately available. Protocol extensions to L2TP defined in this \ndocument
    are intended to facilitate state recovery, providing \nadditional resiliency in
    an L2TP network and improving a remote \nsystem's layer 2 connectivity.\n\t </p>\n
