abstract:
- content: "<p>IP is designed for use in Best Effort Networks, which are networks
    that provide no guarantee that data is delivered, or that delivery meets any specified
    quality of service parameters. However there are new applications requiring IP
    to provide deterministic services in terms of bandwidth and latency, such as network
    based AR/VR (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality), industrial internet. This
    document proposes a solution in IPv6 that can be used by transport layer protocols
    to guarantee certain level of service quality. This new service is fined-grained
    and could apply to individual or aggregated TCP/UDP flow(s).</p>"
