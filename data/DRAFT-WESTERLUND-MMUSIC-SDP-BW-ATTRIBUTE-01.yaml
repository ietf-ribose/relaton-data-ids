abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Knowledge of what bandwidths the end-points intend to use is\n
    \  important both for the other end-point and for resource allocation in\n   various
    types of networks.  This is especially important for wireless\n   access networks
    which typically have quite limited resources.  The\n   bandwidth attribute in
    Session Description Protocol (SDP), 'b=AS', is\n   today quite widely used to
    define the bandwidth that the end-points\n   intends to use, in various types
    of sessions.  This document will\n   show that the existing bandwidth attribute,
    such as 'b=AS', although\n   widely used in todays scenarios, has limitations
    that make it hard or\n   even impossible for the end-points to express their intentions\n
    \  accurately when it comes to bandwidth usage.  To solve the identified\n   problems,
    this document defines a new extensible SDP bandwidth\n   attribute 'a=bw' which
    enables more detailed control over the\n   bandwidth declarations, request, and
    allocations.  With the new\n   bandwidth attribute it is possible to define different
    scopes in the\n   session setup and then negotiate the bandwidth individually
    for each\n   scope.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
