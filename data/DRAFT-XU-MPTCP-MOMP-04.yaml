abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies a message-oriented extension for Multipath
    TCP\n   (MPTCP) which aims to serve high-bandwidth and real-time\n   applications.
    By introducing a message mapping to MPTCP, Message-\n   Oriented MPTCP (MO-MPTCP)
    attaches some message features like\n   boundaries, priority and dependency to
    bytestream. With such\n   message-oriented information, MPTCP senders can avoid
    the waste of\n   transmission resources and improve the transmission efficiency.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
