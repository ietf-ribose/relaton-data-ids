abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes managed objects for extending the Entity MIB (RFC 2737) to provide
    generalized access to information related to physical sensors, which are often
    found in networking equipment (such as chassis temperature, fan RPM, power supply
    voltage). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
