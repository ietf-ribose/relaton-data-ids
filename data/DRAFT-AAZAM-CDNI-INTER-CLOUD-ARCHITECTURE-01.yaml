abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Rapidly increasing digital media has triggered the importance\n
    \  of cloud computing. Cloud    computing provides ease of management\n   and
    ubiquitous access facility to the growing digital content.\n   The ratio with
    which digital content has been increasing, it now\n   requires multiple clouds
    to interoperate for the purpose of\n   scalability, efficient service provisioning,
    and better management.\n   This scenario is known as inter-cloud computing or
    cloud federation.\n   On the other hand, increase in multimedia content requires
    much\n   better service provisioning, responsiveness, and efficient\n   transcoding.\n
    \  Thoroughly designing the architecture of Media Cloud Inter-Cloud\n   Computing
    is today's requirement.\n   This document focuses on this important issue and
    presents\n   architectural fundamentals and key concerns in\n   Media Inter-Cloud
    Computing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
