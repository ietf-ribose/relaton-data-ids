abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Port Control Protocol (PCP) allows clients to request explicit\n
    \  dynamic inbound and outbound port mappings in their their closest on-\n   path
    NAT, Firewall, or other middlebox.  However, in today's world,\n   there may be
    more than one NAT on the path between a client and the\n   public Internet.  This
    document describes how the closest on-path\n   middlebox generates a corresponding
    upstream PCP request to the next\n   closest on-path middlebox, to request an
    appropriate explicit dynamic\n   port mapping in that middlebox too.  Applied
    recursively, this\n   generates the necessary chain of port mappings in any number
    of\n   middleboxes on the path between the client and the public Internet.\n\n\t
