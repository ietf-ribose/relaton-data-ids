abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA), administering\n
    \  the .CA country-code top-level domain, offers internationalized\n   domain
    names (IDN) in French, one of Canada's official languages.\n   CIRA's Extensible
    Provisioning Protocol (EPP) services have been\n   augmented with an IDN EPP extension
    in order to support registrars\n   desiring to register internationalized domains
    using French\n   characters as bundled domains.\n\n   This document defines the
    extension to the Extensible Provisioning\n   Protocol used at CIRA to support
    IDN operations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
