abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which assign
    them to their downstream-attached links and networks. This document considers
    prefix delegation models according to whether the requesting router acts as a
    router on behalf of any downstream networks, as a host on behalf of its local
    applications or as both.</p>"
