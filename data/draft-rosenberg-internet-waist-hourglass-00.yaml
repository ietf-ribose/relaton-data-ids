abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the fundamental design principles of the Internet is that IP
    represents a common intermediate protocol layer, linking together a variety of
    link layer technologies underneath with a large number of applications on top.
    When drawn graphically, this can be show as an hourglass with IP in the middle.
    The preponderence of NATs and firewalls in the Internet has changed this reality,
    such that UDP and TCP are now the waist of the hourglass. This document discusses
    this change and describes its implications for protocol and application design.</p>"
