abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents the motivation, design guidelines and high\nlevel
    descriptions of peer-to-peer session initiation protocol\n(P2PSIP) client protocol,
    which is spoken between P2PSIP peers and\nP2PSIP clients.  In this document, the
    necessity of P2PSIP Client is\nidentified firstly.  Then, two fundamental guidelines
    for our design\nare explained in details.  Following these guidelines, the design
    of\nproposed protocol and new extensions to existing SIP (session\ninitiation
    protocol) are described.  Such a SIP-based protocol not\nonly makes itself backward-compatible
    with the vast existing SIP\ndevices, but also provides extra functions to satisfy
    some particular\nrequirements raised by P2PSIP.\n\t </p>\n      "
