abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a special elliptic curve with complex multiplication
    (by i) and a compact description (see title). This curve is recommended for cryptographic
    use in a strongest-link combination with dissimilar elliptic curves (e.g. NIST
    P-256, Curve25519, extension-field curves, etc.) as a defense in depth against
    an unlikely, unforeseen attack on otherwise preferred elliptic curves. The curve
    equation 2y^2=x^3+x is the Montgomery form of a curve y^2=x^3-x in a class of
    curves y^2=x^3-ax suggested by Miller in the first published paper elliptic curve
    cryptography, and an endomorphism usable for efficiency, an idea of Koblitz. The
    field size 8^91+5 is prime, and is relatively efficient and compactly described
    for its bit-size (273 bits). The document specifies some practical details such
    as: encoding a point (on the curve) into 34 bytes, public key validation, encoding
    a private key into 34 bytes, and encoding 34 bytes into a point. The document
    also provides pseudocode, motivation, and security considerations.</p>"
