abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides benchmarking terminology and methodology for
    next-generation network security devices including next-generation firewalls (NGFW),
    next-generation intrusion prevention systems (NGIPS), and unified threat management
    (UTM) implementations. The main areas covered in this document are test terminology,
    test configuration parameters, and benchmarking methodology for NGFW and NGIPS.
    This document aims to improve the applicability, reproducibility, and transparency
    of benchmarks and to align the test methodology with today's increasingly complex
    layer 7 security centric network application use cases. As a result, this document
    makes [RFC3511] obsolete.</p>"
