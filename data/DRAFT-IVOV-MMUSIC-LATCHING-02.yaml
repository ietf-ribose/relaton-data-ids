abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes behavior of signalling intermediaries
    in RTC\n   deployments, sometimes referred to as Session Border Controllers\n
    \  (SBCs), when performing Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT).  HNT is a set of\n   mechanisms,
    such as media relaying and latching, that such\n   intermediaries use to enable
    other RTC devices behind NATs to\n   communicate with each other.  This document
    is non-normative, and is\n   only written to explain HNT in order to provide a
    reference to the\n   IETF community, as well as an informative description to\n
    \  manufacturers, and users.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
