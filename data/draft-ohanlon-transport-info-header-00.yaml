abstract:
- content: "<p>The Transport-Info header provides a mechanism to inform a client of
    the last-mile server's view of the network transport related information such
    as current delivery rate and round-trip time. This information has a wide range
    of uses such as client monitoring and diagnostics, or allowing a client to adapt
    to current network conditions. Note to Readers _RFC Editor: please remove this
    section before publication_ Source code and issues for this draft can be found
