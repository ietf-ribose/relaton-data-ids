abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents how the Flow Label can be used inside
    a LLN\n   domain such as a RPL domain or an ISA100.11a D-subnet, and provides\n
    \  updated rules for a domain Border Router to set and reset the Flow\n   Label
    when forwarding between inside the domain and the larger\n   Internet in both
    direction.  Rules for routers inside the domain are\n   also provided.\n\n\t </p>\n
