abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The goal of this document is to serve as input to the design of
    the\nSource Address Validation architecture being defined in the SAVI WG.\nIn
    particular, it analyses the different ways to handle data packets\nfor which no
    binding exists, and the impact of the different\napproaches in the overall performance
    of the network.\n\t </p>\n      "
