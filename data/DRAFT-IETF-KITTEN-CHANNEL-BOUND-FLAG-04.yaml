abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Channel binding is a technique that allows applications to
    use a\n   secure channel at a lower layer without having to use authentication\n
    \  at that lower layer.  The concept of channel binding comes from the\n   Generic
    Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-\n   API).  It turns
    out that the semantics commonly implemented are\n   different than those specified
    in the base GSS-API RFC (RFC2743), and\n   that that specification has a serious
    bug.  This document addresses\n   both the inconsistency as-implemented and the
    specification bug.\n\n   This Internet-Draft proposes the addition of a \"channel
    bound\" return\n   flag for the GSS_Init_sec_context() and GSS_Accept_sec_context()\n
    \  functions.  Two behaviors are specified: a default, safe behavior\n   reflecting
    existing implementation deployments, and a behavior that\n   is only safe when
    the application specifically tells the GSS-API that\n   it (the application) supports
    the new behavior.  Additional API\n   elements related to this are also added,
    including a new security\n   context establishment API.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
