abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Normal TCP/IP operation is for the routing system to select a bestpath
    that remains stable for some time, and for TCP to adjust to theproperties of this
    path to optimize throughput. A multipath TCPwould be able to either use capacity
    on multiple paths, ordynamically find the best performing path, and therefore
    reach higherthroughput. By adapting to the properties of several paths throughthe
    usual congestion control algorithms, a multipath TCP shifts itstraffic to less
    congested paths, leaving more capacity available fortraffic that can't move to
    another path on more congested paths. Andwhen a path fails, this can be detected
    and worked around by TCP muchmore quickly than by waiting for the routing system
    to repair thefailure.This memo specifies a multipath TCP that is implemented on
    thesending host only, without requiring modifications on the receivinghost.</p>"
