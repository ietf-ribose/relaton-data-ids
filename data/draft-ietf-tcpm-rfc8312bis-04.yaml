abstract:
  content: "<p>CUBIC is a standard TCP congestion control algorithm that uses a cubic
    function instead of the linear window increase function on the sender side to
    improve scalability and stability over fast and long- distance networks. CUBIC
    has been adopted as the default TCP congestion control algorithm by the Linux,
    Windows, and Apple stacks. This document updates the specification of CUBIC to
    include algorithmic improvements based on these implementations and recent academic
    work. Based on the extensive deployment experience with CUBIC, it also moves the
    specification to the Standards Track, obsoleting RFC 8312.</p>"
