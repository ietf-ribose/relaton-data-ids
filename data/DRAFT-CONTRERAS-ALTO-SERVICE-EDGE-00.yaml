abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service providers are starting to deploy and interconnect computing\n
    \  capabilities across the network for hosting network functions and\n   applications.
    \ In distributed computing environments, both computing\n   and topological information
    are necessary in order to determine the\n   more convenient infrastructure where
    to deploy such a service or\n   application.  This document raises an initial
    approach towards the\n   use of ALTO to provide such information and assist in
    the selection\n   of proper execution environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
