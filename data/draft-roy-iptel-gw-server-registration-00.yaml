abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This contribution describes a registration protocol that can be
    usedbetween gateways (GWs) and severs as well as among servers in intra-ITAD communications
    environment. The registration protocol is usedby a GW just to inform its transport
    address and reachable aliasaddresses including telephone numbers through it along
    with otherinformation (e.g., capacity, cost, traffic, usage, QoS, GoS) to theServer
    and does not deal with any routes or path attributes.The registration protocol
    is also used to negotiate capabilitiesbetween the peers.</p>"
