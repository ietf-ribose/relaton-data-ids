abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks like financial information network (stock/ commodity
    trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications, Latency (delay), Latency-Variation
    (jitter) and Packet loss is becoming a key requirement for path computation along
    with other constraints and metrics. Latency, Latency-Variation and Packet Loss
    is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and service
    providers. [MPLS-DELAY-FWK] describes MPLS architecture to allow latency, loss
    and jittering as properties. [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS] describes
    mechanisms with which network performance information is distributed via OSPF
    and ISIS respectivily. This document describes the extension to PCEP to carry
    Latency, Latency-Variation and Loss as constraints for end to end path computation.</p>"
