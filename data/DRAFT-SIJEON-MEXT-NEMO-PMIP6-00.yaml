abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network mobility (NEMO) enables all the nodes within a mobile
    network\n   to provide session continuity without requiring their involvement\n
    \  when the mobile network moves. To provide NEMO support, the NEMO\n   basic
    support protocol (NEMO-BSP) is specified in [RFC 3963].\n\n   With the advances
    of the network-based mobility management protocol\n   referred to as Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 (PMIPv6), interest in applicable\n   NEMO support in the PMIPv6 domain is
    increasing however, the standard\n   PMIPv6, defined in [RFC 5213], handles only
    a single mobile node.\n\n   This document presents a NEMO-enabled PMIPv6 using
    a Proxy Router\n   (PR) rather than the MR defined in [RFC 3963] and describes
    detailed\n   operations for network/node mobility support in the PMIPv6 domain.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
