abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide numerous benefits:
    reduced\n   delivery cost for cacheable content, improved quality of experience\n
    \  for End Users and increased robustness of delivery.  For these\n   reasons
    they are frequently used for large-scale content delivery.\n   As a result, existing
    CDN Providers are scaling up their\n   infrastructure and many Network Service
    Providers (NSPs) are\n   deploying their own CDNs.  It is generally desirable
    that a given\n   content item can be delivered to an End User regardless of that
    End\n   User's location or attachment network.  This is the motivation for\n   interconnecting
    standalone CDNs so they can interoperate as an open\n   content delivery infrastructure
    for the end-to-end delivery of\n   content from Content Service Providers (CSPs)
    to End Users.  However,\n   no standards or open specifications currently exist
    to facilitate\n   such CDN interconnection.\n\n   The goal of this document is
    to outline the problem area of CDN\n   interconnection for the IETF CDNI (CDN
    Interconnection) working\n   group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
