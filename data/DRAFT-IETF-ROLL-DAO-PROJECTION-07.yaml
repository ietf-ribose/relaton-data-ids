abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a protocol extension to RPL that enables
    to\n   install a limited amount of centrally-computed routes in a RPL graph,\n
    \  enabling loose source routing down a non-storing mode DODAG, or\n   transversal
    routes inside the DODAG.  As opposed to the classical\n   route injection in RPL
    that are injected by the end devices, this\n   draft enables the Root of the DODAG
    to projects the routes that are\n   needed on the nodes where they should be installed.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
