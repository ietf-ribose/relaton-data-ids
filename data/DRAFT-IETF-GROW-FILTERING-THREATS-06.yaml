abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how unexpected traffic flows can emerge\n
    \  across an autonomous system, as the result of other autonomous\n   systems
    filtering, or restricting the propagation of more specific\n   prefixes.  We provide
    a review of the techniques to detect the\n   occurrence of this issue and defend
    against it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
