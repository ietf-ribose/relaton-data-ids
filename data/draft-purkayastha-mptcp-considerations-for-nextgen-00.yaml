abstract:
- content: "<p>MPTCP is deployed in devices which have multiple interfaces to different
    networks. It takes advantage of these multiple interfaces to improve user experience
    by bandwidth aggregation, redundancy, and increased reliability by having a fallback
    option. This document describes scenarios where next generation (5G) mobility
    management frameworks may impact MPTCP operations thus potentially jeopardizing
    achievement of some of these gains.</p>"
