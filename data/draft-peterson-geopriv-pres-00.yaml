abstract:
  content: "<p>Geopriv defines the concept of a 'using protocol', a protocol thatcarries
    geopriv location objects. Geopriv also defines variousscenarios for the distribution
    of location objects that require theconcept of subscriptions and asynchronous
    notifications. Thisdocument examines some existing IETF work on the concept of
    presence,shows how presence architectures map onto geopriv architectures, andpresents
    one pre-existing using presence protocol that might carrylocation objects.</p>"
