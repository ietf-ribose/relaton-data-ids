abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a method to exploit the Cryptographically\n
    \  Generated Address (CGA) features in highly mobile environment. \n   The draft
    introduces a new optimization to the \"Binding Update \n   Backhauling (BUB)\"
    proposal, which eliminates the need for \n   running a return routability (RR)
    procedure at the beginning \n   and improves its security.\n\t </p>\n      "
