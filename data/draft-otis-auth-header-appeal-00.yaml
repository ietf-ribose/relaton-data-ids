abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The proposed [I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header] defines a headerfield
    used to capture email verification results obtained at borderreceptions has been
    approved for publication. However, seriousdeficiencies remain in its secure use
    and has prompted an appeal ofthe publication decision. This new header field is
    to convey to MailUser Agents (MUA) and downstream processes the verification resultsthat
    are intended to augment handling decisions and messageannotations that might be
    made visible to recipients. For such use,it is crucial to include within an \"authenticated-results\"
    header, atruly authenticated identity.The draft acknowledges that it confuses
    authorization withauthentication in section 1.5.2. This confusion has lead the
    draftto incorrectly elevate the authorization of an SMTP client into theauthentication
    of an email-address domain. Elevating the*authorization* of the SMTP client into
    the *authentication* of anemail-address domain incorrectly assumes current email
    practicesadequately restrict the use of an email-address domain based upon theoriginating
    IP address of the SMTP client. In an era of carriergrade NATs, virtual servers,
    aggregated services, and othertechniques that overload the IP address, this assumption
    is neithersafe nor practical.Although the draft explicitly declares Sender-ID
    and SPF as theauthorization of the transmitting SMTP client, it fails to offer
    theauthenticated identity being trusted. A truly authenticated identityis essential
    for reputation assessments which section 4.1 indicatesshould be made prior to
    results being revealed. A reputation checkof a truly authenticated identifier
    is often a necessary step neededto mitigate fraud and abuse. In addition, it is
    unfair to attributefraud or abuse to the unauthenticated identifiers. Even so,
    theheader offers no assurance that any reputation check has been made,nor does
    it ensure that an authenticated identity, the IP address ofthe SMTP client, can
    be determined by the MUA or downstream process.The goal of the appeal is to ensure
    adequate information is availablewhen annotating email.</p>"
