abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A make-before-break handoff is one where resources on a target
    system\nare allocated prior to releasing the resources on a source system.\nMake-before-break
    can be an effective means to provide a more\nseamless handoff with fewer dropped
    packets.  The existing Mobile\nIPv4 specification supports simultaneous bindings,
    which can\nfacilitate a make-before-break handoff.  However, the binding state\nat
    the home agent is only one example of a resource that can be\nallocated; others
    include the link connection to the Foreign Agent\n(or access router) and the provision
    of security associations between\nthe mobile node and the mobility agents.  It
    may be desirable to set\nup these resources on the target system without necessarily
    creating\na binding entry on the Home Agent.  This document provides some\nadditional
    conventions on the use of simultaneous bindings in a make-\nbefore-break handoff
    that can be used to optimize the allocation of\nresources in these scenarios.\n\t
