abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo provides an analysis of the aspects of multi-homing
    support\n   for the IPv6 protocol suite. The purpose of this analysis is to\n
    \  provide a taxonomy for classification of various proposed approaches\n   to
    multi-homing. It is also an objective of this exercise to identify\n   common
    aspects of this domain of study, and also to provide a\n   framework that can
    allow exploration of some of the further\n   implications of various architectural
    extensions that are intended to\n   support multi-homing.\n\t </p>\n      "
