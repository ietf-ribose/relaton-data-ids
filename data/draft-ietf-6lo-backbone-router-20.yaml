abstract:
- content: <p>This document updates RFCs 6775 and 8505 in order to enable proxy services
    for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery by Routing Registrars called "Backbone Routers". Backbone
    Routers are placed along the wireless edge of a backbone and federate multiple
    wireless links to form a single Multi-Link Subnet (MLSN).</p>
