abstract:
- content: "<p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)-TE shares architecture and packet
    formats with BIER-TE forwards and replicates packets based on a BitString in the
    packet header, but every BitPosition of the BitString of a BIER-TE packet indicates
    one or more adjacencies. This document describes the mechanism and basic BIER-TE
    OAM packet format that can be used to perform Ping and Traceroute on the BIER-TE
    network.</p>"
