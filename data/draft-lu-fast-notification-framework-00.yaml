abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architectural work that competes with the
    IP Fast Re-Route (IPFRR) solution which aims to minimize the network down time
    in the event of equipments failure. The work provides a layered framework based
    upon which applications such as the domain- wide fast convergence may be achieved
    through the transport layer fast delivery of failure notifications.</p>"
