abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cryptographic operations like hashing and signing requires
    that the\n   data is expressed in an invariant format.  One way to address this
    is\n   to create a canonical representation of the data.  Canonicalization\n   also
    permits data to be exchanged in its original form on the \"wire\"\n   while secure
    cryptographic operations are performed on its\n   canonicalized counterpart in
    the producer and consumer end points.\n   The JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS)
    defines how to create a\n   canonical representation of JSON data by building
    on the strict\n   serialization methods for JSON primitives defined by ECMAScript,\n
    \  constraining JSON data to the I-JSON subset, and by using\n   deterministic
    property sorting.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
