abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As network scale increases and network operation becomes more\n
    \  sophisticated, traditional Operation, Administration and Maintenance\n   (OAM)
    methods, which include proactive and reactive techniques,\n   running in active
    and passive modes, are no longer sufficient to meet\n   the monitoring and measurement
    requirements.  Data-plane on-path\n   telemetry techniques which provide high-precision
    flow insight and\n   real-time issue notification are emerging to support suitable
    quality\n   of experience for users and applications, and network fault or\n   deficiency
    identification.\n\n   Centering on the new data-plane on-path telemetry techniques,
    this\n   document outlines a high-level framework to provide an operational\n
    \  environment that utilizes these techniques to enable the collection\n   and
    correlation of performance measurement information from the\n   network.  The
    framework identifies the components that are needed to\n   coordinate the existing
    protocol tools and telemetry mechanisms, and\n   addresses key deployment challenges
    for flow-oriented on-path\n   telemetry techniques, especially in carrier networks.\n\n
    \  The framework is informational and intended to guide system designers\n   attempting
    to apply the referenced techniques as well as to motivate\n   further work to
    enhance the ecosystem.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
