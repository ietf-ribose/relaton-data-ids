abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949) is
    a data\n   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small\n
    \  code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the\n   need
    for version negotiation.\n\n   In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition
    of CBOR tags.\n   RFC 8949 defines two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (RFC3339 time
    as a\n   string) and tag 1 (Posix time as int or float).  Since then,\n   additional
    requirements have become known.  The present document\n   defines a CBOR tag for
    time that allows a more elaborate\n   representation of time, as well as related
    CBOR tags for duration and\n   time period.  It is intended as the reference document
    for the IANA\n   registration of the CBOR tags defined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
