abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the Segment Routing IPv6 Mobile User
    Plane\n   (SRv6 MUP) architecture for Distributed Mobility Management.  The\n
    \  requirements for Distributed Mobility Management described in\n   [RFC7333]
    can be satisfied by routing fashion.\n\n   Mobile services are deployed over several
    parts of IP networks.  A\n   Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) network can accommodate
    all, or part\n   of those networks thanks to the large address space of IPv6 and
    the\n   network programming capability described in [RFC8986].\n\n   Segment Routing
    IPv6 Mobile User Plane Architecture can incorporate\n   existing session based
    mobile networks.  By leveraging SRv6 network\n   programmability, mobile user
    plane can be integrated into the SRv6\n   data plane.  In that routing paradigm,
    session information between\n   the entities of the mobile user plane is turned
    to routing\n   information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
