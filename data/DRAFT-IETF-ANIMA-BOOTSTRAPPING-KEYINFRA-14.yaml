abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies automated bootstrapping of a remote
    secure\n   key infrastructure (BRSKI) using manufacturer installed X.509\n   certificate,
    in combination with a manufacturer's authorizing\n   service, both online and
    offline.  Bootstrapping a new device can\n   occur using a routable address and
    a cloud service, or using only\n   link-local connectivity, or on limited/disconnected
    networks.\n   Support for lower security models, including devices with minimal\n
    \  identity, is described for legacy reasons but not encouraged.\n   Bootstrapping
    is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new\n   key infrastructure
    is successfully deployed to the device but the\n   established secure connection
    can be used to deploy a locally issued\n   certificate to the device as well.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
