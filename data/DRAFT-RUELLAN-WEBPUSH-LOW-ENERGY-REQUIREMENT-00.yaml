abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many devices are now connected to the Internet.  Receiving\n
    \  instantaneous notifications from the Web is an appealing but possibly\n   power-hungry
    feature.  This can be a substantial problem for light\n   devices with limited
    battery capacities.  WebPush alleviates this\n   problem by enabling a server
    to push notifications to the device\n   instead of having the device regularly
    poll the server.  This is a\n   first step towards more energy efficient devices,
    but is still not\n   sufficient for enabling batteries to last weeks or months
    without\n   recharging.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
