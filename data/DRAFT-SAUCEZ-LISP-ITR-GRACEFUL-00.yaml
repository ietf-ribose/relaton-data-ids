abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) is a map-and-encap\n
    \  mechanism to enable the communication between hosts identified with\n   their
    Endpoint IDentifier (EID) over the Internet where EIDs are not\n   routable.  To
    do so, packets toward EIDs are encapsulated in packets\n   with routing locators
    (RLOCs) to form dynamic tunnels.  An Ingress\n   Tunnel Router (ITR) that encapsulates
    EID packets determines tunnel\n   endpoints via mappings that associate EIDs to
    RLOCs.  Before\n   encapsulating a packet, the ITR queries the mapping system
    to obtain\n   the mapping associated to the EID of the packet it must encapsulate.\n
    \  Such mapping is cached by the ITR in its local EID-to-RLOC cache for\n   any
    subsequent encapsulation for the same EID.  LISP is scalable\n   because the EID-to-RLOC
    cache of an ITR, which is initially empty, is\n   populated progressively according
    to the traffic going through the\n   ITR.  However, after an ITR is restarted,
    e.g., for maintenance\n   reason, its cache is empty which means that all packets
    that are re-\n   routed to the freshly restarted ITR will cause cache misses and
    a\n   potentially high loss rate.  In this draft, we present mechanisms to\n   reduce
    the negative impact on traffic caused by the restart of an ITR\n   in a LISP network.\n\n\t
