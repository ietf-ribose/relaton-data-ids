abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document suggests the GR enhancement for BSR, BIDIR and\n
    \ PIM-SM. \n\n -This draft suggests a mechanism to refresh \n\n  E-BSR state and
    to learn RP-Set on Rebooted E-BSR Router quickly. \n \n\n -This draft suggests
    a mechanism for PIM-BIDIR Downstream Routers to \n\n  refresh the (*, G) state
    only after 'Rebooted Upstream Router has\n\n  learnt the RP Information and DF
    election is complete'. \n \n\n -This draft suggests a mechanism for PIM-SM Downstream
    Router to \n\n  delay the (*, G) joins to allow RP Information to be learnt on
    \n\n  Rebooted Upstream Router. It also suggests the mechanism to refresh \n\n
    \ the Assert-Winner or Assert-Loser state on Rebooting Router.\n\t </p>\n      "
