abstract:
  content: "\t <t>[OSPF-ASON] defines OSPFv2 extensions to fulfill the requirementsdefined
    in [RFC4258]. In OIF discussion of ASON routing, OIF membershave noted that some
    additional functionality beyond that defined in[OSPF-ASON] would be useful for
    deployment of ASON routing by OIFcarriers.The purpose of this document is to list
    such additionalfunctionalities, so that CCAMP experts study whether suchfunctionalities
    can be fulfilled by existing GMPLS mechanisms, orwhether extensions to [OSPF-ASON]
    are required.Some proposals for potential extensions are provided for review byIETF
    CCAMP.</p>"
