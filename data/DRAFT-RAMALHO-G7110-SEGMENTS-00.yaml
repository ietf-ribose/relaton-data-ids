abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes use cases for ITU-T Recommendation
    G.711.0\n   compression of ITU-T Recommendation G.711 payloads when deployed in\n
    \  transport system segments using the Real-Time Transport Protocol\n   (RTP).\n\n
    \  ITU-T Rec. G.711.0 defines a lossless and stateless compression for\n   G.711
    packet payloads typically used in IP networks.  Although the\n   use of ITU-T
    Rec. G.711.0 can be negotiated end-to-end, being\n   lossless and stateless it
    can also be applied as a compression\n   mechanism \"in-the-middle\" of an end-to-end
    ITU-T G.711 negotiated\n   session.  These \"in-the-middle\" applications of ITU-T
    Rec. G.711.0\n   are called \"G.711.0 Compression Segments\" in this document.\n\n
    \  This document outlines considerations and best practices (a.k.a. use\n   cases)
    for these \"G.711.0 compression segments\".\n\n\t </p>\n      "
