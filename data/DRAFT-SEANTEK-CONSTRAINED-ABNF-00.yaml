abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends the base definition of ABNF (Augmented
    Backus-\n   Naur Form) to express a rule that is constrained by another rule.
    If\n   a rule B is constrained by rule A, then every production generated by\n
    \  rule B must also be generated by rule A. By creating subordinate\n   production
    forms, ABNF-using specifications can formally denote the\n   relationship between
    a general rule and specific subsets of that\n   rule, while preserving ABNF's
    context-free nature.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
