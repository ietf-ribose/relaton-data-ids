abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes extensions to the Label Distribution
    Protocol\n   (LDP) for the setup of point to multi-point (P2MP) Label Switched\n
    \  Paths (LSPs) in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks.  The\n   solution
    relies on LDP without requiring a multicast routing protocol\n   in the network.
    \ Protocol elements and procedures for this solution\n   are described.  There
    can be various applications for P2MP LSPs such\n   as IP multicast.  Specification
    of how such applications can use a\n   LDP signaled P2MP LSP is outside the scope
    of this document.\n\t </p>\n      "
