abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes MASQUE (Multiplexed Application Substrate over
    QUIC Encryption). MASQUE is a framework that allows concurrently running multiple
    networking applications inside an HTTP/3 connection. For example, MASQUE can allow
    a QUIC client to negotiate proxying capability with an HTTP/3 server, and subsequently
    make use of this functionality while concurrently processing HTTP/3 requests and
    responses. This document is a straw-man proposal. It does not contain enough details
    to implement the protocol, and is currently intended to spark discussions on the
    approach it is taking. Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the
    MASQUE IETF mailing list masque@ietf.org (mailto:masque@ietf.org) or on the GitHub
    repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts
    (https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts).</p>"
