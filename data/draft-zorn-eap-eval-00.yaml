abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method that may be used to enumerate the
    claimed security qualities of EAP authentication types in terms of well-defined
    objective qualities. These claims may then be used to evaluate the claims against
    both the actual operation of the authentication types themselves and the security
    requirements of users (including other standards development organizations).</p>"
