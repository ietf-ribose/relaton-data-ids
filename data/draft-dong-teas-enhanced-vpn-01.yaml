abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework for using existing, modified and
    potential new networking technologies as components to provide an enhanced VPN
    (VPN+) service. The purpose is to enable virtual private networks (VPNs) to support
    the needs of new applications, particularly applications that are associated with
    5G services. A network enhanced with these properties can form the underpinning
    of network slicing, but will also be of use in its own right.</p>"
