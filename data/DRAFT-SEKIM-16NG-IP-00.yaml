abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes IP packet transmission over IEEE 802.16 network\nto
    access Internet with PMP mode based IP CS.  IP CS is a payload of\nIPv4 packet
    and IPv6 packet over IEEE 802.16 frame.  This draft\nintroduces host based packet
    delivery mechanism that can be\nclassified layer 2 forwarding and IP tunnel based
    on public service\nand trial on IEEE 802.16 network.  It describes HBPD on IEEE
    802.16,\nrequirements of the network elements and how to control IP CS on the\nIEEE
    802.16.\n\t </p>\n      "
