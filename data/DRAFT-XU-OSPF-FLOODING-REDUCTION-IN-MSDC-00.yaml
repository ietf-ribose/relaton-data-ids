abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OSPF is commonly used as a underlay routing protocol for MSDC\n
    \  (Massively Scalable Data Center) networks.  This document proposes\n   some
    extensions to OSPF so as to reduce the OSPF flooding within MSDC\n   networks
    greatly.  The reduction of the OSPF flooding is much\n   beneficial to improve
    the scalability of MSDC networks.  These\n   modifications are applicable to both
    OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
