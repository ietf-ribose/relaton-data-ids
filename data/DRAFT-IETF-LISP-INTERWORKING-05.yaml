abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes techniques for allowing sites running
    the\n   Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) to interoperate with Internet\n
    \  sites (which may be using either IPv4, IPv6, or both) but which are\n   not
    running LISP.  A fundamental property of LISP speaking sites is\n   that they
    use Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), rather than traditional IP\n   addresses, in
    the source and destination fields of all traffic they\n   emit or receive.  While
    EIDs are syntactically identical to IPv4 or\n   IPv6 addresses, normally routes
    to them are not carried in the global\n   routing system so an interoperability
    mechanism is needed for non-\n   LISP-speaking sites to exchange traffic with
    LISP-speaking sites.\n   This document introduces three such mechanisms.  The
    first uses a new\n   network element, the LISP Proxy Ingress Tunnel Routers (Proxy-ITRs)\n
    \  (Section 5) to act as a intermediate LISP Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR)\n   for
    non-LISP-speaking hosts.  Second the document adds Network\n   Address Translation
    (NAT) functionality to LISP Ingress and LISP\n   Egress Tunnel Routers (xTRs)
    to substitute routable IP addresses for\n   non-routable EIDs.  Finally, this
    document introduces the Proxy\n   Egress Tunnel Router (Proxy ETR) to handle cases
    where a LISP ITR\n   cannot send packets to non-LISP sites without encapsulation.\n\n\t
