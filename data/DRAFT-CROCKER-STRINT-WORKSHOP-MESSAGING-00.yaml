abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Given a concern for pervasive monitoring, messaging information\n
    \  needing protection includes primary payload, descriptive meta-data,\n   and
    traffic-related analysis.  Complete protection against pervasive\n   monitoring
    (PM), for traffic through complex handling sequences, has\n   not yet been achieved
    reliably in real-world operation.\n   Consequently, it is reasonable to consider
    a range of mechanisms, for\n   protecting differing amounts of information and
    against monitoring of\n   different kinds.  Although channel-based encryption
    can be helpful,\n   it is not sufficient.  This paper considers pursuing different
    levels\n   of end-to-end protection, referencing examples of component\n   mechanisms
    that already have encouraging field experience.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
