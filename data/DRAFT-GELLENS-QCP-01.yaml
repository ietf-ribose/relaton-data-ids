abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RFC 2658 specifies the streaming format for 3GPP2 13KK vocoder
    (High Rate Speech Service Option 17 for Wideband Spread Spectrum Communications
    Systems, also known as QCELP 13K vocoder) data, but does not specify a storage
    format.  Many implementations have been using the \"QCP\" file format (named for
    its file extension) for exchanging QCELP 13K data as well as Enhanced Variable
    Rate Coder (EVRC) and Selectable Mode Vocoders (SMV) data. (For example, Eudora(r),
    QuickTime(r), and cmda2000(r) handsets).  This document specifies the QCP file
    format and updates the audio/qcelp media registration to specify this format for
    storage, and registers the audio/evrc-qcp and audio/smv-qcp media types for EVRC
    and SMV (respectively) data stored in this format.\n\t </p>\n      "
