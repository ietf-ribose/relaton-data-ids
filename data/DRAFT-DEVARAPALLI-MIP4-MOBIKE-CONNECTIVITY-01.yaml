abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Enterprise users require mobility and secure connectivity when
    they\n   roam and connect to the services offered in the enterprise.  Secure\n
    \  connectivity is required when the user connects to the enterprise\n   from
    an untrusted network.  Mobility is beneficial when the user\n   moves, either
    inside or outside the enterprise network, and acquires\n   a new IP address.  This
    document describes a solution using Mobile\n   IPv4 and mobility extensions to
    IKEv2 (MOBIKE) to provide secure\n   connectivity and mobility.\n\t </p>\n      "
