abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The IETF has standardized RBridges, devices that implement the TRILLprotocol,
    a solution for transparent shortest-path frame routing inmulti-hop networks with
    arbitrary topologies, using a link-staterouting protocol technology and encapsulation
    with a hop-count. AsRBridges are deployed in real-world situations, operators
    will needtools for debugging problems that arise. This document specifies aset
    of RBridge features for operations, administration, andmaintenance purposes in
    RBridge campuses. The features specified inthis document include tools for traceroute,
    ping, and errorreporting.</p>"
