abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a method that can selectively apply\n
    \  application data encryption to the DTLS record layer. The CoAP used\n   for
    resource-constrained devices defines the use of DTLS as a basic\n   security mechanism,
    and CoAP standard specifies the use of AES_CCM\n   that provides data integrity
    and confidentiality as a cipher suite\n   for DTLS. However, not all CoAP messages
    require both data integrity\n   and confidentiality. For example, in case of CoAP
    messages that\n   include information for turning a light off at home or in a
    building,\n   or simple ACK information, encryption might not be necessary because\n
    \  such information might not be useful to attackers. Furthermore, from\n   the
    perspective of effective resource use of resource-constrained\n   devices, reducing
    the computation load required to perform data\n   encryption every time is necessary.
    This document describes the\n   methods for CoAP nodes to establish DTLS security
    channels using the\n   AES_CCM cipher suite, and to selectively apply the encryption\n
    \  function in the DTLS record layer by considering sensitivity to\n   application
    data leakage\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
