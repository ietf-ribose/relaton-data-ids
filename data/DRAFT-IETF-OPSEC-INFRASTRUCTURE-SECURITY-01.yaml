abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This RFC describes best current practices for implementing
    Service\n   Provider network infrastructure protection for network elements.\n
    \  This RFC complements and extends RFC 2267 and RFC 3704.  RFC 2267\n   provides
    guidelines for filtering traffic on the ingress to service\n   provider networks.
    \ RFC 3704 expands the recommendations described in\n   RFC 2267 to address operational
    filtering guidelines for single and\n   multi-homed environments.  The focus of
    those RFCs is on filtering\n   packets on ingress to a network, regardless of
    destination, if those\n   packets have a spoofed source address, or if the source
    address fall\n   within \"reserved\" address space.  Deployment of RFCs 2267 and
    3704\n   has limited the effects of denial of service attacks by dropping\n   ingress
    packets with spoofed source addresses, which in turn offers\n   other benefits
    by ensuring that packets coming into a network\n   originate from validly allocated
    and consistent sources.  This\n   document focuses solely on traffic destined
    to elements of the the\n   network infrastructure itself.  This document presents
    techniques\n   that, together with network edge ingress filtering and RFC 2267
    and\n   RFC 3704, provides a defense in depth approach for infrastructure\n   protection.
    \ This document does not present recommendations for\n   protocol validation (i.e.
    \"sanity checking\") nor does it address\n   guidelines for general security configuration.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
