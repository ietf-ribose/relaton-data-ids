abstract:
- content: "<p>The merged ALTO protocol proposal proposes several mechanisms to increase
    scalability of the protocol. One of the proposed mechanisms is the distribution
    of ALTO information directly between the peers without any involvement of the
    server. This memo discusses why the proposed mechanism is considered harmful and
    why the proposed security framework is deployable.</p>"
