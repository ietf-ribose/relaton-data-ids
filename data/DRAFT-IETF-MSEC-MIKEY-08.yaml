abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a key management scheme that can be used
    for real-time applications (both for peer-to-peer communication and group communication).
    \ In particular, its use to support the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol is
    described in detail.  Security protocols for real-time multimedia applications
    have started to appear.  This has brought forward the need for a key management
    solution to support these protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t </p>\n      "
