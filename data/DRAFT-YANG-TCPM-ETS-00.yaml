abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents ETS: an Extensible TimeStamps option
    for TCP.\n   It allows hosts to use microseconds as the unit for timestamps to\n
    \  improve the precision of timestamps, and advertise the maximum ACK\n   delay
    for its own delayed ACK mechanism.  Furthermore, it extends the\n   information
    provided in the [RFC7323] TCP Timestamps Option by\n   including the receiver
    delay in the TSecr echoing, so that the\n   receiver of the ACK is able to more
    accurately estimate the portion\n   of the RTT that resulted from time traveling
    through the network.\n   The ETS option format is extensible, so that future extensions
    can\n   add further information without the overhead of extra TCP option kind\n
    \  and length fields.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
