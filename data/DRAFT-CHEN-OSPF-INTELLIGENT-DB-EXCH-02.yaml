abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents an intelligent database exchange mechanism
    for\n   the database exchange procedure in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  This mechanism\n
    \  is backward compatible.  It eliminates the unnecessary database\n   exchanges
    through using the existing reachability information\n   calculated from the link
    state database and the un-reachability\n   information about routers recorded.
    \ It significantly speeds up the\n   establishment of the full adjacency between
    two routers in some\n   situations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
