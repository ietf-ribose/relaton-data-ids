abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a set of requirements and facilities designed
    to improve email confidentiality between a mail user agent (MUA) and a mail submission
    or mail access server. This provides mechanisms intended to increase use of already
    deployed Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology and provides a model for a
    mail user agent's confidentiality assurance. This enables mail service providers
    to advertise strict transport security (STS) policies that request MUAs increase
    confidentiality assurance.</p>"
