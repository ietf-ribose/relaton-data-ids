abstract:
  content: "<p>This design provides the ability to have an entire campus, withmultiple
    physical links, look to IP like a single subnet. Thiscapability is often provided
    today with bridges. Bridges have theadvantage of being plug-and-play. However,
    they have disadvantages:routing is confined to a spanning tree, the header on
    which thespanning tree forwards has no hop count, spanning tree forwarding inthe
    presence of loops spawns exponential copies of packets, nodes canhave only a single
    point of attachment, and the spanning tree, inorder to avoid temporary loops,
    is slow to start forwarding on newports. The design in this paper avoids those
    disadvantages ofbridges. The basic design is layer 3-independent, and is a designfor
    bridging with a shortest-path routing algorithm (instead ofspanning tree paths),
    and with more robust forwarding. Then thedesign is extended to provide IP-specific
    optimizations.</p>"
