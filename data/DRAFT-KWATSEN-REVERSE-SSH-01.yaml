abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo presents a technique for a SSH (Secure Shell) server
    to\n   initiate the underlying TCP connection to the SSH client.  This role\n
    \  reversal is necessary in cases where the SSH client would otherwise\n   be
    unable to initiate an SSH connection to the SSH server, such as a\n   device \"calling
    home\" on its first boot.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
