abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\n
    \  functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching
    (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n\n   MPLS and GMPLS networks may
    be constructed from layered service\n   networks.  It is advantageous for overall
    network efficiency to\n   provide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple
    network layers\n   through a process called inter-layer traffic engineering.  PCE
    is a\n   candidate solution for such requirements.\n\n   The PCE communication
    Protocol (PCEP) is designed as a communication\n   protocol between Path Computation
    Clients (PCCs) and PCEs.  This\n   document presents PCEP extensions for inter-layer
    traffic\n   engineering.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
