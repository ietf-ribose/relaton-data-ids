abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a solution to enable an emulated LAN Service
    or\nVirtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) by decoupling the bridging and\ntunneling
    of Ethernet traffic into Customer Located Equipment (CLE)\nor Customer Edge (CE)
    and Provider Edge (PE), respectively.  This\ndecoupling of functions allows an
    operator to provision point-to-\npoint transport of Ethernet services for customer
    on PEs, while\nleveraging bridging functions at CLEs to forward traffic towards
    the\nappropriate point-to-point Ethernet service leading to the\ndestination node.
    This decoupling of functions also allow providers\nto leverage existing network
    infrastructures to enable VPLS while\neasing migration to new network infrastructures.
    This approach scales\nas the number of customers and sites increases, and as customers'\nemulated
    LAN sites span over a large wide area network.  It is also\nthe intention to show
    that an interface like Ethernet can be offered\nto customers and emulated LAN
    services can be enabled, but it is not\nmandatory to introduce VLAN like technologies
    (or PE-based type of\nVPLS) in the provider's network. In addition, existing and\nheterogeneous
    access technologies can be supported in a common\nnetwork infrastructure.\n\t
