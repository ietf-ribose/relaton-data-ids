abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths at
    the end-\n   systems typically provided through different IP addresses obtained
    by\n   different ISPs.  While this scenario is certainly becoming\n   increasingly
    a reality (e.g.  mobile devices), currently most end-\n   systems are single-homed
    (e.g.  desktop PCs in an enterprise). It\n   seems also likely that a lot of network
    sites will insist on having\n   all traffic pass a single network element (e.g.
    \ for security\n   reasons) before traffic is split across multiple paths.  This
    memo\n   therefore describes mechanisms to make multiple paths available to\n
    \  multipath TCP-capable end-systems that are not available directly at\n   the
    end-systems but somewhere within the network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
