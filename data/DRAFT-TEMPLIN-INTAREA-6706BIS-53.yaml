abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operation of IP over Overlay Multilink\n
    \  Network (OMNI) interfaces using the Asymmetric Extended Route\n   Optimization
    (AERO) internetworking and mobility management service.\n   AERO uses an IPv6
    link-local address format that supports operation\n   of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
    (ND) protocol and links ND to IP\n   forwarding.  Prefix delegation/registration
    services are employed for\n   network admission and to manage the routing system.
    \ Multilink\n   operation, mobility management, quality of service (QoS) signaling\n
    \  and route optimization are naturally supported through dynamic\n   neighbor
    cache updates.  Standard IP multicasting services are also\n   supported.  AERO
    is a widely-applicable mobile internetworking\n   service especially well-suited
    to aviation services, intelligent\n   transportation systems, mobile Virtual Private
    Networks (VPNs) and\n   many other applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
