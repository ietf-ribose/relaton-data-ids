abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the near future, multi-interfaces Mobile Nodes will be used
    for \nconnecting to the Internet by way of a multitude of Radio Access \nNetworks
    including 802.11 based WLANs, GPRS, CDMA2000 and 3G based \ncellular networks.
    Ensuring the non-disrupted flow of real-time \napplications data, as well as adhering
    to subscribed service profiles \nwhile the Mobile Node moves between Access Networks
    of different \ntechnologies, is an issue that needs to be addressed. It is assumed
    \nthat a unified and external IP core network is used to support such a \nmultitude
    of Access Networks. This will probably be the case for a \nmobile network operator
    intending to benefit its subscribers with its \nown hot-spots broadband internet
    access. Consequently, the need \narises to define managed handoff mechanisms between
    heterogeneous \nattachment networks, while providing service continuity to the
    Mobile \nNode. \nAs such, information necessary for the Mobile Node to performing
    a \njudicious handoff across Wireless Access Networks, will have to be \ngathered
    from the involved Access Networks, transferred across the IP \nnetwork that interconnects
    them, to the operators home network. \nThis document discusses the desirability
    of a network controlled \nhandoff process for optimizing inter-Access Network
    Mobile Node \nmobility. The approach presented provides the means for the operator
    \nhome network to achieve the best possible selection of the Mobile \nNode target
    Access Network for handoff, on the basis of information \ngathered on the most
    relevant nodes. It introduces a new function \nlocated in the operator network
    and referred to as a Mobility \nManager. It also introduces the concepts for implementing
    such a \nhandoff process to make it compatible with Mobile IPv6. Other \ndocuments
    will be needed to specify the protocol structures that are \nintended for handling
    the handoff process hereafter described. \n       \n\t </p>\n      "
