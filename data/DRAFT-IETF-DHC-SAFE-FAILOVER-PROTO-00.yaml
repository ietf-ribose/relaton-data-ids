abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The DHCP protocol [RFC 2131] [1] allows multiple DHCP servers.
    \ A\n   recent draft, the DHCP Failover Protocol [3], has been distributed\n   which
    is designed to provide a redundant DHCP solution.  While\n   clearly a work in
    progress, it is equally clear that it can be made\n   to work and meet the goals
    that the authors have set for it.  One of\n   the goals of the Failover protocol
    is that it should avoid duplicate\n   IP address allocations, except under some
    rare circumstances.  While\n   this approach may be quite reasonable in a wide
    variety of environ-\n   ments, some environments require a DHCP redundancy solution
    which can\n   (optionally) ensure that no possibility of duplicate IP address
    allo-\n   cation exists.\n \n   The Safe Failover protocol is designed to build
    on top of the\n   Failover protocol, and add to it certain protocol exchanges,
    prac-\n   tices and algorithms which will create a DHCP redundancy solution\n
    \  which avoids duplicate IP address allocation.\n\t </p>\n      "
