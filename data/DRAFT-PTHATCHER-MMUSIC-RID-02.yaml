abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this specification, we define a framework for identifying
    Source\n   RTP Streams with the constraints on its payload format in the Session\n
    \  Description Protocol.  This framework uses \"rid\" SDP attribute to: a)\n   effectively
    identify the Source RTP Streams within a RTP Session, b)\n   constrain their payload
    format parameters in a codec-agnostic way\n   beyond what is provided with the
    regular Payload Types and c) enable\n   unambiguous mapping between the Source
    RTP Streams to their media\n   format specification in the SDP.\n\n   Note-1:
    The name 'rid' is not yet finalized.  Please refer to\n   Section 12 for more
    details on the naming.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
