abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) exhibit characteristics
    unlike\n   other more traditional IP links.  LLNs are a class of network in\n
    \  which both routers and their interconnect are resource constrained.\n   LLN
    routers are typically resource constrained in processing power,\n   memory, and
    energy (i.e. battery power).  LLN links are typically\n   exhibit high loss rates,
    low data rates, are are strongly affected by\n   environmental conditions that
    change over time.  LLNs may be composed\n   of a few dozen to thousands of routers.
    \ A new protocol called the\n   IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) has been\n   specified for routing in LLNs supporting multipoint-to-point,
    point-\n   to-multipoint traffic, and point-to-point traffic.  Since RPL's\n   publication
    as an RFC, several large scale networks have been\n   succesfully deployed.  The
    aim of this document is to provide\n   deployment experience on real-life deployed
    RPL-based networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
