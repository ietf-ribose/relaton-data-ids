abstract:
  content: "<p>This document is intended only to provide information to the Internetcommunity.
    The Mobile IP (MIP) protocol for IP version 4 providescontinuous Internet connectivity
    to mobile hosts, without requiring anychanges to existing routers and higher-layer
    applications. Thisdocument describes an alternative protocol, Mobile IP with LocationRegisters
    (MIP-LR), where the sender first queries a database, called aLocation Register,
    to obtain the recipients current location. MIP-LRis designed for operation in
    tactical military environments, enterpriseenvironments or within logical administrative
    domains, as it requires asending host to be aware which hosts implement the MIP-LR
    protocol.MIP-LR gives up the transparency of MIP for several benefits in theareas
    of survivability, performance and interoperability. MIP-LR improves survivability
    for situations where the mobile's homenetwork is particularly vulnerable (e.g.
    in the forward area of abattlefield), by allowing location registers to be placed
    andreplicated outside the home network. This document describes howreplicated
    location registers can be managed by Translation Server orQuorum schemes. In terms
    of performance, MIP-LR avoids trianglerouting and tunneling, and reduces the load
    on the home network as wellas the home agents. MIP-LR provides improved interoperability
    withprotocols such as RSVP for providing QoS guarantees. Finally, MIP-LRis interoperable
    with MIP, such that hosts which implement only MIP cancontinue to operate as expected
    (provided the provisions required byMIP, such as Home and Foreign Agents, are
    appropriately provided)without gaining any of the benefits of MIP-LR. We have
    developed aworking version of the MIP-LR protocol running on Linux hosts.</p>"
