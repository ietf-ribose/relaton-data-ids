abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft gives provides an example set of licensing terms
    for use\n   in IPR disclosures that are compatible with the goals of the proposed\n
    \  video-codec working group for further discussion and refinement by\n   participants
    at the IETF.  Although usage of such a license is\n   strictly voluntary, the
    hope is that getting agreement on a set of\n   terms before the bulk of the work
    begins will allow contributors to\n   use a common license and minimize the amount
    of legal analysis that\n   must be performed in order to deploy the codec.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
