abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an extension to the CONNECT-IP HTTP
    method.\n   This extension defines a new Flow Forwarding Mode which supports\n
    \  optimization for individual IP flows forwarded to the targeted peer.\n\n   *
    \ IMPORTANT NOTE: This draft exists only to demonstrate the\n      feasibility
    of defining CONNECT-IP Flow Forwarding Mode as an\n      extension to CONNECT-IP.
    \ The overwhelming majority of the content\n      in this draft was copied from
    draft-kuehlewind-masque-connect-ip-\n      01.  A list of changes from that design
    is available in an\n      appendix to this document.  All credit for flow forwarding
    should\n      go to the authors of that document.  However, all blame for any\n
    \     errors in this draft should be attributed to its editor.  The\n      editor's
    intent is to step down as editor of this draft and have\n      the authors of
    draft-kuehlewind-masque-connect-ip take on that\n      role.\n\nDiscussion Venues\n\n
    \  This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Discussion of
    this document takes place on the Multiplexed\n   Application Substrate over QUIC
    Encryption Working Group mailing list\n   (masque@ietf.org), which is archived
    at\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/masque/.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
