abstract:
- content: "<p>A BGP speaker may perform Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
    origin validation not only on routes received from BGP neighbors and routes that
    are redistributed from other routing protocols, but also on routes it sends to
    BGP neighbors. For egress policy, it is important that the classification use
    the 'effective origin AS' of the processed route, which may specifically be altered
    by the commonly available knobs, such as removing private ASes, confederation
    handling, and other modifications of the origin AS. This document updates RFC
    6811.</p>"
