abstract:
- content: "<p>When a DNS server filters a query, the response to such query conveys
    no detailed explanation that elaborates why that query was blocked, leading thus
    to end-user confusion. A solution to this problem is needed in order to enhance
    the user experience. This document defines a method to return an URI that explains
    the reason why a DNS query was filtered by a DNS server.</p>"
