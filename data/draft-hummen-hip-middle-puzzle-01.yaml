abstract:
- content: "<p>The Host Identity Protocol [RFC5201] is a secure signaling protocol
    with a cryptographic namespace. It provides the communicating peers with a cryptographic
    puzzle mechanism to protect against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks exploiting
    the computation and memory overheads of the protocol exchange. This document specifies
    an extension of the protocol that enables an on-path network entity to assist
    in the choice of the puzzle difficulty in case of an attack. Furthermore, it defines
    a modification of the puzzle mechanism that enables a host to delegate puzzle
    solving to an on-path network entity.</p>"
