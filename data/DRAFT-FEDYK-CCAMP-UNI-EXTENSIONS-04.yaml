abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document builds on the GMPLS overlay model [RFC4208] and
    defines\n   extensions to the GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) to support route\n
    \  diversity within the core network for sets of LSPs initiated by edge\n   nodes.
    A particular example where route diversity within the core\n   network is desired,
    are dual-homed edge nodes. The core network is\n   typically composed of multiple
    network domains and those multi-domain\n   diversity aspects that have an implication
    on the GMPLS UNI\n   extensions are discussed.\n\n   The document also defines
    GMPLS UNI extensions to deal with latency\n   requirements for edge node initiated
    LSPs.\n\n   This document uses a VPN model that is based on the same premise as\n
    \  L1VPN framework [RFC4847] but may also be applied to other\n   technologies.
    \ The extensions are applicable both to VPN and non VPN\n   environments. These
    extensions move the UNI from basic connectivity\n   to enhanced mode connectivity
    by including additional constraints\n   while minimizing the exchange of CE to
    PE information. These\n   extensions are applicable to the overlay extension service
    model.\n   Route Diversity for customer LSPs are a common requirement applicable\n
    \  to L1VPNs. The UNI mechanisms described in this document are L1VPN\n   compatible
    and can be applied to achieve diversity for sets of\n   customer LSPs.\n\n   The
    UNI extensions in support of latency constraints can also be\n   applied to the
    extended overlay service model in order for the\n   customer LSPs to meet certain
    latency requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
