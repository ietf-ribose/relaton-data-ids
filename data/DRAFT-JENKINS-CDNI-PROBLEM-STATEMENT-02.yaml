abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide numerous benefits: reduced\ndelivery
    cost for cacheable content, improved quality of experience\nfor End Users and
    increased robustness of delivery.  For these\nreasons they are frequently used
    for large-scale content delivery.\nAs a result, existing CDN providers are scaling
    up their\ninfrastructure and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are\ndeploying
    their own CDNs.  It is generally desirable that a given\ncontent item can be delivered
    to an end user regardless of that end\nuser's location or attachment network.
    \ This creates a requirement\nfor interconnecting standalone CDNs so they can
    interoperate as an\nopen content delivery infrastructure for the end-to-end delivery
    of\ncontent from Content Service Providers (CSPs) to end users.  However,\nno
    standards or open specifications currently exist to facilitate\nsuch CDN interconnection.\n\nThe
    goal of this document is to outline the problem area for the IETF\nwith a view
    towards creating a working group.  This working group\nwould work on interoperable
    and scalable solutions for CDN\ninterconnection.\n\t </p>\n      "
