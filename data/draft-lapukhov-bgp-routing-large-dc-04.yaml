abstract:
- content: <p>Some service providers build and operate data centers that support over
    100,000 servers. In this document, such data centers are referred to as "large-scale"
    to differentiate them from smaller infrastructures. The environments of this scale
    have a unique set of network requirements, with emphasis on operational simplicity
    and network stability. This document summarizes ideas and experience of many people
    involved in designing and operating large scale data centers using BGP as the
    only control-plane protocol. The intent here is to report a proven and stable
    routing design that could be leveraged by others in the industry.</p>
