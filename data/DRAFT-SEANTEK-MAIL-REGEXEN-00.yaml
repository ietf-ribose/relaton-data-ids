abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet Mail identifiers are used ubiquitously throughout
    computing\n   systems as building blocks of online identity. Unfortunately,\n
    \  incomplete understandings of the syntaxes of these identifiers has\n   led
    to interoperability problems and poor user experiences. Many\n   users use specific
    characters in their addresses that are not\n   properly accepted on various systems.
    This document prescribes\n   normative regular expression (regex) patterns for
    all Internet-\n   connected systems to use when validating or parsing Internet
    Mail\n   identifiers, with special attention to regular expressions that work\n
    \  with popular languages and platforms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
