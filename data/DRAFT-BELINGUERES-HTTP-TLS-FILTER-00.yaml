abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document explains how to use the TCP Security Filter mechanism
    \nto initiate a Transport Layer Security (TLS) session to secure HTTP \nconnections
    over the Internet. This allows unsecured and secured HTTP \ntraffic to share the
    same well known port (in this case, http: at 80 \nrather than https: at 443).
    As an additional point, a similar \nmechanism like the described here could be
    used to provide other \ndifferent kind of layers to HTTP connections.\n\t </p>\n
