abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a new Diameter Application to support
    the\n   Mobile IPv6's bootstrapping mechanism during the AAA authentication\n
    \  and authorization phase based on PANA.  PANA is used as a protocol\n   for
    network authentication between mobile nodes and access networks.\n   During the
    PANA authentication phase, the mobile node's initial\n   configuration information
    like its home address, home agent address\n   and IKEv2/IKEv1 pre-shared keying
    material is piggybacked to the PANA\n   messages cryptographically protected by
    the PANA SA.  The Diameter\n   and PANA message formats to support the Mobile
    IPv6 bootstrapping in\n   the integrated bootstrapping scenario are defined.\n\t
