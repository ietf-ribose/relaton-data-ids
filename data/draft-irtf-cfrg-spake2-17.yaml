abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SPAKE2 which is a protocol for two parties
    that share a password to derive a strong shared key with no risk of disclosing
    the password. This method is compatible with any group, is computationally efficient,
    and SPAKE2 has a security proof. This document predated the CFRG PAKE competition
    and it was not selected. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research
    Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.</p>"
