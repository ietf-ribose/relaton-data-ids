abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes requirements for connecting a pure photonic
    \n   sub-domain to a GMPLS-based Label Switch Router. One of the main \n   requirements
    is to avoid advertising all the physical properties of \n   the underlying optical
    hardware while still peering with standard \n   GMPLS. This draft discusses the
    requirements for abstracting the \n   optical topology and the implications of
    various abstract models. \n   This draft discusses possible extensions to [OSPF-TE]
    [GMPLS-\n   Routing] and [ISIS-TE] for use by GMPLS networks that require \n   additional
    constraints to be considered in the computation of viable \n   paths.  \n\t </p>\n
