abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) enables service differentiation\n
    \  through class-based forwarding.  IGP protocols (OSPF and IS-IS) and\n   LDP
    have already been extended to setup MTR.  In order to deploy mLDP\n   in an MTR
    network, mLDP is also required to become topology-aware.\n   This document specifies
    extensions to mLDP to support Multi-Topology\n   Routing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
