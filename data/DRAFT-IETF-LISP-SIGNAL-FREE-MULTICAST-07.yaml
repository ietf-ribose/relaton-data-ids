abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When multicast sources and receivers are active at LISP sites,
    the\n   core network is required to use native multicast so packets can be\n   delivered
    from sources to group members.  When multicast is not\n   available to connect
    the multicast sites together, a signal-free\n   mechanism can be used to allow
    traffic to flow between sites.  The\n   mechanism within here uses unicast replication
    and encapsulation over\n   the core network for the data-plane and uses the LISP
    mapping\n   database system so encapsulators at the source LISP multicast site\n
    \  can find decapsulators at the receiver LISP multicast sites.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
