abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is a working document intended to focus discussion on\n
    \  requirements for multicast in Low-power and Lossy Networks in the\n   area
    of M2M communication for control purposes.  The Trickle\n   algorithm, which uses
    re-broadcasting to assure that messages arrive\n   at all destinations, is proposed
    as the ROLL multicast protocol.  In\n   this draft additional requirements on
    Trickle, such as timeliness and\n   ordering, are motivated by building control.
    \ Re-broadcasting and\n   timeliness can be mutually exclusive properties.  To
    alleviate that\n   problem, this draft considers the possibility of reducing\n
    \  interference by limiting the number of transmission paths between any\n   two
    devices in the mesh.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
