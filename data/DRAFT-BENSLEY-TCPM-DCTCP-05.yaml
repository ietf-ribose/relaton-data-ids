abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes Datacenter TCP (DCTCP), an improvement
    to TCP\n   congestion control for datacenter traffic.  DCTCP uses improved\n   Explicit
    Congestion Notification (ECN) processing to estimate the\n   fraction of bytes
    that encounter congestion, rather than simply\n   detecting that some congestion
    has occurred.  DCTCP then scales the\n   TCP congestion window based on this estimate.
    \ This method achieves\n   high burst tolerance, low latency, and high throughput
    with shallow-\n   buffered switches.\n\t </p>\n      "
