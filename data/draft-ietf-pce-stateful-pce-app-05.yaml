abstract:
- content: "<p>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information about
    Label Switched Path (LSP) characteristics and resource usage within a network
    in order to provide traffic engineering calculations for its associated Path Computation
    Clients (PCCs). This document describes general considerations for a stateful
    PCE deployment and examines its applicability and benefits, as well as its challenges
    and limitations through a number of use cases. PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    extensions required for stateful PCE usage are covered in separate documents.</p>"
