abstract:
  content: "<p>In order for the local mobility anchor to receive and forward uplinktraffic
    for a mobile node, Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocol mandatesthe LMA to have an
    active BCE with a registered proxy CoA that is theother end of the tunnel between
    the LMA and MAG. In some systems andduring active inter-MAG handoff with traffic
    that is sensitive todelay and packet loss, the LMA is required to forward uplink
    trafficfor the mobile node from the target MAG without completely switchingthe
    tunnel from the source MAG. This document specifies a mechanismwhich allows the
    target MAG to perform transient registration for anew proxy CoA and the LMA to
    create a transient BCE for the samemobile node for a specified period of time
    while maintaining theoriginal mobile node's BCE which reference the old pCoA at
    the sourceMAG.</p>"
