abstract:
  content: "\t <t>AFS-3 is a distributed file system based upon prototypes developed
    atCarnegie Mellon University during the 1980s. AFS-3 heavily leveragesRemote Procedure
    Calls (RPCs) as the foundation for its distributedarchitecture. In 2003, new RPCs
    were introduced into AFS-3 thatprovide for capability introspection between file
    servers and cachemanagers. This memo introduces equivalent functionality to thevolume
    server RPC interface, thus making the volume managementinterface more extensible.Furthermore,
    this memo extends the volume management interface tosupport getting and setting
    of AFS volume attributes via anextensible Tag-Length-Value (TLV) encoding, which
    is based upon XDRdiscriminated unions. TLV-based get and set RPCs are specified,along
    with a tag enumeration RPC. The TLV encoding side-steps thetypical XDR union decode
    problem, whereby failure to decode a unionleg causes the entire RPC payload decode
    to fail, by mandating an XDRopaque default leg for the union, along with a standard
    mechanism forencoding new leg types inside the XDR opaque blob.Finally, tags are
    allocated for existing volume and transactionmetadata, and implementation-private
    tags are allocated for metadatarelated to the OpenAFS Demand Attach File Server
    and RxOSD protocol.Internet Draft CommentsComments regarding this draft are solicited.
    Please include theAFS-3 protocol standardization mailing list(afs3-standardization@openafs.org)
    as a recipient of any comments.</p>"
