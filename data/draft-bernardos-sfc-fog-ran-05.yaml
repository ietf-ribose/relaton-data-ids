abstract:
- content: "<p>Fog Radio Access Networks (RAN) refers to the part of the RAN that
    is virtualized at the very edge of the network, even at the end-user device. Fog
    RAN support is considered critical for the 5G mobile network architectures currently
    being developed in various research, standardization and industry forums. Since
    fog RAN builds on top of virtualization and can involve several virtual functions
    running on different virtualized resources, Service function chaining (SFC) support
    for the fog RAN will be critical. This document describes the overall fog RAN
    approach and also gives some use cases. Finally it proposes some requirements
    to be considered in the development of the SFC architecture and related protocols.</p>"
