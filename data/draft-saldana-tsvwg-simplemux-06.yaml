abstract:
- content: <p>The high amount of small packets present in nowaday's networks results
    in a low efficiency, as the size of the headers and the payload of these packets
    can be in the same order of magnitude. In some situations, multiplexing a number
    of small packets into a bigger one is desirable in order to improve the efficiency.
    For example, a number of small packets can be sent together between a pair of
    machines if they share a common network path. Thus, the traffic profile can be
    shifted from small to larger packets, reducing the network overhead and the number
    of packets per second to be managed by intermediate routers. This document describes
    Simplemux, a protocol able to encapsulate a number of packets belonging to different
    protocols into a single packet. Small headers (separators) are added at the beginning
    of each multiplexed packet, including some flags, the packet length and a "Protocol"
    field. This allows the inclusion of a number of packets belonging to different
    protocols (the "multiplexed packets") on a packet of another protocol (the "tunneling
    protocol"). In order to reduce the overhead, the size of the multiplexing headers
    is kept very low (it may be a single byte when multiplexing small packets).</p>
