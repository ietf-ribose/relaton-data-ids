abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This documents describe a technique called A-PAWS which can
    provide\n   protection against old duplicates segments like PAWS.  While PAWS\n
    \  requires TCP to set timestamp options in all segments in a TCP\n   connection,
    A-PAWS supports the same feature without using\n   timestamps.  A-PAWS is designed
    to be used complementary with PAWS.\n   TCP needs to use PAWS when it is necessary
    and activates A-PAWS only\n   when it is safe to use.  Without impairing the reliability
    and the\n   robustness of TCP, A-PAWS can provide more option space to other TCP\n
    \  extensions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
