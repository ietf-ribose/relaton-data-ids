abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a methodology and framework for quantifying\n
    \  the performance impact of monitoring of IP flows on a network device\n   and
    export of this information to a collector. It identifies the rate\n   at which
    the IP flows are created, expired, and successfully exported\n   as a new performance
    metric in combination with traditional\n   throughput. The metric is only applicable
    to the devices compliant\n   with the Architecture for IP Flow Information Export
    [RFC5470].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
