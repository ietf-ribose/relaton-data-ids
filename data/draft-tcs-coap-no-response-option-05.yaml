abstract:
- content: '<p>There can be typical M2M scenarios where responses from the data sink
    to the data source against request/ notification from the source might be considered
    redundant. This kind of open-loop exchange (with no reverse path from the sink
    to the source) may be desired while updating resources in constrained systems
    looking for maximized throughput with minimized resource consumption. CoAP already
    provides a non-confirmable (NON) mode of exchange where The receiving end-point
    does not respond with ACK. However, the receiving end-point responds the sender
    with a status code indicating "the result of the attempt to understand and satisfy
    the request". This draft introduces a header option: ''No-Response'' to suppress
    responses from the receiver and discusses exemplary use cases which motivated
    this proposition based on real experience. This option also provides granularity
    by allowing suppression of a typical class or a combination of classes of responses.
    This option may be effective for both unicast and multicast scenarios.</p>'
