abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft describes a metric, based on the minimal longest ascendingsubsequence
    (MLAS), which can be used to measure the level ofreorderedness of a given single
    sequence of packets transmitted by onehost and received by a second. This metric
    enables reordering betweensimilar packet flows to be compared across differing
    networktopologies. The draft goes on to provide a set of recommendedparameters
    which can be used when attempting to consistently comparereordering, and highlights
    potential issues which should be taken intoaccount during measurement.</p>"
