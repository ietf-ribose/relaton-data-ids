abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo requires support for Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    in all\n   electronic mail user agents (MUAs) and the servers with which they\n
    \  communicate when using standard protocols, including Interactive\n   Message
    Access Protocol (IMAP), Post Office Protocol (POP) and the\n   variant of the
    Simple Message Transfer Protocol (SMTP) used in\n   message submission.  It also
    requires support for TLS in mail\n   protocol servers provided by electronic mail
    service providers, and\n   encourages mail service providers to migrate to requiring
    TLS for all\n   interaction with their servers.  In addition, this memo details\n
    \  specific recommendations for implementation and use of TLS with\n   electronic
    mail protocols used in interactions between MUAs and mail\n   service providers.\n\n
    \  Use of TLS with SMTP for message relaying is described in a separate\n   document,
    and not in scope for this document.\n\n   The recommendations in this memo do
    not replace the functionality of,\n   and are not intended as a substitute for,
    end-to-end encryption of\n   electronic mail.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
