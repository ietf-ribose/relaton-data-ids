abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This Internet draft describes a number of applications that requireaccurate
    time and/or frequency, and elucidates difficulties relatedto the transfer of high
    quality time and frequency across an IP orMPLS Packet Switched Network. This issue
    is not addressed by anycurrently chartered IETF working group, and we therefore
    propose theformation of a new working group to be called Transmitting Timingover
    IP Connections and Transfer of Clock (TICTOC).</p>"
