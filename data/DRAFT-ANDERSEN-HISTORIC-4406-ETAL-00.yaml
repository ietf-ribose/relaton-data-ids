abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In 2006, two experiments were started for email authentication:\n
    \  Sender Policy Framework (SPF, RFC 4408 [RFC4408]) and Sender ID (RFC\n   4406
    [RFC4406], supported by RFCs 4405 [RFC4405] and 4407 [RFC4407]).\n   After eight
    years of experimental data (RFC 6686 [RFC6686]), it was\n   clear that SPF remained
    in widespread use while Sender ID did not.\n   RFC 7208 [RFC7208] moved SPF from
    Experimental status to Proposed\n   Standard.  This document acknowledges that
    Sender ID did not pass its\n   experiment, and changes the status of RFCs 4405
    [RFC4405], 4406\n   [RFC4406], and 4407 [RFC4407] to Historic.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
