abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies the use of the Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP) for group communication, using UDP/IP multicast as the underlying data
    transport. Both unsecured and secured CoAP group communication are specified.
    Security is achieved by use of the Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful
    Environments (Group OSCORE) protocol. The target application area of this specification
    is any group communication use cases that involve resource- constrained network
    nodes. The most common of such use cases are listed in this document.</p>"
