abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>FMIPv6 aims to achieve seamless handoff but needs (AP-ID, AR-Info)
    in\nPARs to function and can't work if PAR doesn't have an entry for the\nnext
    AP.  In this draft, we present a scheme to dynamically build\n(AP-ID, AR-Info)
    tuple in PAR and make FMIPv6 perform even when PAR\ndoesn't have a suitable (AP-ID,
    AR-Info) tuple by putting LinkID\nprefix in L2 beacon.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
