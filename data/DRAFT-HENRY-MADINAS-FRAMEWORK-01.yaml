abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To limit the association between a device traffic and its user,\n
    \  client vendors have started implementing MAC address rotation.  When\n   such
    rotation happens, some in-network states may break, which may\n   affect network
    efficiency and the user experience.  At the same time,\n   devices may continue
    sending other stable identifiers, defeating the\n   MAC rotation purposes.  This
    document lists various network\n   environements and a set of network services
    that may be affected by\n   such rotation.  This docuemnt then examines settings
    where the user\n   experience may be affected by in-network state disruption,
    and\n   settings where other machine identifiers may expose the user privacy.\n
    \  Last, this document examines solutions to maintain user privacy while\n   preserving
    user quality of experience and network operation\n   efficiency.\n\n\t </p>\n
