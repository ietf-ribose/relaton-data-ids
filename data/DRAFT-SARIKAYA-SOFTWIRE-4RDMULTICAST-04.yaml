abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies 4rd technology's multicast component so
    that IPv4\n   hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4 servers over an IPv6\n
    \  network.  In 4rd encapsulation solution for encapsulation variant of\n   Mapping
    of Address and Port (MAP), MAP-E, IGMP Proxy at the 4rd\n   Customer Edge router
    uses IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel established by MAP-E to\n   exchange IGMP messages to
    establish multicast state at MAP Border\n   Relay so that MAP Border Relay can
    tunnel IPv4 multicast data to IPv4\n   hosts connected to MAP Customer Edge device.
    \ In 4rd Translation\n   Multicast solution for 4rd and translation variant of
    MAP, MAP-T,\n   IGMP messages are translated into MLD messages at the CE router
    which\n   is IGMP/MLD Proxy and sent to the network in IPv6. 4rd Border Relay\n
    \  does the reverse translation and joins IPv4 multicast group for 4rd\n   hosts.
    \ Border Relay as multicast router receives IPv4 multicast data\n   and translates
    the packet into IPv6 multicast data and sends\n   downstream on the multicast
    tree.  Member CEs receive multicast data,\n   translate it back to IPv4 and transmit
    to the hosts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
