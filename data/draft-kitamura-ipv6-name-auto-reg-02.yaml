abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a scheme of 'Domain Name Auto-Registrationfor
    Plugged-in IPv6 Nodes' mechanism that makes it possible toregister both regular
    and inverse domain name information of plugged-in IPv6 nodes to DNS servers automatically.Since
    IPv6 addresses are too long to remember and EUI64-basedaddresses are too complicated
    to remember, there are strongrequirements to use logical names that are easy to
    remember insteadof IPv6 addresses to specify IPv6 nodes and to register domain
    nameinformation of plugged-in IPv6 nodes automatically.In order to meet the requirements,
    a mechanism is proposed as one ofthe IPv6 auto-configuration (plug and play) functions.
    After theAddress Autoconfiguration [ADDR-AUTO] has been executed, it works asa
    succeeding plug and play mechanism.This document clarifies problems that we meet
    when we apply theDynamic Updates in the DNS [DYN-DNS] to automatic domain nameinformation
    registration mechanisms. This document proposes theDomain Name Auto-Registration
    mechanism as a solution to theseproblems.</p>"
