abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SIP networks use signalling monitoring tools to diagnose user\n
    \  reported problem and for regression testing if network or client\n   software
    is upgraded.  As networks grow and become interconnected,\n   including connection
    via transit networks, it becomes impractical to\n   predict the path that SIP
    signalling will take between clients, and\n   therefore impractical to monitor
    SIP signalling end-to-end.\n\n   This draft describes requirements for adding
    an indicator to the SIP\n   protocol which can be used to mark signalling as of
    interest to\n   logging.  Such marking will typically be applied as part of network\n
    \  testing controlled by the network operator and not used in regular\n   client
    signalling.  However, such marking can be carried end-to-end\n   including the
    SIP terminals, even if a session originates and\n   terminates in different networks.\n\n\t
