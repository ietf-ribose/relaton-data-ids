abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Path MTU discovery is vulnerable and IP fragmentation may cause\n
    \  protocol weakness.  Currently, DNS is said to be the biggest user of\n   IP
    fragmentation.  However, it is possible to avoid IP fragmentation\n   in DNS because
    TCP transport and truncation work well.  This document\n   proposes to avoid IP
    fragmentation in DNS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
