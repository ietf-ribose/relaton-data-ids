abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies SIP Certificate Authentication (SCA), a challenge-response
    mechanism that uses public key cryptography to perform certificate-based authentication
    in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based architectures. Performing authentication
    in SIP with certificates will provide stronger authentication capabilities and
    increase possible deployment scenarios in SIP networks. The scope is limited to
    the authentication of the SIP UA to the SIP Service Provider's network. It does
    not include UA to UA authentication within its scope.</p>"
