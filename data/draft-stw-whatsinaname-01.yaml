abstract:
- content: "<p>From time to time, networking protocols need to be able to name things
    used within the protocol, and resolve the names created or referenced. It's common
    for protocol designers in this predicament to attempt to use domain names as the
    starting point for their systems of names, and the DNS as the starting point for
    name resolution. There is existing guidance on how to think about application-specific
    extensions to DNS if the protocol or software designer is re-using both domain
    name abstractions and DNS protocol assumptions (see RFC 6950). However, recently
    there's also a tendency to re-use a domain- name-based namespace without necessarily
    re-using DNS protocol for name resolution. This document acknowledges that class
    of extensions to the shared domain namespace and considers a framework for the
    properties a naming and resolution convention should have in the internet protocol
    environment, including the avoidance of collision with other uses of the namespace.
    Depending to the answers to the suggested questions, the answer may be that domain
    names will not meet the constraints at hand.</p>"
