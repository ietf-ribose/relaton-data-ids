abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a vehicular mobility management scheme
    for\n   IP-based vehicular networks.  The vehicular mobility management\n   scheme
    takes advantage of a vehicular link model based on a multi-\n   link subnet.  With
    a vehicle's mobility information (e.g., position,\n   speed, and direction) and
    navigation path (i.e., trajectory), it can\n   provide a moving vehicle with proactive
    and seamless handoff along\n   with its trajectory.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
