abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>With today's peer-to-peer applications, more and more content
    is\navailable from multiple sources.  In tomorrow's Internet hosts will\nhave
    multiple paths to reach one destination host with the deployment\nof dual-stack
    IPv4/IPv6 hosts, but also with new techniques such as\nshim6 or other locator/identifier
    mechanisms being discussed within\nthe IRTF RRG.  All these hosts will need to
    rank paths in order to\nselect the best paths to reach a given destination/content.
    \ In this\ndraft, we propose an informed path selection service that would be\nqueried
    by hosts and would rank paths based on policies and\nperformance metrics defined
    by the network operator to meet his\ntraffic engineering objectives.  A companion
    document describes a\nprotocol that implements this service.\n\t </p>\n      "
