abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a secure data aggregation scheme based
    on key\n   vector sharing.  New key set is negotiated among sink and sensor\n
    \  nodes, and then each sensor node uses one key in the set to encrypt\n   and
    decrypt sensory data.  A key vector structure is constructed and\n   shared among
    them.  Since the size of the shared key vector structure\n   is constant, the
    transmission overhead is saved in the proposed\n   scheme while security is ensured.
    \ Moreover, MAC integrity mechanism\n   is also included in the proposed scheme.
    \ The recommended scheme\n   reduces the transmitted overhead so as to save the
    energy consumption\n   of each sensor node.Meanwhile, the scheme is data-loss
    resilient.\n   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
