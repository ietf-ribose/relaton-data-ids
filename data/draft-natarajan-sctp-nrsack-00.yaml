abstract:
  content: "<p>Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960] specifiesSelective
    Acknowledgements (SACKs) to allow a transport layer datareceiver to acknowledge
    DATA chunks which arrive out-of-order. InSCTP, SACK information is advisory because
    the data receiver ispermitted to renege; that is, later discard a DATA chunk whichpreviously
    has been SACKed. Since delivery of a SACKed out-of-orderDATA chunk is not guaranteed,
    a copy of this DATA chunk MUST be keptin the data sender's retransmission queue
    until this DATA chunk iscumulatively acked.This document specifies Non-Renegable
    Selective Acknowledgements (NR-SACKs), an extension to SCTP's acknowledgment mechanism.
    NR-SACKsenable a data receiver to explicitly acknowledge out-of-order DATAchunks
    that have been delivered to the receiving application.(Recall that, in SCTP, out-of-order
    data sometimes can be delivered.)NR-SACKs also enable a data receiver to indicate
    any out-of-orderDATA chunks on which the receiver guarantees never to renege.
    Asopposed to SACKed DATA chunks, a sender can consider NR-SACKed DATAchunks as
    never requiring retransmission, thus freeing space in thedata sender's retransmission
    queue sooner.</p>"
