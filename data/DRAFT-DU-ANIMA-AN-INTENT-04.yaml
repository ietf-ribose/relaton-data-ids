abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the goals of autonomic networking is to simplify the\n
    \  management of networks by human operators.  Intent Based Networking\n   (IBN)
    is a possible approach to realize this goal.  With IBN, the\n   operator indicates
    to the network what to do (i.e. her intent) and\n   not how to do it.  In the
    field of Policy Based Management (PBM), the\n   concept of intent is called a
    declarative policy.  This document\n   proposes a refinement of the intent concept
    initially defined in\n   [RFC7575] for autonomic networks by providing a more
    complete\n   definition, a life-cycle, some use cases and a tentative format of\n
    \  the ANIMA Intent Policy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
