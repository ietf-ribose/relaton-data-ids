abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. SR is applicable
    to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This
    document defines procedure for Enhanced Performance Measurement of end-to-end
    SR paths including SR Policies for both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes using Simple
    Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) defined in RFC 8762. The procedure
    allows to improve the scale for number of sessions and failure detection interval.</p>"
