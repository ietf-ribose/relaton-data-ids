abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The 6rd tunnel MTU is currently recommended to be set to 1480.
    \ This\n   is to avoid IPv4 fragmentation within the tunnel, but requires the\n
    \  6rd tunnel ingress interface to drop any IPv6 packet larger than 1480\n   bytes
    and return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) message.  Concerns\n   for operational
    issues with both IPv4 and IPv6 Path MTU Discovery\n   point to the possibility
    of MTU-related black holes when a packet is\n   dropped due to an MTU restriction,
    so dropping packets is considered\n   highly undesirable.  Fortunately, the \"Internet
    cell size\" is 1500\n   bytes, i.e., the minimum MTU configured by the vast majority
    of links\n   in the Internet.  This document therefore presents a method to boost\n
    \  the 6rd MTU to 1500 bytes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
