abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Floor control is a means to manage joint or exclusive access
    to\n   shared resources in a (multiparty) conferencing environment.\n   Thereby,
    floor control complements other functions -- such as\n   conference and media
    session setup, conference policy manipulation,\n   and media control -- that are
    realized by other protocols.\n\n   This document specifies the Binary Floor Control
    Protocol (BFCP).\n   BFCP is used between floor participants and floor control
    servers,\n   and between floor chairs (i.e., moderators) and floor control\n   servers.\n\n
    \  This document obsoletes RFC 4582.  Changes from RFC 4582 are\n   summarized
    in section 16.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
