abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Many common TCP/IP protocols such as DHCP [RFC2131], DNS[RFC1034][RFC1035],
    MADCAP [RFC2730], and LDAP [RFC2251] must beconfigured and maintained by an administrative
    staff. This isunacceptable for emerging networks such as home networks, automobilenetworks,
    airplane networks, or ad hoc networks at conferences,emergency relief stations,
    and many others. Such networks may benothing more than two isolated laptop PCs
    connected via a wirelessLAN. For all these networks, an administrative staff will
    not existand the users of these networks neither have the time nor inclinationto
    learn network administration skills. Instead, these networks needprotocols that
    require zero user configuration and administration.This document is part of an
    effort to define such zero configuration(zeroconf) protocols.Before embarking
    on defining zeroconf protocols, protocolrequirements are needed. This document
    states the zeroconf protocolrequirements for four protocol areas; they are: IP
    interfaceconfiguration, translation between host name and IP address, IPmulticast
    address allocation, and service discovery. This documentdoes not define specific
    protocols, just requirements. Therequirements for these four areas result from
    examining everyday useor scenarios of these protocols.</p>"
