abstract:
- content: "<p>As DDoS attacks evolve rapidly in the aspect of volume and sophistication,
    cooperation among operators has become very necessary because it gives us quicker
    and more sophisticated protection to cope with the varius DDoS attacks. This document
    describes possible mechanisms which implement the cooperative inter-organization
    DDoS protection by DOTS protocol. The described data models are intended to cover
    intra-organization and inter-organization solutions.</p>"
