abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Security Evaluated Standardized Password-
    Authenticated Key Exchange (SESPAKE) protocol. The SESPAKE protocol provides password-authenticated
    key exchange for usage in systems for protection of sensitive information. The
    security proofs of the protocol were made for situations involving an active adversary
    in the channel, including man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks and attacks based on
    the impersonation of one of the subjects.</p>"
