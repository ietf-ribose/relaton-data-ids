abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes open research challenges for network\n
    \  virtualization.  Network virtualization is following a similar path\n   as
    previously taken by cloud computing.  Specifically, cloud\n   computing popularized
    migration of computing functions (e.g.,\n   applications) and storage from local,
    dedicated, physical resources\n   to remote virtual functions accessible through
    the Internet.  In a\n   similar manner, network virtualization is encouraging
    migration of\n   networking functions from dedicated physical hardware nodes to
    a\n   virtualized pool of resources.  However, network virtualization can\n   be
    considered to be a more complex problem than cloud computing as it\n   not only
    involves virtualization of computing and storage functions\n   but also involves
    abstraction of the network itself.  This document\n   describes current research
    and engineering challenges in network\n   virtualization including guaranteeing
    quality-of-service, performance\n   improvement, supporting multiple domains,
    network slicing, service\n   composition, device virtualization, privacy and security,
    separation\n   of control concerns, network function placement and testing.  In\n
    \  addition, some proposals are made for new activities in IETF/IRTF\n   that
    could address some of these challenges.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
