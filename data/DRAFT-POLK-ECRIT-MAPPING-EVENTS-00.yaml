abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Emergency calling is a localized event, requiring a caller
    to place \n   an specially identified local emergency call to a Public Safety
    \n   Answering Point (PSAP), while including the location of the caller \n   in
    that signaling.  The function of routing the set-up messaging to \n   the appropriate
    PSAP is performed by a mapping function that binds a\n   given location with one
    or more PSAP SIP(S)-URIs.  This function is \n   done by the ECRIT mapping protocol.
    \ This document analyzes when the\n   ECRIT mapping protocol function can occur,
    and what general \n   components are involved in that mapping.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
