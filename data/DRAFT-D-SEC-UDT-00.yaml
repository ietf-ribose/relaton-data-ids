abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>UDT does not have its specific security mechanism. It depends
    \n   on the application to provide authentication and lower layer to \n   provide
    security mechanisms[GG07]. However, UDT implementations     \n   should check
    each arrived packets are from the expected source, \n   since UDP is connectionless.
    \n\n   This document proposes evaluation of security requirements for UDT, \n
    \  or UDP based Data Transfer considered as an alternative data transfer \n   protocol
    for the situation when TCP does  not work well.The objective\n   is to achieve
    a wide  class of security methods used on existing mature protocols such as UDP
    and TCP.\n\t </p>\n      "
