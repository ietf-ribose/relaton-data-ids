abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many service providers offer \"BGP/MPLS IP VPN\" service to
    their\n   customers.  Existing IETF standards specify the procedures and\n   protocols
    that a service provider uses in order to offer this service\n   to customers who
    have IP unicast and IP multicast traffic in their\n   VPNs.  It is also desirable
    to be able to support customers who have\n   MPLS multicast traffic in their VPNs.
    \ This document specifies the\n   procedures and protocol extensions that are
    needed to support\n   customers who use the Multicast Extensions to Label Distribution\n
    \  Protocol (mLDP) as the control protocol for their MPLS multicast\n   traffic.
    \ Existing standards do provide some support for customers\n   who use mLDP, but
    only under a restrictive set of circumstances.\n   This document generalizes the
    existing support to include all cases\n   where the customer uses mLDP, without
    any restrictions.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
