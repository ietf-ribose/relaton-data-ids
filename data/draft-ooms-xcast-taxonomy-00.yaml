abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Recently several multicast mechanisms were proposed that scale betterwith
    the number of multicast sessions than traditional multicast does(DCM [BLAZ], SGM
    [BOIV], Somecast [HELD], MDO6 [IMAI], CLM [OOMS],ERM [SHAN], REUNITE [STOI]).
    These proposals are also known asExplict Multicast (xcast; explicit list of destinations)
    or SmallGroup Multicast (sgm; the main application being few-to-fewcommunication).
    To stimulate and streamline the discussion thisdraft is an attempt to make a taxonomy
    of these mechanisms.</p>"
