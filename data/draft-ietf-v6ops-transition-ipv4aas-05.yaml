abstract:
  content: <p>This document specifies the IPv4 service continuity requirements for
    an IPv6 Customer Edge (CE) router, either provided by the service provider or
    thru the retail market. Specifically, this document extends the "Basic Requirements
    for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers" in order to allow the provisioning of IPv6 transition
    services for the support of "IPv4 as-a-Service" (IPv4aaS) by means of new transition
    mechanisms. The document only covers transition technologies for delivering IPv4
    in IPv6-only access networks, commonly called "IPv4 as-a-Service" (IPv4aaS), as
    required in a world where IPv4 addresses are no longer available, so hosts in
    the customer LANs with IPv4-only or IPv6-only applications or devices, requiring
    to communicate with IPv4-only services at the Internet, are still able to do so.</p>
