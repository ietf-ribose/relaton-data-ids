abstract:
- content: "<p>{ Work in progress to update the OpenPGP specification from RFC4880
    } This document is maintained in order to publish all necessary information needed
    to develop interoperable applications based on the OpenPGP format. It is not a
    step-by-step cookbook for writing an application. It describes only the format
    and methods needed to read, check, generate, and write conforming packets crossing
    any network. It does not deal with storage and implementation questions. It does,
    however, discuss implementation issues necessary to avoid security flaws. OpenPGP
    software uses a combination of strong public-key and symmetric cryptography to
    provide security services for electronic communications and data storage. These
    services include confidentiality, key management, authentication, and digital
    signatures. This document specifies the message formats used in OpenPGP.</p>"
