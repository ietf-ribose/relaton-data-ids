abstract:
  content: "<p>It used to be reasonable to expect that any two points connected tothe
    Internet to have the ability to hold any communication. Such anexpectation has
    not be reasonable for quite some time, thanks tofirewalls, NATs, and other intermediate
    devices. Today, weacknowledge a new architecture and we name the functional blocks
    ofthat architecture as well as several ways to get ends to communicate,and how
    two devices could expect to communicate with each other.This document does not
    define the protocols involved.</p>"
