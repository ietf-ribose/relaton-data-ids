abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a protocol independent encoding for
    flow\n   characteristics (a.k.a. metadata).  A flow is defined as a set of IP\n
    \  packets passing through a network in a given direction.  All packets\n   belonging
    to a particular flow have a set of common properties (e.g.\n   IP, port, transport).
    \ Flow metadata exposes key characteristics of\n   the flow such as the originating
    application, the type of media in\n   use (e.g.  audio, video) and others as defined
    in\n   [I-D.eckert-intarea-flow-metadata-framework].  The flow\n   characteristics
    are expressed in terms of information elements.\n   These information elements
    are signaled either out of band or in band\n   but always along the same path
    of the flow associated with the\n   application.\n\n   [I-D.eckert-intarea-flow-metadata-framework]
    defines the overall\n   framework for flow metadata and the definition of the
    flow\n   characteristics, whereas this document captures the encoding of these\n
    \  characteristics.  The mapping of flow metadata encoding to different\n   signaling
    protocols is outside the scope of this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
