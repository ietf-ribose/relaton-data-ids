abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an extended Objective Function(OF) that\n
    \  balances the number of children nodes of the parent nodes to avoid\n   the
    overloading problem and ensure node lifetime maximization in the\n   IPv6 Routing
    Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The\n   standard OFs are used
    to build a Destination Oriented Directed\n   Acyclic Graph (DODAG) where the bottleneck
    nodes may suffer from\n   unbalanced traffic load. As a result, a part of the
    network may be\n   disconnected as the energy of the overloaded preferred parent
    node\n   will drain much faster than other candidate parents. Thus, a new RPL\n
    \  metric has been introduced to balance the traffic load over the\n   network.
    \ The potential extra overhead has been mitigated using a new\n   utilization
    technique. Finally, the proposed OF amends the DODAG\n   Information Object (DIO)
    message format.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
