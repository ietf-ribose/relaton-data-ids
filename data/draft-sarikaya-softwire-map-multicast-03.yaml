abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies multicast component for MAP-E and Light Weight
    4over6 so that IPv4 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4 servers over an
    IPv6 network. Two types of solutions are developed, encapsulation and translation.
    In the encapsulation solution for MAP-E and lw4o6, IGMP Proxy at the MAP-E Customer
    Edge router/lwB4 uses IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel to exchange IGMP messages to establish
    multicast state at MAP-E Border Relay/lwAFTR so that MAP-E Border Relay/lwAFTR
    can tunnel IPv4 multicast data to IPv4 hosts. In the Translation Multicast solution
    for MAP-T, 4rd and lw4o6, IGMP messages are translated into MLD messages and sent
    to the network in IPv6. MAP-T/4rd Border Relay/lwAFTR does the reverse translation
    and joins IPv4 multicast group for the hosts. Border Relay/lwAFTR as multicast
    router receives IPv4 multicast data and translates the packet into IPv6 multicast
    data and sends downstream on the multicast tree. Member CEs/lwB4s receive multicast
    data, translate it back to IPv4 and transmit to the hosts.</p>"
