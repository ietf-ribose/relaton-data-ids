abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines textual conventions for the constants used
    in\nMIBs for the IPsec protocols.  In particular, it documents those\nnumbers
    whose assignments are managed by the IANA, with new\nassignments being made over
    time.  The textual conventions provide\nIPsec-related MIBs with clearer documentation,
    and insulate them from\nhaving to track new assignments by the IANA.\nThe MIB
    documented by this document will become a separate living\ndocument maintained
    by the IANA, and will be the document of record\nfor these assignments.\n\t </p>\n
