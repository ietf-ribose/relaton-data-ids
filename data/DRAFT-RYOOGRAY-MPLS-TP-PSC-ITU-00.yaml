abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document contains the updates to [RFC6378], \"MPLS Transport\n
    \  Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection\", in an effort to satisfy the\n   ITU-T's
    protection switching requirements.  The following\n   capabilities are required
    by ITU-T and described in this documents:\n   priority modification, modification
    of non-revertive behavior,\n   support of Manual Switch to Working (MS-W) command,
    support of\n   protection against Signal Degrade (SD), and support of Exercise\n
    \  command.  The behavior described in [RFC6378] are modified in order\n   to
    preserve the network operation behavior to which network operators\n   have become
    accustomed.\n\n   This document introduces capabilities and modes to PSC.  A capability\n
    \  is an individual behavior, and a node's set of capabilities are\n   signalled
    using the method given in this document.  A mode is a\n   particular combination
    of capabilities.\n\n   This document describes the behavior of the Protection
    State\n   Coordination (PSC) protocol including priority logic and state\n   machine
    when all of the aforementioned capabilities are enabled.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
