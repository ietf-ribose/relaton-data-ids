abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The GEOPRIV Working Group previously specified how to use an
    IP\n   address and port number to request a location based on an individual\n
    \  packet flow.\n\n   However certain kinds of NAT require that identifiers for
    both ends\n   of the packet flow must be specified in order to unambiguously\n
    \  satisfy the location request.\n\n   This document specifieds a Flow Identity
    Extension for the HTTP-\n   Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) Protocol to support
    this\n   requirement.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
