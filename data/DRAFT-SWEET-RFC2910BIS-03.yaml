abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is one of a set of documents, which together
    describe\n   all aspects of a new Internet Printing Protocol (IPP).  IPP is an\n
    \  application level protocol that can be used for distributed printing\n   using
    Internet tools and technologies.  This document defines the\n   rules for encoding
    IPP operations and IPP attributes into a new\n   Internet mime media type called
    \"application/ipp\".  This document\n   also defines the rules for transporting
    over HTTP a message body\n   whose Content-Type is \"application/ipp\".  This
    document defines a new\n   scheme named 'ipp' for identifying IPP printers and
    jobs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
