abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple networks,
    e.g. Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, and DSL. It is desirable to combine them seamlessly to improve
    quality of experience. Such optimization requires additional control information,
    e.g. Sequence Number, in each (IP) data packet. This document presents a new light-weight
    and flexible encapsulation protocol for this need. The solution has been developed
    by the authors based on their experiences in multiple standards bodies including
    the IETF and 3GPP, is not an Internet Standard and does not represent the consensus
    opinion of the IETF. This document will enable other developers to build interoperable
    implementations.</p>"
