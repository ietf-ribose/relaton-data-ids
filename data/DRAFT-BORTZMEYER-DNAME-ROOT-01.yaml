abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This documents asks IANA to add DNAME records in the DNS root
    for\n   TLDs which are in the Special-Use Domain Names registry, in order to\n
    \  ensure they receive an appropriate reply (NXDOMAIN) and that the root\n   is
    not too bothered by them.\n\n   REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: there is no obvious
    place to discuss this\n   document.  May be the IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) group,
    through its\n   mailing list (the author reads it).  Or may AS112 operators mailing\n
    \  lists?  The source of the document, as well as a list of open issues,\n   is
    currently kept at Github [1].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
