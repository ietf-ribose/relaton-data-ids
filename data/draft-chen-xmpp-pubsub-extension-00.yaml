abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines extensions to pubsub features of the Extensible Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (XMPP) that will address issues encountered by a long-lived
    TCP connection in mobile environments. Network resources consumption issues are
    happenned when there are frequent notification messages have been transmitted
    periodically. Depending on raised issues, the extension for XMPP pubsub protocol
    could be considered to optimize network quality.</p>"
