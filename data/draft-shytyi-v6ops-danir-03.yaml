abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a description of the implementation of Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol version 6 Prefix Delegation, Neighbour Discovery Protocol
    and of the use of the Packet Data Protocol in an Internet of Things Router. This
    Internet of Things Router is connected on a cellular network; it is a DHCPv6-PD
    Client and it requests a /56 pool of prefixes from the server; the DHCPv6-PD server
    is placed in the PGW and is a part of the cellular infrastructure. After the pool
    of prefixes is delegated, the Internet of Things Router derives sub-prefixes from
    the prefix pool; each one of these sub-prefixes is aimed at one ingress interface.
    After the Internet of Things Router finishes the network prefix assignment procedure,
    it advertises the network prefixes on the ingress links by using the Neighbour
    Discovery protocol. Finally, when Hosts receive the sub-prefixes via Router Adverticement
    messages, they configure the Global Unique Address with the Stateless Address
    Auto-configuration protocol.</p>"
