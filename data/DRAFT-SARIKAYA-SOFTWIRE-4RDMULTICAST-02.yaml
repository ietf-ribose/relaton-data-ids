abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies 4rd technology's multicast component so
    that IPv4\n   hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4 servers over an IPv6\n
    \  network.  In 4rd Translation Multicast solution, IGMP messages are\n   translated
    into MLD messages at the CE router which is IGMP/MLD Proxy\n   and sent to the
    network in IPv6. 4rd Border Relay does the reverse\n   translation and joins IPv4
    multicast group for 4rd hosts.  Border\n   Relay as multicast router receives
    IPv4 multicast data and translates\n   the packet into IPv6 multicast data using
    4rd-U and sends downstream\n   on the multicast tree.  Member CEs receive multicast
    data, translate\n   it back to IPv4 and transmit to the hosts.  In AMT based\n
    \  encapsulation solution, AMT Gateway at the 4rd Customer Edge router\n   uses
    AMT protocol to establish a tunnel interface with AMT Relay at\n   the 4rd Border
    Relay and this tunnel is used to exchange IGMP\n   messages to establish multicast
    state at AMT Relay so that AMT Relay\n   can tunnel IPv4 multicast data to IPv4
    hosts connected to AMT\n   Gateway.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
