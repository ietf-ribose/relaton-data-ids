abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 7970 [RFC7970] provides XML-based data representation on
    incident\n   information, but the use of the IODEF data model is not limited to\n
    \  XML.  JSON representation is sometimes preferred since it is easy to\n   handle
    from certain programming environments.  This draft represents\n   the IODEF data
    model in JSON.  Note that this 00 version draft is\n   prepared for the purpose
    of encouraging discussion on the need for\n   JSON representation.\n\n\t </p>\n
