abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This  memo  discusses and proposes a framework for the development
    of IP\nperformance benchmarking methodologies in the case of systems under test\n(SUT)
    running IETF routing protocols.  The intent of this document is to\nfacilitate
    the use of existing metrics developed by the BMWG  and  other\nworking   groups.
    \  This  will  be  accomplished  by  specifying  router\nconfiguration and state
    parameters and characterizing their effect on IP\npacket forwarding in terms of
    these existing metrics.  The terms defined\nin this memo will be used in addition
    to terms  defined  in  RFCs  1242,\n2285,  and  2544  and  2761.  This memo is
    a product of the Benchmarking\nMethodology Working Group (BMWG) of the Internet
    Engineering Task  Force\n(IETF).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
