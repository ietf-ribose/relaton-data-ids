abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document reports the results of an ADD-PATH implementation\n
    \  survey.  The survey had 22 questions about implementations' support\n   for
    advertising multiple paths in BGP.  After a brief summary of the\n   results,
    each response is listed.  This document contains responses\n   from six implementers
    who completed the survey.\n\n   The editor did not use external means to verify
    the accuracy of the\n   information submitted by the respondents.  The respondents
    are\n   considered experts on the products they reported on.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
