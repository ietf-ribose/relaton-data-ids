abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC5309] defines the Point-to-Point (P2P) circuit type, one of the
    two circuit types used in the link state routing protocols, and highlights that
    it is important to identify the correct circuit type when forming adjacencies,
    flooding link state database packets, and monitoring the link state. The P2P interface
    over LAN ifType value 303, has been assigned by IANA Expert Review, and this document
    requests IANA to add this document as a reference to ifType 303. This document
    provides advice about the ifStack for the P2P interface over LAN ifType to facilitate
    operational control, maintenance and statistics.</p>"
