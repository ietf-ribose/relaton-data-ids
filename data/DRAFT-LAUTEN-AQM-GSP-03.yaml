abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The congestion avoidance processes of transmission capacity
    sharing\n   TCP flows tend to be synchronized among each other, so that the rate\n
    \  variations of the individual flows do not compensate. In contrary,\n   they
    accumulate into large variations of the whole aggregate. The\n   effect is known
    as global synchronization. Large queuing buffer\n   demand and large latency and
    jitter are the consequences. Global\n   Synchronization Protection (GSP) is an
    extension of regular tail drop\n   packet queuing schemes that prevents global
    synchronization. For\n   large traffic aggregates the de-correlation between the
    individual\n   flow variations reduces buffer demand and packet sojourn time by
    an\n   order of magnitude and more. Even though quite simple, the solution\n   has
    a theoretical background and is not heuristic. It has been tested\n   with a Linux
    kernel implementation and shows equivalent performance\n   as other relevant AQM
    schemes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
