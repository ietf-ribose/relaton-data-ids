abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the use of the HMAC algorithm in conjunctionwith
    the SHA-256 algorithm as an experimental authentication mecha-nism within the
    context of the IPsec AH and ESP protocols. This algo-rithm is intended to provide
    data origin authentication and integrityprotection. Given the current lack of
    practical experience withSHA-256, implementations based on this document will
    be experimentalin nature, and implementation is not required in order to claim
    com-pliance with the IPsec proposed standards. The version of the HMAC-SHA-256
    authenticator described in this document specifies truncationto 128 bits, and
    is therefore named HMAC-SHA-256-128.</p>"
