abstract:
- content: "<p>When the Public-Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Working Group
    was chartered, an object identifier arc was allocated by IANA for use by that
    working group. RFC 7299 describes the object identifiers that were assigned in
    that arc. A small number of object identifiers that were assigned in RFC 4212
    are not included in RFC 7299, and this document corrects that oversight.</p>"
