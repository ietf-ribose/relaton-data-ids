abstract:
- content: "<p>This document imposes a new requirement on Label Edge Routers (LER)
    specifying that when determining whether to MPLS encapsulate an IP packet, the
    determination is made independent of any IP options that may be carried in the
    IP packet header. Lack of a formal standard may result in a different forwarding
    behavior for different IP packets associated with the same prefix-based Forwarding
    Equivalence Class (FEC). While an IP packet with either a specific option type
    or no header option may follow the MPLS label switched path (LSP) associated with
    a prefix-based FEC, an IP packet with a different option type but associated with
    the same prefix-based FEC may bypass MPLS encapsulation and instead be IP routed
    downstream. IP option packets that fail to be MPLS encapsulated simply due to
    their header options present a security risk against the MPLS infrastructure.</p>"
