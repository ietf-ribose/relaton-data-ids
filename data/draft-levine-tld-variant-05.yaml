abstract:
- content: <p>Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) provides a method
    to map a subset of names written in Unicode into the DNS. Because of Unicode decisions,
    appearance, language and writing system conventions, and historical reasons, it
    often has been asserted that there is more than one way to write what competent
    readers and writers think of as the same host name; the different ways of writing
    are often called "variants". This document surveys the approaches that top level
    domains have taken to the registration and provisioning of domain names that have
    variants. This document is not a product of the IETF, does not propose any method
    to make variants work "correctly", and is not an introduction to internationalization
    or IDNA.</p>
