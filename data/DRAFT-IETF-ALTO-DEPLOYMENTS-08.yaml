abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many Internet applications are used to access resources such
    as\n   pieces of information or server processes that are available in\n   several
    equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but\n   is not limited
    to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal\n   of Application-Layer
    Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide\n   guidance to applications that have
    to select one or several hosts\n   from a set of candidates, which are able to
    provide a desired\n   resource.  This memo discusses deployment related issues
    of ALTO.  It\n   addresses different use cases of ALTO such as peer-to-peer file\n
    \  sharing and CDNs, security considerations, recommendations for\n   network
    administrators, and also guidance for application designers\n   using ALTO.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
