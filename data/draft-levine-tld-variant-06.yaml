abstract:
- content: <p>Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) provides a method
    to map a subset of names written in Unicode into the DNS. Because of Unicode decisions,
    appearance, language and writing system conventions, and historical reasons, it
    often has been asserted that there is more than one way to write what competent
    readers and writers think of as the same host name; these different ways of writing
    are often called "variants". (The authors note that there are many conflicting
    definitions for the term "variant" in the IDNA community.) This document surveys
    the approaches that top-level domains have taken to the registration and provisioning
    of domain names that have variants. This document is not a product of the IETF,
    does not propose any method to make variants work "correctly", and is not an introduction
    to internationalization or IDNA.</p>
