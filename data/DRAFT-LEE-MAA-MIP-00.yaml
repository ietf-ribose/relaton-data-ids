abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>While it is a necessary feature that the home agent tunnels\nmulticast
    packets to mobile nodes away from home, it can cause\nsevere network congestion
    on the forward path between the home\nagent and the care-of address nodes, because
    of the unicast\ntunneling of multicast packets. Multicast avalanche avoidance
    in\nMobile IP (MAAMIP) is designed to avoid the network congestion by\nusing of
    Explicit multicast tunneling. Explicit multicast tunneling\nin Mobile IP enables
    avoidance of network congestion and realizes\nthe true bandwidth saving, which
    is the primitive goal of\nmulticast.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
