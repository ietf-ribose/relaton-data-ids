abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CLUE protocol is an application protocol conceived for
    the\n   description and negotiation of a CLUE telepresence session.  The\n   design
    of the CLUE protocol takes into account the requirements and\n   the framework
    defined, respectively, in [I-D.ietf-clue-framework] and\n   [RFC7262].  The companion
    document [I-D.ietf-clue-signaling] delves\n   into CLUE signaling details, as
    well as on the SIP/SDP session\n   establishment phase.  CLUE messages flow upon
    the CLUE data channel,\n   based on reliable and ordered SCTP over DTLS transport,
    as described\n   in [I-D.ietf-clue-datachannel].  Message details, together with
    the\n   behavior of CLUE Participants acting as Media Providers and/or Media\n
    \  Consumers, are herein discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
