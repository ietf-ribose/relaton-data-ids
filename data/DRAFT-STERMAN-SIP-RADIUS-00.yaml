abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document examines the proposal for a SIP extension to allow
    \nauthentication of a user-agent through a proxy to a RADIUS server \nusing CHAP
    put forward by Byerly and Williams [BYERLY]. An \nalternative method is offered
    which does not require any changes to \nthe SIP protocol as defined in [SIP].
    It also will not require any \nmodification to the way RADIUS clients communicate
    with RADIUS\nServers [RADIUS], although it will change the way some of the\nfields
    are interpreted by the RADIUS server.\n\t </p>\n      "
