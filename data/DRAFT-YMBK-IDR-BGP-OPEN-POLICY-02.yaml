abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Route Leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes which violate\n
    \  assumptions of BGP topology relationships; e.g. passing a route\n   learned
    from one peer to another peer or to a transit provider,\n   passing a route learned
    from one transit provider to another transit\n   provider or to a peer.  Today,
    approaches to leak prevention rely on\n   marking routes according to operator
    configuration options without\n   any check that the configuration corresponds
    to that of the BGP\n   neighbor, or enforcement that the two BGP speakers agree
    on the\n   relationship.  This document enhances BGP Open to establish agreement\n
    \  of the (peer, customer, provider, internal) relationship of two\n   neighboring
    BGP speakers to enforce appropriate configuration on both\n   sides.  Propagated
    routes are then marked with a eOTC and iOTC\n   attributes according to agreed
    relationship allowing prevention and\n   detection of route leaks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
