abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Threshold Secret Sharing (TSS) provides a way to generate N sharesfrom
    a value, so that any M of those shares can be used toreconstruct the original
    value, but any M-1 shares provide noinformation about that value. This method
    can provide shared accesscontrol on key material and other secrets that must be
    stronglyprotected.This note defines a threshold secret sharing method based onpolynomial
    interpolation in GF(256) and a format for the storage andtransmission of shares.
    It also provides usage guidance, describeshow to test an implementation, and supplies
    test cases.</p>"
