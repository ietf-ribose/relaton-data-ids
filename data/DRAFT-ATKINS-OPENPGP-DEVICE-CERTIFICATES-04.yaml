abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The OpenPGP Message Formats defined in RFC 4880 specify packet\n
    \  formats and methods for combining those packets to form messages and\n   certificates.
    \ However RFC 4880 made an architectural decision that\n   keys are owned by users
    and must be self-certified.  New use cases\n   have emerged where that is not
    the case.  There is a desire to have\n   certificates that are not tied to a user
    (e.g. device certificates)\n   which may only have encryption keys so may not
    be self certifiable.\n   Moreover, devices might be space constrained so reducing
    size is\n   important.  This draft specifies extensions to (and updates) RFC 4880\n
    \  that loosen the definitions of certificates in order to enable\n   userless
    certificates without self-certifications and specifies a set\n   of notations
    to enable compact device certifications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
