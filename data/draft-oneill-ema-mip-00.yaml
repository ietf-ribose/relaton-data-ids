abstract:
- content: "<p>It is well recognised by all micro and macro-mobility routing protocols
    that Mobile IP (MIP) is likely to be used to support inter-domain mobility. It
    is also widely accepted that Mobile IP could be used as the basis for signalling
    between the mobile and the micro-mobility domains for simplicity of the mobile
    terminal and interoperability purposes. The Edge Mobility Architecture (EMA) defines
    a generic IP hand-over model which operates in conjunction with a Mobility Enhanced
    Routing (MER) protocol to provide large- scale, intra-domain, IP address mobility.
    The aim of this document is to describe the minimum MIP signalling requirements
    for EMA:MER, and to propose additional changes necessary to [MIPv6] and [MIPv4]
    for them to support EMA:MER. The document deals with mobiles moving inside and
    between EMA:MER domains as well as coming and going from/to non-EMA:MER domains,
    demonstrating EMA/MIP interoperability and inter-domain hand-overs. The document
    also demonstrates the benefits a mobile and an operator will see when a mobile
    host is within an EMA domain.</p>"
