abstract:
  content: "<p>It is well recognised by all micro and macro-mobility routingprotocols
    that Mobile IP (MIP) is likely to be used to supportinter-domain mobility. It
    is also widely accepted that Mobile IPcould be used as the basis for signalling
    between the mobile and themicro-mobility domains for simplicity of the mobile
    terminal andinteroperability purposes. The Edge Mobility Architecture (EMA)defines
    a generic IP hand-over model which operates in conjunctionwith a Mobility Enhanced
    Routing (MER) protocol to provide large-scale, intra-domain, IP address mobility.
    The aim of this documentis to describe the minimum MIP signalling requirements
    for EMA:MER,and to propose additional changes necessary to [MIPv6] and [MIPv4]for
    them to support EMA:MER. The document deals with mobiles movinginside and between
    EMA:MER domains as well as coming and goingfrom/to non-EMA:MER domains, demonstrating
    EMA/MIP interoperabilityand inter-domain hand-overs. The document also demonstrates
    thebenefits a mobile and an operator will see when a mobile host iswithin an EMA
    domain.</p>"
