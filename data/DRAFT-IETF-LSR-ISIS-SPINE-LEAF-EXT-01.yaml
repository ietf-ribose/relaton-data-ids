abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for routers and switches
    in a\n   Spine-Leaf type topology to have non-reciprocal Intermediate System\n
    \  to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing relationships between the\n   leafs
    and spines.  The leaf nodes do not need to have the topology\n   information of
    other nodes and exact prefixes in the network.  This\n   extension also has application
    in the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
