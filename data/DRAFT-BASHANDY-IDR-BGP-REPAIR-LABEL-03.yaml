abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the provider edge BGP\nspeakers
    PE1, PE2,..., PEn know about a prefix P/p via the external\nrouters CE1, CE2,...,
    CEm.  If the PE router PEi loses connectivity to\nthe primary path, it is desirable
    to immediately restore traffic by\nrerouting packets arriving from the core to
    PEi and destined to the\nprefix P/p to one of the other PE routers that advertised
    P/p, say PEj,\nuntil BGP re-converges. However if the loss of connectivity of
    PEi to\nthe primary path also resulted in the loss of connectivity between PEj\nand
    CEj, rerouting a packet before the control plane converges may\nresult in a loop.
    In this document, we propose using a repair label for\ntraffic restoration while
    avoiding loops. We propose advertising the\n\"repair\" label through BGP.\n\n\t
