abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model for configuring and managing
    locally generated routes in a vendor-neutral way and based on operational best
    practice. Locally generated routes are those created by configuration, rather
    than by dynamic routing protocols. Such routes include static routes, locally
    created aggregate routes for reducing the number of constituent routes that must
    be advertised, summary routes for IGPs, etc.</p>"
