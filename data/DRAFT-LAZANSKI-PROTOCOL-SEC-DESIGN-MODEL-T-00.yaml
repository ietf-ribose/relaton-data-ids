abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  This document is a non-exhaustive set of considerations for
    protocol\n  designers and implementers with regards to attack defence. These\n
    \ considerations can be used as an aid to analyse protocol design\n  choice and
    in turn to help combat threats and defend users of these\n  protocols and systems
    against malicious attacks.\n\n  First, we list well-known classes of attacks that
    pose threats, with\n  relevant case studies and descriptions. Next, we give a
    list of\n  defence measures against these attacks to be considered when\n  designing
    and deploying protocols. Naturally, deployments of\n  protocols vary greatly between
    use cases; therefore, some attacks and\n  defensive measures outlined may require
    more consideration than\n  others, dependent on use case.\n\n  This RFC can be
    used by protocol designers to write the Security\n  Considerations section in
    an RFC. The impact on attack defence of a\n  protocol should be considered in
    multiple use cases across the\n  multiple layers of the internet in its this section.
    Defence against\n  malicious attacks can be improved and it can be weakened by
    design\n  features of protocols. Designers should acknowledge the role of\n  protocols
    in attack prevention, detection and mitigation; this\n  document aims to be a
    useful guide in doing so.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
