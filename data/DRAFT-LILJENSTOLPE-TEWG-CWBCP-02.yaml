abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is in response to a request made by the Traffic\nEngineering
    Working Group for a set of traffic engineering practices\nfrom a sample of the
    ISP engineering community.  It reflects the\ncurrent traffic engineering principles
    and practices that Cable &amp;\nWireless uses for its global 'packet' networks
    (including IP and\nMPLS) at the time of publication.  It will also identify some
    of the\nhistory that has lead to the specific principles and practices as\nwell
    as some of the trade-offs between these methods and other\npossible approaches.
    \ It is not intended to be a detailed engineering\nguide or 'how-to' document.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
