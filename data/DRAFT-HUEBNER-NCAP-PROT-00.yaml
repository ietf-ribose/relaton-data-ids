abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document outlines the protocol used by the NetIQ Common\nAgent
    as part of its NetIQ Common Agent Protocol (NCAP).  This binary\nprotocol is used
    over standard TCP sockets and provides both \nreal-time event delivery and common
    RPC services to the NetIQ\nCommon Agent Framework.  These messages may be encrypted
    via SSL \nbased on the handshake received during intial negotiation.  \nMessages
    consist primarily of a standardized header and a \nvariable-length body.\n\nBoth
    message header and content are stored in sender-native form,\npursuant to a reader-makes-right
    data flow.\n\t </p>\n      "
