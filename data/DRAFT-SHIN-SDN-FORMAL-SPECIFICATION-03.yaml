abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses formally verifiable networking framework
    for\n   software-defined networks (SDN). In SDN, incomplete or malicious\n   programmable
    entities could cause break-down of underlying networks\n   shared by heterogeneous
    devices and stake-holders. Formally\n   verifiable networking can provide a logic-based
    framework to unify\n   the design, specification, verification, and implementation
    of SDN.\n   This framework describes formal specification and verification\n   process
    for SDN. In addition, we present two examples of formal\n   specification for
    a part of SDN using a process algebra called\n   Algebra of Communicating Shard
    Resources (ACSR) and Z specification\n   languages.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
