abstract:
  content: "<p>CUBIC is an extension to the current TCP standards. The protocoldiffers
    from the current TCP standards only in the congestion windowadjustment function
    in the sender side. In particular, it uses acubic function instead of a linear
    window increase of the current TCPstandards to improve scalability and stability
    under fast and longdistance networks. BIC-TCP, a predecessor of CUBIC, has been
    adefault TCP adopted by Linux since year 2005 and has already beendeployed globally
    and in use for several years by the Internetcommunity at large. CUBIC is using
    a similar window growth functionas BIC-TCP and is designed to be less aggressive
    and fairer to TCP inbandwidth usage than BIC-TCP while maintaining the strengths
    of BIC-TCP such as stability, window scalability and RTT fairness. Throughextensive
    testing in various Internet scenarios, we believe thatCUBIC is safe for deployment
    and testing in the global Internet. Theintent of this document is to provide the
    protocol specification ofCUBIC for a third party implementation and solicit the
    communityfeedback through experimentation on the performance of CUBIC. Weexpect
    this document to be eventually published as an experimentalRFC.</p>"
