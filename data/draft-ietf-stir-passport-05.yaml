abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a token format for verifying with non- repudiation
    the sender of and authorization to send information related to the originator
    of personal communications. A cryptographic signature is defined to protect the
    integrity of the information used to identify the originator of a personal communications
    session (e.g. the telephone number or URI) and verify the accuracy of this information
    at the destination. The cryptographic signature is defined with the intention
    that it can confidently verify the originating persona even when the signature
    is sent to the destination party over an unsecure channel. The Persona Assertion
    Token (PASSporT) is particularly useful for many personal communications applications
    over IP networks and other multi-hop interconnection scenarios where the originating
    and destination parties may not have a direct trusted relationship.</p>"
