abstract:
- content: "<p>NAT devices are required to log events like creation and deletion of
    translations and information about the resources the NAT is managing. The logs
    are required to identify an attacker or a host that was used to launch malicious
    attacks, and for various other purposes of accounting and management. Since there
    is no standard way of logging this information, different NAT devices behave differently.
    The lack of a consistent way makes it difficult to write the collector applications
    that would receive this data and process it to present useful information. This
    document describes the information that is required to be logged by the NAT devices.
    It goes on to standardize formats for reporting these events and parameters using
    SYSLOG (RFC 5424). A companion document specifies formats for reporting the same
    events and parameters using IPFIX (RFC 7011). Applicability statements are provided
    in this document and its companion to guide operators and implementors in their
    choice of which technology to use for logging.</p>"
