abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a new framework for the transport of IPDatagrams
    over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). The MPEG-2 TS hasbeen widely accepted
    not only for providing digital TV services, butalso as a subnetwork technology
    for building IP networks. Examplesof systems using MPEG-2 include the Digital
    Video Broadcast (DVB)and Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) Standards
    forDigital Television. The document identifies the need for a set of Internet
    standardsdefining the interface between the MPEG-2 Transport Stream and an IPsubnetwork.
    It suggests a new encapsulation method for IP datagrams,and proposes protocols
    to perform IPv6/IPv4 address resolution, toassociate IP packets with the properties
    of the Logical Channelsprovided by an MPEG-2 TS.</p>"
