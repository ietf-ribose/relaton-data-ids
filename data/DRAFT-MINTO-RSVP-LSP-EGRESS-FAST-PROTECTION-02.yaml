abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC4090 defines a fast reroute mechanism for locally repairing
    an\n   RSVP-TE LSP in the order of 10s of milliseconds, in the event of a\n   downstream
    link or node failure.  However, this mechanism does not\n   provide node protection
    for LSP egress nodes, even when an alternate\n   egress node (a backup egress)
    is available that could carry the\n   traffic to its ultimate destination.  This
    document addresses this\n   scenario and describes how to provide egress protection
    by\n   establishing a bypass LSP from the penultimate-hop node of a LSP to\n   the
    backup egress node.  The methods described in this document\n   enable local repair
    in the order of 10s of milliseconds, in the event\n   of the egress node failure.
    \ These methods are only applicable if\n   traffic carried by the LSP can be rerouted
    to its ultimate\n   destination by the backup egress node.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
