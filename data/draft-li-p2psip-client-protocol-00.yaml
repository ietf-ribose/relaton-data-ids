abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document presents the motivation, design guidelines and highlevel
    descriptions of peer-to-peer session initiation protocol(P2PSIP) client protocol,
    which is spoken between P2PSIP peers andP2PSIP clients. In this document, the
    necessity of P2PSIP Client isidentified firstly. Then, two fundamental guidelines
    for our designare explained in details. Following these guidelines, the design
    ofproposed protocol and new extensions to existing SIP (sessioninitiation protocol)
    are described. Such a SIP-based protocol notonly makes itself backward-compatible
    with the vast existing SIPdevices, but also provides extra functions to satisfy
    some particularrequirements raised by P2PSIP.</p>"
