abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a general mechanism to use the header-\n
    \  extension feature of RTP (the Real Time Protocol).  It provides the\n   option
    to use a small number of small extensions in each RTP packet,\n   where the universe
    of possible extensions is large and unregistered.\n   The actual extensions in
    use in a session are signaled in the setup\n   information for that session.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
