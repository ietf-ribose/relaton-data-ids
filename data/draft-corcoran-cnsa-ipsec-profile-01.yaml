abstract:
- content: "<p>The United States Government has published the NSA Commercial National
    Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite, which defines cryptographic algorithm policy
    for national security applications. This document specifies the conventions for
    using the United States National Security Agency's CNSA Suite algorithms in Internet
    Protocol Security. It applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation
    of all components of US National Security Systems that employ IPSec. US National
    Security Systems are described in NIST Special Publication 800-59. It is also
    appropriate for all other US Government systems that process high-value information.
    It is made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and
    any other system deployments.</p>"
