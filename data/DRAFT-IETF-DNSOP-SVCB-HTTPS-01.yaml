abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the \"SVCB\" and \"HTTPS\" DNS resource
    record\n   (RR) types to facilitate the lookup of information needed to make\n
    \  connections to network services, such as for HTTPS origins.  SVCB\n   records
    allow a service to be provided from multiple alternative\n   endpoints, each with
    associated parameters (such as transport\n   protocol configuration and keys for
    encrypting the TLS ClientHello).\n   They also enable aliasing of apex domains,
    which is not possible with\n   CNAME.  The HTTPS RR is a variation of SVCB for
    HTTPS and HTTP\n   origins.  By providing more information to the client before
    it\n   attempts to establish a connection, these records offer potential\n   benefits
    to both performance and privacy.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED: This proposal is inspired
    by and based on recent DNS\n   usage proposals such as ALTSVC, ANAME, and ESNIKEYS
    (as well as long\n   standing desires to have SRV or a functional equivalent implemented\n
    \  for HTTP).  These proposals each provide an important function but\n   are
    potentially incompatible with each other, such as when an origin\n   is load-balanced
    across multiple hosting providers (multi-CDN).\n   Furthermore, these each add
    potential cases for adding additional\n   record lookups in addition to AAAA/A
    lookups.  This design attempts\n   to provide a unified framework that encompasses
    the key functionality\n   of these proposals, as well as providing some extensibility
    for\n   addressing similar future challenges.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED: This document
    is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/MikeBishop/dns-alt-svc
    [1].  The most recent\n   working version of the document, open issues, etc. should
    all be\n   available there.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.\n\n\t
