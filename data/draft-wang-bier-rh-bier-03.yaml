abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes one new encapsulation schema of Bit Index Explicit
    Replication (BIER) information to transfer the multicast packets within the IPv6
    network. By using a new type of IPv6 Routing Header to forward the packet, the
    original source address and destination address of the multicast packet is kept
    unchanged along the forwarding path. Such encapsulation schema can make full use
    of the existing IPv6 quality assurance solutions to provide high-quality multicast
    service.</p>"
