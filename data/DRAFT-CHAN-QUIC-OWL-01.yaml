abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the use of One Way Latency (OWL) for\n
    \  enhancing multipath transmission in QUIC.  Several representative\n   usages
    of OWL, such as congestion control mechanism, retransmission\n   policy, crucial
    data scheduling are analyzed.  Two kinds of OWL\n   measurement approaches are
    also provided and compared.  More\n   explorations related with OWL will be researched
    to improve the\n   performance of QUIC.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
