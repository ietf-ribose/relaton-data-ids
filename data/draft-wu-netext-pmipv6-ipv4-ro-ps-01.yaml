abstract:
  content: "<p>[ID-PMIP6-RO-PS] describes the problem space of localized routingwhich
    allows end-to-end user traffic forwarding between MN and CNdirectly without involving
    Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in a singleProxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] domain. However,
    localized routing withIPv4 support which allows IPv4 transport between MAG and
    LMA and/orIPv4 enabled user traffic between MN and CN is not considered. Thisdocument
    details the scenarios and problem statement for localizedrouting with IPv4 support.</p>"
