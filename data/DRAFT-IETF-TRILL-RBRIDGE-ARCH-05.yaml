abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RBridges are link layer (L2) devices that use a routing protocol
    \nas a control plane. This combines several of the benefits of the \nlink layer
    with those of the network layer. For example RBridges \nuse existing link state
    routing, without necessarily requiring \nconfiguration, to improve aggregate throughput,
    for RBridge to \nRBridge traffic. RBridges also may support IP multicast and IP
    \naddress resolution optimizations. They are intended to be \napplicable to L2
    network sizes similar to those of conventional \nbridges and are intended to be
    backward compatible with those \nbridges as both ingress/egress and transit. They
    also support \nVLANs (although this generally requires configuration) while \notherwise
    attempting to retain as much 'plug and play' as is \nalready available in existing
    bridges. This document proposes an \narchitecture for RBridge systems as a solution
    to the TRILL \nproblem, defines terminology, and describes basic components and
    \ndesired behavior. One (or more) separate documents will specify \nprotocols
    and mechanisms that satisfy the architecture presented \nherein. \n\t </p>\n      "
