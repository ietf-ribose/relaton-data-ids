abstract:
- content: "<p>The CoAP protocol needs to be implemented in such a way that it does
    not cause persistent congestion on the network it uses. The CoRE CoAP specification
    defines basic behavior that exhibits low risk of congestion with minimal implementation
    requirements. It also leaves room for combining the base specification with advanced
    congestion control mechanisms with higher performance. This specification defines
    more advanced, but still simple CoRE Congestion Control mechanisms, called CoCoA.
    The core of these mechanisms is a Retransmission TimeOut (RTO) algorithm that
    makes use of Round-Trip Time (RTT) estimates, in contrast with how the RTO is
    determined as per the base CoAP specification (RFC 7252). The mechanisms defined
    in this document have relatively low complexity, yet they improve the default
    CoAP RTO algorithm. The design of the mechanisms in this specification has made
    use of input from simulations and experiments in real networks.</p>"
