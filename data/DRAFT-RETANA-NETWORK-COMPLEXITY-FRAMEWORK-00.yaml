abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network architecture revolves around the concept of fitting
    the\n   design of a network to its purpose; of asking the question, \"what\n   network
    will best fit these needs?\"  A part of fitting network design\n   to requirements
    is the problem of complexity, an idea often measured\n   by \"seat of pants\"
    methods.  When would adding a particular protocol,\n   policy, or configuration
    be \"too complex?\"  This document suggests a\n   series of continuums along which
    network complexity might be\n   measured.  No suggestions are made in measuring
    complexity for each\n   of these continuums are provided; this is left for future
    documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
