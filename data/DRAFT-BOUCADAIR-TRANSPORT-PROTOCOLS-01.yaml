abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The world of Internet transport protocols is changing, after
    decades\n   of TCP and UDP operation.  Several proposals have been submitted for\n
    \  the past years (and counting) to introduce other transport protocols\n   that
    aim at reducing the web latency of that of TCP or avoiding the\n   burden of the
    various middle-boxes (NATs, firewalls, for one)\n   encountered along the communication
    path.  Such initiatives, although\n   not new, are motivated by the complexity
    of some (non-transparent)\n   networking functions.\n\n   This document advocates
    for the definition of transport profiles and\n   the need to document recommendations
    for middleboxes, including\n   Performance Enhancement Proxies (PEPs) behaviors.
    \ A collaboration\n   among the involved players (service providers, vendors)
    is required\n   to soften the current complications encountered in the Internet
    at\n   large.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
