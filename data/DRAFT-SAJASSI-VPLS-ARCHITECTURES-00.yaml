abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a reference architecture for a VPLS system.
    It \ndescribes possible VPLS architectures based on this reference \narchitecture
    and the merits of each. Each VPLS architecture is \ndescribed in terms of its
    logical components and their relationship to \neach other, as well as the mapping
    of these logical components to \nphysical network elements. By understanding these
    logical components, \nwhich are fundamental building blocks for any VPLS system,
    one can \neasily compare different VPLS architectures and understand the pros
    and \ncons of each. A VPLS system may support one or more of these \narchitectures
    simultaneously. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
