abstract:
- content: "<p>DOSP (DKIM Originator's Signing Policy) is a DNS-based mechanism for
    associating domain-names and asserting separate DKIM related policies for all
    originating header fields and parameters found in DKIM related messages. DOSP
    can associate an email-address with a list of signing domains, and a signing domain
    with a list of SMTP Clients. DOSP also provides a means to assert whether signatures
    are always initial provided, whether there was an effort to protect these signatures,
    and their role related to offering assurances, such as when an identity referencing
    the DOSP policy is assured to be valid.</p>"
