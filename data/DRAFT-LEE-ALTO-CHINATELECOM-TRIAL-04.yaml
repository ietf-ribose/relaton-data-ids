abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>      This document reports the experience of China Telecom in
    a recent\n   experiment with the ALTO service and P2P caches deployment. It is\n
    \  found that the deployment of the ALTO service significantly improves\n   the
    capability of a Service Provider to affect the distribution of\n   P2P traffic.
    It is also found that a traffic localized ALTO policy\n   may decrease the download
    speed of a P2P user. However, the\n   deployment of some P2P caches can compensate
    such influence.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
