abstract:
  content: "<p>Internet Calendaring and Scheduling protocols require the definition
    ofobjects to encapsulate an event to be scheduled, a calendar on whichthe event
    will be stored, and means for exchanging these objects acrossthe Internet between
    calendars on behalf of people for whom thecalendars are meaningful. This document
    gives an abstract model of theobjects and the protocols necessary to accomplish
    this kind ofinformation exchange. It will establish the context in which otherCalendaring
    and Scheduling RFCs can be interpreted. Included are briefintroductions to the
    other components of Internet calendar protocolsand definitions of nomenclature
    common to all documents defining theseprotocols. Reading this document will enable
    implementors and users ofInternet Calendaring and Scheduling protocols to understand
    the goalsand constraints chosen for related protocols.</p>"
