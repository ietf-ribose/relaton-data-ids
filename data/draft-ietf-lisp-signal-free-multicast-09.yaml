abstract:
- content: "<p>When multicast sources and receivers are active at Locator/ID Separation
    Protocol (LISP) sites, the core network is required to use native multicast so
    packets can be delivered from sources to group members. When multicast is not
    available to connect the multicast sites together, a signal-free mechanism can
    be used to allow traffic to flow between sites. The mechanism described in this
    document uses unicast replication and encapsulation over the core network for
    the data plane and uses the LISP mapping database system so encapsulators at the
    source LISP multicast site can find decapsulators at the receiver LISP multicast
    sites.</p>"
