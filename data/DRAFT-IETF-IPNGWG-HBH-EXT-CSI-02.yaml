abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a new mechanism called 'Connection/Link
    Status\nInvestigation (CSI)'. It is designed to collect status information of\nnodes
    along the communication path. One new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option\n(CSI option) and
    three new ICMPv6 messages (Status Request/Reply, and\nStatus Report) are proposed
    as extensions for the CSI mechanism.\nThe CSI mechanism is based on hop-by-hop
    data acquisition operations\nand realtime 'boomerang' action messages. It is simple
    and can\ninvestigate both outgoing and incoming paths between the source and\nthe
    destination with minimum investigation packets.\nIt can provide various new functions
    (e.g. realtime consumed\nbandwidth measurement, etc.). Since it has good characteristics,
    it\nis possible to innovate current investigation functions (e.g.,\n'traceroute',
    'pathchar', etc.)\nThis document describes specifications of the CSI mechanism
    and\ndefines a set of basic data types. The CSI mechanism is designed as a\ngeneric
    framework mechanism. By defining new data types to collect,\nit can be easily
    applied to various advanced usages.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
