abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes protection methods for the BIER-TE\n
    \  architecture [I-D.eckert-bier-te-arch].  These include 1+1 (live-\n   live)
    path/tree [RFC7431] redundancy, 1:1 path/tree protection, as\n   well as fast
    reroute (FRR) methods.  The latter may protect against\n   link and/or node failures
    and leverage infrastructure tunnels, BIER-\n   in-BIER encapsulation, or header
    modification for implementation.\n\n   In particular, this memo describes FRR
    for BIER-TE in detail.  FRR\n   for BIER-TE requires support from the BIER-TE
    controller and the BFRs\n   that are attached to a link/adjacency for which FRR
    protection is\n   desired.  FRR relies on the BIER header described in\n   [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]
    which is also used by BIER-TE.  It does\n   not require extensions or modifications
    to existing BIER-TE tables.\n   However, the presented FRR procedures need some
    additional forwarding\n   plane logic on the BFR.  An additional table is needed
    that carries\n   information about pre-computed backup paths.  When a failure
    is\n   detected, the information from this table is used to modify the\n   bitstring
    in the BIER header before forwarding a packet over a backup\n   path.  To prevent
    undesired packet duplication, packets should be\n   tunneled on the backup paths.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
