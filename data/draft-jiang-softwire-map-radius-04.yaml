abstract:
- content: "<p>Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) is a stateless mechanism for running
    IPv4 over IPv6-only infrastructure. It provides both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity
    services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co- existing period. The Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) MAP options has been defined to
    configure MAP Customer Edge (CE). However, in many networks, the configuration
    information may be stored in Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA)
    servers while user configuration is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway (BNG)
    through DHCPv6 protocol. This document defines a Remote Authentication Dial In
    User Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries MAP configuration information from
    AAA server to BNG. The MAP RADIUS attribute are designed following the simplify
    principle. It provides just enough information to form the correspondent DHCPv6
    MAP option.</p>"
