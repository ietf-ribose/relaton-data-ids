abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Sieve scripting language can be used for implementing of\nwhitelisting,
    blacklisting and personal distribution lists.\nCurrently this requires that all
    members of such lists be hardcoded\nin the script itself.  Whenever a member of
    such list is added or\ndeleted, the script needs to be updated and possibly uploaded
    to a\nmail server.\n\nThis document defines a Sieve extension for accessing externally\nstored
    mailing lists, i.e. list whose members are stored externally\nto the script, for
    example in LDAP (RFC 4510), ACAP (RFC 2244) or a\nrelational database.\n\nToDo\n\no
    \ Need a way to advertise supported URI schemas in ManageSieve and\n\nihave.\n\t
