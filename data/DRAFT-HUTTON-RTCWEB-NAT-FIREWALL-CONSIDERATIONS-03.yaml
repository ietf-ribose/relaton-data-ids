abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes mechanism to enable media stream\n
    \  establishment for Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (WebRTC) in\n   the
    presence of network address translators, firewalls and HTTP\n   proxies.  HTTP
    proxy and firewall deployed in many private network\n   domains introduce obstacles
    to the successful establishment of media\n   stream via WebRTC.  This document
    examines some of these deployment\n   scenarios and specifies requirements on
    WebRTC enabled web browsers\n   designed to provide the best possible chance of
    media connectivity\n   between WebRTC peers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
