abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the pNFS protocol to communicate errors caused
    by inability to access data servers referenced by layouts, including checks performed
    by both clients and the MDS. The extension provides means for clients to communicate
    client-detected access denial errors to the MDS, including the case in which a
    client requests direct NFS access via the MDS that the MDS cannot perform.</p>"
