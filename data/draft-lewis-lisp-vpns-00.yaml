abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of the Locator/ID Separation Protocol
    (LISP) to create Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). LISP is used to provide segmentation
    in both the LISP data plane and control plane. These IP based VPNs can be created
    over the top of the Internet or other VPN protocols, and can be implemented by
    Enterprise or Service Provider type networks. The goal of these VPNs is to leverage
    the characteristics of LISP - routing scalability, simply expressed Ingress site
    TE Policy, IP Address Family traversal, and mobility, in ways that provide value
    to network operators.</p>"
