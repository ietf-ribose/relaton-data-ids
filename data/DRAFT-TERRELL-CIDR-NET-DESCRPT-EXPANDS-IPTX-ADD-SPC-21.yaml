abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  This document, which Obsoletes RFC 2373, RFC 1517, RFC 1518,
    RFC\n  1519, and IEEE Specification 1541-2002 (Re-defining the\n  Electromagnetic
    Spectrum and the 'SI Units' as a Base 2 Exponential\n  Binary Conversion - defines
    the IPtX Bit-Map Specification and\n  Technique for Bit-Mapping any 'Decimal Fraction'
    - Page [93], [94],\n  [106] - ['DCE Unit' = ' 2E'Q ']), provides the final clarification\n
    \ of the conclusions that redefines the 'CIDR' notation as the 'Network\n  Descriptor',
    and proves that the IP Address Pool Total for the IPtX\n  Specification is greater
    than IPv6. And more importantly, because\n  these conclusions reveal the actual
    design of the Binary\n  Communication System, the Revolutionary impact sustained,
    is an\n  upheaval affecting the entire field of Computer Science; 'The\n  Rudiments
    of Finite Quantum Computing and Finite Quantum Computer\n  Programming'. In other
    words, IPtX is a more powerful and cost\n  effective IP Addressing Specification,
    and when using the 'IPtX-MX\n  Protocol' {'2\"X : 1'; the Compression Ratio for
    \"The Intelligent\n  Quantum Tunneling Worm Protocol\" - The Design of the 'Internet\n
    \ Protocol telecommunications Xchange Specification'}, the interface\n  of the
    \"Front-End\" can mimic or simulate a 32 Bit-Mapped IP Address.\n  And this, in
    conjunction with the IPv4 IP Addressing Overlay,\n  provides a 100% Backward Compatibility
    with the IPv4 Specification\n  (Meeting the Requirements of RFC 1550), in the
    Backbone environment\n  approaching an unlimited size 'Bit-Map' Address Space.\n\n\t
