abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Domain contact information over DNS provides a vehicle for\n
    \  exchanging contact information in a programmatic and reliable\n   manner. DNS
    has a ubiquitous presence within the internet\n   infrastructure and will act
    as a reliable publication method for\n   contact information exchange. This RFC
    provides an agreed upon\n   structure, voluntarily, to publish points of contact
    for domains.\n\n   This document outlines the methodology for utilizing DNS TXT
    records\n   for voluntary publication of various forms of contact. The intended\n
    \  purpose is to provide a faster means of reliable contact for\n   professionals,
    cyber-defense of domains.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
