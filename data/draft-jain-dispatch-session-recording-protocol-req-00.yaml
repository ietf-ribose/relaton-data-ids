abstract:
  content: "<p>Session recording is a critical requirement in many businesscommunications
    environments such as call centers and financialtrading floors. In some of these
    environments, all calls must berecorded for regulatory and compliance reasons.
    In others, calls maybe recorded for quality control or business analytics. Recording
    istypically done by sending a copy of the media to the recordingdevices. This
    document specifies requirements for a protocol thatwill manage delivery of media
    from an end-point that originates mediaor that has access to it to a recording
    device. This protocol isbeing referred to as Session Recording Protocol and will
    most likelybe based on SIP.</p>"
