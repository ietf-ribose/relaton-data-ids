abstract:
  content: <p>This document describes the "Bump-In-the-Host" (BIH), a host basedprotocol
    translation mechanism that allows a subset of applicationssupporting only one
    IP address family to communicate with peers thatare reachable or supporting only
    the other address family.This specification addresses scenarios where a host is
    provided dualstack or IPv6 only network connectivity. In the dual stack networkcase,
    single address family applications in the host sometime willcommunicate directly
    with other hosts using the different addressfamily. In the case of IPv6 only network
    or IPv6 only destination,IPv4 originated communications have to be translated
    into IPv6. TheBIH makes the IPv4 applications think they talk to IPv4 peers andhence
    hides the IPv6 from those applications.Acknowledgement of previous workThis document
    is an update to and directly derivative from KazuakiTSHUCHIYA, Hidemitsu HIGUCHI,
    and Yoshifumi ATARASHI [RFC2767] andfrom Seungyun Lee, Myung-Ki Shin, Yong-Jin
    Kim, Alain Durand, andErik Nordmark's [RFC3338], which similarly provides a dual
    stack hostmeans to communicate with other IPv6 host using existing IPv4appliations.
    This document combines and updates both [RFC2767] and[RFC3338].The changes in
    this document reflect five components1. Supporting IPv6 only network connections2.
    IPv4 address pool use private address instead of theunassigned IPv4 addresses
    (0.0.0.1 - 0.0.0.255)3. Extending ENR and address mapper to operate differently4.
    Adding an alternative way to implement the ENR5. Going for standards track instead
    of experimental/informational</p>
