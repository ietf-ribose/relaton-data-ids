abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the use of the SIP INFO Method for\ncommunicating
    mid-call events in SIP [1] sessions.  Two new MIME\ntypes are described, according
    to the rules defined in RFC 2046 [2],\nfor use in the INFO message.  These media
    types can be used within a\nSIP INFO message to request, and report, event detection
    between SIP\nnetwork entities.  Emphasis is placed on DTMF signaling to\ncommunicate
    user indications when using SIP between a Media Gateway\nController (MGC) and
    a SIP application.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
