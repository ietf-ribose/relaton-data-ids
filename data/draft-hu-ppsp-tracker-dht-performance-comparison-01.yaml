abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The draft makes performance analysis in two kinds of resourceexchange
    and discovery methods, tracker based and DHT basedarchitectures in P2P streaming.
    Our analysis shows that centralizedtracker solution for resource discovery (and
    chunk lookup) has muchshorter response time than highly distributed DHT approach.</p>"
