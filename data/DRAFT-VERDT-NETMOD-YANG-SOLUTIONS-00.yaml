abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This 'work in progress' document describes and evaluates potential\n
    \  solutions to the requirements stated in section 5 of the YANG\n   versioning
    requirements draft.  The aim of this draft is to only\n   provide a progress update
    to the Netmod WG concerning the YANG\n   versioning design team discussions on
    potential solutions, and to\n   hopefully provide minimally sufficient information
    to allow the wider\n   Netmod community to provide input into the direction of
    the YANG\n   versioning design team.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
