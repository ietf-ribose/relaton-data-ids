abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines Global Postion/Encryption Protocol (GP/EP),
    a\n   proposal for a universal wireless computer network. Global position\n   is
    defined as region in space-time. The network routes data to a\n   global position
    using routing information provided as part of the\n   protocol data and proposes
    use of encryption algorithms to prevent\n   unauthorised  access.\n \n   This
    protocol is proposed as an alternative for IP, the Internet\n   Protocol. The
    memo also describes how a network can work with no real\n   network address other
    than its global position in the universe.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
