abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses setting up special-purpose network connections
    using existing IETF technologies. These connections are called IETF network slices
    for the purposes of this memo. The memo discusses the general framework for this
    setup, the necessary system components and interfaces, and how abstract requests
    can be mapped to more specific technologies. The memo also discusses related considerations
    with monitoring and security. This memo is intended for discussing interfaces
    and technologies. It is not intended to be a new set of concrete interfaces or
    technologies. Rather, it should be seen as an explanation of how some existing,
    concrete IETF VPN and traffic-engineering technologies can be used to create IETF
    network slices. Note that there are a number of these technologies, and new technologies
    or capabilities keep being added. This memo is also not intended presume any particular
    technology choice.</p>"
