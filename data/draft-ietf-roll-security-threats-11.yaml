abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a security threat analysis for the Routing Protocol
    for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPLs). The development builds upon previous
    work on routing security and adapts the assessments to the issues and constraints
    specific to low-power and lossy networks. A systematic approach is used in defining
    and evaluating the security threats. Applicable countermeasures are application
    specific and are addressed in relevant applicability statements.</p>"
