abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of usable next-hop
    address families is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the
    Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI). The current AFI/SAFI definitions
    for the IPv4 address family only have provisions for advertising a Next Hop address
    that belongs to the IPv4 protocol when advertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability
    Information (NLRI) or VPN-IPv4 NLRI. This document specifies the extensions necessary
    to allow advertising IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop address that belongs
    to the IPv6 protocol. This comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions
    to allow the address of the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong
    to the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the Next Hop to determine which of the protocols
    the address actually belongs to, and a new BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers
    to dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI
    with an IPv6 Next Hop.</p>"
