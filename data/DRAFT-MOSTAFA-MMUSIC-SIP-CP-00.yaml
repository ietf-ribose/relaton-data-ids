abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The NextGen video conferencing clients require multiple concurrent\n
    \  video streams to provide a User eXperience (UX) in which multiple\n   participants
    can be viewed at the same time, this user experience is\n   called Continuous
    Presence (CP) video.  The multi-stream CP video\n   provides more client control
    of the UX and less processing on the\n   conference server since the video streams
    are relayed by the server\n   rather than mixed to compose a CP video stream.
    \ The client CP\n   layout, processing power and bandwidth limitations require
    a per\n   stream bandwidth and resolution to be negtiated in the SIP Offer/\n
    \  Answer with the conference server.  Standard methods are used to\n   achieve
    this negotiation in addition to a new SDP parameter.  This\n   document explains
    the methodology and solution to achieve this in SIP\n   and SDP.\n\n\t </p>\n
