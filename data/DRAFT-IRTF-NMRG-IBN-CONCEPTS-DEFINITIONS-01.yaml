abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Intent and Intent-Based Networking (IBN) are taking the industry
    by\n   storm.  At the same time, those terms are used loosely and often\n   inconsistently,
    in many cases overlapping and confused with other\n   concepts such as \"Policy\".
    \ This document clarifies the concept of\n   \"Intent\" and provides an overview
    of functionality that is associated\n   with it.  The goal is to contribute towards
    a common and shared\n   understanding of terms, concepts, and functionality that
    can be used\n   as foundation to guide further definition of associated research
    and\n   engineering problems and their solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
