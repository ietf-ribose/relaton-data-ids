abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a protocol for dynamically determining
    CE/FE \n   element  bindings  discovery  and  inter-FE  topology  discovery  and
    \n   maintenance. Such a mechanism is needed for all these elements in \n   the
    set to behave as a single network element, as required by the \n   ForCES architecture.
    The discovery protocol operates during both the \n   pre-association and post-association
    phases of ForCES protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
