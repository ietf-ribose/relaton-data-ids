abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo instructs IANA to restructure its IPv4 and IPv6 Special-\n
    \  Purpose Address Registries.  Upon restructuring, the aforementioned\n   registries
    will record all special-purpose address blocks,\n   maintaining a common set of
    information regarding each address block.\n\n   This memo updates RFC 5736 and
    RFC 4773, which define the current\n   structure of the IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose
    Address Registries .\n   It also obsoletes RFC 5735 and RFC 5156 which document
    special-\n   purpose address blocks that are not currently, but will in the\n
    \  future, be recorded in the IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address\n   Registries.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
