abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a framework and requirements for theinteraction
    between users and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) basedapplications. By interacting
    with applications, users can guide theway in which they operate. The focus of
    this framework is stimulussignaling, which allows a user agent to interact with
    an applicationwithout knowledge of the semantics of that application. Stimulussignaling
    can occur to a user interface running locally with theclient, or to a remote user
    interface, through media streams.Stimulus signaling encompasses a wide range of
    mechanisms, rangingfrom clicking on hyperlinks, to pressing buttons, to traditional
    DualTone Multi Frequency (DTMF) input. In all cases, stimulus signalingis supported
    through the use of markup languages, which play a keyrole in this framework.</p>"
