abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are many situations in which it is desirable to take\n
    \  measurements of data which people consider sensitive.  In these\n   cases,
    the entity taking the measurement is usually not interested in\n   people's individual
    responses but rather in aggregated data.\n   Conventional methods require collecting
    individual responses and then\n   aggregating them, thus representing a threat
    to user privacy and\n   rendering many such measurements difficult and impractical.
    \ This\n   document describes a multi-party privacy preserving measurement (PPM)\n
    \  protocol which can be used to collect aggregate data without\n   revealing
    any individual user's data.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
