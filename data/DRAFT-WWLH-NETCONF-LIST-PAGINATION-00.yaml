abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In some circumstances, instances of YANG modeled \"list\" and
    \"leaf-\n   list\" nodes may contain numerous entries.  Retrieval of all the\n
    \  entries can lead to inefficiencies in the server, the client, and the\n   network
    in between.\n\n   This document defines a model for list pagination that can be\n
    \  implemented by YANG-driven management protocols such as NETCONF and\n   RESTCONF.
    \ The model supports paging over optionally filtered and/or\n   sorted entries.
    \ The solution additionally enables servers to\n   constrain query expressions
    on some \"config false\" lists or leaf-\n   lists.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
