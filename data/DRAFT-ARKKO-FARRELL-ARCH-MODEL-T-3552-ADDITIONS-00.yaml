abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Communications security has been at the center of many security\n
    \  improvements in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that\n   communications
    are protected against outside observers and attackers.\n\n   This memo suggests
    additions to the RFC 3552 threat model to cater\n   for the evolving security
    and privacy issues seen on the Internet\n   today.  For instance, it is often
    also necessary to protect against\n   endpoints that are compromised, malicious,
    or whose interests simply\n   do not align with the interests of users.  While
    such protection is\n   difficult, there are some measures that can be taken and
    we argue\n   that investigation of these issues is warranted.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
