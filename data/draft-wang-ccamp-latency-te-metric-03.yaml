abstract:
  content: <p>Latency is such requirement that must be achieved according to theService
    Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and serviceproviders. Network Performance
    Objective (NPO) defined in ITU-TY.1540 and Y.1541 is used for describing the meaning
    and numericalvalues performance parameters traversing multiple packet networks.The
    definitions of the packet network performance parameters areoften also used as
    the basis of SLAs service providers, but possiblywith different numerical values.
    A SLA is a part of a servicecontract where the level of service is formally defined
    betweenservice providers and customers. For example, the service levelincludes
    platinum, golden, silver and bronze. Different servicelevel may associate with
    different protection/restorationrequirement. Latency can also be associated with
    different servicelevel. The user may select a private line provider based on theability
    to meet a latency SLA.The key driver for latency is stock/commodity trading applicationsthat
    use data base mirroring. A few milli seconds can impact atransaction. Financial
    or trading companies are very focused on end-to-end private pipe line latency
    optimizations that improve things2-3 ms. Latency and latency SLA is one of the
    key parameters thatthese "high value" customers use to select a private pipe lineprovider.
    Other key applications like video gaming, conferencing andstorage area networks
    require stringent latency and bandwidth.This document describes the requirements
    and mechanisms tocommunicate latency as a traffic engineering performance metric
    intoday's network which is consisting of potentially multiple layers ofpacket
    transport network and optical transport network in order tomeet the latency SLA
    between service provider and his customers.This document also extends RSVP-TE
    and IGP to support theserequirement. These extensions are intended to advertise
    and conveythe latency information of nodes and links as traffic engineeringperformance
    metric.</p>
