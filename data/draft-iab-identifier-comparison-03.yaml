abstract:
- content: "<p>Identifiers such as hostnames, URIs, and email addresses are often
    used in security contexts to identify security principals and resources. In such
    contexts, an identifier supplied via some protocol is often compared against some
    policy to make security decisions such as whether the principal may access the
    resource, what level of authentication or encryption is required, etc. If the
    parties involved in a security decision use different algorithms to compare identifiers,
    then failure scenarios ranging from denial of service to elevation of privilege
    can result.</p>"
