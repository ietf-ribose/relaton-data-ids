abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents recommendations to the Internet community concerning
    measures to improve and preserve Internet performance. It presents a strong recommendation
    for testing, standardization, and widespread deployment of active queue management
    (AQM) in network devices, to improve the performance of today's Internet. It also
    urges a concerted effort of research, measurement, and ultimate deployment of
    AQM mechanisms to protect the Internet from flows that are not sufficiently responsive
    to congestion notification. The note largely repeats the recommendations of RFC
    2309, updated after fifteen years of experience and new research.</p>"
