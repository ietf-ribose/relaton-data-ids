abstract:
  content: <p>This document defines the "Form" HTTP authentication scheme. It allows
    web developers access to standard HTTP-based authentication mechanisms whilst
    retaining control over the look and feel of their log-in page, without requiring
    any client-side scripting. Comments are requested and should be addressed to the
    author.</p>
