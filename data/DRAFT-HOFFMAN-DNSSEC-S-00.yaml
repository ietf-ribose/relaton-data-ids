abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNSSEC as defined in RFCs 4033, 4034, and 4035 is based on\n
    \  authenticated messages.  That design has allowed DNSSEC to be\n   deployed
    at the upper levels of the DNS tree, but operational issues\n   with message-based
    authentication has caused lower levels fo the DNS\n   tree to mostly forego DNSSEC.
    \ This document extends DNSSEC with a\n   second type of authentication, based
    on session authentication from\n   TLS, that is easier to deploy by some (but
    certainly not all)\n   authoritative DNS servers.  The goal is to have many more
    zones be\n   DNSSEC-enabled.\n\n   Note that this document does _not_ replace
    current DNSSEC.  A\n   validating resolver needs to implement all of traditional
    DNSSEC, and\n   might also implement the protocol defined here.  A server might\n
    \  protect the contents of DNS zones for which it is authoritative with\n   traditional
    DNSSEC, with the protocol defined here, or both.  The\n   protocol defined here
    is only useful for some authoritative servers,\n   and is explicitly not useful
    for others.\n\n   *** Notice for -00 ***\n\n   This -00 draft is meant to engender
    discussion, particularly to find\n   out if there is a good use case for this
    proposal.  This draft is\n   definitely not considered ready for consideration
    in an IETF WG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
