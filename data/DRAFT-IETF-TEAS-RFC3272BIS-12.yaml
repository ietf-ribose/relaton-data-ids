abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the principles of traffic engineering
    (TE) in\n   the Internet.  The document is intended to promote better\n   understanding
    of the issues surrounding traffic engineering in IP\n   networks and the networks
    that support IP networking, and to provide\n   a common basis for the development
    of traffic engineering\n   capabilities for the Internet.  The principles, architectures,
    and\n   methodologies for performance evaluation and performance optimization\n
    \  of operational networks are also discussed.\n\n   This work was first published
    as RFC 3272 in May 2002.  This document\n   obsoletes RFC 3272 by making a complete
    update to bring the text in\n   line with best current practices for Internet
    traffic engineering and\n   to include references to the latest relevant work
    in the IETF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
