abstract:
- content: "<p>When the service provider networks are upgraded to IPv6, end users
    will continue to demand IPv4 connectivity. This document describes a mechanism
    for hosts or customer networks in IPv6 access network to build bidirectional IPv4
    communication with the IPv4 Internet. The mechanism follows the hub and spokes
    softwire model, and uses IPv4- over-IPv6 tunnel as basic method to traverse IPv6
    network. The bi- directionality of this IPv4 communication is achieved by explicitly
    allocating public IPv4 addresses to end users, as well as maintaining IPv4-IPv6
    address binding on the border relay. This mechanism features the allocation of
    full IPv4 address over IPv6 network, and has been used in production for high-end
    IPv4 users, IPv6 transition of ICPs, etc.</p>"
