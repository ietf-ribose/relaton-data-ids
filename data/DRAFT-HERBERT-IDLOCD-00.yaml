abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Identifier-locator protocols rely on a mapping system that
    is able to\n   map identifiers to locators. Such a mapping system is a type of\n
    \  key/value store. This draft proposes a design and implementation for\n   an
    Identifier-Locator control daemon (idlocd). The intent is to\n   provide an open
    source implementation that would be a basis for\n   experimentation, development,
    and eventual deployment of identifier-\n   locator solutions at large scale.\n\n\t
