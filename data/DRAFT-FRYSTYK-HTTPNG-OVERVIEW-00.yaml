abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document gives the authors' opinion of a rough outline of
    (1) the\n       problems to be addressed by the proposed IETF HTTP-NG Working
    Group;\n       (2) the requirements on the solution; and (3) the architecture
    of the\n       solution. It draws heavily on contributions from the whole Protocol\n
    \      Design Group of the W3C HTTP-NG Activity. A suite of problems should\n
    \      be addressed, summarized as observing that the World Wide Web's\n       tremendous
    success has created some strains on the Internet, its\n       users, and its application
    developers. The requirements on the\n       solution include modularity, extensibility,
    scalability, and\n       efficiency. The proposed solution is to factor HTTP,
    the Web's central\n       protocol, into three layers and look into performance
    improvements in\n       the lower two of those resultant layers.\n\t </p>\n      "
