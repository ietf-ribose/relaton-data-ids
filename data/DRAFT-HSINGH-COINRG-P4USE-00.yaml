abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF specifies several algorithms operating in the data
    plane of\n   a network node, including liveliness detection, congestion control,\n
    \  network measurement, security, and load balancing.  Such algorithms\n   are
    commonly specified using English or flow charts.  As an\n   alternative, this
    document proposes that P4 programs can be used to\n   specify some data plane
    algorithms.  P4 is a programming language\n   created in 2014 to program the data
    plane of network nodes such as\n   switches, routers, smartNICs, and generic compute
    targets.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
