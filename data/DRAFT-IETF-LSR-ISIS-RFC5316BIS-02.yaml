abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes extensions to the Intermediate System
    to\n   Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol to support Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching
    (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering\n   (TE) for multiple
    Autonomous Systems (ASs).  It defines IS-IS\n   extensions for the flooding of
    TE information about inter-AS links,\n   which can be used to perform inter-AS
    TE path computation.\n\n   No support for flooding information from within one
    AS to another AS\n   is proposed or defined in this document.\n\n   This document
    obsoletes RFC 5316.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
