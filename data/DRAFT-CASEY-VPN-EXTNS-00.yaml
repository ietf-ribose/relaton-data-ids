abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  This Internet Draft extends the framework for IP VPN's, as,
    for\n  example, described by Heinanen et al.[1] and Gleeson et al [2],\n  to include
    the concept of VPN Areas. VPN areas relate to the\n  scoping of the mechanisms
    (membership dissemination, tunneling\n  etc.) used to provide IP VPN service.
    VPN areas are a\n  partitioning of the shared service provider's network. In\n
    \ general, all sites within a VPN area are one tunneled hop from\n  each other,
    but multiple tunneled hops will be required for\n  traffic between sites served
    by different VPN areas.\n \n  Two reasons why Service Providers might partition
    their IP\n  network into areas in support of VPN's are to achieve\n  scalability,
    and to match administrative domain. VPN areas also\n  facilitate the use of different
    IP VPN mechanisms in different\n  parts of the network. There are multiple proposals
    for tunnel\n  technology and discovery mechanisms for IP VPN's. The VPN area\n
    \ concept allows them to co-exist in one provider's network as\n  well as smoothing
    migration to new mechanisms.\n \n  This draft also examines the impact that VPN
    areas have on the\n  IP VPN framework mechanisms described in [2]. The conclusion\n
    \ reached is that the best mechanism for intra-VPN reachability\n  dissemination
    is a full routing protocol run by Virtual Routers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
