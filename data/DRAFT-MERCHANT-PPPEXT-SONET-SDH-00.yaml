abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard mechanism\n
    \   for transport of multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.\n    There
    is currently significant interest and activity in transporting\n    PPP over SONET
    links, and RFC 1619 [2] and RFC 1662 [3], both from\n    1994, have so far provided
    most of the basis for implementation of\n    such a transport. Recent needs, proposals
    and standards have\n    recently progressed beyond these two RFCs, as well as
    identified\n    limitations of the methods described in the aforementioned RFCs
    for\n    effective implementation at very high data rates in the vicinity of\n
    \   10 Gb/s (STS-192c/OC-192).\n \n    This document (A) attempts to consolidates
    (sometimes by reference)\n    current standards and current practice in transport
    of PPP over\n    SONET; (B) attempts to document current viewpoints that share
    some\n    degree of consensus in recent developments in this area and (C)\n    proposes
    for STS-192c/OC-192 transmission a simple, efficient and\n    robust 32-bit-word-oriented
    framing mechanism based on HDLC, called\n    HDLC-32, which is significantly more
    conducive to efficient\n    implementation at high data rates in the vicinity
    of 10 Gb/s\n    (STS-192c/OC-192) than the HDLC framing currently used at lower\n
    \   rates.\n\t </p>\n      "
