abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many example procedures in our mind which can benefit from
    the service virtualization and the service pooling. Therefore, we come up with
    this idea of multi-service virtualization, not only supports service resource
    pooling to realize intelligent resource sharing, but also makes the service much
    more flexible and reliable.</p>"
