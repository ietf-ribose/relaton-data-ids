abstract:
  content: <p>The MVPN (Multicast Virtual Private Network) architecture is dividedinto
    a number of functional "layers". At each layer, multipleoptions are allowed. It
    is necessary to allow multiple options ateach layer because "one size doesn't
    fit all." However, it is notexpected that any particular implementation will support
    all thepossible combinations of options. To ensure multi-vendorinteroperability,
    it is useful to specify "profiles", where eachprofile is a particular combination
    of options. The number ofspecified profiles will be much less than the total number
    ofpossible combination, and a given implementation can be characterizedby saying
    which profiles it supports. This document describes twoprofiles that use a PIM
    control plane.</p>
