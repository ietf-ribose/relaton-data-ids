abstract:
- content: "<p>AS Path Prepending provides a tool to manipulate the BGP AS_Path attribute
    through prepending multiple entries of an AS. AS Path Prepending is used to deprioritize
    a route or alternate path. By prepending the local ASN multiple times, ASs can
    make advertised AS paths appear artificially longer. Excessive AS Path Prepending
    has caused routing issues in the Internet. This document provides guidance with
    the use of AS Path Prepending, including alternative solutions, in order to avoid
    negatively affecting the Internet.</p>"
