abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A secure substrate is required by the Generic Autonomic Signaling\n
    \  Protocol (GRASP) used by Autonomic Service Agents.  This document\n   describes
    QUADS, a QUick And Dirty Security method using symmetric\n   cryptography and
    preconfigured keys or passwords.  It also describes\n   a simplistic QUADS Key
    Infrastructure based on asymmetric\n   cryptography used over insecure instances
    of GRASP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
