abstract:
- content: "<p>The applets written in the Java programming [JAVA] language are becoming
    a household name on the World Wide Web. Currently, web browsers are able to retrieve
    and display these applets. This document describes a set of guidelines for conforming
    mail user agents to be able to send and display applets. The applets are transferred
    within a MIME [MIME] message. In order to do this, a new MIME subtype, Application/Applet,
    is being defined in this document. We also discuss how other protocols for adding
    security to MIME objects could be used to provide additional security.</p>"
