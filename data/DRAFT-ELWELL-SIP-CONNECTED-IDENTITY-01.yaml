abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Because of retargeting of a dialog-forming request, the UAS can
    have\na different identity from that in the To header.  This document\nprovides
    a means for that UA to supply its identity to the peer UA by\nmeans of a request
    in the reverse direction and for that identity to\nbe signed by an authentication
    service.  The same mechanism can be\nused to indicate a change of identity during
    a dialog, e.g., because\nof some action in a PSTN behind a gateway.\n\nThis work
    is being discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.\n\t </p>\n      "
