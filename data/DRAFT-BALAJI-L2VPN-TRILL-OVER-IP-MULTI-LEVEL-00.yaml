abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a need to connect (a) TRILL based data centers or
    (b) TRILL\n   based networks which provide Provider Backbone like functionalities\n
    \  or (c) Campus TRILL based networks over the WAN using one or more\n   ISPs
    that provide regular IP+GRE or IP+MPLS transport. A few\n   solutions have been
    proposed as in [1] in the recent past that have\n   not looked at the PB-like
    functionality. These solutions have not\n   dealt with the details as to how these
    services could be provided\n   such that multiple TRILL sites can be inter-connected
    with issues\n   like nick-name collisons for unicast and multicast being taken
    care\n   of. It has been found that with extensions to BGP the problem\n   statement
    which we will define below can be handled. Both control\n   plane and data plane
    operations can be driven into the solution to\n   make it seamlessly look at the
    entire set of TRILL sites as a single\n   entity which then can be viewed as one
    single Layer 2 cloud. MAC\n   moves across TRILL sites and within TRILL sites
    can be realized. This\n   document / proposal envisions the use of BGP-MAC-VPN
    vrfs both at the\n   IP cloud PE devices and at the peripheral PEs within a TRILL
    site\n   providing Provider Backbone like functionality. We deal in depth with\n
    \  the control plane and data plane particulars for unicast and\n   multicast
    with nick-name election being taken care of as part of the\n   solution.\n\n\n\t
