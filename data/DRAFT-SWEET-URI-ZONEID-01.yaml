abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how the zone identifier of an IPv6
    scoped\n   address, defined as &lt;zone_id&gt; in the IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture\n
    \  (RFC 4007), can be represented in a literal IPv6 address and in a\n   Uniform
    Resource Identifier that includes such a literal address.  It\n   documents a
    long-standing usage of the IPvFuture extension point\n   provided in the Uniform
    Resource Identifier (URI) syntax\n   specification [RFC3986].\n\n   [ Editor's
    note: This draft documents the IPvFuture format originally\n   defined in [LITERAL-ZONE]
    and used by CUPS since 2005.  A separate,\n   incompatible format was defined
    and published in RFC 6874. ]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
