abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The EUI-64 identifier of a 6LoWPAN device can be used as the\n
    \  interface identifier of the IPv6 address, which can be used for for\n   on-demand
    multi-hop routing in 6LoWPAN.  One of the distinctive\n   feature of 6LoWPAN is
    the capability of the dynamic assignment of 16-\n   bit short addresses.  By utilizing
    this dynamically assigned  short\n   address, a hierarchical routing which is
    very scalable can be \n   employed. This This document defines a dynamic address
    assignment  \n   scheme and hierarchical routing HiLow) based on the assignment.\n\n\t
