abstract:
  content: "\t <t>RFC 6724 defines default address selection mechanisms for IPv6 that
    allow nodes to select an appropriate address when faced with multiple source and/or
    destination addresses to choose between. RFC 6724 allows for the future definition
    of methods to administratively configure the address selection policy information.
    This document defines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration, allowing a site
    administrator to distribute address selection policy overriding the default address
    selection parameters and policy table, and thus allowing the administrator to
    control the address selection behavior of nodes in their site.</p>"
