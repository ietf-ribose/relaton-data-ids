abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the minimal properties IP Encapsulating\n
    \  Security Payload (ESP) implementation needs to meet to remain\n   interoperable
    with the standard RFC4303 ESP.  Such a minimal version\n   of ESP is not intended
    to become a replacement of the RFC 4303 ESP.\n   Instead, a minimal implementation
    is expected to be optimized for\n   constrained environment while remaining interoperable
    with\n   implementations of RFC 4303 ESP.  In addition, this document also\n   provides
    some considerations to implement minimal ESP in a\n   constrained environment
    which includes limiting the number of flash\n   writes, handling frequent wakeup
    / sleep states, limiting wakeup\n   time, or reducing the use of random generation.\n\n
    \  This document does not update or modify RFC 4303, but provides a\n   compact
    description of how to implement the minimal version of the\n   protocol.  RFC
    4303 remains the authoritative description.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
