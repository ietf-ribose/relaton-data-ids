abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a need, for relatively simple and scaleable methods
    of\n   providing  differentiated classes of service for IP traffic over\n   various
    WAN media, to support different types of applications and\n   specific business
    requirements. The Differentiated Services approach\n   to providing quality of
    service (QoS) in Networks, employs a small,\n   well-defined set of building blocks
    from which a variety of services\n   may be built. A small bit-pattern in each
    packet in the IPv4 ''TOS\n   octet'' or in the IPv6 ''Traffic Class octet'' is
    used to mark a  packet\n   to receive a differentiated forwarding treatment or
    per-hop behavior\n   at each network node. IETF Working Groups will standardize
    a common\n   layout for both octets, called the ''DS byte'' superseding the IPv4
    TOS\n   octet definitions or RFC 1349 [1].\n \n   The goal of this contribution
    is to suggest how the Next Hop\n   Resolution Protocol (NHRP) may be extended
    and deployed in\n   conjunction with the IP ToS octet (DS-Byte) to create both\n
    \  differentiated forwarding and differentiated class of service over\n   an NBMA
    network such as ATM or Frame-Relay.\n\n   In the proposed solution, any SVC created
    between the same two points\n   in an NBMA network will be used bi-directionally
    by traffic with the\n   same class of service.  This is achieved by extending
    the scope of\n   the existing NHRP protocol to include QoS information in the\n
    \  extensions part of both the NHRP resolution request and resolution\n   reply,
    and by implementing a NBMA addressing scheme that dynamically\n   maps CoS, to
    subaddresses that are unique within the NBMA network.\n \n   The proposal is compliant
    with the NHRP specifications, and every\n   effort is made by the proposal to
    build on the work currently\n   underway within the IETF that is attempting to
    standardize on the\n   use of the ToS octet (DS-byte) within the IP datagram.\n\n\t
