abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines how the Uniform Resource Name namespace\n
    \  reserved for GSMA (Global Sstandard for Mobiles Association)\n   identities
    and its sub namespace for the IMEI (International Mobile\n   station Equipment
    Identity) can be used as an instance-id as\n   specified in RFC 5626 [1] and also
    as used by RFC 5627 [2].  Its\n   purpose is to fulfil the requirements in RFC
    5626 [1] that state \"If\n   a URN scheme other than UUID is used, the UA MUST
    only use URNs for\n   which an RFC (from the IETF stream) defines how the specific
    URN\n   needs to be constructed and used in the \"+sip.instance\" Contact\n   header
    field parameter for outbound behavior.\"\n\n\t </p>\n      "
