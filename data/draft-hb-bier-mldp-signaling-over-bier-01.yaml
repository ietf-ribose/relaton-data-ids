abstract:
- content: <p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that provides
    multicast forwarding through a "BIER domain" without requiring intermediate routers
    to maintain multicast related per-flow state. Neither does BIER require an explicit
    tree-building protocol for its operation. A multicast data packet enters a BIER
    domain at a "Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router" (BFIR), and leaves the BIER domain
    at one or more "Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers" (BFERs). The BFIR router adds a
    BIER header to the packet. Such header contains a bit-string in which each bit
    represents exactly one BFER to forward the packet to. The set of BFERs to which
    the multicast packet needs to be forwarded is expressed by the according set of
    bits switched on in BIER packet header. This document describes the procedure
    needed for mLDP tunnels to be signaled over and stitched through a BIER core,
    allowing LDP routers to run traditional Multipoint LDP services through a BIER
    core.</p>
