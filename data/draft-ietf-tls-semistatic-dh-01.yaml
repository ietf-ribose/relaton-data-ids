abstract:
- content: "<p>TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] specifies a signed Diffie-Hellman exchange modelled
    after SIGMA [SIGMA]. This design is suitable for endpoints whose certified credential
    is a signing key, which is the common situation for current TLS servers. This
    document describes a mode of TLS 1.3 in which one or both endpoints have a certified
    DH key which is used to authenticate the exchange. Note to Readers Source for
    this draft and an issue tracker can be found at https://github.com/ekr/draft-rescorla-tls13-semistatic-dh
    (https://github.com/ekr/draft-rescorla-tls13-semistatic-dh).</p>"
