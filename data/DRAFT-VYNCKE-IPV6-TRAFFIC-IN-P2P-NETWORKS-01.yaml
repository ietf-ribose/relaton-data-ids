abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is a follow-up of a University thesis which aims
    to\n   measure the evolution over time of IPv6 traffic and to analyze the\n   geographical
    distribution of IPv6 nodes.  The first measurements were\n   done during the Summer
    2009 using a specific-purpose program which\n   connects to the BitTorrent peer-to-peer
    network and this document\n   adds measurements done with the same program but
    in October 2011 and\n   February 2012.\n\n   The study was made in Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) networks because they are\n   responsible for a big part of Internet traffic
    and because their\n   structure and functioning permit a rapid discovery of a
    large number\n   of nodes from all over the world.  In addition, the P2P users
    are\n   more likely to be interested by IPv6 as IPv6 does not have the same\n
    \  NAT problems as IPv4.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
