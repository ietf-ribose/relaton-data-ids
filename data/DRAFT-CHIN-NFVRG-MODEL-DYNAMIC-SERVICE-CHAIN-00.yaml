abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the context of Network Function Virtualization (NFV), a
    service\n   chain refers to a group of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) deployed\n
    \  in a virtual infrastructure manager (VIM) environment, such as\n   OpenStack,
    to apply a set of networking services to users' traffic\n   passing through it.\n\n
    \  Depending on the service requirements, the service chain may consist\n   of
    a single VNF or multiple VNFs deployed serially, or in parallel,\n   and the Virtual
    Network Forwarding Graph (VNF-G) describes the\n   topologies of how these VNFs
    are interconnected together via virtual\n   links to provide different networking
    services.\n\n   After a service chain is deployed, its user may require to modify\n
    \  the VNF-G from time to time, and on-demand, to meet changing service\n   requirements.
    Therefore, operators may require to support a high\n   degree of flexibility to
    orchestrate the provisioning and dynamic\n   modifications of VNFs in service
    chains.\n\n   This document presents a hierarchical model based approach to allow\n
    \  the NFV Orchestrator (NFV-O) and the VNF Manager (VNF-M) to support\n   the
    dynamic provisioning and on-demand modifications of VNFs in\n   service chains.\n\n\n\t
