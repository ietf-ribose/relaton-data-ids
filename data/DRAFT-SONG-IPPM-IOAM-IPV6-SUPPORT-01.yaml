abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It has been proposed to encapsulate IOAM tracing option data
    fields\n   in IPv6 HbH options header.  However, due to size of the trace data\n
    \  and the extension header location in the IPv6 packets, the proposal\n   creates
    practical challenges for implementation, especially when\n   other extension headers,
    such as routing header, also exist and\n   require in-network processing.  We
    propose several alternative\n   approaches to address this challenge, including
    separating the IOAM\n   trace data to a different extension header, using the
    postcard-based\n   telemetry (e.g., IOAM DEX) instead, and applying the segment
    IOAM\n   trace export scheme, based on the network scenario and application\n
    \  requirements.  We discuss the pros and cons of each approach and hope\n   to
    foster standard convergence and industry adoption.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
