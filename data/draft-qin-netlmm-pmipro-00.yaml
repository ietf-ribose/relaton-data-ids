abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines route optimization protocol for Proxy MobileIPv6.
    Proxy home test, concurrent proxy care-of test and handoverprocedures based on
    Enhanced Route Optimization for Mobile IPv6 areexplained. Mobile access gateway
    uses cryptographically generatedhome addresses so that no more home test is needed
    after the initialhome test. Handover home keygen token is used during handover
    inorder to eliminate home test for the next mobile access gateway. Theprotocol
    also supports IPv4 transport network operation.</p>"
