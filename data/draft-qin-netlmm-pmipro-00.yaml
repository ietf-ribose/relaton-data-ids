abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines route optimization protocol for Proxy Mobile
    IPv6. Proxy home test, concurrent proxy care-of test and handover procedures based
    on Enhanced Route Optimization for Mobile IPv6 are explained. Mobile access gateway
    uses cryptographically generated home addresses so that no more home test is needed
    after the initial home test. Handover home keygen token is used during handover
    in order to eliminate home test for the next mobile access gateway. The protocol
    also supports IPv4 transport network operation.</p>"
