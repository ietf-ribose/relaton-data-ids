abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal
    Control\n   (RTP/AVP) is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure\n
    \  Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for\n   Real-time
    Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/\n   AVPF), and the Extended
    Secure RTP Profile for RTCP-Based Feedback\n   (RTP/SAVPF).  This document provides
    guidelines for payload type\n   number usage policy when dynamic payload type
    allocation is used.\n   Also this document updates closed IANA registry \"RTP
    Payload types\n   (PT) for standard audio and video encodings\".\n\n\t </p>\n
