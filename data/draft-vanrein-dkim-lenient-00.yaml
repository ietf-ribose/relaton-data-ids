abstract:
- content: "<p>DKIM is a framework for signed messages, especially for email. While
    in transit, changes are sometimes made, and these break the DKIM- Signature. This
    specification makes DKIM more lenient, without changes to its core. It adds leniency
    towards MIME body rewrites, removal of alternatives and annotation with bits of
    text. The intention is to allow these changes such that they can be clearly shown
    to the user, while indicating that the remainder of the signedmessage is still
    in tact.</p>"
