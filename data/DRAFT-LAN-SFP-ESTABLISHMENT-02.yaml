abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service Function Chain architecture leads to more adaptive
    network\n   nodes. It allows splitting the network function into fine-grained\n
    \  build blocks --- service function, and combining the network\n   functions
    into service function chain to formulate complicated\n   services. Further, the
    service function chain should be instantiated\n   by selecting the optimal instance
    from the candidates for each\n   service function in it. This document discusses
    the required\n   components during the instantiation of service function chain
    in the\n   network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
