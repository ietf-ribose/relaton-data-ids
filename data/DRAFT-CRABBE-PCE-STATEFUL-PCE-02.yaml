abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides\n   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n
    \  computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n\n   Although
    PCEP explicitly makes no assumptions regarding the\n   information available to
    the PCE, it also makes no provisions for\n   synchronization or PCE control of
    timing and sequence of path\n   computations within and across PCEP sessions.
    \ This document\n   describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable this functionality,\n
    \  providing stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)\n   Traffic
    Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP) via PCEP.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
