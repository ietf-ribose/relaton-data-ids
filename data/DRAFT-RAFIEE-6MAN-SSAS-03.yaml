abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The default method for IPv6 address generation uses an\n   Organizationally
    Unique Identifier (OUI) assigned by the IEEE\n   Standards Association and an
    Extension Identifier assigned to the\n   hardware manufacturer [1] (section 2.5.1
    RFC-4291) [RFC4291]. This\n   fact thus means that a node will always have the
    same Interface ID\n   (IID) whenever it connects to a new network. Because the
    node's IP\n   address does not change, the node will be vulnerable to privacy\n
    \  related attacks. Currently this problem is addressed by the use of\n   two
    mechanisms that do not make use of the MAC address, or other\n   unique values
    that can be used for ID generation, for randomizing the\n   IID; Cryptographically
    Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] and\n   Privacy Extension [RFC4941]. The problem
    with the former approach is\n   the computational cost involved for the IID generation
    and in the\n   verification process. The problem with the latter approach is that
    it\n   lacks necessary security mechanisms and provides the node with only\n   partial
    protection against privacy related attacks. This document\n   proposes the use
    of a new algorithm for use in the generation of the\n   IID while, at the same
    time, securing the node against some types of\n   attack, like IP spoofing. These
    attacks are prevented by the addition\n   of a signature to messages sent over
    the network and by direct use of\n   a public key in the IP address.\n\n\n\n\t
