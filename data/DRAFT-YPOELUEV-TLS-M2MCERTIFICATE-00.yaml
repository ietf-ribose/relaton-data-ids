abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines Transport Layer Security (TLS) extensions and\nassociated
    semantics that allow clients and servers to negotiate the\nuse of M2M certificates
    for a TLS/DTLS session, and specifies how to\ntransport M2M certificates via TLS/DTLS.
    \ It also defines the registry\nfor non-X.509 certificate types.\n\nThe X.509
    public key certificate format is overly verbose for Internet-\nof-Things (IoT)
    constrained environments, where nodes with limited\nmemory and networks with limited
    bandwidth are not uncommon.  The\nMachine-to-Machine (M2M) certificate format
    is a pruned down and\nencoding-optimized replacement for X.509, which reuses much
    of the\nX.509 semantics but reduces certificate sizes by typically 40%.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
