abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has been designed with
    TCP as\n   an underlying transport protocol.  The Constrained Application\n   Protocol
    (CoAP), which has been inspired by HTTP, has on the other\n   hand been defined
    to make use of UDP.  Reliable delivery, a simple\n   congestion control mechanism,
    and flow control had been added to the\n   CoAP protocol.  UDP is a good choice
    for networks that do not perform\n   any form of filtering and firewalling.  There
    are, however, many\n   deployment environments where UDP is either firewalled
    or subject to\n   deep packet inspection.  These environments make the use of
    CoAP\n   brittle.\n\n   This document defines the use of CoAP over TCP as well
    as CoAP over\n   TLS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
