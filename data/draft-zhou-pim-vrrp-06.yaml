abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces VRRP-aware PIM, a redundancy mechanism for
    the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) to interoperate with the Virtual Router
    Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). It allows PIM to track VRRP state and to preserve
    multicast traffic upon failover in a redundant network with virtual routing groups
    enabled. The mechanism described in this document is based on Cisco IOS software
    implementation.</p>"
