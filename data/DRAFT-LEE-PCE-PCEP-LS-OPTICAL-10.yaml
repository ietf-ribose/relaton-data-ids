abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to compute and provide optimal paths, Path Computation\n
    \  Elements (PCEs) require an accurate and timely Traffic Engineering\n   Database
    (TED). Traditionally this Link State and TE information has\n   been obtained
    from a link state routing protocol (supporting traffic\n   engineering extensions).\n\n
    \  This document extends the Path Communication Element Communication\n   Protocol
    (PCEP) with Link-State and TE information for optical\n   networks.\n\n\n\n\t
