abstract:
  content: "<p>To determine which domain is allowed to claim ownership of a certaintelephone
    number is difficult. This may cause problems when toauthenticate endpoints that
    use telephone number URIs and domainnames in their From address. This document
    investigates a proposalthat stores a public key below the corresponding ENUM tree
    in theDNS. The verifier can determine ownership by performing an ENUMlookup to
    retrieve the public key from the DNS and to use it forverifying the signature
    created as part of the SIP Identitymechanism.This document is a contribution to
    the ongoing discussion on RFC 4474when used in combination with E.164 numbers.</p>"
