abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document recommends ways to reduce forged-origin hijack
    attack\n   surface by prudently limiting the set of IP prefixes that are\n   included
    in a Route Origin Authorization (ROA).  One recommendation\n   is to avoid using
    the maxLength attribute in ROAs except in some\n   specific cases.  The recommendations
    complement and extend those in\n   RFC 7115.  The document also discusses creation
    of ROAs for\n   facilitating the use of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)\n
    \  mitigation services.  Considerations related to ROAs and origin\n   validation
    in the context of destination-based Remote Triggered Black\n   Hole (RTBH) filtering
    are also highlighted.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
