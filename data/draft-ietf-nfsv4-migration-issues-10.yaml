abstract:
- content: "<p>The migration feature of NFSv4 provides for moving responsibility for
    a single filesystem from one server to another, without disruption to clients.
    Recent implementation experience has shown problems in the existing specification
    for this feature. This document discusses options to cure issues which have arisen.
    It also explains the choices made in updating the NFSv4.0 specification and those
    to be made with regard to the NFSv4.1 specification, in order to properly address
    migration.</p>"
