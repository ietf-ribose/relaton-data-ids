abstract:
- content: "<p>BIER is a scalable multicast overlay [RFC8279] that utilizes a routing
    underlay, e.g., IP, to build up its Bit Index Forwarding Tables (BIFTs). This
    document proposes Fast Reroute Extensions for BIER (BIER-FRR). It protects BIER
    traffic after detecting the failure of a link or node in the core of a BIER domain
    until affected BIFT entries are recomputed after reconvergence of the routing
    underlay. The BIER-FRR extensions are applied locally at the point of local repair
    (PLR) and do not introduce any per-flow state. The document specifies nomenclature
    for BIER-FRR and gives examples for its integration in BIER forwarding. Furthermore,
    it presents operation modes for BIER-FRR. Link and node protection may be chosen
    as protection level. Moreover, the backup strategies tunnel-based BIER-FRR and
    LFA-based BIER-FRR are defined and compared.</p>"
