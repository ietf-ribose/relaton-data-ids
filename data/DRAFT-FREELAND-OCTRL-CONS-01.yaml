abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Work on extensions to IP control protocols for reuse in the control\nplane
    of optical transport networks has now been underway for around\na year in the
    MPLS and IPO groups.  Recent discussions have however\nhighlighted a lack of defined
    requirements that should be met by\ncandidate protocols being considered for the
    optical control plane.\nIndeed, there have been several requests for carriers
    to submit\ntheir requirements.  This draft provides one view of some (but by no\nmeans
    all) of these requirements.  A protocol independent approach\nis taken, and the
    authors recommend that the design of any\nparticular facet of an optical control
    plane should take into\naccount the considerations made in this document.\n\t
