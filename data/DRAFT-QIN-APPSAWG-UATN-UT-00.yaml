abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Moving data center closer to end users can provide numerous
    benefits\n   for pre-uploaded content: lower latency, increased robustness of\n
    \  delivery, and improved quality of user experience.  For these\n   reasons,
    many Online Storage Service Providers(OSSPs),Photos Sharing\n   Service Providers
    (PSSPs), and Videos Sharing Service\n   Providers(VSSPs), etc., are scaling up
    their infrastructure, and many\n   above Upload Service Providers(USPs)are also
    deploying their own\n   cloud platforms to improve data upload rate.  It is generally\n
    \  desirable that a given content item generated by end users can be\n   quickly
    and robustly delivered to the destination regardless of that\n   end user's location
    or attachment network.  This is the motivation\n   for deploying Upload Acceleration
    Transport Network(UATN) so it can\n   propose an open content delivery infrastructure
    for the end-to-end\n   delivery of content from end users to the destination(data
    center or\n   another end user, etc.).  However, no standards or open\n   specifications
    currently exist to facilitate such an upload\n   acceleration mechanism.\n\n   The
    goal of this document is to explain the proposed UATN in detail\n   for providing
    public upload acceleration service and interconnect\n   existing upload acceleration
    systems as an open content delivery\n   infrastructur.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
