abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo registers a trace field clause for use in indicating transitions
    between handling queues or processing states, including enacting inter- and intra-host
    message transitions. This might include message quarantining, mailing list moderation,
    timed delivery, queueing for further analysis, content conversion, or other similar
    causes, as well as optionally identifying normal handling queues.</p>"
