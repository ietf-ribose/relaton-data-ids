abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The stateful PCE extensions
    allow stateful control of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) using PCEP. A Path Computation Client (PCC) can
    synchronize an LSP state information to a Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE).
    The stateful PCE extension allows a redundancy scenario where a PCC can have redundant
    PCEP sessions towards multiple PCEs. In such a case, a PCC gives control on a
    LSP to only a single PCE, and only one PCE is responsible for path computation
    for this delegated LSP. The document does not state the procedures related to
    an inter-PCE stateful communication. There are some use cases, where an inter-PCE
    stateful communication can bring additional resiliency in the design for instance
    when some PCC-PCE sessions fails. The inter-PCE stateful communication may also
    provide a faster update of the LSP states when an event occurs. Finally, when,
    in a redundant PCE scenario, there is a need to compute a set of paths that are
    part of a group (so there is a dependency between the paths), there may be some
    cases where the computation of all paths in the group is not handled by the same
    PCE: this situation is called a split-brain. This split-brain scenario may lead
    to computation loops between PCEs or suboptimal paths computation. This document
    describes the procedures to allow a stateful communication between PCEs for various
    use-cases and also the procedures to prevent computations loops.</p>"
