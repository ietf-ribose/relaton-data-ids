abstract:
- content: "<p>Web bundles provide a way to bundle up groups of HTTP responses, with
    the request URLs and content negotiation that produced them, to transmit or store
    together. They can include multiple top-level resources, provide random access
    to their component exchanges, and efficiently store 8-bit resources.</p>"
