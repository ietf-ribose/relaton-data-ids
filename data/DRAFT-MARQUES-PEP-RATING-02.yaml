abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In many Opportunistic Security scenarios end-to-end encryption
    is\n   automatized for Internet users.  In addition, it is often required to\n
    \  provide the users with easy means to carry out authentication.\n\n   Depending
    on several factors, each communication channel to different\n   peers may have
    a different Privacy Status, e.g., unencrypted,\n   encrypted and encrypted as
    well as authenticated.  Even each message\n   from/to a single peer may have a
    different Privacy Status.\n\n   To display the actual Privacy Status to the user,
    this document\n   defines a Privacy Rating scheme and its mapping to a traffic-light\n
    \  semantics.  A Privacy Status is defined on a per-message basis as\n   well
    as on a per-identity basis.  The traffic-light semantics (as\n   color rating)
    allows for a clear and easily understandable\n   presentation to the user in order
    to optimize the User Experience\n   (UX).\n\n   This rating system is most beneficial
    to Opportunistic Security\n   scenarios and is already implemented in several
    applications of\n   pretty Easy privacy (pEp).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
