abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the \"Depth-First Forwarding\" (DFF)
    protocol\n   for IPv6 networks, a data forwarding mechanism that can increase\n
    \  reliability of data delivery in networks with dynamic topology and/or\n   lossy
    links.  The protocol operates entirely on the forwarding plane,\n   but may interact
    with the routing plane.  DFF forwards data packets\n   using a mechanism similar
    to a \"depth-first search\" for the\n   destination of a packet.  The routing
    plane may be informed of\n   failures to deliver a packet or loops.  This document
    specifies the\n   DFF mechanism both for IPv6 networks (as specified in RFC2460)
    and in\n   addition also for LoWPAN \"mesh-under\" networks (as specified in\n
    \  RFC4944).  DFF assumes that the underlying link layer provides means\n   to
    detect if a packet has been successfully delivered to the next hop\n   or not,
    is designed for networks with little traffic, and is used for\n   unicast transmissions
    only.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
