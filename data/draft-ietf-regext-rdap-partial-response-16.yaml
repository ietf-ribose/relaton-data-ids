abstract:
- content: "<p>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include capabilities
    to request partial responses. Servers will only return full responses that include
    all of the information that a client is authorized to receive. A partial response
    capability that limits the amount of information returned, especially in the case
    of search queries, could bring benefits to both clients and servers. This document
    describes an RDAP query extension that allows clients to specify their preference
    for obtaining a partial response.</p>"
