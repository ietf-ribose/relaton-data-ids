abstract:
  content: "<p>Some LLN subnets are expected to scale up to the thousands of nodes
    and hundreds of routers. This paper proposes an IPv6 version of the Backbone Router
    concept that enables such a degree of scalability using a high speed network as
    a backbone to the subnet.</p>"
