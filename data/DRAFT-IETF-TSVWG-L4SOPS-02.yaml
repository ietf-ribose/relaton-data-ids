abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is intended to provide guidance in order to ensure\n
    \  successful deployment of Low Latency Low Loss Scalable throughput\n   (L4S)
    in the Internet.  Other L4S documents provide guidance for\n   running an L4S
    experiment, but this document is focused solely on\n   potential interactions
    between L4S flows and flows using the original\n   ('Classic') ECN over a Classic
    ECN bottleneck link.  The document\n   discusses the potential outcomes of these
    interactions, describes\n   mechanisms to detect the presence of Classic ECN bottlenecks,
    and\n   identifies opportunities to prevent and/or detect and resolve\n   fairness
    problems in such networks.  This guidance is aimed at\n   operators of end-systems,
    operators of networks, and researchers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
