abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) is dual
    text-\n   binary encoding format that has the unique property of text-binary\n
    \  concatenation composability.  This composability property enables the\n   round
    trip conversion en-masse of concatenated primitives between the\n   text domain
    and binary domain while maintaining separability of\n   individual primtives.
    \ This enables convenient usability in the text\n   domain and compact transmission
    in the binary domain.  CESR\n   primitives are self-framing.  CESR supports self-framing
    group codes\n   that enable stream processing and pipelining in both the text
    and\n   binary domains.  CESR supports composable text-binary encodings for\n
    \  general data types as well as suites of cryptographic material.\n   Popular
    cryptographic material suites have compact encodings for\n   efficiency while
    less compact encodings provide sufficient\n   extensibility to support all foreseeable
    types.  CESR streams also\n   support interleaved JSON, CBOR, and MGPK serializations.
    \ CESR is a\n   universal encoding that uniquely provides dual text and binary
    domain\n   representations via composable conversion.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
