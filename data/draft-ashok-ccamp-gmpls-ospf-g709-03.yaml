abstract:
  content: "\t <t>As OTN network capabilities continue to evolve, there is an increasedneed
    to support GMPLS control for the same. [RFC4328] introducedGMPLS signaling extensions
    for supporting the early version of G.709[G.709-v1]. The basic routing considerations
    from signalingperspective is also specified in [RFC4328].The recent revision of
    ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G.709-v3] and[GSUP.43] have introduced new ODU containers
    (both fixed andflexible) and additional ODU multiplexing capabilities, enablingsupport
    for optimal service aggregation. This document describes OSPF protocol extensions
    to supportGeneralized MPLS (GMPLS) control for routing services over thestandardized
    OTU/ODU containers in support of ODU based TDMswitching. Routing support for Optical
    Channel Layer switching(Lambda switching) is not covered in this document.</p>"
