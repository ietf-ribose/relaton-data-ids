abstract:
- content: "<p>As OTN network capabilities continue to evolve, there is an increased
    need to support GMPLS control for the same. [RFC4328] introduced GMPLS signaling
    extensions for supporting the early version of G.709 [G.709-v1]. The basic routing
    considerations from signaling perspective is also specified in [RFC4328]. The
    recent revision of ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G.709-v3] and [GSUP.43] have introduced
    new ODU containers (both fixed and flexible) and additional ODU multiplexing capabilities,
    enabling support for optimal service aggregation. This document describes OSPF
    protocol extensions to support Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) control for routing services
    over the standardized OTU/ODU containers in support of ODU based TDM switching.
    Routing support for Optical Channel Layer switching (Lambda switching) is not
    covered in this document.</p>"
