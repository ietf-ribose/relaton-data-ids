abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides the supporting test plan and results to advance
    RFC 2679 on one-way delay metrics along the Standards Track, following the process
    in RFC 6576. Observing that the metric definitions themselves should be the primary
    focus rather than the implementations of metrics, this memo describes the test
    procedures to evaluate specific metric requirement clauses to determine if the
    requirement has been interpreted and implemented as intended. Two completely independent
    implementations have been tested against the key specifications of RFC 2679. This
    memo also provides direct input for development of a revision of RFC 2679. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"
