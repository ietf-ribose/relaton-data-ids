abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a protocol which enables resource\n
    \  constrained nodes to perform authentication and authorization\n   operations
    in a constrained environment.  By using this protocol, a\n   resource constrained
    node can delegate the authentication of\n   communication peers and management
    of authorization information to a\n   trusted third party with less severe limitations
    regarding processing\n   power and memory.\n\n   This specification is based on
    the pull model architecture.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
