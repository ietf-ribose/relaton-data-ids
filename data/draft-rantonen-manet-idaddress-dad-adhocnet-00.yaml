abstract:
  content: "<p>Many kinds of mobile user equipments may want to join or createwireless
    local area network. Today connectivity is usually based onusing the IP address
    as the identifier for the device. However, suchkinds of devices do not necessary
    have a static IP address. Someautoconfiguration procedures are developed for fixed
    networks, butthose procedures have requirements that Manet does not satisfy. Forad
    hoc networks, some IPv6 address autoconfiguration solutions aredeveloped during
    recent years.In this document, an autoconfiguration mechanism for mobile ad hoc
    network nodes will be described. A hardware based addressing will bepresented
    as one approach to create a temporary IPv6 address.Furthermore, a solution for
    minimizing Duplicate Address Detectionprocedures while generating a globally unique
    IPv6 address will beexplained.</p>"
