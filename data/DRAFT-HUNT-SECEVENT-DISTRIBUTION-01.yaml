abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines how a series of security event tokens\n
    \  (SETs) may be delivered to a previously registered receiver using\n   HTTP
    over TLS.  The specification defines the metadata the an Event\n   Transmitter
    uses to describe the Event Receiver's HTTP endpoint and\n   the SET token delivery
    configuration.  The specification defines how\n   the Event Receiver may check
    the current configuration metadata and\n   delivery status using HTTP GET over
    TLS.  The specification also\n   defines how delivery can be assured subject to
    the SET Token\n   Receiver's need for assurance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
