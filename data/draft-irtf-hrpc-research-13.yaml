abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims to propose guidelines for human rights considerations,
    similar to the work done on the guidelines for privacy considerations [RFC6973].
    If you want to apply this work to your own, you can directly go to Section 6.
    The rest of the document explains the background of the guidelines and how they
    were developed. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes. This informational document has consensus
    for publication from the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) Human Right Protocol
    Considerations Research Group. It is the first milestone in a longer term research
    effort and has been reviewed both by the research group and by individuals from
    outside the research group. Many of the topics discussed are still under discussion
    in the research group and will be subjects of continuing research.</p>"
