abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes a mechanism for BGP that would help minimizethe
    negative effects on routing caused by BGP restart. An End-of-RIBmarker is specified
    and can be used to convey routing convergenceinformation. A new BGP capability,
    termed 'Graceful RestartCapability', is defined which would allow a BGP speaker
    to expressits ability to preserve forwarding state during BGP restart. Finally,procedures
    are outlined for temporarily retaining routing informationacross a TCP transport
    reset.</p>"
