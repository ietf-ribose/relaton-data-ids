abstract:
- content: "<p>Network operators define their BGP policies based on the business relationships
    that they maintain with their peers. By limiting the propagation of BGP prefixes,
    an autonomous system avoids the existence of flows between BGP peers that do not
    provide any economical gain. This draft describes how undesired flows can emerge
    in autonomous systems due to the filtering of overlapping BGP prefixes by neighboring
    domains.</p>"
