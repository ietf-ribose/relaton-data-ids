abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>On demand Internet services with guaranteed throughput are the
    major\ndriver behind QoS signaling architectures. Guaranteeing throughput\nbetween
    two defined points of a DiffServ network requires a\ncombination of flow information
    and Per Hop Behaviour. Handling\naggregates instead of flows as specified by the
    DiffServ\narchitecture is the most reasonable attempt to do so. This document\ndescribes
    an architecture using DiffServ mechanisms to provide\non demand throughput guarantees
    between two points of a DiffServ\nnetwork.\n\t </p>\n      "
