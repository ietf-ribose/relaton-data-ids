- content: "<p>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality
    of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. The overall PCN
    architecture is described in RFC 5559. This memo is one of a series describing
    possible boundary node behaviours for a PCN domain. The behaviour described here
    is denoted as the HOSE model.</p>"
