abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS over TLS (DoT) has been gaining attention, primarily as
    a means\n   of communication between stub resolvers and recursive resolvers.\n
    \  There have also been discussions and experiments involving the use of\n   DoT
    to communicate with authoritative nameservers (Authoritative DNS\n   over TLS
    or \"ADoT\"), including communication between recursive and\n   authoritative
    resolvers.  However, we have identified a number of\n   operational concerns with
    ADoT that have arisen as DNS operators have\n   begun to experiment with and prepare
    for deploying DoT.  These\n   operational concerns need to be addressed prior
    to ADoT's deployment\n   at scale by DNS operators in order to maintain the stability
    and\n   resilience of the global DNS.  The document also provides some\n   suggested
    next steps to advance the operator community's\n   understanding of ADoT's operational
    impact.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
