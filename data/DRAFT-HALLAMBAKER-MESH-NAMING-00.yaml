abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The importance of naming in information systems is explained
    with\n   reference to a typical use case.  Existing Internet naming systems\n
    \  attempt to strike a balance between usability and machine\n   readability.
    \ An alternative approach in which separate classes of\n   identifiers are introduced
    for human and machine interaction is\n   described.  Human Interaction Identifiers
    are interpreted in the\n   context in which they are used and are thus more compact
    and offer a\n   superior user experience.  Strong Internet Names are a form of\n
    \  Machine Interaction Identifier that are backwards compatible with\n   existing
    Internet names that include a DNS address and are\n   cryptographically bound
    to a security policy governing\n   interpretation.  The application of these approaches
    in the\n   Mathematical Mesh is described.\n\n   This document is also available
