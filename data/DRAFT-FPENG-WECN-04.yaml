abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>TCP congestion control has been developed on the assumption that
    \ncongestion in the network to be the only cause for packet loss. Thus, \nit drops
    its transmit window upon detecting a packet loss. In the \npresence of high erro
    rates and intermittent connective \ncharacteristic of wireless link, these results
    in an unnecessary \nreduction in link bandwidth utilization for packet losses
    are not \nmainly due to congestion.\n\t </p>\n      "
