abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes procedures to support node protection for (unicast)
    Label Switched Paths(LSPs) established by LDP("Label Distribution Protocol").
    In order to protect a node N, the Point of Local Repair (PLR) of N must discover
    the Merge Points(MPTs) of node N such that traffic can be redirected to them in
    case node N fails. Redirecting the traffic around the failed node N depends on
    existing point-to-point LSPs originated from the PLR to the MPTs while bypassing
    the protected node N. The procedures described in this document are topology independent
    in a sense that they provide node protection in any topology.</p>
