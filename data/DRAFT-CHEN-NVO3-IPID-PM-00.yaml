abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   IP Identification(IPID)is a field in IP header primarily
    used to\n   uniquely identify the group of fragments of a single IP packet. The\n
    \  value of IPID field in a packet from a specific traffic flow or\n   source
    IP address keeps increasing until wrapped-around.\n\n   This document specifies
    a method by carefully examining IPID value to\n   monitor the performance of VXLAN
    network. In this memo packet loss\n   measurement is mainly considered. This method
    requires no extra\n   hardware support, which means it is compatible with most
    of the\n   deployed routers or switches. Such a mechanism is applicable to IPv4\n
    \  network and potential useful in overlay network with different data\n   encapsulation.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
