abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a service-identifying label that allows
    \tvenue-based services that are locally offered by the venue owner to \tbe identified.
    In particular, we define labels for the most known \tand common venue services
    (e.g. mapping and printer). These labels \tcan be used by IEEE 802.11 and service
    discovery protocols to \tdiscover the available services specific to the venue
    and \taccessible via the Wireless LAN.</p>"
