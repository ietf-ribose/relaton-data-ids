abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We describe two extensions to the Certificate Revocation List
    v2 to\n   more strongly identify revoked and legitimately issued certificates.\n
    \  This creates a means for non-CA OCSP responders which are fed by CRL\n   and
    can parse these extensions to presume that unlisted or non-\n   matching certificates
    from that Issuer are REVOKED rather than\n   UNKNOWN, as well as creating a means
    by which the Issuer can provide\n   digest values for stronger certificate authentication.\n\n
    \  Placing issuance data within the CRL in some ways violates the\n   original
    intent of the CRL, but CRLv2 has places for Extensions.  It\n   is a logical extension
    to permit existing buildout to address newly-\n   exploited vulnerabilities in
    the model.\n\n   A new crlEntryExtension is defined to permit the optional provision\n
    \  of several hashes of each certificate on the list of revoked\n   certificates.
    \ In addition, a new crlExtension is defined to provide\n   serial numbers and
    hashes of issued certificates.  Neither of these\n   extensions needs to be marked
    critical, and the original semantics\n   are preserved for existing clients.\n\n
    \  Notably, no data format or protocol of PKIX can currently utilize\n   any extra
    hashes to provide any extra authentication or security.\n   Nevertheless, until
    there is a standard way for the CA issuer to\n   provide these digest values,
    it's impossible to build anything which\n   uses them.\n\n   The downside: Whitelist
    CRLs with strong certificate authentication\n   data are *huge*.  The canonical
    1MB CRL example would, if extended\n   with this extra information, balloon to
    at a minimum 2.5MB\n   (presuming random 20-byte serial numbers) to a single-digest
    maximum\n   of approximately 400MB.  CAs are encouraged not to alter their\n   current
    CRL production, and produce these extensions only when\n   needed by a certificate
    status server or consuming client.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
