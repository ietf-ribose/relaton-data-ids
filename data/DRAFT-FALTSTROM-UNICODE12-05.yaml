abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the changes between Unicode 6.0.0 and
    Unicode\n   12.0.0 in the context of IDNA2008.  Some additions and changes have\n
    \  been made in the Unicode Standard that affect the values produced by\n   the
    algorithm IDNA2008 specifies.  IDNA2008 allows adding exceptions\n   to the algorithm
    for backward compatibility; however, this document\n   does not add any such exceptions.
    \ This document provides the\n   necessary tables to IANA to make its database
    consistent with Unicode\n   12.0.0.\n\n   To improve understanding, this document
    describes systems that are\n   being used as alternatives to those that conform
    to IDNA2008.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED AT TIME OF PUBLICATION AS AN RFC:\n\n   This
    document is discussed on the i18n-discuss@ietf.org mailing list\n   of the IETF.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
