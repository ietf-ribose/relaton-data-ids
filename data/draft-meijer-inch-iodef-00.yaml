abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The purpose of the Incident Object Description and Exchange Format
    isto define a common data format for describing and exchanging incidentinformation
    between collaborating Computer Security Incident ResponseTeams (CSIRTs). The specific
    goals and requirements of the IODEF aredescribed in [2]. One of the design principles
    in the IODEF iscompatibility with the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format(IDMEF)
    [3] developed for intrusion detection systems. For thisreason, IODEF is heavily
    based on the IDMEF and provides upwardcompatibility with it.</p>"
