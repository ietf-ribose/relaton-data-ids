abstract:
- content: "<p>Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and IPv6-only
    hosts at the same time. Such networks may want to add IPv6/IPv4 translation for
    the IPv6-only host so it can access servers on the IPv4 Internet. Adding translation
    service to the IPv6-enabled network may change dual-stack host behavior and affect
    the way deployed network is working. This document defines the problem statement
    for such networks.</p>"
