abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When RFC 6374 \"Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS
    Networks\"\n   were developed, the code points allocated by this RFC were mistakenly\n
    \  placed within the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label\n   Switched
    Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameter registry.  This document creates\n   a new dedicated
    name space for Generic Associated Channel code points\n   and move them to a name
    space their own.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
