abstract:
  content: "<p>There are several applications that require symmetric MultiprotocolLabel
    Switching (MPLS) path between two points. This cannot beachieved with regular
    MPLS as the LSPs are unidirectional. Ifsymmetry is required, a separate LSP in
    each direction is requiredfor bidirectional traffic flow. Generalized MPLS on
    the other hand,has provisions for setting up a bidirectional LSP. This documentuses
    the extensions introduced for GMPLS and applies it to regularMPLS for establishing
    bidirectional LSPs. Additionally, it alsodescribes how bi-directional symmetrical
    Fast Reroute using both one-to-one and facility backup can be achieved.</p>"
