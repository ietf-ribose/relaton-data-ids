    Using Relays around NAT) functionality in certain casesthat are not unlikely to
    occur. There is little incentive to deployTURN servers, except by those who need
    them -- who may not be in aposition to deploy a new protocol on an Internet-connected
    node, inparticular not one with deployment requirements as high as those ofTURN."STUN/TURN
