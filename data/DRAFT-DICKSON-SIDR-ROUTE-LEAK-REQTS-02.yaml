abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Border Gateway Protocol, version 4, (BGP4) provides the
    means to\n   advertise reachability for IP prefixes.  This reachability\n   information
    is propagated in a peer-to-peer topology.  Sometimes\n   routes are announced
    to peers for which the local peering policy does\n   not permit.  And sometimes
    routes are propagated indiscriminantly,\n   once they have been accepted.\n\n
    \  This document is a requirements document for detection of (and\n   prevention
    of) route leaks.\n\n   Together with the definitions document, it is intended
    to suggest\n   solutions which meet these criteria, and to facilitate evaluation
    of\n   proposed solutions.\n\n   The fundamental objective is to \"solve the route
    leaks problem\".\n\n\t </p>\n      "
