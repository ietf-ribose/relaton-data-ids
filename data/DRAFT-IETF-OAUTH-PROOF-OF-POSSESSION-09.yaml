abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines how to express a declaration in
    a JSON Web\n   Token (JWT) that the presenter of the JWT possesses a particular
    key\n   and that the recipient can cryptographically confirm proof-of-\n   possession
    of the key by the presenter.  Being able to prove\n   possession of a key is also
    sometimes described as the presenter\n   being a holder-of-key.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
