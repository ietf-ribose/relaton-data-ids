abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A recurrent theme in emerging real-time communications use
    cases,\n   such as RTCWEB, has been the need to handle very large numbers of\n
    \  media flows.  Unfortunately, naive uses of SDP do not handle this\n   case
    particularly well.  This document describes a modest set of\n   extensions to
    SDP which allow it to cleanly handle arbitrary numbers\n   of flows while still
    retaining a large degree of backward\n   compatibility with existing and non-RTCWEB
    endpoints.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
