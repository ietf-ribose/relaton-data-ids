abstract:
- content: "<p>This document revisits the dual-stack model and introduces the Dual-
    Stack Lite technology aimed at better aligning the costs and benefits of deploying
    IPv6 in service provider networks. Dual-Stack Lite enables a broadband service
    provider to share IPv4 addresses among customers by combining two well-known technologies:
    IP in IP (IPv4- in-IPv6) and Network Address Translation (NAT). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
