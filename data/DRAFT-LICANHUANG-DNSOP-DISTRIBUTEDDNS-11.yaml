abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This file is a proposal for P2P based Domain Name query strategy
    in \nIpV6.  The DNS servers construct n-tuple overlay virtual hierarchical \noverlay
    network.  With cached addresses of DNS servers, the overload of \ntraffic in tree
    structure can be avoided and more security can be  \nenhanced due to the random
    lookup paths. This strategy may use for \nDomain Name query and reverse Domain
    Name query in IpV6 for a large \nnumber of domain names.\n\t </p>\n      "
