abstract:
- content: <p>Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are intended to serve as persistent, location-independent,
    resource identifiers. To structure and organize their usage, the URN syntax (RFC
    2141bis) specifies a hierarchy that divides the set of possible URNs into "URN
    Namespaces" that can be individually defined and managed. URN Namespaces in particular
    serve to map existing identifier systems into the URN system and thereby make
    available generic, network-based resolution services for the identified documents,
    artifacts, and other objects (and metadata related to them). To achive these goals,
    URN Namespaces need to be specified in a comparable manner, and their Namespace
    Identifiers (NIDs) need to be registered with IANA, so that naming conflicts are
    avoided and implementers of services can follow a structured approach in support
    of various namespaces, guided by the registry to the related documents and the
    particularities of specific namespaces, as described in these Namespace registration
    documents. This RFC serves as a guideline for authors of URN Namespace definition
    and registration documents and the process to be followed to register a URN Namespace
    with IANA. It describes the essential content of such documents and how they shall
    be structured to allow readers familar with the scheme to quickly assess the properties
    of a specific URN Namespace. This document is a companion document to the revised
    URN Syntax specification, RFC 2141bis; it supersedes and replaces RFC 3406.</p>
