abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the Static Context Header Compression
    (SCHC)\n   framework, which provides both header compression and fragmentation\n
    \  functionalities.  SCHC has been designed for Low Power Wide Area\n   Networks
    (LPWAN).\n\n   SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored in
    both\n   the LPWAN device and the network side.  This document defines a\n   header
    compression mechanism and its application to compress IPv6/UDP\n   headers.\n\n
    \  This document also specifies a fragmentation and reassembly mechanism\n   that
    is used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over the LPWAN\n   technologies.  Fragmentation
    is needed for IPv6 datagrams that, after\n   SCHC compression or when such compression
    was not possible, still\n   exceed the layer-2 maximum payload size.\n\n   The
    SCHC header compression and fragmentation mechanisms are\n   independent of the
    specific LPWAN technology over which they are\n   used.  This document defines
    generic functionalities and offers\n   flexibility with regard to parameter settings
    and mechanism choices.\n   This document standardizes the exchange over the LPWAN
    between two\n   SCHC entities.  Settings and choices specific to a technology
    or a\n   product are expected to be grouped into profiles, which are specified\n
    \  in other documents.  Data models for the context and profiles are out\n   of
    scope.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
