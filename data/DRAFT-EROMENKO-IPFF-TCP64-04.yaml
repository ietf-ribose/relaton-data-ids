abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document attempts to modernize TCP protocol for new reality,\n
    \  faster bandwidth, encryption-optimization and optional checksums,\n   which
    is required for Identity-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP)\n   compatibility.\n
    \  This extension is backwards compatible with the original TCP\n   specification
    during session establishment, but not compatible\n   during the rest of the session
    nor with deployed middleboxes.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
