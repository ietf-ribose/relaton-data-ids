abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Delivery of streaming media to a large number of clients distributedacross
    several geographic and network boundaries presents severalchallenges in terms
    of scalability and stream quality. This documentdescribes N-tier relays to address
    scalability and quality issues inthe delivery of stored and live content. This
    document addressesissues in stream synchronization, content announcement/expiry,reliability
    of transport, failover/recovery, administration, andsecurity issues. This document
    propose a set of primitives to enableimplementation of Push and Pull mechanisms
    for N-tier relays. We alsoprovide usage scenarios where each approach is most
    useful. The Pulland Push mechanisms are complementary and provide valuable buildingblocks
    in N-tier relays. This document introduces a few new RTSPmethods and headers.</p>"
