abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol
    (EPP)\n   extension for notifying clients of operations on client sponsored\n
    \  objects that were not initiated by the client through EPP.  These\n   operations
    MAY include contractual or policy requirements including\n   but not limited to
    regular batch processes, customer support actions,\n   Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution
    Policy (UDRP) or Uniform Rapid\n   Suspension (URS) actions, court directed actions,
    and bulk updates\n   based on customer requests.  Since the client is not directly\n
    \  involved or knowledgable of these operations, the extension is used\n   along
    with an EPP object mapping to provide the resulting state of\n   the post-operation
    object, and optionally a pre-operation object,\n   with the operation meta-data
    of what, when, who, and why.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
