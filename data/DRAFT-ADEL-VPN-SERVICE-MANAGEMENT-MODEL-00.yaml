abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently new services create new opportunities for both network\n
    \  providers and service providers. Shared Unified Policy Automation\n   (SUPA)
    was proposed to develop a model that abstracts network\n   resources and services
    and a methodology by which the management\n   and monitoring of network services
    can be done using standardized\n   policy rules. This document defines a VPN service
    management yang\n   data model and gives an example for DDC use case.\n\n\n\n\t
