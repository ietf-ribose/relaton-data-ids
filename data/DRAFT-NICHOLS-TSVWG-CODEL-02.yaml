abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The \"persistently full buffer\" problem has been discussed
    in the IETF\n   community since the early 80's [RFC896].  The IRTF's End-to-End\n
    \  Working Group called for the deployment of active queue management\n   (AQM)
    to solve the problem in 1998 [RFC2309].  Despite the awareness,\n   the problem
    gotten worse as by Moore's Law growth in memory density\n   fueled an exponential
    increase in buffer pool size.  Efforts to\n   deploy AQM have been frustrated
    by difficult configuration and\n   negative impact on network utilization.  The
    full buffer problem,\n   recently christened \"bufferbloat\"[TSVBB2011, BB2011]
    has become\n   increasingly important throughout the Internet but particularly
    at\n   the consumer edge.\n\n   To address bufferbloat, this document describes
    a general framework\n   for controlling excessived delay in networks called Controlled
    Delay\n   (CoDel) designed to work in modern networking environments as a part\n
    \  of the solution to bufferbloat [CODEL2012].  CoDel consists of an\n   estimator,
    a setpoint, and a control loop and can be deployed in the\n   Internet without
    configuration.  CoDel comprises some major technical\n   innovations and has been
    made available as open source so that the\n   framework can be applied by the
    community to a range of problems.  It\n   has been implemented in Linux (and available
    in the Linux\n   distribution) and deployed in some networks at the consumer edge.
    \ In\n   addition, the framework has been successfully applied in other ways.\n\n
    \  Note: Code Components extracted from this document must include the\n   license
