abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NDP resource exhastion is a problem which cannot fundamently
    be\n   addressed through limited protocol changes or implementation tweaks;\n
    \  mitigations proposed in RFC 6583 [RFC6583] may well prevent the\n   outright
    failure of a device under duress.  This draft discusses some\n   mitigations which
    have or can be employeed by networks looking to\n   reduce or eliminate the exposure
    of the Neighbor Discovery Process.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
