abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT), a
    protocol for delivering multicast traffic from sources in a multicast-enabled
    network to receivers that lack multicast connectivity to the source network. The
    protocol uses UDP encapsulation and unicast replication to provide this functionality.\n\n
    The AMT protocol is specifically designed to support rapid deployment by requiring
    minimal changes to existing network infrastructure.\n\t </p>\n      "
