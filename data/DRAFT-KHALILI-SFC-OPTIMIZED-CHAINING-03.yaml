abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft investigates possibilities to use so-called 'transport-\n
    \  derived service function forwarders' (tSFFs) that uses existing\n   transport
    information for explicit service path information. The\n   draft discusses two
    such possibilities, focusing on realization of\n   efficient chaining over single
    transport networks. In the first one,\n   the transport network is SDN-based.
    The second one introduces and\n   explains a specific service request routing
    (SRR) function to support\n   URL-level routing of service requests.\n\n\t </p>\n
