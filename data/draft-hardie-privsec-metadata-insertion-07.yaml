abstract:
- content: "<p>The IAB has published RFC7624 in response to several revelations of
    pervasive attack on Internet communications. This document considers the implications
    of protocol designs which associate metadata with encrypted flows. In particular,
    it asserts that designs which do so by explicit actions at the host are preferable
    to designs in which middleboxes insert them.</p>"
