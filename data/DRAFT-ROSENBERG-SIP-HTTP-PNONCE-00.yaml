abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The HTTP Digest algorithm, specified in RFC 2617, allows for\nauthentication
    of a request, along with integrity checks over the\nmethod, request URI, and optionally,
    the body. HTTP Digest is the\nprimary client authentication mechanism used by
    SIP. However, Digest\ndoes not provide for integrity checks over several key SIP
    headers,\nincluding the To, From, Call-ID and Contact headers. We define a\nmechanism
    for supporting integrity over these headers, using a new\nalgorithm we call predictive
    nonces. The mechanism requires no\nchanges in clients, and no protocol changes.
    It requires only a\nchange in the way the nonce is computed by servers.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
