abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a new loop-free IP fast reroute mechanism
    which\n   enhances the IP Fast-ReRoute (IPFRR) [1,15] by introducing the \n   concept
    of pre-computed remote Loop-Free Alternate Paths (rLFAPs) on \n   top of the IPFRR
    local LFAP. In rLFAP, a router which is adjacent to \n   the failed resource switches
    over to pre-computed LFAPs, if they\n   exist, immediately after failure detection.
    Multi-hop neighbors \n   (MNBs) are notified about this remote failure as quickly
    as possible \n   using fast failure notification mechanism. Upon receipt of failure
    \n   information, MNBs activate their pre-computed remote LFAPs that they \n   maintain
    for protecting against remote failures within their \n   multi-hop neighborhoods.
    In the worst case, where IPFRR results in \n   forming micro-loops, rLFAP completely
    prevents micro-loops for \n   single link failures and quickly converges to a
    loop-free path in \n   case of multiple link failures.\n\t </p>\n      "
