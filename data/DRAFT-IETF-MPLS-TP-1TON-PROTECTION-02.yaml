abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a requirement for Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport\n
    \  Profile(MPLS-TP) to support 1:n linear protection for transport\n   paths.
    \ This requirement is further elaborated in RFC6372\n   [SurvivFwk].  The basic
    protocol for linear protection, specified in\n   RFC6378 [LinProt], is limited
    to 1+1 and 1:1 protection.  This\n   document extends that protocol to address
    the additional\n   functionality necessary to support scenarios where a single\n
    \  protection path is preconfigured to provide protection of multiple\n   transport
    paths between two joint endpoints.\n\n   This document is a product of a joint
    Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunications
    Union Telecommunications\n   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include
    an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support
    the\n   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as\n   defined
    by the ITU-T.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
