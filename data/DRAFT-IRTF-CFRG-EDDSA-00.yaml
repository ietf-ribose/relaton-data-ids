abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The elliptic curve signature scheme Edwards-curve Digital Signature\n
    \  Algorithm (EdDSA) is described.  The algorithm is instantiated with\n   recommended
    parameters for the Curve25519 and Curve448 curves.  An\n   example implementation
    and test vectors are provided.\n\n   NOTE: Anything not about Ed25519 in this
    document is extremely\n   premature and there is at least one FIXME that makes
    some things\n   unimplementable.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
