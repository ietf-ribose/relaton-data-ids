abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a light weight route optimization technique
    that\nhelps to optimize the media path between two communicating nodes when\nProxy
    MIP is used as the mobility protocol.  This routing\noptimization technique is
    most useful when the two communicating\nhosts are away from home and need to communicate
    with each other\nusing an optimized path.  It takes advantage of the data packet\nbetween
    LMA and MAG to set up the optimized data path between the\ncommunicating hosts.
    \ This route optimization technique is applicable\nto both the intra-LMA and inter-LMA
    scenarios.\n\t </p>\n      "
