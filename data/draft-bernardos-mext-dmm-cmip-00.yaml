abstract:
  content: "<p>The use of centralized mobility management approaches -- such asMobile
    IPv6 -- poses some difficulties to operators of current andfuture networks, due
    to the expected large number of mobile users andtheir exigent demands. All this
    has triggered the need fordistributed mobility management alternatives, that alleviateoperators'
    concerns allowing for cheaper and more efficient networkdeployments.This draft
    describes a possible way of achieving a distributedmobility behavior with Client
    Mobile IP, based on Mobile IPv6 and theuse of Cryptographic Generated Addresses.</p>"
