abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Identifier-Locator Addressing defined in [I-D.herbert-nvo3-ila]\n
    \  proposes using locator-identifier split in IPv6 address to realize\n   workload
    mobility and network virtualization.  This document\n   describes how ILA can
    be implemented in datacenter using BGP as the\n   control-plane protocol.  In
    general, ILA could be built upon\n   different control planes, and BGP is one
    particular instantiation.\n   BGP is a well-known protocol, sufficient for small
    to medium size\n   deployments, on scale of few millions of mappings.  Defining
    more\n   generic and scalable control plane is outside of scope of this\n   document.\n\n\t
