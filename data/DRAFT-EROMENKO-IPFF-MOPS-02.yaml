abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism, that can be used to live-migrate\n
    \  opened TCP/UDP/other transport sessions between a mobile server and\n   a mobile
    client. This can work even after a mobile node moved to\n   a different subnet
    or disconnected, as long as a session did\n   not timeout.\n   It also describes
    limitations and includes NAT traversal scenarios\n   and guidelines for \"middlebox\"
    vendors.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
