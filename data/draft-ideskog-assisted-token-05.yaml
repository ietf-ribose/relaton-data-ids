abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the OAuth 2.0 framework to include an additional
    authorization flow for single page applications called the assisted token flow.
    It enables OAuth clients written in scripting languages, like JavaScript, to request
    user authorization using a simplified method compared to other flows. Communication
    does not rely on redirection of the user agent, but instead leverages HTML's iframe
    element, child windows, and the postMessage interface. This communication is done
    using an additional endpoint, the assisted token endpoint.</p>"
