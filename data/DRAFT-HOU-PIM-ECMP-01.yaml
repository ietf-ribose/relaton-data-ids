abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A PIM router uses RPF procedure to select an upstream interface
    and\n   router to build forwarding state.  When there are equal cost multiple\n
    \  paths (ECMP), existing implementations often use hash algorithms to\n   select
    a path.  Such algorithms do not allow the spread of traffic\n   among the ECMPs
    according to administrative metrics.  This usually\n   leads to inefficient or
    ineffective use of network resources.  This\n   document introduces the ECMP Assert,
    a mechanism to improve the RPF\n   procedure over ECMPs.  It allows ECMP path
    selection to be based on\n   administratively selected metrics, such as data transmission
    delays,\n   path preferences and routing metrics.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
