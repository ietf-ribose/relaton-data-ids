abstract:
- content: "<p>Client puzzles allow a TLS server to defend itself against asymmetric
    DDoS attacks. In particular, it allows a server to request clients perform a selected
    amount of computation prior to the server performing expensive cryptographic operations.
    This allows servers to employ a layered defense that represents an improvement
    over pure rate-limiting strategies. Client puzzles are implemented as an extension
    to TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] wherein a server can issue a HelloRetryRequest
    containing the puzzle as an extension. The client must then resend its ClientHello
    with the puzzle results in the extension.</p>"
