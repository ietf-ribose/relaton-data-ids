abstract:
  content: "<p>Renewable energy enabled sustainable energy management ensuresa high
    degree of reliability in order to fulfill the energydemand of a smart city. In
    such case, renewable energygeneration is random over time and also energy consumption
    ofsmart city users’ is nondeterministic in nature. Therefore, toensure sustainable
    energy management for smart city,a proactive energy management scheme should be
    integrated intosmart city network. In which, edge node should be considered aslocal
    computational unit for each energy user and microgridcontroller should be played
    the role of energy management decisionaggregator. As a result, proactive energy
    management schemenot only overcomes the challenges of renewable energy-awaredemand
    scheduling but also establishes a strong relationshipfor both energy generation
    and consumption over time.Therefore, a distributed mechanism is considered, where
    the edgenode for executing local agent to determine an individualusers’ policy
    with respect to energy consumption and renewableenergy generation (users’ own
    sources). On the other hand,microgrid controller determines meta-policy through
    a meta-agentwith Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Since a meta-agent acceptslocal
    policy as an input with historical observations, whichensures fast and efficient
    execution of proactive energy managementfor the smart city.</p>"
