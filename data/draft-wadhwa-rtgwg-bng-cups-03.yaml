abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses separation of subscriber-management control
    plane and data-plane for BNG. Traditionally, the BNG provides aggregation of fixed
    access nodes (such as DSLAM and OLTs) over Ethernet and provides subscriber management
    and traffic management functions for residential subscribers. The BNG has however
    evolved to become a multi-access edge device that also provides termination of
    subscribers over fixed-wireless and hybrid access. Therefore, this document proposes
    interfaces between control and user-plane of a BNG that can support multi-access
    BNG.</p>"
