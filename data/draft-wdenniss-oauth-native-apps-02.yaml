abstract:
- content: "<p>OAuth 2.0 authorization requests from native apps should only be made
    through external user-agents such as the system browser (including via an in-app
    browser tab). This specification details the security and usability reasons why
    this is the case, and how native apps and authorization servers can implement
    this best practice.</p>"
