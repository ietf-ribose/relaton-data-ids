abstract:
- content: "<p>CESR Proof Signatures are an extension to the Composable Event Streaming
    Representation [CESR] that provide transposable cryptographic signature attachments
    on self-addressing data (SAD) [SAID]. Any SAD, such as an Authentic Chained Data
    Container (ACDC) Verifiable Credential [ACDC] for example, may be signed with
    a CESR Proof Signature and streamed along with any other CESR content. In addition,
    a signed SAD can be embedded inside another SAD and the CESR proof signature attachment
    can be transposed across envelope boundaries and streamed without losing any cryptographic
    integrity.</p>"
