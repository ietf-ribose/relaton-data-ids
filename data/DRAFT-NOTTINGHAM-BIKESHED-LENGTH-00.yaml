abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The HTTP Content-Length header field is overloaded with (at
    least)\n   two duties: message delimitation in HTTP/1, and metadata about the\n
    \  length of an incoming request body to the software handling it.\n\n   This
    causes confusion, and sometimes problems.  This document\n   proposes a new header
    to untangle these semantics (at least\n   partially).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
