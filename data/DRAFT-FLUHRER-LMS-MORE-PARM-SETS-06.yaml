abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note extends LMS (RFC 8554) by defining parameter sets
    by\n   including additional hash functions.  Hese include hash functions\n   that
    result in signatures with significantly smaller than the\n   signatures using
    the current parameter sets, and should have\n   sufficient security.\n\n   This
    document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG)\n   in the IRTF.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
