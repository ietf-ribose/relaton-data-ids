abstract:
- content: "<p>On network paths where there is significant path asymmetry, acknowledgments
    of data receipt can reduce the efficient use of network capacity. This effect
    occurs when the return capacity is significantly more constrained than the forward
    capacity, or the cost of transmission per packet is a significant component of
    the total transmission cost. In these cases, reducing the ratio of acknowledgements
    to data can improve link utilization and reduce link transmission costs. This
    document proposes a change to the default acknowledgement policy of the QUIC transport
    protocol to improve performance over paths with appreciable asymmetry.</p>"
