abstract:
- content: <p>SenML [I-D.ietf-core-senml] defines a base time attribute and time value
    which is used to determine the time when a value is recorded. In some applications
    a SenML package will contain a series of records related to a constant sample
    time interval, e.g. once every 60 seconds. This means that the time attribute
    will be required for each record. This document defines a new "time offset" base
    attribute that allows a sender to include the time for the sample interval between
    records. If the "time offset" base attribute is used the sender will not send
    the time attribute for each record, minimising message and storage size.</p>
