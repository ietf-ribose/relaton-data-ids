abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a C language application program interface
    to the\nlightweight directory access protocol (LDAP). This document replaces the\nprevious
    definition of this API, defined in RFC 1823, updating it to\ninclude support for
    features found in version 3 of the LDAP protocol.\nNew extended operation functions
    were added to support LDAPv3 features\nsuch as controls.  In addition, other LDAP
    API changes were made to\nsupport information hiding and thread safety.\n \nThe
    C LDAP API is designed to be powerful, yet simple to use. It defines\ncompatible
    synchronous and asynchronous interfaces to LDAP to suit a\nwide variety of applications.
    This document gives a brief overview of\nthe LDAP model, then an overview of how
    the API is used by an applica-\ntion program to obtain LDAP information.  The
    API calls are described in\ndetail, followed by an appendix that provides some
    example code demon-\nstrating the use of the API. This document provides information
    to the\nInternet community. It does not specify any standard.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
