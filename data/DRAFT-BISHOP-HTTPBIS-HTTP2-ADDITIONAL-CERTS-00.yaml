abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many HTTP servers host content from several origins.  HTTP/2\n
    \  [RFC7540] permits clients to reuse an existing HTTP connection to a\n   server
    provided that certain conditions are satisfied.  One of these\n   conditions is
    the inclusion of the secondary origin in the\n   certificate provided during the
    TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] handshake.\n\n   In many cases, origins will wish to
    maintain separate certificates\n   for different origins but still desire the
    benefits of a shared HTTP\n   connection.  This draft describes how frames which
    were defined to\n   transfer client certificates might be used to provide additional\n
    \  server certificates as well.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
