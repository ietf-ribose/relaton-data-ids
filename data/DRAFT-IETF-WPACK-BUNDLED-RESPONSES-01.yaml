abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Web bundles provide a way to bundle up groups of HTTP responses,
    with\n   the request URLs and content negotiation that produced them, to\n   transmit
    or store together.  They can include multiple top-level\n   resources, provide
    random access to their component exchanges, and\n   efficiently store 8-bit resources.\n\n\t
