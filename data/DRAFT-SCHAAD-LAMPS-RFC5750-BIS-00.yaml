abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies conventions for X.509 certificate usage
    by\n   Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) v3.2 agents.\n   S/MIME
    provides a method to send and receive secure MIME messages,\n   and certificates
    are an integral part of S/MIME agent processing.\n   S/MIME agents validate certificates
    as described in RFC 5280, the\n   Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
    and CRL Profile.\n   S/MIME agents must meet the certificate processing requirements
    in\n   this document as well as those in RFC 5280.  This document obsoletes\n
    \  RFC 3850.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
