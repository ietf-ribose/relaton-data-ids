abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document poses open questions in path-aware networking,
    as a\n   background for framing discussions in the Path Aware Networking\n   proposed
    Research Group (PANRG).  These are split into making\n   properties of Internet
    paths available to endpoints, and allowing\n   endpoints to select paths through
    the Internet for their traffic.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
