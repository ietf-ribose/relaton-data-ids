abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   At the time the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee was
    set up\n   the Internet Architecture Board had an internal structure\n   significantly
    different from its current structure.  This document\n   aims to update the way
    in which the ex officio member from the IAB\n   who serves on the IAOC is appointed,
    in order to better account for\n   that change and better match the skills set
    out in RFC 4333.  After\n   community discussion, it is likely that this document
    will be split\n   into two distinct parts: one which updates the IAOC membership\n
    \  section of the relevant BCP and another which describes the IAB's\n   program.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
