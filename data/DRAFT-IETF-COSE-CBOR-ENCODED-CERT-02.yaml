abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a CBOR encoding of X.509 certificates.
    \ The\n   resulting certificates are called C509 Certificates.  The CBOR\n   encoding
    supports a large subset of RFC 5280 and all certificates\n   compatible with the
    RFC 7925, IEEE 802.1AR (DevID), CNSA, RPKI, GSMA\n   eUICC, and CA/Browser Forum
    Baseline Requirements profiles.  When\n   used to re-encode DER encoded X.509
    certificates, the CBOR encoding\n   can in many cases reduce the size of RFC 7925
    profiled certificates\n   with over 50%.  The CBOR encoded structure can alternatively
    be\n   signed directly (\"natively signed\"), which does not require re-\n   encoding
    for the signature to be verified.  The document also\n   specifies C509 COSE headers,
    a C509 TLS certificate type, and a C509\n   file format.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
