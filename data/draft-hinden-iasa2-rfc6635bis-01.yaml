abstract:
- content: '<p>The RFC Editor model described in this document divides the responsibilities
    for the RFC Series into three functions: the RFC Series Editor, the RFC Production
    Center, and the RFC Publisher. Internet Architecture Board (IAB) oversight via
    the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC) is described, as is the relationship
    between the IETF Administration Limited Liability Corporation Board and the RSOC.
    This document reflects the experience gained with "RFC Editor Model (Version 1)",
    documented in RFC 5620; and obsoletes RFC 6635 to replace all references to the
    IASA and related structures with those defined by the IASA 2.0 Model.</p>'
