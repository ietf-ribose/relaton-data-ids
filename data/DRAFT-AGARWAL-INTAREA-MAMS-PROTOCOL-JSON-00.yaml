abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Today, a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple\n
    \  communication networks based on different technology implementations\n   and
    network architectures like WiFi, LTE, DSL.  In such multi-\n   connectivity scenario,
    it is desirable to combine multiple access\n   networks or select the best one
    to improve quality of experience for\n   a user and improve overall network utilization
    and efficiency.  This\n   document presents the control plane message definitions
    and their\n   presentations in JSON, for control plane procedures for configuring\n
    \  the user plane in a multi access management services (MAMS) framework\n   that
    can be used to flexibly select the combination of uplink and\n   downlink access
    and core network paths, and user plane treatment for\n   improving network efficiency
    and enhanced application quality of\n   experience.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
