abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Multipath TCP extends the TCP protocol to allow multiple paths to
    beused simultaneously for the same TCP connection. The different pathsare typically
    provided using multiple IP addresses for the same endsystem, each address taken
    from a subnet that is routed differently.In this document we describe a set of
    conventions for how to ensurethat outgoing packets are routed in a manner consistent
    with thenetwork topology and constraints on use of that topology such asthose
    imposed by ingress filtering on IP address prefixes.</p>"
