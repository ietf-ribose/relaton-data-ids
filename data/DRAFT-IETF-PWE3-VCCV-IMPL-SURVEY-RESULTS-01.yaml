abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Most pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations
    mandate\n   the use of the Control Word (CW) to carry information essential to\n
    \  the emulation, to inhibit ECMP behavior, and to discriminate OAM from\n   PW
    packets.  However, some encapsulations treat the Control Word as\n   optional.
    \ As a result, implementations of the CW, for encapsulations\n   for which it
    is optional, vary by equipment manufacturer, equipment\n   model and service provider
    network.  Similarly, Virtual Circuit\n   Connectivity Verification (VCCV) supports
    three Control Channel (CC)\n   types and multiple Connectivity Verification (CV)
    Types.  This\n   flexibility has led to reports of interoperability issues within\n
    \  deployed networks and associated drafts to attempt to remedy the\n   situation.
    \ This survey of the PW/VCCV user community was conducted\n   to determine implementation
    trends.  The survey and results is\n   presented herein.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
