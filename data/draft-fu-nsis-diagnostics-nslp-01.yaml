abstract:
  content: "<p>The Next Steps in Signaling protocol suite aims to provide a way tocommunicate
    with network intermediaries. As such, it is desirable tooffer generic diagnostics
    function for NSIS users and systemadministrators to make the functionality provided
    by the network moretransparent (e.g., to identify particular NSLPs, to determine
    towhich degree the network supports NSIS, GIST state or specific NSLPsession information
    along a given path).Instead of suggesting one specific solution we highlight thedifferent
    design options of some simple, stateless diagnosticsfunctions from a querying
    node to a responding node. Thesepreliminary thoughts should help the working group
    to have a morestructure discussion in this problem space.</p>"
