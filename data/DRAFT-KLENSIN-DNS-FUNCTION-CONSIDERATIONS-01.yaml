abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The basic design of the Domain Name System was completed almost
    30\n   years ago.  The last half of that period has been characterized by\n   significant
    changes in requirements and expectations, some of which\n   either require changes
    to how the DNS is used or that can be\n   accommodated only poorly or not at all.
    \ This document asks the\n   question of whether it is time to either redesign
    and replace the DNS\n   to match contemporary requirements and expectations (rather
    than\n   continuing to try to design and implement incremental patches that\n
    \  are not fully satisfactory) or to draw some clear lines about\n   functionality
    that is not really needed or that should be performed\n   somewhere else.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
