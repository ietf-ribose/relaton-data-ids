abstract:
- content: "<p>National Bibliography Numbers, NBNs, are widely used by the national
    libraries and other organizations in order to identify various resources such
    as digitized monographs. Generally, NBNs may be applied to all kinds of resources
    that do not have an established (standard) identifier system of their own. A URN
    (Uniform Resource Names) namespace for NBNs was established in 2001 in RFC 3188.
    Since then, several European national libraries have implemented URN:NBN-based
    systems. This document replaces RFC 3188 and defines how NBNs can be supported
    within the updated URN framework. A revised namespace registration (version 4)
    is included.</p>"
