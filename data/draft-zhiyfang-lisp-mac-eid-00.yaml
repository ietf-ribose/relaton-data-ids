abstract:
- content: "<p>In today's networking environment most enterprise networks span multiple
    physical sites, Live workload mobility is required . LISP MAC to RLOC mapping
    provides a scalable solution for L2/L3 Connectivity across different sites using
    the currently internet access. It is a very cost-effective and simple solution
    that does not request core network support MPLS. This document provides an overview
    of this technology.</p>"
