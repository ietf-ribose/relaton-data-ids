abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to measure congestion on a
    tunnel\n   segment based on recommendations from RFC 6040, \"Tunneling of\n   Explicit
    Congestion Notification\", and to use IPFIX to communicate\n   the congestion
    measurements from the tunnel's egress to a controller\n   which can respond by
    modifying the traffic control policies at the\n   tunnel's ingress.\n\n\t </p>\n
