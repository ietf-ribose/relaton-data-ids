abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a key exchange method allowing devices
    managed\n   by a controller (e.g., an SDN management station) to create private\n
    \  pair-wise IPsec SAs without IKEv2 or any other direct peer-to-peer\n   session
    establishment messages.  The method can be used when a full\n   mesh of IKEv2
    sessions between IPsec devices is not appropriate.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
