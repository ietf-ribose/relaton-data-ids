abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of\n
    \  cryptographic algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over\n   DNS
    data.  There is currently an IANA registry for these algorithms\n   that is incomplete
    in that it lacks the implementation status of each\n   algorithm.  This document
    provides an applicability statement on\n   algorithm implementation compliance
    status for DNSSEC\n   implementations.  This status is to measure compliance to
    this RFC\n   only.  This document replaces that registry table with a new IANA\n
    \  registry table for Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm\n   Numbers
    that lists (or assigns) each algorithm's status based on the\n   current reference.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
