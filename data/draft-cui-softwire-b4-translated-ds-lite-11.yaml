abstract:
- content: "<p>DS-Lite [RFC6333] describes an architecture for transporting IPv4 packets
    over an IPv6 network. This document specifies an extension to DS-Lite called Lightweight
    4over6 which moves the Network Address Translation function from the DS-Lite AFTR
    to the B4, removing the requirement for a Carrier Grade NAT function in the AFTR.
    This reduces the amount of centralized state that must be held to a per- subscriber
    level. In order to delegate the NAPT function and make IPv4 Address sharing possible,
    port-restricted IPv4 addresses are allocated to the B4s.</p>"
