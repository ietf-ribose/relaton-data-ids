abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC8366 defines a digital artifact called voucher as a YANG-defined
    JSON document that has been signed using a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
    structure. This memo introduces a variant of the voucher structure in which CMS
    is replaced by the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) mechanism described
    in RFC7515 to better support use-cases in which JOSE is preferred over CMS. In
    addition to explaining how the format is created, MIME types are registered and
    examples are provided.</p>"
