abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a method to split the Control Plane
    (CP) and\n   User Plane (UP) for a Proxy Mobile IPv6 based network infrastructure.\n
    \  Existing specifications allow a mobile access gateway (MAG) to\n   separate
    its control and user plane using the Alternate Care of\n   address mobility option
    for IPv6, or Alternate IPv4 Care of Address\n   option for IPv4.  However, the
    current specification does not provide\n   any mechanism allowing the local mobility
    anchor (LMA) to perform an\n   analogous functional split.  To remedy that shortcoming,
    this\n   document specifies a mobility option enabling a LMA to provide an\n   alternate
    LMA address to be used for the bi-directional user plane\n   traffic between the
    MAG and LMA.  With this new option, a LMA will be\n   able to use an IP address
    for its user plane which is different than\n   the IP address used for the control
    plane.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
