abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ForCES LFB Topology currently defines that once an instance
    of an\n   LFB class is created it becomes immediately active in the datatapath.\n
    \  This document makes a slight extension to add state to an\n   instantiated
    LFB class allowing the CE to decide when an LFB instance\n   becomes operational
    on the datapath.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
