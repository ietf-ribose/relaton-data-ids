abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label\n
    \  Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  This document\n   specifies
    procedures for sending and processing in-band probe query\n   and response messages
    for Performance Measurement.  The procedure\n   uses the mechanisms defined in
    RFC 5357 (Two-Way Active Measurement\n   Protocol (TWAMP)) for Delay Measurement,
    and also uses the mechanisms\n   for direct-mode loss measurement defined in this
    document.  The\n   procedure specified is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data
    planes for\n   both links and end-to-end measurement for SR Policies.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
