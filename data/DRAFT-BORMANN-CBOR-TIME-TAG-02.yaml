abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is
    a data\n   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small\n
    \  code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the\n   need
    for version negotiation.\n\n   In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition
    of CBOR tags.\n   RFC 7049 defines two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (RFC3339 time)
    and tag\n   1 (Posix time [TIME_T], int or float).  Since then, additional\n   requirements
    have become known.  The present document defines a CBOR\n   tag for time that
    allows a more elaborate representation of time, and\n   anticipates the definition
    of related CBOR tags for duration and time\n   period.  It is intended as the
    reference document for the IANA\n   registration of the CBOR tags defined.\n\n\t
