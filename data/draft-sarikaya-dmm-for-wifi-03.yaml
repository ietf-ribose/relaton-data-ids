abstract:
- content: "<p>As networks are moving towards flat architectures, a distributed approach
    is needed to mobility management. This document defines a distributed mobility
    management protocol called Distributed Mobility Management for Wi-Fi protocol.
    The protocol is based on mobility aware virtualized routing system with software-defined
    network support. Routing is in Layer 2 in the access network and in Layer 3 in
    the core network. Smart phones access the network over IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) interface
    and can move in home, hotspot and enterprise buildings.</p>"
