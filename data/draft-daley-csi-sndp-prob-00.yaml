abstract:
  content: "<p>Neighbour Discovery Proxy is used to provide an address presence on
    alink from nodes which are no themselves present. It allows a node toreceive packets
    directed at its address by allowing another device toneighbour advertise on its
    behalf.Neighbour Discovery Proxy is used in Mobile IPv6 and relatedprotocols to
    provide reachability from nodes on the home network whena Mobile Node is not at
    home, by allowing the Home Agent to act asproxy. It is also used as a mechanism
    to allow a global prefix tospan multiple links, where proxies act as relays for
    neighbourdiscovery messages.Neighbour Discovery Proxy currently cannot be secured
    using SEND.Today, SEND assumes that a node advertising an address is the addressowner
    and in possession of appropriate public and private keys forthat node. This document
    describes how existing practice for proxyNeighbour Discovery relates to Secured
    Neighbour Discovery.</p>"
