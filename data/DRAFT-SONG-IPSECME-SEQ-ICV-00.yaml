abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an IPsec AH and ESP sequence number\n
    \  validation scheme, which is complementary to the existing ICV\n   mechanism
    and anti-replay mechanism of AH and ESP in defense against\n   DOS attack.  It
    is an optional feature negotiable through IKE, for\n   this feature to be negotiated,
    both sender and receiver must\n   implement it.  If any party doesn't support
    it, then this feature\n   should be excluded from negotiation.  The rationale
    for such a scheme\n   is discussed first; then requirements and guidelines for
    design of\n   the scheme are laid out.  There can be various ways to implement
    the\n   scheme, some reference designs are discussed to set the base for\n   effort
    of identifying best practice and eventually establishing a\n   standard on the
    subject.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
