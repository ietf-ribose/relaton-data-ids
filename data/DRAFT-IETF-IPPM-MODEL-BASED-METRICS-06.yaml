abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We introduce a new class of Model Based Metrics designed to
    assess if\n   a complete Internet path can be expected to meet a predefined Bulk\n
    \  Transport Performance target by applying a suite of IP diagnostic\n   tests
    to successive subpaths.  The subpath-at-a-time tests can be\n   robustly applied
    to key infrastructure, such as interconnects or even\n   individual devices, to
    accurately detect if any part of the\n   infrastructure will prevent any path
    traversing it from meeting the\n   specified Target Transport Performance.\n\n
    \  The IP diagnostic tests consist of precomputed traffic patterns and\n   statistical
    criteria for evaluating packet delivery.  The traffic\n   patterns are precomputed
    to mimic TCP or other transport protocol\n   over a long path but are constructed
    in such a way that they are\n   independent of the actual details of the subpath
    under test, end\n   systems or applications.  Likewise the success criteria depends
    on\n   the packet delivery statistics of the subpath, as evaluated against a\n
    \  protocol model applied to the Target Transport Performance.  The\n   success
    criteria also does not depend on the details of the subpath,\n   end systems or
    application.  This makes the measurements open loop,\n   eliminating most of the
    difficulties encountered by traditional bulk\n   transport metrics.\n\n   Model
    based metrics exhibit several important new properties not\n   present in other
    Bulk Capacity Metrics, including the ability to\n   reason about concatenated
    or overlapping subpaths.  The results are\n   vantage independent which is critical
    for supporting independent\n   validation of tests results from multiple Measurement
    Points.\n\n   This document does not define IP diagnostic tests directly, but\n
    \  provides a framework for designing suites of IP diagnostics tests\n   that
    are tailored to confirming that infrastructure can meet a\n   predetermined Target
    Transport Performance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
