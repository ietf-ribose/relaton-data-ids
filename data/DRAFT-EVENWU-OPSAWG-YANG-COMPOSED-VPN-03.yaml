abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used by
    a network\n   operator to configure a VPN service that spans multiple\n   administrative
    domains and that is constructed from component VPNs in\n   each of those administrative
    domains.  The component VPNs may be\n   L2VPN or L3VPN or a mixture of the two.
    \ This model is intended to be\n   instantiated at the management system to deliver
    the end to end\n   service (i.e., performing service provision and activation
    functions\n   at different levels through a unified interface).\n\n   The model
    is not a configuration model to be used directly on network\n   elements.  This
    model provides an abstracted common view of VPN\n   service configuration components
    segmented at different layer and\n   administrative domain.  It is up to a management
    system to take this\n   as an input and generate specific configurations models
    to configure\n   the different network elements within each administrative domain
    to\n   deliver the service.  How configuration of network elements is done\n   is
    out of scope of the document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
