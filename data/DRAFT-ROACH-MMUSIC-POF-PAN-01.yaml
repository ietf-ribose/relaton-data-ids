abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Whenever two hosts have the ability to set up and control a
    session\n   on a peer-to-peer basis, situations can arise in which both parties\n
    \  attempt to change session parameters \"at the same time,\" such that\n   the
    session control messages cross on the wire.  When this happens,\n   implementations
    need to invoke extraordinary procedures to return the\n   shared state of the
    session to a common view between the endpoints.\n\n   For real-time communications,
    these session control messages are\n   typically exchanged using the session description
    protocol (SDP),\n   using an Offer/Answer model.  This document expands the offer/answer\n
    \  model to include the ability to exchange information relating to\n   discrete
    media streams within the session.  By reducing the amount of\n   session data,
    the frequency of session state conflicts can be\n   reduced; and, for certain
    types of operations, conflicts can be\n   eliminated altogether.\n\n   This document
    updates RFC 3264.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
