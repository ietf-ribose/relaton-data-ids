abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a proposal for an administrative oversight entity
    for the collection of activities that allow the IETF to carry out its work. The
    current description of the IETF's work can be found in [2]. The proposal is based
    on the observations and recommendations outlined in the IAB Advisory Committee
    report ([1]). The motivation for this proposal is described separately ([3]).
    These 4 documents must be read together for completeness.</p>"
