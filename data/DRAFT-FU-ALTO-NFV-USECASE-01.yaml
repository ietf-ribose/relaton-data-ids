abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft presents a use case of Application Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization (ALTO) with the emergence of Network Function\n   Virtualization
    (NFV).  The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization\n   (ALTO) Service provides
    network information (e.g., basic network\n   location structure and preferences
    of network paths) with the goal of\n   modifying network resource consumption
    patterns while maintaining or\n   improving application performance.  The emerging
    Network Functions\n   Virtualisation (NFV), as currently being in progress in
    ETSI NFV,\n   leverages standard IT virtualisation technology to consolidate many\n
    \  network equipment types onto industry standard high volume servers,\n   switches
    and storage.  The usecase presented in this draft discusses\n   the impact of
    virtualization on the ALTO protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
