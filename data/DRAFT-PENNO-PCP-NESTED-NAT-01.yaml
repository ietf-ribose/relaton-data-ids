abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Nested NATs or multi-layer NATs are already widely deployed.
    \ They\n   are characterized by two or more NAT devices in the path of packets\n
    \  from the subscriber to the Internet.  Moreover, NAT devices current\n   deployed
    are PCP unaware and It is assumed that NAT aware PCP devices\n   will take a long
    time to be rolled out.  Therefore in order to lower\n   the adoption barrier of
    PCP and make it work for current deployed\n   networks, this document proposes
    a few mechanisms for PCP-enabled\n   applications to work through nested NATs
    with varying level of PCP\n   protocol support.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
