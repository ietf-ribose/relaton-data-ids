abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents the Lightweight GNSS (Global Navigation\n
    \  Satellite System) Support Protocol (LGSP).  The Lightweight GNSS\n   Support
    Protocol (LGSP) is being developed in order to provide a\n   comprehensive solution
    which solves the problems inherent in\n   traditional radio-based Differential
    GPS (DGPS) protocols.  LGSP will\n   also provide additional support for GNSS
    user equipment, such as a\n   GPS almanac retrieval method, allowing compatible
    units to perform\n   faster almanac acquisition, thus resulting in less time until
    an\n   initial position measurement can be established.  Other supporting\n   features
    include alternative distribution of GPS navigation messages\n   and differential
    correction messages, a hierarchical mirroring\n   architecture, redundant backup
    operation and load balancing\n   functions.\n\t </p>\n      "
