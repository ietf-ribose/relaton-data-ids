abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo proposes use cases for LISP in the area of end Host\n
    \  mobility.  The applicability of end host mobility can be found in\n   data
    centers, where Virtual Machines (VM's) can be moved freely from\n   one physical
    server onto another physical server, independent of\n   location, without having
    to change the IP/MAC-addresses inside those\n   VMs, nor impacting traffic flows
    to and from those VMs.  Wireless end\n   hosts are another area of applicability.
    \ Although this draft will\n   not address wireless end host mobility, most of
    the same principles\n   apply.\n\n   Traditionally L2 extension technologies have
    been used to handle\n   mobility events, but they could lead to suboptimal routing
    of traffic\n   to and from the end host after the mobility event, as well as created\n
    \  big broadcast domains.  This memo describes how LISP solves the\n   traffic
    optimization issues caused by a mobility event of an end host\n   like a Virtual
    Machine, as it decouples the identity of the end host\n   from its location, such
    that traffic will always be forwarded to the\n   correct location.  More-over
    the LISP control plane can be leveraged\n   to discover and distribute the reachability
    information of end hosts\n   such that end to end broadcast domains, and their
    associated\n   problems, are no longer needed.\n\n   Various sub-use cases will
    be looked at in this draft, depending on\n   whether mobility is achieved at L2
    (using MAC-addresses as EID) or at\n   L3 (using IP addresses as EIDs), and whether
    subnets are L2 extended\n   across LISP sites or not.  This memo also describes
    how to handle\n   mobility in the case where the default gateway of the end host
    is not\n   capable of performing the LISP map-and-encap function, while the LISP\n
    \  xTR function is located one or more L3 hops away from the default\n   gateway.\n\n\n\t
