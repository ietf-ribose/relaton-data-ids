abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the\n
    \  network.  Instead, links with restricting Maximum Transmission Units\n   (MTUs)
    must either drop each too-large packet and return an ICMPv6\n   Packet Too Big
    (PTB) message or perform link-specific fragmentation\n   and reassembly (also
    known as \"link adaptation\") at a layer below\n   IPv6.  This latter category
    of links is often performance-challenged\n   to accommodate steady-state link
    adaptation.  This document therefore\n   proposes an update to the base IPv6 specification
    to better\n   accommodate links that require link-specific adaptation to meet
    the\n   IPv6 minimum MTU of 1280 bytes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
