abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an abstract framework to reason about
    the\n   composition of multi-path aware systems in a protocol-independent\n   fashion.
    \ It discusses basic mechanisms that are used in multi-path\n   systems and their
    applicability to different granularities of\n   communication units.  This document
    is targeted as consideration\n   basis for automation of destination, path and
    transport protocol\n   selection within the transport layer.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
