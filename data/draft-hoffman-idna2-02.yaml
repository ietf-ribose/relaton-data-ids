abstract:
  content: "<p>IDNA has been a world-wide success since it was introduced over fiveyears
    ago. However, it has some notable deficiencies, includingbeing tied to an old
    version of the Unicode standard and needlessrestrictions that prevented some languages
    from being used. Thisdocument describes IDNA version 2, which rectifies those
    problemswhile making the fewest changes necessary to the original protocol.</p>"
