abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes Extended RAMS (ERAMS), which is a complementto
    the unicast based Rapid Acquisition for Multicast based Streaming(RAMS) discussed
    in [ID-RAMS]. The outline of this addedfunctionality to RAMS is to gather up Rapid
    Acquisition requests formany users and transmit them in dedicated multicast streams.
    Withthis technique the peak load on the retransmission server and on theoutgoing
    link from the retransmission server can be reduced. For aproblem description of
    the channel change problem in multicast basedIPTV the reader is encouraged to
    read [ID-RAMS].</p>"
