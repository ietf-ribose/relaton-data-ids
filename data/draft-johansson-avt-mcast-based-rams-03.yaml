abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes Extended RAMS (ERAMS), which is a complement
    to the unicast based Rapid Acquisition for Multicast based Streaming (RAMS) discussed
    in [ID-RAMS]. The outline of this added functionality to RAMS is to gather up
    Rapid Acquisition requests for many users and transmit them in dedicated multicast
    streams. With this technique the peak load on the retransmission server and on
    the outgoing link from the retransmission server can be reduced. For a problem
    description of the channel change problem in multicast based IPTV the reader is
    encouraged to read [ID-RAMS].</p>"
