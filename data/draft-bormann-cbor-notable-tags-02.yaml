abstract:
- content: "<p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data
    format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size,
    fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.
    In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags. RFC 7049 and
    its revision 7049bis define a basic set of tags as well as a registry that can
    be used to contribute additional tag definitions [IANA.cbor-tags]. Since RFC 7049
    was published, some 80 tag definitions have been added to that registry. The present
    document provides a roadmap to a large subset of these tag definitions. Where
    applicable, it points to a IETF standards or standard development document that
    specifies the tag. Where no such document exists, the intention is to collect
    specification information from the sources of the registrations. After some more
    development, the present document is intended to be useful as a reference document
    for the IANA registrations of the CBOR tags the definitions of which have been
    collected.</p>"
