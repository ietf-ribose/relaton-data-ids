abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IEEE originally structured the 48-bit MAC address space
    in such a\n   way that half of it was reserved for local use.  Recently, the IEEE\n
    \  has been working on a new specification (IEEE 802c) which defines a\n   new
    \"optional Structured Local Address Plan\" (SLAP) that specifies\n   different
    assignment approaches in four specified regions of the\n   local MAC address space.\n\n
    \  The IEEE is working on mechanisms to allocate addresses in the one of\n   these
    quadrants (IEEE 802.1CQ).  There is work also in the IETF on\n   specifying a
    new mechanism that extends DHCPv6 operation to handle\n   the local MAC address
    assignments.  In this document, we complement\n   this ongoing IETF work by defining
    a mechanism to allow choosing the\n   SLAP quadrant to use in the allocation of
    the MAC address to the\n   requesting device/client.\n\n   This document proposes
    extensions to DHCPv6 protocols to enable a\n   DHCPv6 client or a DHCPv6 relay
    to indicate a preferred SLAP quadrant\n   to the server, so that the server allocates
    the MAC address to the\n   given client out of the quadrant requested by relay
    or client.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
