abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This Internet-Draft describes DNS name server and stub resolverbehavior
    that results in a significant query volume sent to theroot and top-level domain
    (TLD) name servers. In some cases werecommend minor additions to the DNS protocol
    specification andcorresponding changes in name server implementations to alleviatethese
    unnecessary queries. In one case, we have highlightedbehavior of a popular name
    server implementation that does notconform to the DNS specification. The recommendations
    made in thisdocument are a direct byproduct of observation and analysis ofabnormal
    query traffic patterns seen at two of the thirteen rootname servers and all thirteen
    com/net/org TLD name servers.</p>"
