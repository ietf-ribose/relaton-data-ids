abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the core security features of the NFSv4 family
    of protocols, applying to all minor versions. The discussion includes the use
    of security features provided by the RPC transport. This preliminary version of
    the document, is intended, in large part, to result in working group discussion
    regarding existing NFSv4 security issues and to provide a framework for addressing
    these issues and obtaining working group consensus regarding necessary changes.
    When a successor document is eventually published as an RFC, it will supersede
    the description of security appearing in existing minor version specification
    documents such as RFC 7530 and RFC 8881.</p>"
