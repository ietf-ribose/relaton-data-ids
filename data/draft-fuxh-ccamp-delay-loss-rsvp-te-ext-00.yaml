abstract:
- content: <p>The key driver for latency is stock/commodity trading applications.
    Financial or trading companies are very focused on end-to-end private pipe line
    latency optimizations that improve things 2-3 ms. Latency and latency SLA is one
    of the key parameters that these "high value" customers use to select a private
    pipe line provider. This document extends RSVP-TE protocol to promote SLA experince
    of latency application.</p>
