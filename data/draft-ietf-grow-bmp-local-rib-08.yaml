- content: "<p>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines access to various Routing
    Information Bases (RIBs). This document updates BMP (RFC 7854) by adding access
    to the Local Routing Information Base (Loc-RIB), as defined in RFC 4271. The Loc-RIB
    contains the routes that have been selected by the local BGP speaker's Decision
    Process.</p>"
