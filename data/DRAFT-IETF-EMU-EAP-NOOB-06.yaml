abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support
    for\n   multiple authentication methods.  This document defines the EAP-NOOB\n
    \  authentication method for nimble out-of-band (OOB) authentication,\n   and
    key derivation.  The EAP method is intended for bootstrapping all\n   kinds of
    Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that have no pre-configured\n   authentication
    credentials.  The method makes use of a user-assisted\n   one-directional OOB
    message between the peer device and\n   authentication server to authenticate
    the in-band key exchange.  The\n   device must have a non-network input or output
    interface, such as a\n   display, microphone, speaker, or blinking light, which
    can send or\n   receive dynamically generated messages of tens of bytes in length.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
