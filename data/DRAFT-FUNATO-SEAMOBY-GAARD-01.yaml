abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a scheme that allows a node to determine
    an IP \naddress corresponding to a given link-layer id.  The node performing the
    \nquery doesn't need to be on the same link or subnet of the node \nassociated
    with the link-layer id.  This scheme was designed for the \nhandoff candidate
    access router discovery in wireless networks, but may \nalso be applied to other
    networks with similar behavior.\n\t </p>\n      "
