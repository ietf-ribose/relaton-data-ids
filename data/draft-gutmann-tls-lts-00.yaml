- content: "<p>This document specifies a profile of TLS 1.2 for long-term support,
    one that represents what's already deployed for TLS 1.2 but with the security
    holes and bugs fixed. This represents a stable, known-good profile that can be
    deployed now to systems that can't can't roll out patches every month or two when
    the next attack on TLS is published.</p>"
