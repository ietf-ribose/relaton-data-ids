abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document analyzes the potential problems of applying existing\n
    \  IP-based performance measurement methods to wireless accessing\n   environments.
    \ It suggests that a more flexible passive measuring\n   framework and performance
    metrics, such as congestion ratio are\n   needed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
