abstract:
- content: "<p>A Cryptographically Generated Address is an IPv6 addresses binding
    with a public/private key pair. However, the current CGA specifications are lack
    of procedures to enable proper management of the usage of CGAs. This document
    defines the process using DHCPv6 to manage CGAs in detail. A new DHCPv6 option
    is defined accordingly. This document also analyses the configuration of the parameters,
    which are used to generate CGAs, using DHCPv6. Although the document does not
    define new DHCPv6 option to carry these parameters for various reasons, the configuration
    procedure is described.</p>"
