abstract:
- content: "<p>Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms allow for burst tolerance
    while enforcing short queues to minimise the time that packets spend enqueued
    at a bottleneck. This can cause noticeable performance degradation for TCP connections
    traversing such a bottleneck, especially if there are only a few flows or their
    bandwidth-delay- product is large. The reception of a Congestion Experienced (CE)
    ECN mark indicates that an AQM mechanism is used at the bottleneck, and therefore
    the bottleneck network queue is likely to be short. Feedback of this signal allows
    the TCP sender-side ECN reaction in congestion avoidance to reduce the Congestion
    Window (cwnd) by a smaller amount than the congestion control algorithm's reaction
    to inferred packet loss. This specification therefore defines an experimental
    change to the TCP reaction specified in RFC3168, as permitted by RFC 8311.</p>"
