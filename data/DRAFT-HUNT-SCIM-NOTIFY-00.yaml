abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification\n
    \  is an HTTP based protocol that makes managing identities in multi-\n   domain
    scenarios easier to support through a standardized HTTP\n   service.\n\n   In
    a SCIM environment, changes to resources may be requested by\n   multiple parties.
    \ As time goes by an interested subscriber may wish\n   to be informed about resource
    state changes that are occurring at the\n   SCIM service provider.  This specification
    defines a hub notification\n   service that can be used to publish and distribute
    events to\n   interested registered subscribers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
