abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo documents the various methods known to be in use by\n
    \  peer-to-peer (P2P) applications for communication in the presence\n   of Network
    Address Translators (NATs) at the current time. This\n   memo covers NAT traversal
    approaches used by both TCP and UDP\n   based applications. This memo is not an
    endorsement of the methods \n   described, but merely an attempt to capture them
    in a document.\n\t </p>\n      "
