abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Black Lies method of providing compact DNSSEC denial of
    existence\n   proofs has some operational implications.  Depending on the specific\n
    \  implementation, it may provide no way to reliably distinguish Empty\n   Non-Terminal
    names from names that actually do not exist.  This draft\n   describes the use
    of a synthetic DNS resource record type to act as\n   an explicit signal for Empty
    Non-Terminal names and which is conveyed\n   in an NSEC type bitmap.\n\n\t </p>\n
