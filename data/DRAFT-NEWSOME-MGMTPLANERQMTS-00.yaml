abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The objective of this draft is to discuss methods for deciding
    that an\nIP network would be improved in some way by the addition of extra\ncapacity,
    (provided by an underlying network). The draft concludes\nthat the only reasonable
    way of doing this is the result of\nco-operation between routers, and that this
    co-operation leads to the\nneed for standardization of this process.\n\n\t </p>\n
