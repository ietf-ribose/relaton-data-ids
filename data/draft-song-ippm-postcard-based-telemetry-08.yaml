abstract:
- content: "<p>The document describes a packet-marking variation of the Postcard-
    Based Telemetry (PBT), referred to as PBT-M. Unlike the instruction- based PBT,
    as embodied in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export], PBT-M does not require the
    encapsulation of a telemetry instruction header, so it avoids some of the implementation
    challenges of the instruction-based PBT. However, PBT-M has unique issues that
    need to be considered. This document serves as a scheme overview and provides
    design guidelines applicable to implementations in different network protocols.</p>"
