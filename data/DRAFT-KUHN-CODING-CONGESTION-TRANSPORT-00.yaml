abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are discussions on how loss-based congestion controls
    consider\n   lost packets that have been recovered by a coding mechanism.  This\n
    \  document analyses to what extent transport protocols could ignore\n   such
    signals and proposes best current practices on the interaction\n   between congestion
    control and coding mechanism at the transport\n   layer.  Coding for tunnels is
    out-of-the scope of the document.\n   Examples of interest for the proposed solution
    is to better deal with\n   tail losses or with networks with non-congestion losses.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
