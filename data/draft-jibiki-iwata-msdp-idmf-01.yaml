abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft proposes a general inter-domain multicast forwarding(IDMF)
    mechanism for the PIM-SM multicast routing protocol and itsapplication to the
    MSDP specific forwarding extension (MSDP-FE).Although there have been various
    inter-domain multicast routing andforwarding protocols, they are still limited
    in their capacity tohandle policy routing, QoS routing, accounting and security,
    whichnetwork administrators are willing to use in their network. In orderto overcome
    this limitation, we propose a novel approach to create aninter-domain multicast
    forwarding tree (or routing table) amongmultiple PIM-SM domains with logical multicast
    paths over whichmulticast packets are forwarded or flooded. The logical multicastpaths
    are created by either the IP-in-IP tunneling method, the IPmasquerade-like method,
    or the MPLS label switched path (LSP) method,which can easily reuse policy routing
    and QoS routing for unicastrouting. These logical multicast paths are established
    among IDMF-capable nodes, which are located within each PIM-SM domain, eithermanually
    or by a dynamic IDMF tree construction protocol. Thisgeneral framework for IDMF
    can be used as an MSDP based forwardingmechanism. Furthermore, the IDMF-capable
    nodes (i.e., MSDP-FE-capablenodes) can also function as a proxy sender of multicast
    packets. Thiscan prevent a multicast receiver from changing an RP-tree into aglobal
    SP-tree, and also can help to reduce, on the surface, thenumber of multicast sources
    for a particular multicast group. Thisproperty can be effectively used for accounting,
    security, andscalability enhancement required for inter-domain communication.</p>"
