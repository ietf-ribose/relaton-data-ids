abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cryptography is becoming more important to the IETF and its\n
    \  protocols, and more IETF protocols are using, or looking at,\n   cryptography
    to increase privacy on the Internet [RFC7258].\n\n   This document specifies a
    proposed best practice for any protocol (or\n   data format) that uses cryptography.
    \ Namely, that such RFCs cannot\n   specify an algorithm as mandatory-to-implement
    (MTI) unless that\n   algorithm has had reasonable public review.  This document
    also\n   \"sketches out\" a rough definition around what such a review would\n
    \  look like.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
