abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  This document specifies a special elliptic curve with complex\n
    \ multiplication (by i) and a compact description (see title).  This\n  curve
    is recommended for cryptographic use in a strongest-link\n  combination with dissimilar
    elliptic curves (e.g. NIST P-256,\n  Curve25519, extension-field curves, etc.)
    \ as a defense in depth\n  against an unlikely, unforeseen attack on otherwise
    preferred\n  elliptic curves.  The curve equation 2y^2=x^3+x is the Montgomery\n
    \ form of a curve y^2=x^3-x in a class of curves y^2=x^3-ax suggested\n  by Miller
    in the first published paper elliptic curve cryptography,\n  and an endomorphism
    usable for efficiency, an idea of Koblitz.  The\n  field size 8^91+5 is prime,
    and is relatively efficient and\n  compactly described for its bit-size (273 bits).
    \ The document\n  specifies some practical details such as: encoding a point (on
    the\n  curve) into 34 bytes, public key validation, encoding a private key\n  into
    34 bytes, and encoding 34 bytes into a point.  The document\n  also provides pseudocode,
    motivation, and security considerations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
