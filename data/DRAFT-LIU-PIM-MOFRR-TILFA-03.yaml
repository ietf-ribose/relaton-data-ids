abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR) has been defined in [RFC7431],\n
    \  but the selection of the secondary multicast next hop only according\n   to
    the loop-free alternate fast reroute, which has restrictions in\n   multicast
    deployments. This document describes a mechanism for\n   Multicast-only Fast Reroute
    by using Topology Independent Loop-free\n   Alternate fast reroute, which is independent
    of network topology and\n   can achieve covering more network environments.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
