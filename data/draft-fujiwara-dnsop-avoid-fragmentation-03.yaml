abstract:
- content: "<p>Path MTU discovery remains widely undeployed due to security issues,
    and IP fragmentation has exposed weaknesses in application protocols. Currently,
    DNS is known to be the largest user of IP fragmentation. It is possible to avoid
    IP fragmentation in DNS by limiting response size where possible, and signaling
    the need to upgrade from UDP to TCP transport where necessary. This document proposes
    to avoid IP fragmentation in DNS.</p>"
