abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how providing IPsec-based flow protection
    by\n   means of a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller (aka.  Security\n
    \  Controller) and establishes the requirements to support this service.\n   It
    considers two main well-known scenarios in IPsec: (i) gateway-to-\n   gateway
    and (ii) host-to-host.  The SDN-based service described in\n   this document allows
    the distribution and monitoring of IPsec\n   information from a Security Controller
    to one or several flow-based\n   Network Security Function (NSF).  The NSFs implement
    IPsec to protect\n   data traffic between network resources with IPsec.\n\n   The
    document focuses in the NSF Facing Interface by providing models\n   for Configuration
    and State data model required to allow the Security\n   Controller to configure
    the IPsec databases (SPD, SAD, PAD) and IKEv2\n   to establish security associations
    with a reduced intervention of the\n   network administrator.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
