abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a Password Authenticated Key Exchange
    by\n   Juggling (J-PAKE) protocol.  This protocol allows the establishment\n   of
    a secure end-to-end communication channel between two remote\n   parties over
    an insecure network solely based on a shared password,\n   without requiring a
    Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or any trusted\n   third party.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
