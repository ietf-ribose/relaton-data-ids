abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service Model is a fundamental building block for a controller's\n
    \  North-Bound Interface (NBI).  Defining a service model for different\n   multi-layered
    and heterogeneous networks is a complicated work and\n   may require lots of consideration
    since different model users may\n   have different perspective and concerns.\n\n
    \  This document proposes the requirements and architecture for service\n   models
    to facilitate future work.  This document does not attempt to\n   provide a detailed
    description of all the architectural components,\n   but rather it describes a
    set of building blocks, requirements,\n   architecture and guidelines from which
    models may be constructed.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
