abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides guidelines and procedures for those who are defining,
    registering, or evaluating definitions of new interface types ("ifType" values)
    and tunnel types. The original definition of the IANA interface type registry
    predated the use of IANA Considerations sections and YANG modules, so some confusion
    arose over time. Tunnel types were added later, with the same requirements and
    allocation policy as interface types. This document updates RFC 2863 and provides
    updated guidance for these registries.</p>
