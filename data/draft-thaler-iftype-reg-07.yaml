abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document provides guidelines and procedures for those who aredefining,
    registering, or evaluating definitions of new interfacetypes (\"ifType\" values)
    and tunnel types. The original definition ofthe IANA interface type registry predated
    the use of IANAConsiderations sections and YANG modules, so some confusion aroseover
    time. Tunnel types were added later, with the same requirementsand allocation
    policy as interface types. This document updates RFC2863 and provides updated
    guidance for these registries.</p>"
