abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes motivations behind and solutions for tooling
    to automate the extraction/insertion of artwork and source code to/ from `rfc2xml`
    documents. While much may appear to be working, the author believes that, in order
    for such automation to be maximally useful, it is necessary to solicit broad input
    from the community (co-authors are welcomed, both on the draft and the tool).</p>"
