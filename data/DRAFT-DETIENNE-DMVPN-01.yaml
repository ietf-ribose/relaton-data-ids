abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of a Dynamic Mesh VPN (DMVPN) is to allow IPsec/IKE\n
    \  Security Gateways administrators to configure the devices in a\n   partial
    mesh (often a simple star topology called Hub-Spokes) and let\n   the Security
    Gateways establish direct protected tunnels called\n   Shortcut Tunnels.  These
    Shortcut Tunnels are dynamically created\n   when traffic flows and are protected
    by IPsec.\n\n   To achieve this goal, this document extends NHRP ([RFC2332]) into
    a\n   routing policy feed and integrates GRE tunneling with IKEv2 and IPsec\n
    \  to provide the necessary cryptographic security.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
