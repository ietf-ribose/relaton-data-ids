abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a model for enabling end to end QoS
    in systems\n   where there is a 802.11 based wireless system coupled with a PMIPv6\n
    \  mobility domain consisting a local mobility anchor and mobility\n   access
    gateway. This enables QoS policing and labeling of packets in\n   a consistent
    manner on the 802.11 link between the MN and the AP as\n   well as the link between
    the MAG and the LMA. To enable this, the\n   document specifies mapping between
    QoS parameters on the 802.11 link\n   and the QoS Mobility options in the PMIPv6
    domain.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
