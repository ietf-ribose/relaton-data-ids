abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new, backwards-compatible, approach to packet
    forwarding, where the service required rather than the IP address required acts
    as the vector for routing packets at the edge of the network. Deeper in the network,
    the mechanism can interface to conventional and future methods of service or application
    aware networking.</p>"
