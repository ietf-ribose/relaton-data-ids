abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This proposal creates a mechanism for managing the ingress or
    egress\n   of IP multicast through a firewall.  It does this by defining\n   extensions
    to the existing SOCKS V5 protocol [RFC-1928], which\n   provides a framework for
    doing user-level, authenticated firewall\n   traversal of unicast TCP and UDP
    traffic.  However, because the\n   current UDP support in SOCKS V5 has scalability
    problems as well as\n   other deficiencies -- and these need to be addressed before\n
    \  multicast support can be achieved -- the extensions are defined in\n   two
    parts: Base-level UDP extensions, and Multicast UDP extensions.\n \n   Using the
    SOCKS framework for managing multicast flows in/out of an\n   organization, offers
    numerous security advantages over what is\n   possible with a conventional firewall
    approach.  These are spelled\n   out in the draft.\n\t </p>\n      "
