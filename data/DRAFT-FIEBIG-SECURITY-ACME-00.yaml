abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Most Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX) certificates are
    issued\n   via the ACME protocol.  Recently, several attacks against domain\n
    \  validation (DV) have been published, including IP-use-after-free and\n   (forced)
    on-path attacks.  These attacks can often be mitigated by\n   (selectively) requiring
    additional challenges, such as DNS\n   validation, proof of ownership of a prior
    certificate, and by being\n   more diligent in operating a certificate authority.
    \ This document\n   provides a list of currently known attacks and describes mitigations\n
    \  and operational procedures to prevent issuing a certificate to an\n   unauthorized
    party.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
