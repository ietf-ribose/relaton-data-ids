abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   During the period of IPv6 transition, IP-based Geolocation
    (GeoIP)\n   applications are identified as a challenge and speed bump for ICPs\n
    \  (Internet Content Providers) to migrating their service to IPv6.\n   Some studies
    and operational experiences show that the accuracy of\n   IPv6 GeoIP is relatively
    poor in comparison to their IPv4\n   counterparts.  This memo proposed to include
    client's dualstack\n   subnets into DNS queries to provide better IPv6 GeoIP.\n\n
    \  REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: The source of the document with test\n   script
    is currently placed at GitHub [Dualstack-ECS-GitHub].\n   Comments and pull request
    are welcome.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
