abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The File Transfer Protocol does not offer any method to verify
    the\n   integrity of a transferred file, nor can two files be compared\n   against
    each other without actually transferring them first.\n   Cryptographic hashes
    are a possible solution to this problem.  In the\n   past, several attempts have
    been made to add commands to obtain\n   checksums and hashes, however none have
    been formally specified,\n   leading to non-interoperability and confusion.  To
    solve these\n   issues, this document specifies a new FTP command to be used by\n
    \  clients to request cryptographic hashes of files.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
