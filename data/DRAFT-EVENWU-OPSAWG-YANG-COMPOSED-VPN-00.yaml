abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used by
    a network\n   operator to configure a VPN service at one layer interconnecting
    VPN\n   service at another layer and manage how a hybrid VPN service is\n   engineered
    in the network [RFC8309].  This model is intended to be\n   instantiated at the
    management system to deliver the overall service.\n   It is not a configuration
    model to be used directly on network\n   elements.  This model provides an abstracted
    view of VPN service\n   configuration components at different layer.  It is up
    to a\n   management system to take this as an input and generate specific\n   configurations
    models to configure the different network elements to\n   deliver the service.
    \ How configuration of network elements is done\n   is out of scope of the document.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
