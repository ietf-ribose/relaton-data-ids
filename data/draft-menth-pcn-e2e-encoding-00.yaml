abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes an encoding of PCN marks based on the ECNfield
    of the Voice-Admit DSCP. It has global meaning and ECNsemantics are not applied
    to that field. The PCN codepoints are thesame as those for packet-specific dual
    marking (PSDM) within a singlePCN domain, but the general concept can also be
    applied to otherencodings requiring only a single PCN-enabled DSCP.</p>"
