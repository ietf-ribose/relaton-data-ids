abstract:
- content: <p>In this document we introduce a new BGP capability termed "Long-lived
    Graceful Restart Capability" so that stale routes can be retained for a longer
    time upon session failure. In addition a new BGP community "LLGR_STALE" is introduced
    for marking stale routes retained for a longer time. We also specify that such
    long-lived stale routes be treated as the least-preferred, and their advertisements
    be limited to BGP speakers that have advertised the new capability. Use of this
    extension is not advisable in all cases, and we provide guidelines to help determine
    if it is.</p>
