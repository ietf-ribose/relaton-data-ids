abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The development of two explicit routing protocols RSVP-TE[RSVP-TE]\nand
    CR-LDP[CR-LDP] within MPLS has created the need to allow\ninterworking between
    the two MPLS. Explict routed (ER) label switch\npaths do not have a prior knowledge
    of the ER signaling method in\nuse within the various links comprising a domain.
    In an integrated\nenvironment an ER path may crisscross between RSVP-TE and CR-LDP\nnodes
    numerous times.\nThis document describes the procedures for the establishment
    of an\nRSVP-TE originated LSP transiting or terminating within a CR-LDP\ndomain
    and the procedures for the establishment of a CR-LDP\noriginated LSP terminating
    within an RSVP-TE domain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
