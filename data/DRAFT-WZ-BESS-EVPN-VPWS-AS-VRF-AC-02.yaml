abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When a VRF Attachment Cirucit (VRF-AC) is far away from its
    IP-VRF\n   instance, we can deploy an EVPN VPWS ([RFC8214]) between that VRF-AC\n
    \  and its IP-VRF instance.  From the viewpoint of the IP-VRF instance,\n   a
    local virtual interface takes the place of that remote \"VRF-AC\".\n   The IP
    address for that VRF-AC is now configured to the virtual\n   interface, in other
    words, the virtual interface is the actual VRF-AC\n   of the IP-VRF instance.
    \ The virtual interface is also the AC of that\n   VPWS instance, in other words,
    the virtual interface is cross-\n   connected to that remote \"VRF-AC\" by the
    VPWS instance.\n\n   This document proposes an extension to\n   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-inter-subnet-forwarding]
    to support this\n   scenario.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
