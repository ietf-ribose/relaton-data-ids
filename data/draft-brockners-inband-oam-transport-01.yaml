abstract:
  content: "<p>In-band operation, administration and maintenance (OAM) records operational
    and telemetry information in the packet while the packet traverses a path between
    two points in the network. In-band OAM is to complement current out-of-band OAM
    mechanisms based on ICMP or other types of probe packets. This document outlines
    how in-band OAM data records can be transported in protocols such as NSH, Segment
    Routing, VXLAN-GPE, native IPv6 (via extension header), and IPv4. Transport options
    are currently investigated as part of an implementation study. This document is
    intended to only serve informational purposes.</p>"
