abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines a new TLS extension called \"Inner Application\".When
    TLS is used with the Inner Application extension (TLS/IA),additional messages
    are exchanged after completion of the TLShandshake, in effect providing an extended
    handshake prior to thestart of upper layer data communications. Each TLS/IA messagecontains
    an encrypted sequence of Attribute-Value-Pairs (AVPs) fromthe RADIUS/Diameter
    namespace. Hence, the AVPs defined in RADIUS andDiameter have the same meaning
    in TLS/AI; that is, each attributecode point refers to the same logical attribute
    in any of theseprotocols. Arbitrary \"applications\" may be implemented using
    the AVPexchange. Possible applications include EAP or other forms of userauthentication,
    client integrity checking, provisioning of additionaltunnels, and the like. Use
    of the RADIUS/Diameter namespace providesnatural compatibility between TLS/IA
    applications and widely deployedAAA infrastructures.It is anticipated that TLS/IA
    will be used with and withoutsubsequent protected data communication within the
    tunnel establishedby the handshake. For example, TLS/IA may be used to secure
    an HTTPdata connection, allowing more robust password-based userauthentication
    to occur than would otherwise be possible usingmechanisms available in HTTP. TLS/IA
    may also be used for itshandshake portion alone; for example, EAP-TTLSv1 encapsulates
    aTLS/IA handshake in EAP as a means to mutually authenticate a clientand server
    and establish keys for a separate data connection.</p>"
