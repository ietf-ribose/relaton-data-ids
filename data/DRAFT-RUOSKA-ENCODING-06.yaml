abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes hierarchically structured binary encoding\n
    \  format called Ruoska Encoding (later RSK).  The main design goals are\n   minimal
    resource usage, well defined structure with good selection of\n   widely known
    data types, and still extendable for future usage.\n\n   The main benefit when
    compared to non binary hierarchically\n   structured formats like XML is simplicity
    and minimal resource\n   demands.  Even basic XML parsing is time and memory consuming\n
    \  operation.\n\n   When compared to other binary formats like BER encoding of
    ASN.1 the\n   main benefit is simplicity.  ASN.1 with many different encodings
    is\n   complex and even simple implementation needs a lot of effort.  RSK is\n
    \  also more efficient than BER.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
