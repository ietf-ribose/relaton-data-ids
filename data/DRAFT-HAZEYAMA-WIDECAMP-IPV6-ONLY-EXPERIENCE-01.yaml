abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document reports and discusses issues on IPv6 only networks
    and\n   IPv4/IPv6 transition technologies through our experiences on the 2nd\n
    \  experiment on the WIDE camp.  The second experiment was held from\n   March
    4th to March 8th, 2012.  We tried to live in commercial IPv6\n   networks with
    four kinds of IPv4/IPv6 transition technologies, DNS64/\n   NAT64, 4RD, 464XLAT
    and SA46T. In this -01.txt aims to report results\n   of the 2nd experiment and
    to share issues / problems on the IPv4 /\n   IPv6 transition that we met.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
