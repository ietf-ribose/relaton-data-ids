abstract:
- content: "<p>For more than 30 years, a large number of implementations of the TCP/
    IP protocol suite have been subject to a variety of attacks, with effects ranging
    from Denial of Service (DoS) or data injection, to information leakage that could
    be exploited for pervasive monitoring. The root of these issues has been, in many
    cases, the poor selection of transient identifiers in such protocols, usually
    as a result of an insufficient or misleading specifications. This document formally
    updates RFC3552, such that RFCs are required to perform a security and privacy
    analysis of the transient numeric identifiers they specify.</p>"
