abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document argues for and describes alternatives that shift\n
    \  specific language conventions used by RFC Authors and RFC Editors to\n   avoid
    offensive terminology in the technical documentation of the RFC\n   series.  Specifically,
    this document details two sets of terms that\n   are normalised on the technical
    level but offensive on a societal\n   level.  First, arguments are presented for
    why any offensive terms\n   should be avoided by the IETF/IRTF.  Second, problem
    statements for\n   both sets of terms are presented and alternatives are referenced
    and\n   proposed.  There is a third section on additional considerations and\n
    \  general action points to address the RFC series, past and future.\n   Lastly,
    a summary of recommendations is presented.\n\t </p>\n      "
