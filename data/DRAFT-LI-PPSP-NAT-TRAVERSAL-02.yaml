abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the necessity and solutions of PPSP
    NAT\n   traversal.  Two NAT traversal solutions based are described in this\n
    \  document: PPSP-ICE and RELOAD-ICE solution.  PPSP-ICE and RELOAD-ICE\n   solutions
    both use ICE.  PPSP-ICE solution uses PPSP messages to\n   convey ICE parameters,
    while RELOAD-ICE solution proposes to form a\n   RELOAD overlay with PPSP peers
    and use RELOAD messages to exchange\n   ICE parameters.  Extensions to PPSP are
    also proposed to support\n   these solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
