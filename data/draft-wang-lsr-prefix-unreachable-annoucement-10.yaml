abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism that can trigger the switchover
    of the services which rely on the reachability of the peer endpoints, for example
    the BGP or the tunnel services. It is mainly used in the scenarios that the summary
    prefixes are advertised at the border routers whereas the services endpoints are
    located in different IGP areas or levels, whose reachabilities are covered by
    the summary prefixes. It introduces a new signaling mechanism using a negative
    prefix announcement called Prefix Unreachable Announcement Mechanism(PUAM), utilized
    to detect a link or node down event and signal the overlay services that the event
    has occurred to force immediate switchover.</p>"
