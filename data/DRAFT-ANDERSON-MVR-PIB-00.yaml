abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a Policy Information Base (PIB) for  \npartitioning
    a single switch into a set of virtual switches.  \n([SPPI] describes a structure
    for specifying policy information  \nthat can then be transmitted to a network
    device for the purpose  \nof configuring policy at that device.  The model underlying
    this  \nstructure is one of well defined policy rule classes and instances  \nof
    these classes residing in a virtual information store called  \nthe Policy Information
    Base (PIB).)  The partitioning PIB defined  \nhere is largely based on the Base
    Switch Partitioning MIB (MSF  \n00.069) [MSF-VSMIB].  However, unlike that MIB,
    this document does  \nnot provide a management interface for the switch as a whole
    but  \ninstead only specifies the ports and resources assigned to virtual  \nswitches.
    \ The management interface(s) to discover switch  \nresources as a whole are outside
    the scope of this document.\n\t </p>\n      "
