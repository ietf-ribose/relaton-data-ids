abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an alternative service architecture
    for user-\n   centric control of the sharing of resources following the UMA model,\n
    \  such as personal data, using the decentralized peer-to-peer computing\n   paradigm.
    \ The term 'control' is used here to denote the full\n   capacity of the user
    to freely select (i) the entities with whom to\n   share resources (e.g. data),
    and (ii) the entities which provide\n   services implementing user-controlled
    resource sharing.  The peer-to-\n   peer service architecture uses a set of computing
    nodes called\n   OAuth2.0 Nodes (ON) that are part of a peer-to-peer network as
    the\n   basis for the decentralized service architecture.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
