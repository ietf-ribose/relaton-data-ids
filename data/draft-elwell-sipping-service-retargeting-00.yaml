abstract:
- content: <p>This contains motivation, requirements and a proposed solution for indicating
    service retargeting information in SIP requests and responses. Retargeting of
    a request can be considered to be service retargeting when it goes beyond "normal"
    routing and might be of interest to applications at the UAS or UAC.</p>
