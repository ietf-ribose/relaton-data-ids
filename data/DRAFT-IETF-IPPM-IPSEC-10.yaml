abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and Two-Way
    Active\n   Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) security mechanisms require that both\n
    \  the client and server endpoints possess a shared secret.  This\n   document
    describes the use of keys derived from an IKEv2 security\n   association (SA)
    as the shared key in O/TWAMP.  If the shared key can\n   be derived from the IKEv2
    SA, O/TWAMP can support certificate-based\n   key exchange, which would allow
    for more operational flexibility and\n   efficiency.  The key derivation presented
    in this document can also\n   facilitate automatic key management.\n\n\t </p>\n
