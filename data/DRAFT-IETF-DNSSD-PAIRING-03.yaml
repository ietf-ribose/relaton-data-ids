abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a device pairing mechanism that establishes
    a\n   relation between two devices by agreeing on a secret and manually\n   verifying
    the secret's authenticity using an SAS (short\n   authentication string).  Pairing
    has to be performed only once per\n   pair of devices, as for a re-discovery at
    any later point in time,\n   the exchanged secret can be used for mutual authentication.\n\n
    \  The proposed pairing method is suited for each application area where\n   human
    operated devices need to establish a relation that allows\n   configurationless
    and privacy preserving re-discovery at any later\n   point in time.  Since privacy
    preserving applications are the main\n   suitors, we especially care about privacy.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
