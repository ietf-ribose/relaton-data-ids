abstract:
- content: "<p>The transcendence of the user-operator dichotomy through interactive
    computing greatly empowered the programmers of early time-sharing systems and
    subsequent operating systems. Earth is examined in the light of history as the
    largest known time-sharing system in operation, and Omnics, a synergistic planet
    operating system, is proposed.</p>"
