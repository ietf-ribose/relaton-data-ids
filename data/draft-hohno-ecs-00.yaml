abstract:
- content: "<p>It will be strongly required to provide internet services even in an
    emergency since the internet is one of the most important communication infrastructures.
    Therefore, it is necessary to prepare special communication functoin such as victims'
    information exchange and the disaster information transmission system. It is also
    necessary to introduce priority control mechanism for the emergency communication.
    We need to start discussion about the emergency communication systems on the Internet.</p>"
