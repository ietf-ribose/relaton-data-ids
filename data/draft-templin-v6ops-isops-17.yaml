abstract:
- content: "<p>Many end user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly
    IPv4 internal infrastructures. These sites range in size from small home/office
    networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but share the commonality that
    IPv4 provides satisfactory internal routing and addressing services for most applications.
    As more and more IPv6-only services are deployed, however, end user devices within
    such sites will increasingly require at least basic IPv6 functionality. This document
    therefore provides operational guidance for deployment of IPv6 within predominantly
    IPv4 sites using the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP).</p>"
