abstract:
- content: "<p>Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) services such as 800-number
    routing (freephone), time-and-day routing, credit-card calling, and virtual private
    network (mapping a private network number into a public number) are realized by
    the Intelligent Network (IN). This document addresses means to support existing
    IN services from Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) endpoints for an IP-host-to-phone
    call. The call request is originated on a SIP endpoint, but the services to the
    call are provided by the data and procedures resident in the PSTN/IN. To provide
    IN services in a transparent manner to SIP endpoints, this document describes
    the mechanism for interworking SIP and Intelligent Network Application Part (INAP).
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
