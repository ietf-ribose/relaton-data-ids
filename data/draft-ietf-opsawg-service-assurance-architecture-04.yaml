abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture that aims at assuring that
    service instances are running as expected. As services rely upon multiple sub-services
    provided by a variety of elements including the underlying network devices and
    functions, getting the assurance of a healthy service is only possible with a
    holistic view of all involved elements. This architecture not only helps to correlate
    the service degradation with a specific network component but also the impacted
    services when a network component fails or degrades.</p>"
