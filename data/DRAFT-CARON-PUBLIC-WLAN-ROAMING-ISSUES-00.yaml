abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Public wireless Internet access zones based on IEEE 802.11 [1]
    \nwireless LAN technology are becoming common. However, many issues \nare impeding
    further adoption of the technology by end-users, in \nparticular the inability
    or difficulty to roam between the networks \nof different providers. This document
    aims to document these issues, \nshow how they are different from roaming in other
    contexts such as \ndialup access to the Internet or GSM roaming, and how current
    \nsolutions do not fully address these issues. Future documents will \ntry to
    address these issues with practical solutions.\n\t </p>\n      "
