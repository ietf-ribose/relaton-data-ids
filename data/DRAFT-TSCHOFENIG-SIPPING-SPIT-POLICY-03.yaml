abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SPAM, defined as sending unsolicited messages to someone in bulk,\nmight
    be a problem on SIP open-wide deployed networks.  The\nresponsibility for filtering
    or blocking calls can belong to\ndifferent elements in the call flow and may depend
    on various\nfactors.  This document defines an authorization based policy\nlanguage
    that allows end users to upload anti-SPIT policies to\nintermediaries, such as
    SIP proxies.  These policies mitigate\nunwanted SIP communications.  It extends
    the Common Policy\nauthorization framework with additional conditions and actions.
    \ The\nnew conditions match a particular Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\ncommunication
    pattern based on a number of attributes.  The range of\nattributes includes information
    provided, for example, by SIP itself,\nby the SIP identity mechanism, by information
    carried within SAML\nassertions.\n\t </p>\n      "
