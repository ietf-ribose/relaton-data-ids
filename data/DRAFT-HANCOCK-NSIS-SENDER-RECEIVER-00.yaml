abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The NSIS working group is considering protocols for signaling
    for \nresources for a traffic flow along its path in the network. The \nrequirements
    for such signaling are being developed in [2] and a \nframework in [3]. \nIt is
    clear from existing work that there are many interrelated \nissues with NSIS signaling,
    concerning the respective roles of the \ntwo ends of the communication path. These
    issues include route \nfinding, authorisation, state management requirements,
    localization \nof negotiation, and so on. The wide variety of problems involved
    \nhinders progress in deciding what approach NSIS should adopt. This \nInternet
    Draft attempts to provide a summary of these issues and \nsuggests a way of structuring
    further analysis. It is not expected \nthat this document should have a long term
    existence.\n\t </p>\n      "
