abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS)
    [3]\nApplication for domain name based discovery of application services.\nEssentially,
    this uses DNS NAPTR resource records [4] to provide one\nmore layer of redirection
    for service lookup than is feasible with\nSRV ([2]) records.  It is proposed because
    real-life use is\ndemonstrating a need for something slightly more substantial
    than\nSRV, and alternatively SRV usage may become twisted out of its\nintended
    shape.\n\t </p>\n      "
