abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes extensions to Border Gateway Protocol
    (BGP)\n   for flooding the link states on a topology that is a subgraph of the\n
    \  complete topology of a BGP-SPF domain, so that the amount of flooding\n   traffic
    in the domain is greatly reduced.  This would reduce\n   convergence time with
    a more stable and optimized routing\n   environment.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
