abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the use of the HMAC algorithm in conjunction\nwith
    the SHA-256 algorithm as an experimental authentication mecha-\nnism within the
    context of the IPsec AH and ESP protocols. This algo-\nrithm is intended to provide
    data origin authentication and integrity\nprotection. Given the current lack of
    practical experience with\nSHA-256, implementations based on this document will
    be experimental\nin nature, and implementation is not required in order to claim
    com-\npliance with the IPsec proposed standards.  The version of the HMAC-\nSHA-256
    authenticator described in this document specifies truncation\nto 128 bits, and
    is therefore named HMAC-SHA-256-128.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
