abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The current memo documents extensions to ICMP that permit Label
    \nSwitching Routers to append MPLS header information to ICMP \nmessages. These
    ICMP extensions support an MPLS aware traceroute \napplication that network operators
    can use to trace paths through \nthe MPLS user plane. \nAlthough these extensions
    are not being proposed as Internet \nStandards, they are documented here because
    they have been \nimplemented by several vendors and deployed by several operators.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
