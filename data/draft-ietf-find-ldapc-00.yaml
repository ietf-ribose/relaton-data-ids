abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how an LDAP server (the supplier) may transmit,
    through an out-of-band email, index information or attributes of its naming context
    to another LDAP server (the consumer). The consumer server will make use of this
    information when determining whether the supplier server is likely to have entries
    in that naming context which match a particular search filter. This assists the
    consumer in processing subtree searches in distributed directories.</p>"
