abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    SDP is a byte-stream transport protocol that closely mimics
    TCP's \n    stream semantics. SDP utilizes iWARP's advanced protocol offload,
    \n    kernel bypass, and zero copy capabilities. Because of this, SDP can \n    have
    lower CPU and memory bandwidth utilization when compared to \n    conventional
    implementations of sockets over TCP, while preserving \n    the familiar byte-stream
    oriented semantics upon which most current \n    network applications depend.
    \n\t </p>\n      "
