abstract:
  content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is standardized to provide network-based mobilitymanagement
    for a regular IPv6 mobile node, the Binding Cache Entry isbuilt based on the HNP.
    If the MN is a multiple interfaces MN, theseinterfaces will get the different
    HNPs from the LMA and several BCEsare built for one MN. This will cause the invalidation
    of multihoming.This document introduces an extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6 formultihoming
    MN. Through extending the binding relationship betweenHNP and MAG in BCE, and
    synchronizing this information between LMAand MAGs, LMA can deliver data through
    multiple MAGs. Thus the MNattaching in a PMIPv6 domain can receive data packets
    with the samedestination through its multiple network interfaces attaching todifferent
    MAGs simultaneously.</p>"
