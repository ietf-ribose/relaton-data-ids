abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes some methods which may be used by Service
    \n  Providers to provide Virtual Private Networks for some scenarios \n  where
    the Service Provider's network or Customer's network is \n  comprised of part
    of IPv4 network and part of IPv6 network.These\n  situations can't be avoided
    during the process of IPv4 transition to\n  IPv6, e.g. IPv6 backbone network for
    IPv4-IPv6 hybrid VPN sites,or \n  IPv4 backbone network for IPv4-IPv6 hybrid VPN
    sites,or IPv4-IPv6 \n  hybrid backbone network for IPv4-IPv6 hybrid VPN sites.This
    proposal \n  continue to use the concepts described in the Internet draft \n  'BGP/MPLS
    VPN'[2547bis],such as RD,VRF,Route Target and some \n  mechanisms. In BGP/MPLS
    VPN, MPLS is used to forward packets over\n  the backbone, and \"Multiprotocol
    BGP\" is used for distributing VPN \n  routes over the service provider backbone.\n\t
