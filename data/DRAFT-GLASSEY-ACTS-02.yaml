abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Automated Computer Time Service [ACTS] has been provided\nsince
    1988 for public users who need to synchronize computer\nclocks to the correct
    time to a Federally Provided timesource\nfor security, audit, or just general
    synchronization purposes.\nIn the current evolving EC aware landscape, the source
    of time\nused in best computing practices is more and more important to\nthe overall
    dependability of the trust model. This document\nthen, is filed for historical
    purposes on the already widely\nused, publicly available ACTS time service protocol.
