abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the part of the CDN Interconnection
    Control\n   Interface that allows a CDN to trigger activity in an interconnected\n
    \  CDN that is configured to deliver content on its behalf.  The\n   upstream
    CDN can use this mechanism to request that the downstream\n   CDN pre-positions
    metadata or content, or that it invalidates or\n   purges metadata or content.
    \ The upstream CDN can monitor the status\n   of activity that it has triggered
    in the downstream CDN.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
