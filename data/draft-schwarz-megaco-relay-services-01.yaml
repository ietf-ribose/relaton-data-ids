abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the terminology and gives a network model
    fordifferent strategies concerning Voiceband Data (VBD) transport services.The
    purpose of this effort is to set the reference space for describingand evaluating
    Megaco/H.248 signaling procedures. Primary scope arevoiceband data services, typically
    inherent part in voice-over-packetnetworks (e.g., like Internet Telephony).Motivation:VBD
    calls typically start out as a voice call. The modems on the VBDdevices at the
    Termination detect the switch to VBD (like facsimile) andfax modem or data modem
    transmission begins. With the development ofVoice over IP, many CODECs have been
    developed which are optimized forthe transmission and reception of voice. In creating
    these CODECs, VBDtransport may not reliably be used over the same transmission
    channel.In an effort to optimize the transmission of VBD, specialized protocols(e.g.,
    T.38, or V.150) have been developed to provide a more reliabletransport, minimize
    bandwidth usage, etc.</p>"
