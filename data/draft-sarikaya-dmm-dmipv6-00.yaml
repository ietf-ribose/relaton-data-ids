abstract:
- content: "<p>As networks are moving towards flat architectures, a distributed approach
    is needed to Mobile IPv6. This document defines a distributed mobility management
    protocol. Protocol is based on Mobile IPv6 and its extensions for multiple care
    of address registration, flow mobility and dual stack mobile IPv6 with minimum
    extensions. Control and data plane separation is achieved by separating Home Agent
    functionalities into the control and data planes.</p>"
