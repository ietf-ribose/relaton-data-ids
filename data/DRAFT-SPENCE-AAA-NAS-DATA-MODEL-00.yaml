abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Recently, considerable attention has been given to the need to
    better\nstructure the information carried in protocols operating within the\nnetwork
    access environment.  The arguable benefits of structured\ninformation is consistency
    in the definitions and reuse of individual\ndata elements and well defined means
    for extending existing\nstructures to support new or proprietary features and
    capabilities.\nIn an effort to demonstrate the benefits of organizing data elements\nand
    provide a practical means for deploying such a model, this memo\ntakes the existing
    attributes currently used in RADIUS and maps them\ninto a data model.  To demonstrate
    the deployment of the data model\nwithin the network access environment, the data
    model has been\nrepresented as a PIB.  While the data model could be implemented
    to\nrun over protocols other than COPS, SPPI is currently the only\nlanguage available
    which expresses data modeling concepts with\nsufficient detail to demonstrate
    the benefits in a practical manner.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
