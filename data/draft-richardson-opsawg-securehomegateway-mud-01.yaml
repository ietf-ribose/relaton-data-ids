abstract:
- content: "<p>This document details the mechanism used by the CIRA Secure Home Gateway
    and CIRA MUD integration server to return MUD artifacts to participating gateway
    systems. The work in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud] creates a relationship between a device's
    manufacturer and a border gateway that may need to enforce policy. This document
    ads an additional relationship to a service provider, trusted by the border gateway
    to enhance or modify the stated security policy.</p>"
