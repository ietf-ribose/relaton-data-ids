abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification provides an architectural framework, called
    IPv6\nLabel Switching Architecture or 6LSA, for an end-to-end, IP-centric\npacket
    transmission technique that uses the IPv6 packet header Flow\nLabel to establish
    IPv6-based label switched paths.  The label\nswitched paths, called 6LSPs, provide
    application and user specified\nroutes for efficient transport of packets and
    as means for quality of\nservice (QoS) delivery, IPv4 tunneling, VPN and other
    mechanisms.\nThrough look-ups of 20-bit labels instead of 128-bit IPv6 addresses,\nthe
    architecture may provide potential memory and processing savings,\nthe latter
    through significantly reduced address fetches for the low-\npowered, handheld
    devices.  The label has two components comprising\nGlobal Label value and Local
    Label value.  The Global Label value\nfrom the source is delivered to the destination
    unmodified.  However,\nthe intermediate network nodes in 6LSA are allowed to temporarily\nreplace
    the Local Label value with a value of local significance.\nThis enables 6LSA flows
    to be hop-specific although session-based and\nas such a unique QoS delivery technique
    for bandwidth constrained\nmedia. 6LSA also enhances security since label generation
    and\nassignment algorithms can be modified periodically.\n\nFinally, it must be
    pointed out that the 6LSA concept of temporary\nflow label assignment is applicable
    to the 6LSA domain only.  The\nconcept is not applicable to domains outside the
    6LSA.\n\t </p>\n      "
