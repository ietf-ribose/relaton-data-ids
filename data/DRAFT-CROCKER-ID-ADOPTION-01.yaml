abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The productive output of IETF working groups is documents,
    as\n   mandated by the working group's charter.  When a working group is\n   ready
    to develop a particular document it usually \"adopts\" it as a\n   working group
    draft.  The document that a working group adopts and\n   then develops further
    is based on initial input at varying levels of\n   maturity.  An initial working
    group draft might be a document already\n   in wide use, or it might be a blank
    sheet, wholly created by the\n   working group, or it might represent any level
    of maturity in\n   between.  This document discusses the process of creating formal\n
    \  working group drafts that are targeted for publication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
