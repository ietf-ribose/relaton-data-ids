abstract:
- content: "<p>With the boom of Multi-CDN services, more enterprises tend to apply
    Multi-CDN service to deliver better end user experience to online global audiences.
    However, the current Multi-CDN strategy has some defects. Different Multi-CDN
    providers have various implementations of CDN balancing, yet there is no such
    unified DNS protocol because that multiple CNAMEs violates DNS standards. Some
    Multi-CDN implementations MAY have extra lookups for CDN redirection which causes
    longer query latency. This document aims to provide an exclusive DNS RR type CDNNAME(CDN
    name) for Multi-CDN implementation.</p>"
