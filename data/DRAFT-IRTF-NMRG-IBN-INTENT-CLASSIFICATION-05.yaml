abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Intent is an abstract, high-level policy used to operate the
    network.\n   Intent management system includes an interface for users to input\n
    \  requests and an engine to translate the intents into the network\n   configuration
    and manage their life-cycle.\n\n   This document discusses mostly the concept
    of network intents, but\n   other types of intents are also being considered.
    Specifically, it\n   highlights stakeholder perspectives of intent, methods to
    classify\n   and encode intent, the associated intent taxonomy, and defines\n
    \  relevant intent terms where necessary. This document provides a\n   foundation
    for intent related research and facilitates solution\n   development.\n\n   This
    document is a product of the IRTF Network Management Research\n   Group (NMRG).\n\n\t
