abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Networks that use SIP to start and stop sessions between their
    users\n   will frequently be upgraded with software and hardware changes.\n   Users
    will similarly frequently change their client software and the\n   way they use
    the network.  In order to allow troubleshooting and\n   regression testing, it
    is useful to provide debugging as part of the\n   network fabric.  This draft
    describes an event package that provides\n   debugging configuration to SIP entities
    and a SIP private header that\n   triggers logging of SIP signalling and identifies
    logs at mulitiple\n   SIP entities as belonging to a single end-to-end session.\n\n
    \  A list of related IETF drafts and non-IETF specifications is included\n   to
    help develop this topic.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
