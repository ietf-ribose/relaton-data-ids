abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC7623 defines how Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) can be combined
    with Ethernet VPN (EVPN) to deploy ELAN services in very large MPLS networks.
    RFC7623 also describes how Single-Active Multi-homing and per-ISID Load-Balancing
    can be provided to access devices and aggregation networks. In order to speed
    up the network convergence in case of failures on Single-Active Multi-Homed Ethernet
    Segments, RFC7623 defines a CMAC-Flush mechanism that works for different Ethernet
    Segment BMAC address allocation models. This document complements those CMAC-Flush
    procedures for cases in which no PBB- EVPN Ethernet Segments are defined (ESI
    0) and an ISID-based CMAC- Flush granularity is desired.</p>"
