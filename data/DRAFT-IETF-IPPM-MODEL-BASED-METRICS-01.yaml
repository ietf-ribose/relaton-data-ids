abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to
    determine\n   if a long network path can meet predefined end-to-end application\n
    \  performance targets by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to\n   successive
    subpaths.  The subpath at a time tests are designed to\n   exclude all known conditions
    which might prevent the full end-to-end\n   path from meeting the user's target
    application performance.\n\n   This approach makes it possible to to determine
    the IP performance\n   requirements needed to support the desired end-to-end TCP\n
    \  performance.  The IP metrics are based on traffic patterns that mimic\n   TCP
    or other transport protocol but are precomputed independently of\n   the actual
    behavior of the transport protocol over the subpath under\n   test.  This makes
    the measurements open loop, eliminating nearly all\n   of the difficulties encountered
    by traditional bulk transport\n   metrics, which fundamentally depend on congestion
    control equilibrium\n   behavior.\n\n   A natural consequence of this methodology
    is verifiable network\n   measurement: measurements from any given vantage point
    can be\n   verified by repeating them from other vantage points.\n\n   Formatted:
