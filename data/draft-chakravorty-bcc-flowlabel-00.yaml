abstract:
- content: <p>The IPv6 header includes a 20-bit Flow Label field. RFC 3697, "IPv6
    Flow Label Specification" [1] specified this field and minimum requirements for
    using the field. This document first identifies several issues related to the
    current Flow Label specification; then it discusses the limitations of the current
    specification and the need for extending the definition to accommodate emerging
    applications and protocols; finally, a new Flow Label specification is proposed
    that enables more effective usage of this field.</p>
