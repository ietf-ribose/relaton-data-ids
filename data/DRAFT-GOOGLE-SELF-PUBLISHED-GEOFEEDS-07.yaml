abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document records a format whereby a network operator can
    publish\n   a mapping of IP address prefixes to simplified geolocation\n   information,
    colloquially termed a geolocation \"feed\".  Interested\n   parties can poll and
    parse these feeds to update or merge with other\n   geolocation data sources and
    procedures.  This format intentionally\n   only allows specifying coarse level
    location.\n\n   Some technical organizations operating networks that move from
    one\n   conference location to the next have already experimentally published\n
    \  small geolocation feeds.\n\n   This document describes a currently deployed
    format.  At least one\n   consumer (Google) has incorporated these feeds into
    a geolocation\n   data pipeline, and a significant number of ISPs are using it
    to\n   inform them where their prefixes should be geolocated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
