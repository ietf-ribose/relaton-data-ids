abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In most RTP-based multicast applications, the RTP source sends
    inter-\nrelated data.  Due to this interdependency, randomly joining RTP\nreceivers
    usually cannot start consuming the multicast data right\nafter they join the session.
    \ Thus, they often experience a random\nacquisition delay.  One approach to reduce
    this delay is to use an\nauxiliary unicast RTP session with a retransmission server
    to receive\na burst stream that facilitates rapid acquisition of the multicast\nstream.
    \ An RTP receiver may use this approach (or any other\napproach) to achieve rapid
    acquisition.  Yet, due to various factors,\nperformance of the rapid acquisition
    methods usually varies.\nFurthermore, in some cases the RTP receiver may (or may
    have to) do a\nsimple multicast join.  For quality reporting, monitoring and\ndiagnostics
    purposes, it is important to collect detailed information\nfrom the RTP receivers
    about their acquisition and presentation\nexperiences.  This document addresses
    this issue by defining a new\nreport block type, called Multicast Acquisition
    (MA) Report Block,\nwithin the framework of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended
    Reports\n(XR).  This document also defines the necessary signaling of the new\nMA
    report block type in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).\n\t </p>\n      "
