abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU socket option directs the IP layer to
    limit the\n   IPv6 packet size to the minimum required supported MTU from the
    base\n   IPv6 specification, i.e. 1280 bytes.  Many implementations of TCP\n   running
    over IPv6 neglect to check the IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU value when\n   performing MSS
    negotiation and when constructing a TCP segment\n   despite MSS being defined
    to be the MTU less the IP and TCP header\n   sizes (60 bytes for IPv6).  This
    leads to oversized IPv6 packets\n   being sent resulting in unintended Path Maximum
    Transport Unit\n   Discovery (PMTUD) being performed and to fragmented IPv6 packets\n
    \  being sent.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
