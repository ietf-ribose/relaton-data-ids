abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of this document is to provide a mapping of QoS policy
    \ninformation to a form that can be implemented in a directory that uses \n(L)DAP
    as its access protocol. Its derivation is as follows.\n\nThe structure of generic
    policy information is defined in the Policy \nCore Information Model ([PCIM]).
    The mapping of this information to a \nform that can be implemented in a directory
    is defined in the Policy \nCore Schema ([PFSCHEMA]). The [PCIM] is extended to
    represent specific \ninformation needed to represent QoS policies with the QoS
    Information \nModel ([QOSIM]). This draft, then, maps the data defined in the
    [QOSIM] \nto a form that can be implemented in a directory. Specifically, this
    \ndraft refines the concept of generic policy rules, conditions and \nactions
    to cover extensions necessary for representing policies to \ncontrol the configuration
    and management of RSVP and Differentiated \nServices. This document also discusses
    LDAP related issues regarding \nthe implementation of such a schema.\n\n\t </p>\n
