abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a set of cipher suites to add client credential\nprotection
    to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.  By\nnegotiating one of those
    ciphersuites, the TLS clients will be able\nto determine for themselves when,
    how, to what extent and for what\npurpose information about them is communicated
    to others.  The\nciphersuites defined in this document can be used only when public\nkey
    certificates are used in the client authentication process.\n\t </p>\n      "
