abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The DIAMETER base protocol defines message integrity and AVPencryption
    using symmetric transforms to secure the communicationbetween two DIAMETER nodes.
    The base protocol also defines a DIAMETERproxy server, that forwards requests
    to other servers when it detectsthat a given request cannot be satisfied locally.The
    ROAMOPS Working Group has defined a requirement that allows forthe DIAMETER servers
    communicating through the proxy to be able toprovide for end-to-end AVP integrity
    and confidentiality, making itdifficult for the proxy to be able to modify, and/or
    be able to viewsensitive information, within the message. The Mobile-IP and NASREQWorking
    Groups have stated that strong authentication is arequirement for AAA data, such
    as accounting records, for thepurposes of non-repudiation.This DIAMETER extension
    specifies how strong AVP authentication,integrity and encryption can be done using
    asymmetric transforms, byencapsulating Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) data
    into DIAMETERAVPs. The CMS data can also be used to carry X.509 certificates.</p>"
