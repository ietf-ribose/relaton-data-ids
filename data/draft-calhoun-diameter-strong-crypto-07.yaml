abstract:
- content: "<p>The DIAMETER base protocol defines message integrity and AVP encryption
    using symmetric transforms to secure the communication between two DIAMETER nodes.
    The base protocol also defines a DIAMETER proxy server, that forwards requests
    to other servers when it detects that a given request cannot be satisfied locally.
    The ROAMOPS Working Group has defined a requirement that allows for the DIAMETER
    servers communicating through the proxy to be able to provide for end-to-end AVP
    integrity and confidentiality, making it difficult for the proxy to be able to
    modify, and/or be able to view sensitive information, within the message. The
    Mobile-IP and NASREQ Working Groups have stated that strong authentication is
    a requirement for AAA data, such as accounting records, for the purposes of non-repudiation.
    This DIAMETER extension specifies how strong AVP authentication, integrity and
    encryption can be done using asymmetric transforms, by encapsulating Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS) data into DIAMETER AVPs. The CMS data can also be used to
    carry X.509 certificates.</p>"
