abstract:
- content: "<p>Edge RBridges currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses and
    their egress RBridges by observing the data packets ingressed or egressed and
    by the TRILL ESADI protocol. When ingress RBridge receives a data frame whose
    destination address (MAC&amp;VLAN) that RBridge does not know, the data frame
    is flooded within the VLAN across the TRILL campus. This draft describes the framework
    for using directory services to assist edge RBridges by reducing multi-destination
    frames, particularly unknown unicast frames flooding, and ARP/ND, improving TRILL
    (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) network scalability in environments
    such as data centers.</p>"
