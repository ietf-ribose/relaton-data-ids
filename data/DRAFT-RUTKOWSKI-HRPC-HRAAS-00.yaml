abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    The establishment of Human Rights as a Service (HRaaS) has\n
    \   significant potential benefits. Although the generic expressions of\n    human
    rights in legal instruments largely precludes definitive HRaaS\n    specification,
    the establishment of a measurable objective is\n    compelling in the global marketplace
    for internet capabilities made\n    available to the public, including new virtualised
    NFV-SDN based\n    implementations and protocols. This HRaaS draft provides a\n
    \   structured enumeration of human rights found in the principal global\n    legal
    instruments against which standards bodies can evaluate their\n    specifications,
    vendors can differentiate their offerings, and users\n    can compare those offerings
    and make informed decisions.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
