abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides GMPLS OSPF routing enhancements to support\n
    \  signal compatibility constraints associated with WSON network\n   elements.
    These routing enhancements are required in common optical\n   or hybrid electro-optical
    networks where not all of the optical\n   signals in the network are compatible
    with all network elements\n   participating in the network.\n\n   This compatibility
    constraint model is applicable to common optical\n   or hybrid electro optical
    systems such as OEO switches,\n   regenerators, and wavelength converters since
    such systems can be\n   limited to processing only certain types of WSON signals.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
