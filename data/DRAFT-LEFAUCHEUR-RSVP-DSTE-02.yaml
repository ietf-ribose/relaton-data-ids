abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides specification for aggregation of RSVP
    end-to-\n   end reservations over MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels or MPLS
    \n   Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) Tunnels. This \n   approach
    is based on RFC 3175 and simply modifies the corresponding \n   procedures for
    operations over MPLS TE tunnels instead of aggregated \n   RSVP reservations.
    This approach can be used to achieve admission \n   control of a very large number
    of flows in a scalable manner since \n   the devices in the core of the network
    are unaware of the end-to-end \n   RSVP reservations and are only aware of the
    MPLS TE tunnels.\n\t </p>\n      "
