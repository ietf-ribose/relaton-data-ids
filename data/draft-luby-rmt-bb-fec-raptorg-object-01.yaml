abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a Fully-Specified FEC scheme, correspondingto
    FEC Encoding ID XXX, for the RaptorG forward error correction codeand its application
    to reliable delivery of data objects.RaptorG codes are a new family of codes to
    provide superiorflexibility, larger source block sizes and better coding efficiencythan
    Raptor codes in RFC5053. RaptorG is also a fountain code, i.e.,as many encoding
    symbols as needed can be generated by the encoderon-the-fly from the source symbols
    of a source block of data. Thedecoder is able to recover the source block from
    any set of encodingsymbols for most cases equal to the number of source symbols
    and inrare cases with slightly more than the number of source symbols.The RaptorG
    code described here is a systematic code, meaning thatall the source symbols are
    among the encoding symbols that can begenerated.Status of this MemoThis Internet-Draft
