abstract:
- content: "<p>A clear application of the SRv6 Network Programming model consists
    in steering, in a stateless manner, packets through a Service Function Chain (SFC).
    Each Service Function (SF) is identified by a segment. Each SF can enrich its
    operation thanks to metadata present in the SRH. This document describes a practical
    use-case where the SF is a firewall and the metadata helps to drastically decrease
    the number of rules that need to be maintained by the operation team.</p>"
