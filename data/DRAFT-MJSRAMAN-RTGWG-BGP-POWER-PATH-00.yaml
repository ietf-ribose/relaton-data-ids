abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate
    power\n   consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between\n
    \  Autonomous Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS\n   and
    then use suitable modifications to the BGP path selection\n   algorithm to route
    the packets along the paths. Such low-power paths\n   can be identified by using
    the available power-to-bandwidth (PWR)\n   ratio as an additional parameter in
    the BGP Path Selection Algorithm.\n   For re-routing the data traffic through
    these low-power paths, the\n   power based best path is selected and advertised
    as per the modified\n   algorithm proposed in this document. Extensions to the
    Border Gateway\n   Protocol (BGP) can be used to disseminate the PWR ratio metric
    among\n   the AS thereby creating a collaborative approach to reduce the power\n
    \  consumption. The feasibility of our approaches is illustrated by\n   applying
    our algorithm to a subset of the Internet. The techniques\n   proposed in this
    paper for the Inter-AS power reduction require\n   minimal modifications to the
    existing features of the Internet. The\n   proposed techniques can be extended
    to other levels of Internet\n   hierarchy, such as Intra-AS paths, through suitable
    modifications.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
