abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft is now a tombstone.  The -00 version of this document
    has\n   a likely-bad suggestion of how encode DNS queries for A and AAAA\n   RRtypes,
    and only for those RRtypes, in JSON.  The author no longer\n   recommends to do
    this.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
