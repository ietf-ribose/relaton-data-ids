abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow transparent
    routing of IPv6 datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet. Each mobile node is
    always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment
    to the Internet. While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated
    with a care-of address, which provides information about its current point of
    attachment to the Internet. The protocol provides for registering the care-of
    address with a home agent. The home agent sends traffic destined for the mobile
    node through a tunnel to the care-of address.</p>"
