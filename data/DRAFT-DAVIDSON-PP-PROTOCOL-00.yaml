abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Privacy Pass protocol for privacy-\n
    \  preserving authorization of clients to servers.  The privacy\n   requirement
    is that client re-authorization events cannot be linked\n   to any previous initial
    authorization.  Privacy Pass is intended to\n   be used as a performant protocol
    in the Internet setting.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
