abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Full use of electronic mail throughout the world requires that
    people\nbe able to use their own names, written correctly in their own\nlanguages
    and scripts, as mailbox names in email addresses.  This\ndocument introduces a
    series of specifications and operational\nsuggestions that define mechanisms and
    protocol extensions needed to\nfully support internationalized email addresses.
    \ These changes\ninclude an SMTP extension and extension of email header syntax
    to\naccommodate UTF-8 data.  The document set also will include\ndiscussion of
    key assumptions and issues in deploying fully\ninternationalized email.\n\n\n\t
