abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document summarizes a subset of the emerging generic SACM
    Data\n   Model for inter-component distribution of SACM Content in and between\n
    \  SACM Domains.  The subset defined in this document is covering every\n   information
    element that can be acquired using YANG based protocols,\n   i.e. NETCONF, RESTCONF,
    COMI or derived mechanisms that transfer YANG\n   modeled data, such as MUD.  As
    subscriptions to data origins in a\n   SACM domain are one of the architectural
    corner-stones of the SACM\n   architecture, this document recommends the use of
    YANG Push, YANG\n   subscribed Notifications and corresponding Notification Headers
    and\n   Bundles.  Analogously, a mapping of Notification Header content to\n   SACM
    Metadata is provided in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
