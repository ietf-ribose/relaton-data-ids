abstract:
- content: "<p>Historically MPLS label distribution was driven by session oriented
    protocols. In order to obtain a particular routers label binding for a given destination
    FEC one needs to have first an established session with that node. This document
    describes a mechanism to distribute FEC/label mappings through flooding protocols.
    Flooding protocols publish their objects for an unknown set of receivers, therefore
    one can efficiently scale label distribution for use cases where the receiver
    of label information is not directly connected. Application of this technique
    are found in the field of backup (Bypass, R-LFA) routing, Label switched path
    stitching, egress protection, explicit routing and egress ASBR link selection.</p>"
