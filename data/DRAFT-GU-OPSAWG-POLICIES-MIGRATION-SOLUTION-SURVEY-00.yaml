abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft enumerates several kinds of potential solutions
    that may\n   resolve the problem described in I-D.gu-opsawg-policies-migration.\n
    \  The goal is to, on one hand, make deeper analysis to this problem\n   and,
    on the other hand, provide informaiton for gap analysis, and\n   authors of gap
    analysis can make research on the potential solutions\n   to find out whether
    there are existing protocols or mechanisms can be\n   reused to compose a specific
    potential solution.  The solutions\n   introduced here are just high level thought
    and, if one solution is\n   regarded as a preferred way, we need to analyze and
    define, if\n   needed, detail mechanism and protocols in future.\n\n\t </p>\n
