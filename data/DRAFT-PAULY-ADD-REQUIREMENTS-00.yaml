abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes several use cases for discovering DNS\n
    \  resolvers that support encrypted transports, and discusses how\n   solutions
    for these use cases can be designed to use common\n   mechanisms.  It also considers
    the requirements for privacy and\n   security when designing resolver discovery
    mechanisms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
