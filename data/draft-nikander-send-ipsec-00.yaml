abstract:
  content: "<p>The Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) Working Group has produced anInternet
    Draft that proposes to use an IPsec AH header that carriesboth a public key and
    a signature. However, based on the recentdiscussion at the mailing lists it seems
    that such a usage of AH isconsidered inappropriate at least by some members of
    the IPSEC WG.In this draft we introduce an alternative method, where a separateextension
    header is used to carry the public key, and the AH headeronly contains a signature.</p>"
