abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The familiar toolset of VPN and IP/MPLS protocols defined in
    IETF\n   has been discussed as a good starting point for addressing several\n
    \  of the problems described in the NVO3 problem statement and\n   requirements
    drafts. However, there is a significant gap between the\n   VPN technologies and
    the scale and complexity required when the NVEs\n   are running in server hypervisors.\n\n
    \  This draft proposes a solution that bridges the gap between the\n   concepts
    familiar to the data center IT community with some of the\n   best concepts developed
    by the networking industry.\n\n   The proposed solution is based on the understanding
    that in a cloud\n   environment NVEs may reside in end-devices that should not
    be\n   burdened with the complexities of control plane protocols. The\n   complex
    control plane functionalities are decoupled from the\n   forwarding plane to minimize
    the required NVE processing,\n   recognizing that major hypervisor distributions
    already employ\n   Openflow to address this issue.\n\n   The solution also defines
    the mechanisms for scaling data center\n   network control horizontally and interoperates
    seamlessly with\n   existing L2 and L3 VPN devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
