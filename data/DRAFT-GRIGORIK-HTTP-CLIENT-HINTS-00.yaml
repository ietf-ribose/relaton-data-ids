abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An increasing diversity of connected device form factors and
    software\n   capabilities has created a need to deliver varying, or optimized\n
    \  content for each device.\n\n   Client Hints can be used as input to proactive
    content negotiation;\n   just as the Accept header allowed clients to indicate
    what formats\n   they prefer, Client Hints allow clients to indicate a list of
    device\n   and agent specific preferences.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
