abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For when we can't meet in person, when there's interim work
    to be\n   done, or just because the task calls for it, an asynchronous text-\n
    \  based meeting can sometimes be perfectly productive and useful.\n   Given how
    much the IETF uses email already [RFC3934] this document\n   aims to create additional
    guidance for co-chairs and meeting\n   facilitators who might want to host a meeting
    asynchronously with\n   mailing lists.  Drawing from decades of facilitation experience
    in\n   global networks, the document also treats unique considerations for\n   facilitators
    that are introduced by this meeting methodology.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
