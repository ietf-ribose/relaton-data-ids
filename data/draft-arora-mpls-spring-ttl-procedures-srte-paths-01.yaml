abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment routing supports the creation of explicit paths using adjacency-sids,
    node-sids, and anycast-sids. The SR-TE paths are built by stacking the labels
    that represent the nodes and links in the explicit path. A very useful Operations
    And Maintenance requirement is to be able to trace these paths as defined in [RFC8029].
    This document specifies a uniform mechanism to support MPLS traceroute for the
    SR-TE paths when the nodes in the network are following uniform mode or short-pipe
    mode [RFC3443].</p>"
