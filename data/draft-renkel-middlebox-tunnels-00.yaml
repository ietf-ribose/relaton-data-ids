abstract:
  content: "<p>This Internet Draft compares Network Address Translation (NAT) andRealm
    Specific IP (RSIP) tunnels, and the advantages anddisadvantages of each. It then
    shows how the advantages can becombined by implementing NAT as a tunnel in hosts,
    whileminimizing the disadvantages. Based on the advantages of middleboxtunnels
    in general and implementing NAT as a middlebox tunnel inparticular, it then recommends
    that the Middlebox Communicationsarchitecture protocol (MIDCOM) be amended to
    support tunnelsbetween hosts and middleboxes.This .txt version of this internet
    draft is identical to thePostScript version (draft-renkel-middlebox-tunnels-00.ps)
    exceptthat the figures from the PostScript version have been deleted.Please refer
    to the PostScript version for these figures.</p>"
