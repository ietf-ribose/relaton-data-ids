abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Connecting an enterprise site to multiple ISPs over IPv6 using\n
    \  provider-assigned addresses is difficult without the use of some form\n   of
    Network Address Translation (NAT).  Much has been written on this\n   topic over
    the last 10 to 15 years, but it still remains a problem\n   without a clearly
    defined or widely implemented solution.  Any\n   multihoming solution without
    NAT requires hosts at the site to have\n   addresses from each ISP and to select
    the egress ISP by selecting a\n   source address for outgoing packets.  It also
    requires routers at the\n   site to take into account those source addresses when
    forwarding\n   packets out towards the ISPs.\n\n   This document examines currently
    available mechanisms for providing a\n   solution to this problem for a broad
    range of enterprise topologies.\n   It covers the behavior of routers to forward
    traffic taking into\n   account source address, and it covers the behavior of
    hosts to select\n   appropriate default source addresses.  It also covers any
    possible\n   role that routers might play in providing information to hosts to\n
    \  help them select appropriate source addresses.  In the process of\n   exploring
    potential solutions, this document also makes explicit\n   requirements for how
    the solution would be expected to behave from\n   the perspective of an enterprise
    site network administrator.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
