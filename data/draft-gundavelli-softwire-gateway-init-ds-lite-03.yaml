abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Gateway-Initiated Dual-Stack lite (GI-DS-lite) is a modified approachto
    the original Dual-Stack lite (DS-lite) applicable to certaintunnel-based access
    architectures. GI-DS-lite extends existingaccess tunnels beyond the access gateway
    to an IPv4-IPv4 NAT usingsoftwires with an embedded context identifier, that uniquelyidentifies
    the end-system the tunneled packets belong to. The accessgateway determines which
    portion of the traffic requires NAT usinglocal policies and sends/receives this
    portion to/from this softwiretunnel.</p>"
