abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP\nnetworks.
    LSDB synchronization in OSPF is achieved via two methods--\ninitial LSDB synchronization
    when an OSPF router has just been\nconnected to the network and asynchronous flooding
    that ensures\ncontinuous LSDB synchronization in the presence of topology changes\nafter
    the initial procedure was completed.  It may sometime be\nnecessary for OSPF routers
    to resynchronize their LSDBs. OSPF\nstandard, however, does not allow routers
    to do so without actually\nchanging the topology view of the network.  This memo
    describes a\nmechanism to perform such form of out-of-band LSDB synchronization.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
