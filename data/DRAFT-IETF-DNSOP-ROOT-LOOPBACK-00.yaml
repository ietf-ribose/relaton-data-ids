abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round
    trip\n   times to the closest DNS root server.  Such resolvers can greatly\n   decrease
    the round trip time by running a copy of the full root zone\n   on a loopback
    address (such as 127.0.0.1).  Typically, the vast\n   majority of queries going
    to the root are for names that do not exist\n   in the root zone, and the negative
    answers are cached for a much\n   shorter period of time.  This document shows
    how to start and\n   maintain such a copy of the root zone in a manner that is
    secure for\n   the operator of the recursive resolver and does not pose a threat
    to\n   other users of the DNS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
