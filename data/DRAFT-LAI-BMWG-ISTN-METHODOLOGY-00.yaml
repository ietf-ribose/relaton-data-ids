abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the rapid evolution of the aerospace industry, many \"NewSpace\"\n
    \  upstarts are actively deploying their mega-constellations in low\n   Earth
    orbits (LEO) and building integrated space and terrestrial\n   networks (ISTN),
    promising to provide pervasive, low-latency, and\n   high-throughput Internet
    service globally.  Due to the high\n   manufacturing, launching, and updating
    cost of LEO mega-\n   constellations, it is expected that ISTNs can be well designed
    and\n   evaluated before the launch of satellites.  However, the progress of\n
    \  designing, assessing, and understanding new network functionalities\n   and
    protocols for futuristic ISTNs faces a substantial obstacle: lack\n   of standardized
    evaluation methodology with acceptable realism,\n   flexibility, and cost that
    can involve the unique dynamic behaviors\n   of ISTNs.  This memo first reviews
    the unique characteristics of LEO\n   mega-constellations.  Further, it analyzes
    the limitation of existing\n   network evaluation and analysis methodologies under
    ISTN\n   environments.  Finally, it outlines the key requirements of future\n
    \  evaluation methodology tailored for ISTNs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
