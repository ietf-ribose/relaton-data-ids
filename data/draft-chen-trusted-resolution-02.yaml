abstract:
- content: "<p>The Handle System [1][2]is a name service system for handle resolution
    and management over the public Internet. Handle System protocol [3] is designed
    to be transmitted as a byte stream via a TCP connection. This document describes
    a Trusted Resolution System and the protocol extension based on Handle System
    protocol. Trusted resolution aims to achieve credibility verification through
    data signing. The Trusted Resolution System determines whether to perform trusted
    resolution and verification on the response according to the trusted flag requested
    by the client.</p>"
