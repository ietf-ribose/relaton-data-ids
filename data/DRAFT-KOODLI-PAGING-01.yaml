abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an IP paging concept that supports IP dormancy\nfor
    hosts and Mobile Nodes.  The concept specifies a generic model\nthat can be applied
    to several mobility mechanisms (including Mobile\nIPv6, Localized Mobility Managament)
    and is independent of the\nlayer-2 access technology and paging capabilities.
    \ The model allows\nfor optimizations of the benefits of layer-2 paging when present,\nwhile
    minimizing the impact on layer-2 paging.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
