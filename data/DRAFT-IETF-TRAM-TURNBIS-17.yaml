abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   If a host is located behind a NAT, then in certain situations
    it can\n   be impossible for that host to communicate directly with other hosts\n
    \  (peers).  In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use\n   the
    services of an intermediate node that acts as a communication\n   relay.  This
    specification defines a protocol, called TURN (Traversal\n   Using Relays around
    NAT), that allows the host to control the\n   operation of the relay and to exchange
    packets with its peers using\n   the relay.  TURN differs from some other relay
    control protocols in\n   that it allows a client to communicate with multiple
    peers using a\n   single relay address.\n\n   The TURN protocol was designed to
    be used as part of the ICE\n   (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) approach
    to NAT traversal,\n   though it also can be used without ICE.\n\n   This document
    obsoletes RFC 5766 and RFC 6156.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
