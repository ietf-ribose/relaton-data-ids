abstract:
- content: "<p>The traditional IETF Nomcom model treats incumbents and new nominees
    (for the same and other positions) as equivalent. This has not proven realistic
    in practice and has had a number of undesirable side effects. This document reviews
    the issues and the specific changes to the model that take advantage of the differences
    between incumbents and new nominees.</p>"
