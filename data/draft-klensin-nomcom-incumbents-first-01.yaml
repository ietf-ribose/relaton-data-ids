abstract:
  content: "<p>The traditional IETF Nomcom model treats incumbents and new nominees(for
    the same and other positions) as equivalent. This has notproven realistic in practice
    and has had a number of undesirable sideeffects. This document reviews the issues
    and the specific changesto the model that take advantage of the differences betweenincumbents
    and new nominees.</p>"
