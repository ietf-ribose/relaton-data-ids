abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document changes the review requirements needed to get
    some\n   DNSSEC algorithms and resource records added to IANA registries.  It\n
    \  updates RFC 6014 to include hash algorithms for DS records and NSEC3\n   parameters.
    \ It also updates RFC 5155 and RFC 6014, which have\n   requirements for DNSSEC
    algorithms.  It also updates RFC 8624 to say\n   that algorithms that are described
    in RFCs that are not on standards\n   track are only at the \"MAY\" level of implementation
    recommendation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
