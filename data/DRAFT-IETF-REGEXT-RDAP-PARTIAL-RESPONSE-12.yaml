abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include\n
    \  capabilities to request partial responses.  Servers will only return\n   full
    responses that include all of the information that a client is\n   authorized
    to receive.  A partial response capability that limits the\n   amount of information
    returned, especially in the case of search\n   queries, could bring benefits to
    both clients and servers.  This\n   document describes an RDAP query extension
    that allows clients to\n   specify their preference for obtaining a partial response.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
