abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operation of IP over tunnel virtual
    links\n   using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO).  Nodes attached\n
    \  to AERO links can exchange packets via trusted intermediate routers\n   that
    provide forwarding services to reach off-link destinations and\n   route optimization
    services for improved performance.  AERO provides\n   an IPv6 link-local address
    format that supports operation of the IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol
    and links IPv6 ND to IP forwarding.\n   Admission control and address/prefix provisioning
    are supported by\n   the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6),
    while\n   mobility management, quality of service signaling and route\n   optimization
    are naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache\n   updates.  AERO is a
    widely-applicable tunneling solution especially\n   well suited to mobile Virtual
    Private Networks (VPNs) and other\n   applications as described in this document.\n\n\t
