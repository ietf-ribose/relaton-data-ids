abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As more and more modern network applications grow in scale
    and\n   complexity, their demands and requirements on the supporting\n   communication
    network will increase. In particular, these demands\n   require the use of specific
    network management and traffic policies\n   which currently are not provided directly
    by the communication\n   network to these applications. Application demands that
    are similar\n   in nature can be grouped together in grouped/classified application\n
    \  models. This draft specifies the need for application policy on\n   network
    functions (APONF) APONF protocol(s), mechanisms and models\n   required by transport
    applications to easily, accurately, and\n   efficiently select and use the available
    communication network\n   capabilities, i.e., network management and/or traffic
    policies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
