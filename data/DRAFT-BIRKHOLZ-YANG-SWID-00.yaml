abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a YANG module definition that enables
    a system\n   entity to provide detailed information about installed software\n
    \  components.  The structure of the module is based on the Concise\n   Software
    Identifier draft and therefore also strongly related to the\n   ISO 19770-2:2015
    Software Identifiers standard.  Both standards\n   provide no interface to transport
    the SWID tag information between\n   system entities and this document leverages
    the wide adoption of YANG\n   based management interfaces.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
