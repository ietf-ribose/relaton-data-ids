abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)
    are\n   typically managed, in terms of pre-deployment management, as well as\n
    \  rationale and means of monitoring and management of MANET routers\n   running
    the Optimized Link State Routing protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)\n   and its constituent
    MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP).\n   Apart from pre-deployment management
    for setting up IP addresses and\n   security related credentials, OLSRv2 only
    needs routers to agree one\n   single configuration parameter (called \"C\").
    \ Other parameters for\n   tweaking network performance may be determined during
    operation of\n   the network, and need not be the same in all routers.  This,
    using\n   MIB modules and related management protocols such as SNMP (or\n   possibly
    other, less \"chatty\", protocols).  In addition, for\n   debugging purposes,
    monitoring data and performance related counters,\n   as well as notifications
    (\"traps\") can be sent to the Network\n   Management System (NMS) via standardized
    management protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
