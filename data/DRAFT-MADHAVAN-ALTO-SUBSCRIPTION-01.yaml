abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The specification of the ALTO protocol uses map based approaches\n
    \  assuming that the information provided is static for a longer period\n   of
    time.  But in some cases network operators reallocate IP subnets\n   from time
    to time which in turn changes the mapping partitions[I-\n   D.ietf-alto-deployments].
    \ Since the ALTO clients are unaware of the\n   map information changes, clients
    need to query the servers for every\n   service request and many such requests
    are redundant because the\n   information was not changed.  The purpose of this
    memo is to propose\n   a mechanism where ALTO clients can subscribe for event
    notifications\n   from the server\n\n\t </p>\n      "
