abstract:
  content: "<p>This document argues for moving away from certain specific language
    conventions sometimes used by RFC authors and the RFC Production Centre in order
    to encourage the use of more inclusive terminology in Internet-Drafts that are
    work in progress, and in new RFCs that may be published in any of the RFC series.
    The document also provides examples of inclusive terminology as precise alternatives
    for these conventions.</p>"
