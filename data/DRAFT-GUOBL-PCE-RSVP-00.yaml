abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\n
    \  functions in support of traffic engineering in multi-domain Multi-\n   Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)\n   networks.  In this context,
    the ability to compute Traffic\n   Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs)
    in MPLS and GMPLS networks\n   across multiple domains has been identified as
    a key requirement.\n   This document specifies the routing and wavelength assignment
    (RWA)\n   procedures and potential extensions for the use of Resource\n   Reservation
    Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in PCE\n   based MPLS-TE packet
    networks and GMPLS packet and non-packet\n   networks to support a flexible establishment
    and maintenance of Label\n   Switched Paths that cross domain boundaries or cross
    layers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
