abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes an AI based TCP-IP model. By understanding
    how\n   the Network is evolving from a Wireless and Software perspective\n   the
    limitations of current Internet Architecture are identified and\n   the corrections
    needed for the Big Data bottleneck present in\n   current Internet Architecture
    are described further. This draft\n   explains about the implicit life cycle between
    the Cloud, Network\n   and Internet.\n   An important conclusion is drawn that
    the Network cannot be\n   declassified from the Cloud.\n   Based on the evolution
    of the Virtualized Datacenter within the\n   Cloud architecture framework and
    the implicit fact that the Network\n   also needs to grow and scale towards the
    Cloud another important\n   conclusion that the whole Topological address space
    which is the\n   current IP address space (IP as well as IPv6) needs to be\n   reclassified
    or divided into a physical (or logical) address space\n   and a new Virtual address
    space. The Virtual address space is a\n   Centralized Control plane which only
    processes routing information.\n   A future Internet architecture for resolving
    the Big Data bottleneck\n   which introduces a Virtual address space at specific
    Intersection\n   points such as Inter-AS, CsC and IXP (Internet Exchange Points)
    is\n   described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
