abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the relationships between the Internet\n
    \  architecture and the ability of people to exercise their right to\n   peaceful
    assembly and the right to association online.  The Internet\n   increasingly mediates
    our lives, our relationships, and our ability\n   to exercise our human rights.
    \ As a global assemblage, the Internet\n   provides a public space, yet it is
    predominantly built on private\n   infrastructure.  Since Internet protocols and
    architecture play a\n   central role in the management, development, and use of
    the Internet,\n   we analyze the relation between protocols, architecture, and
    the\n   rights to assemble and associate to mitigate infringements on those\n
    \  rights.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
