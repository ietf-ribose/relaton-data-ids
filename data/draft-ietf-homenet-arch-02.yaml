abstract:
- content: "<p>This text describes evolving networking technology within small residential
    home networks. The goal of this memo is to define the architecture for IPv6-based
    home networking and the associated principles, considerations and requirements.
    The text briefly highlights the implications of the introduction of IPv6 for home
    networking, discusses topology scenarios, and suggests how standard IPv6 mechanisms
    and addressing can be employed in home networking. The architecture describes
    the need for specific protocol extensions for certain additional functionality.
    It is assumed that the IPv6 home network is not actively managed, and runs as
    an IPv6-only or dual-stack network. There are no recommendations in this text
    for the IPv4 part of the network.</p>"
