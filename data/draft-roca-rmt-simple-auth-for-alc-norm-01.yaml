abstract:
  content: "<p>This document introduces two schemes that provide a per-packetauthentication
    and integrity service in the context of the ALC andNORM protocols. The first scheme
    is based on digital signatures.Because it relies on asymmetric cryptography, this
    scheme generates ahigh processing load at the sender and to a lesser extent at
    areceiver, as well as a significant transmission overhead. It istherefore well
    suited to low data rate sessions. The second schemerelies on a group Message Authentication
    Code (MAC). Because thisscheme relies symmetric cryptography, MAC calculation
    andverification are fast operations, which makes it suited to high datarate sessions.
    However it only provides a group authentication andintegrity service, which means
    that it only protects againstattackers that are not group members.</p>"
