abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a mechanism for enabling mobile nodes
    in IPv6\n   mobile network to perform route optimization.  The route optimization\n
    \  is possible because mobile router provides a care-of address for\n   mobile
    nodes in mobile network which we call Virtual Care-of Address\n   (VCoA).  The
    VCoA uses the network prefix of the access network.\n   Mobile nodes register
    VCoA as its own care-of address with home agent\n   and correspondent nodes.  With
    little modification to mobile nodes\n   and correspondent nodes, mobile router
    deals with the packets\n   forwarding between them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
