abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB) \nfor use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  \nIn
    particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-\nbased management
    for prioritized Quality of Service functionality \nwithin a LAN, between a CableHome
    residential gateway device and \nCableHome compliant LAN host devices. \nThis
    memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the \nSNMP SMIv2
    [5][6][7].  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP \nframework and existing
    SNMP standards.\n\t </p>\n      "
