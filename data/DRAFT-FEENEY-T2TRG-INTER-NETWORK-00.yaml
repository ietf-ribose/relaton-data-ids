abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The breadth of IoT applications implies that future wireless\n
    \  environments will be characterized by the presence of many diverse,\n   administratively
    independent IoT networks operating in the same\n   physical location.  In many
    cases, these networks will use unlicensed\n   spectrum, due to its low cost and
    ease of deployment.  However, this\n   spectrum is becoming increasingly crowded.
    \ IoT networks will\n   therefore be subject to wireless interference, both from
    similar\n   networks and from networks that use the channel in very different\n
    \  ways.\n\n   To date, there have been few studies or testbeds that fully reflect\n
    \  this aspect of the future IoT operating environment.  This document\n   describes
    some of the main issues in network co-existence in IoT\n   environments, focusing
    on protocol-level interactions.  It identifies\n   two issues for the IRTF t2trg
    community.  The first is to define best\n   practices for performance evaluation
    and protocol design in the\n   context of inter-network interference.  The second
    is the potential\n   use of higher layer protocols to actively participate in
    interference\n   mitigation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
