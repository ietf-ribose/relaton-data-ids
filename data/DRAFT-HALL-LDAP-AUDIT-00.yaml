abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an LDAP auxiliary object class and a single
    \nattribute, which together can be used to store and track the \nentities who
    may have accessed or modified a specific entry in an \nLDAP directory information
    tree. For example, an LDAP application \nmay need to store information which can
    indicate when an entry was \ncreated, when it was accessed, who modified it, and
    other kinds of \nsimilar information, with this information acting as a general-\npurpose
    auditing log for that entry. \nThe object class and attributes defined herein
    are designed for that \npurpose in particular, and are not intended to serve as
    detailed \nauditing information capable of withstanding court-of-law scrutiny,
    \nnor are they designed to be used for journaling-playback purposes. \nThey are
    simply to be used for storing general information about the \nchanges which have
    been made to a specific entry. \n\t </p>\n      "
