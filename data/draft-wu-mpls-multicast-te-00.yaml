- content: "<p>In a core ISP backbone network, when there are a lot of multicast traffic
    which belongs to huge number of multicast groups, providing differentiated services
    to different kind of multicast traffic through this core network becomes a very
    difficult task. Also, how to use network resources in an efficient and optimized
    way to support differentiated multicast service is very difficult.</p>"
