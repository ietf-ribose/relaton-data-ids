abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies an alternative to the certificate validation
    procedure specified in RFC 6487 that reduces aspects of operational fragility
    in the management of certificates in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI),
    while retaining essential security features. The procedure specified in RFC 6487
    requires that Resource Certificates are rejected entirely if they are found to
    overclaim any resources not contained on the issuing certificate, whereas the
    validation process defined here allows an issuing Certification Authority (CA)
    to chose to communicate that such Resource Certificates should be accepted for
    the intersection of their resources and the issuing certificate. It should be
    noted that the validation process defined here considers validation under a single
    trust anchor (TA) only. In particular, concerns regarding overclaims where multiple
    configured TAs claim overlapping resources are considered out of scope for this
    document. This choice is signaled by a set of alternative Object Identifiers (OIDs)
    per "X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers" (RFC 3779) and "Certificate
    Policy (CP) for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)" (RFC 6484). It
    should be noted that in case these OIDs are not used for any certificate under
    a trust anchor, the validation procedure defined here has the same outcome as
    the procedure defined in RFC 6487. Furthermore, this document provides an alternative
    to Route Origin Authorization (ROA) (RFC 6482) and BGPsec Router Certificate (BGPsec
    PKI Profiles -- publication requested) validation.</p>
