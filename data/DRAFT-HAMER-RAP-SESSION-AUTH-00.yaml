abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Establishing multimedia streams must take into account requirements
    \nfor end-to-end QoS, authorization of network resource usage and \naccurate accounting
    for resources used. During session set up, \npolicies may be enforced to ensure
    that the media streams being \nrequested lie within the bounds of the service
    profile established \nfor the requesting host. Similarly, when a host requests
    resources \nto provide a certain QoS for a packet flow, policies may be enforced
    \nto ensure that the required resources lie within the bounds of the \nresource
    profile established for the requesting host.\n\t </p>\n      "
