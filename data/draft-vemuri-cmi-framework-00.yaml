abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper we study the problem of call model integration. Several
    call models are in common use. Most are customized for efficiency of operation
    and ease of access to features within specific domains. Access to features external
    to a given domain may be facilitated by overlaying the call model representation
    intrinsic to said external domain atop the base call model integral to the pre-
    specified base domain.</p>"
