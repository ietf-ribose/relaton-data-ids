abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Neighbour Discovery does not provide a mechanism which allows
    a node to match its router solicitations to advertised responses. The Nonce Neighbour
    Discovery Option was originally defined for Secured Neighbour Discovery. This
    draft describes the use of the Nonce Option for generic router reachability testing.</p>"
