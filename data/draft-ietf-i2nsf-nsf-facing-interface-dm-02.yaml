abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model corresponding to the information
    model for Network Security Functions (NSF)-Facing Interface in Interface to Network
    Security Functions (I2NSF). It describes a data model for the features provided
    by generic security functions. This data model provides vendors with generic components
    that they understand well, so these generic components can be used even if they
    have some vendor specific functions. These generic functions represent a point
    of interoperability, and can be provided by any product that offers the required
    capabilities. Also, if they need additional features for their network security
    functions, the vendors can easily add the features by extending the YANG data
    model in this document.</p>"
