abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recently, there has been a discussion on \"Infrastructure-to-\n
    \  Application Information Exposure\" and the related communications\n   requirements
    in fully controlled (e.g. data centers) or partially\n   controlled environments
    (e.g.  CDN).  One possibility to expose\n   infrastructure information to applications
    in the aforementioned\n   environments is to use yet-to-be-defined ALTO extensions.
    \ This draft\n   discusses requirements for such ALTO extensions for a specific
    use\n   case: Request Routing in CDN Interconnection (CDNI).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
