abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for Service Assurance for Intent-based
    Networking (SAIN). This architecture aims at assuring that service instances are
    running as expected. As services rely upon multiple sub-services provided by the
    underlying network devices and functions, getting the assurance of a healthy service
    is only possible with a holistic view of all involved elements. This architecture
    not only helps to correlate the service degradation with the network root cause
    but also the impacted services when a network component fails or degrades.</p>"
