abstract:
- content: "<p>Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format designed
    for small code size and small message size. There is a need for the ability to
    have basic security services defined for this data format. This document defines
    the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) protocol. This specification describes
    how to create and process signatures, message authentication codes, and encryption
    using CBOR for serialization. COSE additionally describes how to represent cryptographic
    keys using CBOR. In this specification the conventions for the use of a number
    of cryptographic algorithms with COSE. The details of the structure of COSE are
    defined in [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct]. This document along with [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct]
    obsoletes RFC8152.</p>"
