abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CPEs are designed to provide IP connectivity to the Home Network.\n
    \  Most of the CPEs are also providing the IP addresses of the nodes of\n   the
    Home Network.  This makes CPEs good candidates for hosting the\n   Naming Service
    that would make devices reachable from the Home\n   Network but also from the
    Internet.\n\n   CPEs have not been designed to host a Naming Service reachable
    from\n   the Internet.  This would expose the CPEs and the Home Network to\n   resource
    exhaustion which would result in making the Home Network\n   unreachable, and
    most probably would also affect the Home Network\n   inner communications.\n\n
    \  This document describes an Front End Naming Architecture where the\n   CPEs
    manage the DNS(SEC) zone for its Home Network, and outsource the\n   zone to Public
    Server for resolution coming from the Internet.\n\n   The goal of the document
    is first to describe a Naming Architecture\n   that fulfills Home Network Naming
    requirements without exposing the\n   CPE to resource exhaustion.  Then we intend
    the CPEs to be easily\n   configured by the End Users, and describe the necessary
    information\n   the End User is expect to provide to the CPE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
