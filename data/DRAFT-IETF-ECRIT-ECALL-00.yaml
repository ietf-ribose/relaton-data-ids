abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services\n
    \  mechanisms to support the next generation of the Pan European in-\n   vehicle
    emergency call service defined under the eSafety initiative\n   of the European
    Commission (generally referred to as \"eCall\"). eCall\n   is a standardized and
    mandated system for a special form of emergency\n   calls placed by vehicles.
    \ eCall deployment is required by 2015 in\n   European Union member states, and
    eCall (and eCall-compatible\n   systems) are also being deployed in other regions.
    \ eCall provides an\n   integrated voice path and a standardized set of vehicle,
    sensor\n   (e.g., crash related), and location data.  An eCall is recognized and\n
    \  handled as a specialized form of emergency call and is routed to a\n   specialized
    eCall-capable Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)\n   capable of processing the
    vehicle data and trained in handling\n   emergency calls from vehicles.\n\n   Currently,
    eCall functions over circuit-switched cellular telephony;\n   work on next-generation
    eCall (NG-eCall, sometimes called packet-\n   switched eCall or PS-eCall) is now
    in process, and this document\n   assists in that work by describing how to support
    eCall within the\n   IP-based emergency services infrastructure.\n\n   This document
    also registers a MIME Content Type and an Emergency\n   Call Additional Data Block
    for the eCall vehicle data.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
