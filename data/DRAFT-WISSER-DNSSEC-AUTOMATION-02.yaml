abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an algorithm and a protocol to automate\n
    \  DNSSEC Multi-Signer [RFC8901] \"Multi-Signer DNSSEC Models\" setup,\n   operations
    and decomissioning.  Using Model 2 of the Multi-Signer\n   specification, where
    each operator has their own distinct KSK and ZSK\n   sets (or CSK sets), [RFC8078]
    \"Managing DS Records from the Parent\n   via CDS/CDNSKEY\" and [RFC7477] \"Child-to-Parent
    Synchronization in\n   DNS\" to accomplish this.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
