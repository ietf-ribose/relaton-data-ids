abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides both a functional description and a detailed\nspecification
    of the Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA)--a\ndistributed routing protocol
    for multihop networks. A key concept in\nthe protocol's design is an attempt to
    de-couple the generation of\nfar-reaching control message propagation from the
    dynamics of the\nnetwork topology. The basic, underlying algorithm is neither\ndistance-vector
    nor link-state; it is a member of a class referred to\nas link-reversal algorithms.
    The protocol builds a loop-free,\nmultipath routing structure that is used as
    the basis for forwarding\ntraffic to a given destination. The protocol can simultaneously\nsupport
    both source-initiated, on-demand routing for some\ndestinations and destination-initiated,
    proactive routing for other\ndestinations.\n\t </p>\n      "
