abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IPv6 for Dual Stack Hosts and Routers enables mobility
    for the\nmobile node's IPv6 home address or prefix as well as an IPv4 home\naddress,
    irrespective of the IP version supported on the link that\nthe mobile node is
    attached to.  The home agent maintains binding\ncache entries for the IPv6 and
    IPv4 home addresses assigned to the\nmobile node when the mobile node is connected
    via a foreign link.\nThe binding cache entries are deprecated when the mobile
    node\nattaches to its home link.  This document addresses an issue related\nto
    the de-registration procedure and the continued connectivity for\nthe IPv4 home
    address when the mobile node attaches to its IPv6-only\nhome link.\n\t </p>\n
