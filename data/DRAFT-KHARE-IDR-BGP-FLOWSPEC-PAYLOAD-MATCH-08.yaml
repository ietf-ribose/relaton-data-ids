abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The rise in frequency, volume, and pernicious effects of DDoS
    attacks\n   has elevated them from fare for the specialist to generalist press.\n
    \  Numerous reports detail the taxonomy of DDoS attacks, the varying\n   motivations
    of their attackers, as well as the resulting impact for\n   their targets ranging
    from internet or business services to network\n   infrastrutures.\n\n   BGP FlowSpec
    (RFC 5575, \"Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules\")\n   can be used to rapidly
    disseminate filtering rules to mitigate\n   (distributed) denial-of-service (DoS)
    attacks.  Operators can use\n   existing FlowSpec components to match typical
    n-tuple criteria in\n   pre-defined packet header fields such as IP protocol,
    IP prefix or\n   port number.  Recent enhancements to IP Router forwarding plane\n
    \  filter implementations also allow matches at arbitrary locations\n   within
    the packet header or payload.  This capability can be used to\n   essentially
    match a signature for the attack traffic and can be\n   combined with traditional
    n-tuple filter criteria to mitigate\n   volumetric DDoS attacks and reduce false
    positive to a minimum.\n\n   To support this new filtering capability we define
    a new FlowSpec\n   component, \"Flexible Match Conditions\", with similar matching\n
    \  semantics to those of existing components.  This component will allow\n   the
    operator to define a new match condition using a combination of\n   offset and
    pattern values.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
