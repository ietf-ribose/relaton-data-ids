abstract:
- content: "<p>The dynamic establishment and removal of an end-to-end light-path consume
    a lot of time which are also the main burden of control plane in optical transport
    networks. With the frequent arrival and departure of services, the control plane
    needs to handle a large number of control and management messages to conduct path
    computation, resource reservation and cross connection configuration. This draft
    proposes a novel routing mechanism based on Path Table for software-defined optical
    transport networks (SD-OTN). The Path Table reserves partial activated established
    light-paths that can be directly used by subsequent requests for subsequent services.
    This new routing mechanism can reduce the network load and save routing time for
    some services.</p>"
