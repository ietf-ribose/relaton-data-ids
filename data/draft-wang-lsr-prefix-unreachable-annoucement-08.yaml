abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to solve an existing issue with
    Longest Prefix Match (LPM), that exists where an operator domain is divided into
    multiple areas or levels where summarization is utilized. This draft addresses
    a fail-over issue related to a multi areas or levels domain, where a link or node
    down event occurs resulting in an LPM component prefix being omitted from the
    FIB resulting in black hole sink of routing and connectivity loss. This draft
    introduces a new control plane convergence signaling mechanism using a negative
    prefix called Prefix Unreachable Announcement Mechanism(PUAM), utilized to detect
    a link or node down event and signal the RIB that the event has occurred to force
    immediate control plane convergence.</p>"
