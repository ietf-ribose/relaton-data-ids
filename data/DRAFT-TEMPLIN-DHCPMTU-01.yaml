abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IP fragmentation has been shown to be problematic through operational\nexperience
    and through studies conducted over the course of many\nyears.  Some transports
    (e.g., TCP) have the abilitiy to adjust their\nmessage sizes to avoid IP fragmentation,
    however no such capability\nis built into the UDP transport.  UDP applications
    such as DHCP must\ntherefore have a means to perform their own segmentation prior
    to\nsubmitting their data to UDP/IP in order to avoid IP fragmentation.\nThis
    document specifies a segmentation/reassembly capability for DHCP\nusing SEAL.\n\t
