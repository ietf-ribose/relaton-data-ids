abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   On IP-routed datacenter networks, RDMA is deployed using RoCEv2\n
    \  protocol or iWARP.  RoCEv2 specification does not define a strong\n   congestion
    management mechanisms and load balancing methods.  RoCEv2\n   relies on the existing
    Link-Layer Flow-Control IEEE\n   802.1Qbb(Priority-based Flow Control, PFC) to
    provide a lossless\n   fabric.  RoCEv2 Congestion Management(RCM) use ECN(Explicit\n
    \  Congestion Notification, defined in RFC3168) to signal the congestion\n   to
    the destination and use the congestion notification to reduce the\n   rate of
    injection and increase the injection rate when the extent of\n   congestion decreases.
    iWRAP depends on TCP congestion handling.  This\n   document describes the current
    state of flow control and congestion\n   handling in the DC and provides requirements
    for new directions for\n   better congestion control.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
