abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents POP, a Software-Defined Networking (SDN)\n
    \  programming model for the Protocol Oblivious Forwarding (POF)\n   network.
    POF is an SDN forwarding plane technology proposed by\n   Huawei. A POF forwarding
    element (FE) does no need to understand the\n   packet format, and can be programmed
    to support new forwarding\n   protocols. POP enables user to define forwarding
    protocols and\n   program the POF SDN network on the centralized control plane
    with\n   algorithmic policies that are expressed with high-level programming\n
    \  languages.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
