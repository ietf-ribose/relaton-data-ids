abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a solution to the Internet address
    depletion\n   issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part
    of\n   the original IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for\n   Easy
    IPv4), outlines the IPv4 public address pool expansion and the\n   Internet system
    architecture enhancement considerations.\n\n   EzIP may expand an IPv4 address
    by a factor of 256M without affecting\n   the existing IPv4 based Internet, or
    the current private networks. It\n   is in full conformance with the IPv4 protocol,
    and supports not only\n   both direct and private network connectivity, but also
    their\n   interoperability. EzIP deployments may coexist with existing Internet\n
    \  traffic and the IoT (Internet of Things) operations without\n   perturbing
    their setups, while offering end-users the freedom to\n   indepdently choose this
    system.\n\n   EzIP may be implemented as a software or firmware enhancement to\n
    \  Internet edge routers or private network routing gateways, wherever\n   needed,
    or simply installed as an inline adjunct hardware module\n   between the two,
    enabling a seamless introduction.\n\n   The 256M case detailed here establishes
    a complete spherical layer of\n   routers for interfacing between the Internet
    fabic (core plus edge\n   routers) and the end user premises. Incorporating caching
    proxy\n   technology in the gateway, a fairly large geographical region may\n
    \  enjoy EzIP as address expansion using as little as one ordinary IPv4\n   public
    address utilizing IP packets with degenerated EzIP header.\n\n   If IPv4 public
    pool allocations were reorganized, the assignable pool\n   could be multiplied
    by 512M times or even more.\n\n   EzIP will immediately resolve local IPv4 address
    shortages, while\n   being transparent to the rest of the Internet. Under the
    Dual-Stack\n   environment, these proposed interim facilities will relieve the
    IPv4\n   address shortage issue, while affording IPv6 more time to reach\n   maturity
    and to provide the availability levels required for\n   delivering a long-term
    general service.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
