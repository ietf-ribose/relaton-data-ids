abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes methods for performing lsp-ping traceroute\n
    \  over mpls tunnels.  The techniques outlined in RFC 4379 fail to\n   perform
    correct traceroute validation and path discovery for a LSP\n   that goes over
    other mpls tunnels.  This document describes new\n   procedures that can be used
    in conjunction with the standard\n   procedures described in RFC 4379 to trace
    such LSPs.\n\t </p>\n      "
