abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A smooth transition from IPv4 to IPv6 requires that either all hostsare
    upgraded to dual stack before the first hosts can become IPv6-only, or that there
    be some mechanism for IPv6-only hosts to talk toIPv4-only hosts. Expecting the
    former within a reasonable timeframeisn't realistic, based on current adoption
    of dual stack combinedwith the latest projections for the IPv4 depletion that
    point to adate early in the next decade. And the IETF has recently deprecatedthe
    main mechanism that allows the latter: NAT-PT.This document proposes modifications
    to NAT-PT that address thereasons why the mechanism was deprecated. This should
    allow futuredeployment of the modified NAT-PT as an IPv4-to-IPv6 transitionmechanism,
    giving operators the option of running their networkslargely IPv6-only.</p>"
