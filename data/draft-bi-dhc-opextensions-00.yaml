abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new option that can be used by DHCP servers
    to exchange with DHCP clients specific security configuration information. This
    new options also defines a standard parameter format and code so that there will
    be no ambiguity in interoperating the information being exchanged and that there
    will be no issues related to interoperability. It also defines some other options
    that may be used in enterprise networks but not included in [RFC2132].</p>"
