abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MPLS-SPRING (a.k.a., MPLS Segment Routing) could be leveraged
    to\n   realize a unified source routing mechanism across MPLS, IPv4 and IPv6\n
    \  data planes by using a unified source routing instruction set while\n   preserving
    backward compatibility with MPLS-SPRING.  More\n   specifically, the source routing
    instruction set information\n   contained in a source routed packet could be uniformly
    encoded as an\n   MPLS label stack no matter the underlay is IPv4, IPv6 or MPLS.
    \ The\n   unified source routing mechanism could be leveraged to realize a\n   transport-independent
    service function chaining by encoding the\n   service function path information
    or service function chain\n   information as an MPLS label stack.  This document
    describes\n   extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that
    allow\n   a PCE to compute and instantiate service function paths in the unifed\n
    \  source routing based service function chaining context.  The\n   extensions
    specified in this document are applicable to both the\n   stateless PCE model
    and the stateful PCE model.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
