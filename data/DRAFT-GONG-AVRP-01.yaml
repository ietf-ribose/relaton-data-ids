abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Anchor-based Voronoi Routing Protocol in this draft is
    an\n   efficient distributed routing protocol for wireless sensor networks\n   with
    mobile sinks. The design objective of the protocol is to reduce\n   the overall
    updating overhead caused by the movement of mobile sinks\n   and simultaneously
    build efficient data delivery structure. The\n   basic idea behind AVRP is to
    combine the ideas of Voronoi scoping\n   and dynamic anchor node selection. The
    designed protocol is simple,\n   efficient, and easy to implement in dynamic wireless
    sensor networks\n   with mobile sinks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
