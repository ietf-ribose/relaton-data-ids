abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document considers the applicability of Abstraction and
    Control\n   of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture to Packet Optical Integration\n
    \  (POI)in the context of IP/MPLS and Optical internetworking,\n   identifying
    the YANG data models being defined by the IETF to\n   support this deployment
    architecture as well as specific scenarios\n   relevant for Service Providers.\n\n
    \  Existing IETF protocols and data models are identified for each\n   multi-layer
    (packet over optical) scenario with particular focus on\n   the MPI (Multi-Domain
    Service Coordinator to Provisioning Network\n   Controllers Interface)in the ACTN
    architecture.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
