abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As networks migrate towards IPv6, some entities still have
    the\n   requirement for IPv4 configuration.  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341]\n   provides
    a mechanism for obtaining IPv4 configuration information\n   dynamically in IPv6
    networks.  DHCPv4/DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery and\n   Active Leasequery allow a client
    to get DHCP address binding\n   information data in bulk transfer or in real-time
    via TCP.  This\n   document describes an extension of DHCPv6 Bulk and Active Leasequery\n
    \  that provides a mechanism to get DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 lease\n   information.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
