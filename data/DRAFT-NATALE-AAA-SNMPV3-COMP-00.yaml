abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents an overview of SNMPv3 compliance with the
    AAA \nprotocol requirements for network access as stipulated in the \n'Network
    Access AAA Evaluation Criteria' Internet Draft dated April \n26, 2000 [1].  SNMPv3
    protocol features and capabilities directly \nsupport many of the AAA requirements.
    \ In addition, the more \nsophisticated management model (see Section 5, below)
    now underlying \nSNMP -- which has evolved from the original model introduced
    in the \nlate 1980s under the guidance of extensive  use in the field -- \nenables
    the design, development, and deployment of more \nsophisticated management applications
    geared to the overall body of \nAAA protocol requirements (or sub-sets thereof).
