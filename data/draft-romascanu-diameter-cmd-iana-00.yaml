abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Diameter Base specification, described in RFC 3588, provides
    anumber of ways to extend Diameter, with new Diameter commands, i.e.messages used
    by Diameter applications, and applications as the mostextensive enhancements.
    RFC 3588 illustrates the conditions thatlead to the need to define a new Diameter
    application or a newcommand code. Depending on the scope of the Diameter extension
    IETFactions are necessary. Although defining new Diameter applicationsdoes not
    require IETF consensus, defining new Diameter commandsrequires IETF consensus
    per RFC 3588. This has lead to questionabledesign decisions by other Standards
    Development Organizations whichchose to define new applications on existing commands
    rather thanasking for assignment of new command codes for the pure purpose ofavoiding
    bringing their specifications to the IETF. In some casesinteroperability problems
    were causes as an effect of the poor designcaused by overloading existing commands.This
    document aligns the extensibility rules of Diameter applicationwith the Diameter
    commands offering ways to delegate work on Diameterto other SDOs to extend Diameter
    in a way that does not lead to poordesign choices.</p>"
