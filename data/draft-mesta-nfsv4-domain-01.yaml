abstract:
  content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to elicit discussion on configuration
    schemes for determining the domain name to be used by NFSv4 implementations that
    do not natively support users and groups from multiple domains. This document
    also describes a method by which NFSv4 clients and servers can discover a domain
    name value appropriate for qualifying NFSv4 user and group names, by leveraging
    DNS TXT resource records.</p>"
