abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Traditional multicast  routing  mechanisms  (e.g.  DVMRP  and\n
    \  MOSPF  [1][2])  were intended for use within regions where groups are\n   widely
    represented or bandwidth is universally plentiful. When  group\n   members, and
    senders to those group members, are distributed\n   sparsely across a wide area,
    these schemes are not  efficient;  data\n   packets  or  membership report information
    are periodically sent over\n   many links that do  not lead to receivers or  senders,
    \ respectively.\n   This  characteristic  lead  the  Internet  community  to  investigate\n
    \  multicast   routing   architectures   that   efficiently    establish\n   distribution
    \ trees across wide-area internets, where many groups are\n   sparsely represented
    and where bandwidth is not  uniformly  plentiful\n   due   to   the  distances
    \ and  multiple  administrations  traversed.\n   Efficiency is evaluated  in  terms
    \ of  the  state,  control  message\n   processing,  and  data  packet  processing
    required across the entire\n   network in order to deliver data packets to the
    members of the group.\n\t </p>\n      "
