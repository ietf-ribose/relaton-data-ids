abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The current resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) design has\n
    \  no reliability mechanism for the delivery of control messages.\n   Instead,
    RSVP relies on periodic refresh between routers to\n   maintain reservation states.
    \ This approach has several problems\n   in a congested network.  End systems
    send Path and Resv messages\n   to set up RSVP connections.  If the first Path
    or Resv message\n   from an end system is accidentally lost in the network, a
    copy of\n   the message will not be retransmitted until the end of a refresh\n
    \  interval, causing a delay of 30 seconds or more until a reservation\n   is
    established.  If a congested link causes a tear-down message\n   (PathTear or
    ResvTear) to be dropped, the corresponding reservation\n   will not be removed
    from the routers until the RSVP cleanup timer\n   expires.\n\t </p>\n      "
