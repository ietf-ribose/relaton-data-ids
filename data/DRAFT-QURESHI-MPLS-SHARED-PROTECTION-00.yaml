abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses the shared mesh protection concept. Its
    aim\nis to provide fast, guaranteed recovery of service at significantly\nless
    cost of protection capacity compared to other schemes. In\ncompanion documents
    [1,2], extensions to RSVP-TE and OSPF-TE\nprotocols are proposed that enable shared
    mesh protection. Those\nextensions, together with this document, first address
    global repair\nwith path-based protection switching, as opposed to local repair
    of\nLSP failures and reroute. However, the concept can be extended\nstraightforwardly
    to the local repair techniques being considered in\nthe MPLS working group.\n\t
