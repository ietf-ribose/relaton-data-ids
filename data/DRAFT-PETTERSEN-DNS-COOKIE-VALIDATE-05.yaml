abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HTTP State Management Cookies are used for a wide variety of
    tasks on\n   the Internet, from preference handling to user identification.  An\n
    \  important privacy and security feature of cookies is that their\n   information
    can only be sent to a servers in a limited namespace, the\n   domain.\n\n   The
    variation of domain structures that are in use by domain name\n   registries,
    especially the country code Top Level Domains (ccTLD)\n   namespaces, makes it
    difficult to determine what is a valid domain,\n   e.g. example.co.uk and example.no,
    which cookies should be permitted\n   for, and a registry-like domain (subTLDs)
    like co.uk where cookies\n   should not be permitted.\n\n   This document specifies
    an imperfect method using DNS name lookups\n   for cookie domains to determine
    if cookies can be permitted for that\n   domain, based on the assumption that
    most subTLD domains will not\n   have an IP address assigned to them, while most
    legitimate services\n   that share cookies among multiple servers will have an
    IP address for\n   their domain name to make the user's navigation easier by omitting\n
    \  the customary \"www\" prefix.\n\t </p>\n      "
