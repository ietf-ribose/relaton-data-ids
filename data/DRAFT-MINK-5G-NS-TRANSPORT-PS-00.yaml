abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes problem statements for realizing an
    end-to-\n   end network slicing that is expected to provide service-oriented\n
    \  communications between users and applications.  3GPP introduced the\n   network
    slicing concept in the 5G architecture (3GPP Release 15),\n   however, it mainly
    focuses on mobile access and core domains.  In\n   order to reap the benefit of
    the concept, a network slicing needs to\n   be designed across multiple domains
    of the network including non-3GPP\n   parts.  This document analyzes the current
    3GPP 5G network slicing\n   architecture and summarizes problem statements for
    the interworking\n   between the 5G network slicing and the transport network.\n\n\t
