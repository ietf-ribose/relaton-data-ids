abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the use of BGP as a control plane for networks
    that support Service Function Chaining (SFC). The document introduces a new BGP
    address family called the SFC AFI/SAFI with two route types. One route type is
    originated by a node to advertise that it hosts a particular instance of a specified
    service function. This route type also provides "instructions" on how to send
    a packet to the hosting node in a way that indicates that the service function
    has to be applied to the packet. The other route type is used by a Controller
    to advertise the paths of "chains" of service functions, and to give a unique
    designator to each such path so that they can be used in conjunction with the
    Network Service Header. This document adopts the SFC architecture described in
    RFC 7665.</p>
