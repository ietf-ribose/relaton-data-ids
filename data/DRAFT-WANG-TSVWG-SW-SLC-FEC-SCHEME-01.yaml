abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC8680 describes a framework for using Sliding Window Forward
    Error\n   Correction(FEC) codes to protection against packet loss, the\n   framework
    significantly improves FEC efficiency and reduces FEC-\n   related added latency
    compared to block FEC codes defined in RFC\n   6363.  RFC8681 further describes
    two fully specified FEC schemes for\n   Sliding Window Random Linear Codes(RLC),
    the schemes rely on an\n   encoding window that slides over a continuous set of
    source symbols,\n   generating new repair symbols whenever needed.  This document\n
    \  describes a fully specified FEC scheme for Sliding Window Selective\n   Linear
    Code(SLC) over the Galois Field GF (2^^8) , compared to\n   RFC8681, this framework
    use a discrete encoding window which can\n   protect arbitrary media streams selectively,
    and has better recovery\n   performance in scenarios such as layered video coding
    or mixed\n   streams for video streaming applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
