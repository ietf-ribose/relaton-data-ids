abstract:
  content: "\t <t>As deployment of global IP networks become more widespread, thereare
    several challenges that become apparent, one of the moreimportant ones being secure
    access from a users perspective. Basedon the users service requirements, secure
    access will have to besetup between a multitude of nodes in a distributed fashion.
    Thenature of these security requirements may well be real-time anddynamic in nature
    and MUST protect the confidentiality of the user.These requirements are clearly
    manifested in the mobility domain.This draft outlines a general purpose Key Exchange
    framework forNetwork Architectures [KENA] with centralised key generation andmanagement
    tailored for distributed nodes. The draft also describesa specific implementation
    of KENA in the IP mobility domain byextending Mobile IP [Perkins96].</p>"
