abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 8231 describes a set of extensions to Path Computation
    Element\n   Communication Protocol (PCEP) to enable stateful control of MPLS-TE\n
    \  and GMPLS Label Switched Paths(LSPs) via PCEP.  One of the extensions\n   is
    the LSP object which includes a Flag field of the length of 12\n   bits.  However,
    11 bits of the Flag field have already been assigned\n   in RFC 8231, RFC 8281
    and RFC 8623.\n\n   This document proposes to define a new LSP-EXTENDED-FLAG TLV
    for the\n   LSP object for an extended flag field.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
