abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an extension to the Internet Key Exchange version
    2 (IKEv2) protocol for the purpose of a group key management. The protocol is
    in conformance with the Multicast Security (MSEC) key management architecture,
    which contains two components: member registration and group rekeying. Both components
    require a Group Controller/Key Server to download IPsec group security associations
    to authorized members of a group. The group members then exchange IP multicast
    or other group traffic as IPsec packets. This document obsoletes RFC 6407.</p>"
