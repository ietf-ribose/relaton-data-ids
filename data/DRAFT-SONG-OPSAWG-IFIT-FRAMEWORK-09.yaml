abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Efficient network operation increasingly relies on data-plane\n
    \  telemetry.  As networks increase in scale and network operations\n   become
    more sophisticated, traditional Operation, Administration and\n   Maintenance
    (OAM) methods, which include proactive and reactive\n   techniques, running in
    active and passive modes, become more\n   susceptible to measurement accuracy
    and misconfiguration errors.\n\n   With the advent of programmable data-plane,
    emerging on-path\n   telemetry techniques provide unprecedented flow insight and
    realtime\n   notification of network issues (e.g., jitter, increased latency,\n
    \  packet loss, significant bit error variations, and unequal load-\n   balancing).\n\n
    \  This document enumerates several key deployment challenges and\n   requirements
    for on-path telemetry techniques, especially in carrier\n   operator networks.
    \ To address these issues, this document outlines a\n   high-level framework,
    In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (iFIT). iFIT\n   provides several essential
    components that can be assembled to\n   achieve a complete and efficient solution
    for on-path telemetry.\n\n   As a reference and open framework, iFIT only describes
    the basic\n   functions of each identified component and suggests possible\n   applications.
    \ It does not specify the implementation of the\n   components and the interfaces
    between the components.  The compliance\n   of iFIT framework is not mandated
    either.  This informational\n   document aims to clarify the problem domain, and
    summarize the best\n   practices and sensible system design considerations.  The
    iFIT\n   framework helps to guide the analysis on the current standard status\n
    \  and gaps, and motivate new works to complete the ecosystem.  It also\n   helps
    to inspire innovative network telemetry applications supporting\n   advanced network
    operations.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
