abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a protocol that enables tunneling of
    Internet\n   Protocol traffic over a Content Centric Network (CCN) or a Named
    Data\n   Network (NDN).  The target use case for such a protocol is to provide\n
    \  an IP mobility plane for mobile networks that might otherwise use IP-\n   over-IP
    tunneling, such as the GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) used by\n   the Evolved Packet
    Core in LTE networks (LTE-EPC).  By leveraging the\n   elegant, built-in support
    for mobility provided by CCN or NDN, this\n   protocol achieves performance on
    par with LTE-EPC, equivalent\n   efficiency, and substantially lower implementation
    and protocol\n   complexity.  Furthermore, the use of CCN/NDN for this purpose
    paves\n   the way for the deployment of ICN native applications on the mobile\n
    \  network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
