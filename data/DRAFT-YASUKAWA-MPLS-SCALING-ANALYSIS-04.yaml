abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE)
    is\n   deployed in providers' backbone networks. As providers plan to grow\n   these
    networks, they need to discover whether existing protocols and\n   implementations
    can support the network sizes that they are planning.\n\n   This document presents
    an analysis of some of the scaling concerns\n   for MPLS-TE backbone networks,
    and examines the value of two\n   techniques for improving scaling. The intention
    is to motivate the\n   development of appropriate deployment techniques and protocol\n
    \  extensions to enable the application of MPLS-TE in large networks.\n\n   This
    document considers only scalability for point-to-point MPLS-TE.\n   Point-to-multipoint
    MPLS-TE is for future study.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
