abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications
    Research Group (NWCRG). This document follows the taxonomy document [RFC8406]
    and considers coding as a linear combination of packets that operate in and above
    the network layer. In this context, this memo details a multi-gateway satellite
    system to identify use-cases where coding is relevant. As example, coding operating
    in and above the network layer can be exploited to cope with residual losses or
    provide reliable multicast services. The objective is to contribute to a larger
    deployment of such techniques in SATCOM systems. This memo also identifies open
    research issues related to the deployment of coding in SATCOM systems, such as
    the interaction between congestion controls and coding techniques.</p>"
