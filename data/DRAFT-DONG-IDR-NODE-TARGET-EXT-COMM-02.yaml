abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP [RFC4271] has been used to distribute different types of
    routing\n   and policy information in the network.  In some cases, the\n   information
    distributed may be only intended for one or several\n   particular receiving BGP
    nodes in the network.  However, BGP does not\n   have a general mechanism of designating
    the receiving node of the\n   routing information.  This document defines a new
    type of BGP\n   Extended Community called \"Node Target\".  The mechanism of using
    the\n   Node Target Extended Community to steer BGP route distribution to\n   particular
    BGP nodes is specified.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
