abstract:
- content: "<p>For the IPv6 transition, dual-stack deployments require both IPv4 and
    IPv6 transfer capabilities to be deployed in parallel. IPv6-only is considered
    as the ultimate stage where only IPv6 transfer capability is used while ensuring
    global reachability for both IPv6 and IPv4(usually known as IPv4aaS). This document
    specifies requirements and propose a framework for deploying IPv6-only as the
    underlay in multi-domain networks.</p>"
