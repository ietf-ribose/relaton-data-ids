abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC4364 and RFC4659 define respectively BGP extensions to provide\n
    \  VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 services.  When defined RFC5549 has brought up\n   an
    inconsistency in how the next hop is encoded when a VPN-IPv4 NLRI\n   carries
    an IPv6 next hop compared to RFC4364 and RFC4659.  For some\n   reasons, existing
    and deployed implementations of RFC5549 haven't\n   followed the specification
    and are using an VPN-IPv6 next hop as in\n   RFC4364 and RFC4659.  Moving these
    implementations to be compliant\n   with RFC5549 may break existing network deployments.
    \ This document\n   proposes a modification of RFC5549 to enable compliancy of
    these\n   implementations.  These document also proposes additional\n   modifications
    of RFC5549 to address missing points.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
