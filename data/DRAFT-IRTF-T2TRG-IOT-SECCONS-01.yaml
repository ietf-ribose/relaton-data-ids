abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet of Things concept refers to the usage of standard\n
    \  Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing or thing-to-thing\n   communication.
    \ Although the security needs are well-recognized, it\n   is still not fully clear
    how existing IP-based security protocols\n   should be applied to this new setting.
    \ This Internet-Draft first\n   provides an overview of security architecture,
    its deployment model\n   and general security needs in the context of the lifecycle
    of a\n   thing.  Then, it presents challenges and requirements for the\n   successful
    roll-out of new applications and usage of standard IP-\n   based security protocols
    when applied to get a functional Internet of\n   Things.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
