abstract:
- content: <p>Some network operators build and operate data centers that support over
    one hundred thousand servers. In this document, such data centers are referred
    to as "large-scale" to differentiate them from smaller infrastructures. Environments
    of this scale have a unique set of network requirements with an emphasis on operational
    simplicity and network stability. This document summarizes operational experience
    in designing and operating large-scale data centers using BGP as the only routing
    protocol. The intent is to report on a proven and stable routing design that could
    be leveraged by others in the industry.</p>
