abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has
    been\n   extended with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to request\n
    \  information about DHCPv4 bindings.  That mechanism is limited to\n   queries
    for individual bindings.  In some situations individual\n   binding queries may
    not be efficient, or even possible.  This\n   document expands on the Leasequery
    protocol, adding new query types\n   and allowing for bulk transfer of DHCPv4
    binding data via TCP.\n\t </p>\n      "
