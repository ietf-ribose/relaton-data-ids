abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) has
    been\nextended with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to request\ninformation
    about DHCPv6 bindings.  That mechanism is limited to\nqueries for individual bindings.
    \ In some situations individual\nbinding queries may not be efficient, or even
    possible.  This\ndocument specifies extensions to the Leasequery protocol that
    add new\nquery types and allow for bulk DHCPv6 binding data transfer.\n\t </p>\n
