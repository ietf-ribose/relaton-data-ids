abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPFRR and loop-free convergence techniques can deal with single\ntopology
    change events, multiple correlated change events, and in\nsome cases even certain
    uncorrelated events.  However, in all cases\nthere are events which cannot be
    dealt with and the mechanism needs\nto quickly revert to normal convergence.  This
    is known as\n\"Abandoning All Hope\" (AAH).  This document describes the nature
    of\nthe problem, and various proposed mechanisms to deal with it.\n\t </p>\n      "
