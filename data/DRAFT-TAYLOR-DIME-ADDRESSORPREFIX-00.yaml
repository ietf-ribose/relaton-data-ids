abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Section 4.3.1 of the Diameter base specification [RFC6733]
    defines a\n   number of derived AVP data formats.  This collection includes the\n
    \  Address format, which is suitable for encoding complete addresses.\n   In some
    potential applications, however, there is a requirement to\n   encode a prefix
    rather than a complete address.  This document\n   defines the AddressOrPrefix
    derived AVP data format, modelled after\n   the Address format defined in [RFC6733],
    but allowing the same AVP to\n   represent a prefix of any length up to a full
    address.  This document\n   updates RFC 6733.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
