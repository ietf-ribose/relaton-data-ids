abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In multiconnectivity scenarios the end-user devices can\n   simultaneously
    connect to multiple networks based on different access\n   technologies and network
    architectures like WiFi, LTE, DSL.  Both the\n   quality of experience of the
    users and the overall network\n   utilization and efficiency may be improved through
    a smart selection\n   and combination of access and core network paths that can
    dynamically\n   adapt to changing network conditions.  This document presents
    the\n   problem statement and proposes solution principles.  It specifies the\n
    \  requirements and architecture for the multi-access management\n   services
    framework that can be used to 1) flexibly select the best\n   combination of access
    and core network paths for uplink and downlink,\n   as well as 2) determining
    the user plane treatment and traffic\n   distribution over the selected links
    ensuring better network\n   efficiency and enhanced application performance.\n\n\t
