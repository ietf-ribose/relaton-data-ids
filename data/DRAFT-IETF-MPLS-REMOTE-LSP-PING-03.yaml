abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a means of remotely initiating Multiprocal\n\nLabel
    Switched Protocol Pings on Label Switched Paths.  A proxy\n\nping request is sent
    to any Label Switching Routers along a Label\n\nSwitched Path.  The primary motivations
    for this facility are\n\nfirst to limit the number of messages and related processing
    when\n\nusing LSP Ping in large Point-to-Multipoint LSPs, and second to\n\nenable
    leaf to root tracing.Contents\n\t </p>\n      "
