abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an information model for the optical\n
    \  impairment characteristics of optical network elements for use in\n   GMPLS/PCE
    control plane protocols and mechanisms. This information\n   model supports Impairment
    Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment\n   (IA-RWA) in optical networks in which
    path computation and optical\n   path validation are essential components. This
    is not a general\n   network management information model.\n\n   This model is
    based on ITU-T defined optical network element\n   characteristics as given in
    ITU-T recommendation G.680 and related\n   specifications. This model is intentionally
    compatible with a\n   previous impairment free optical information model used
    in optical\n   path computations and wavelength assignment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
