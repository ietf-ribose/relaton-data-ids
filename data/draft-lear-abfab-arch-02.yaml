abstract:
  content: "<p>Over the last decade a substantial amount of work has occurred in thespace
    of federated access management. Most of this effort hasfocused on two use-cases:
    network and web-based access. However, thesolutions to these use-cases that have
    been proposed and deployedtend to have few common building blocks in common.This
    memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions tothe commonly used
    security mechanisms for both federated and non-federated access management, including
    RADIUS, Diameter, GSS, GS2,EAP and SAML. The architecture addresses the problem
    of federatedaccess management to primarily non-web-based services, in a mannerthat
    will scale to large numbers of federations.</p>"
