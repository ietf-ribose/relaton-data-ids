abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS over TCP and traditional HTTP are both stream-oriented,
    client-\n   speaks-first protocols.  They can both be run over a stream-based\n
    \  security protocol like TLS.  A server accepting a stream-based client\n   can
    distinguish between a valid stream of DNS queries and valid\n   stream of HTTP
    requests by simple observation of the first few octets\n   sent by the client.
    \ This can be done without any external\n   demultiplexing mechanism like TCP
    port number or ALPN.\n\n   Implicit multiplexing of the two protocols over a single
    listening\n   port can be useful for obscuring the presence of DNS queries from
    a\n   network observer, which makes it relevant for DNS privacy.\n\n\t </p>\n
