abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note defines the Extended Sequence Number (ESN) experimental\n
    \  modification to TCP to increase TCP's sequence number using the\n   TimeStamp
    (TS) option.  It also modifies the Window Scale (WS) option\n   to support larger
    receiver window enable by the extended sequence\n   number space.  At this stage,
    the purpose of this document is to\n   discuss different design choices to generate
    discussion about the\n   approach to follow.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
