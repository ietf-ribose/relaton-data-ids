abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC8287 defines the extensions to MPLS LSP Ping and Traceroute for
    Segment Routing IGP-Prefix and IGP-Adjacency Segment Identifier (SIDs) with an
    MPLS data plane. [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] proposes a mechanism to allow IGPs to
    compute constraint based path over network and use Segment Routing Prefix-SIDs
    to steer packets along the constraint-based paths. All Prefix-SIDs associated
    with the Flexible Algorithm are assigned to the same IPv4/IPv6 Prefix. Any Segment
    Routing network that uses Flexible Algorithm based path computation needs additional
    details to be carried in the FEC Stack sub-TLV for FEC validaiton. This document
    updates [RFC8287] by modifying IPv4 and IPv6 IGP-Prefix Segment ID FEC sub-TLVs
    to also include algorithm identification.</p>"
