  content: "\n\t <p>   An extended architecture in service function chain is provided\n
    \  including the applications to tenants, SDN controller, network\n   function
    virtualized manager (NFVM) and the service function node.\n   Auto-deployed self-service
    is provided by the orchestration of SDN\n   controller and NFV manager.  Besides,
    fundamental configurations and\n   the realizations of the service function chaining
    are introduced with\n   requirements raised.  Benefitting from the Network function\n
    \  virtualization (NFV) and cloud technologies, SFC in virtual networks\n   can
    bring convenient and elastic network to the customers with\n   central management
