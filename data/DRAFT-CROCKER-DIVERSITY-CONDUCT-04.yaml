abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The process of producing today's Internet technologies, through
    a\n   culture of open participation and diverse collaboration has proved\n   strikingly
    efficient and effective, and it is distinctive among\n   standards organizations.
    \ For its early years, participation in the\n   IETF and its antecedent was almost
    entirely composed of well-funded,\n   American, white, male engineers, demonstrating
    a distinctive and\n   challenging group dynamic, both in management and in personal\n
    \  interactions.  In the case of the IETF, interaction style can often\n   contain
    singularly aggressive behavior, often including singularly\n   hostile tone and
    content.  Groups with greater diversity make better\n   decisions.  Obtaining
    meaningful diversity requires more than generic\n   good will and statements of
    principle.  Many different behaviors can\n   serve to reduce participant diversity
    or participation diversity.\n   This document discusses IETF participation, in
    terms of the nature of\n   diversity and practical issues that can increase or
    decrease it.  The\n   document represents the authors' assessments and recommendations,\n
    \  following general disussions of the issues in the IETF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
