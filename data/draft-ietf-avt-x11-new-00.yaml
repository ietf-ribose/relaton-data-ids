abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the payload format for encapsulating X-protocol
    streams in the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP). This specification is intended
    for X-protocol media streams that are not already handled by other RTP payload
    specifications. This specification gives details of the payload format of X-protocol
    data requests that are carried over RTP/UDP/IP in a shared window session. Multiple
    X protocol requests can be carried over an RTP packet as well as one X protocol
    request can be carried over multiple RTP packets. a shared window header is defined
    within the RTP payload to carry X protocol media requests. An RTCP join and RTP
    reply packets are specified to allow a latecomer to join an on-going session.
    This specification is intended for streaming stored X Window protocol data as
    well as live X protocol data requests.</p>"
