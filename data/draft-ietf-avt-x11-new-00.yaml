abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies the payload format for encapsulatingX-protocol
    streams in the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP).This specification is intended
    for X-protocol media streamsthat are not already handled by other RTP payloadspecifications.
    This specification gives details of thepayload format of X-protocol data requests
    that are carriedover RTP/UDP/IP in a shared window session. Multiple Xprotocol
    requests can be carried over an RTP packet as well asone X protocol request can
    be carried over multiple RTPpackets. a shared window header is defined within
    the RTPpayload to carry X protocol media requests. An RTCP join andRTP reply packets
    are specified to allow a latecomer to joinan on-going session. This specification
    is intended forstreaming stored X Window protocol data as well as live Xprotocol
    data requests.</p>"
