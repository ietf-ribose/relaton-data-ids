abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo documents a consequence of how the TTL re-writing\nmechanism
    works (or rather does not work) for the case of a\nresolver chasing a referral
    chain several layers deep.\n\nThe most common example of this is the case of a
    recursive resolver\ntrying to look up a third level domain name starting from
    the root.\n\nA result of how this works is that it seems to be a good idea to\nrecommend
    an increase of the present standard TTL for delegations\nfrom the root zone from
    the present 48 hours to something\nsignificantly longer. But, more importantly,
    the choice of TTL for\nthe referral from the parent should be a decision made
    by the\nchild, not the parent.\n\t </p>\n      "
