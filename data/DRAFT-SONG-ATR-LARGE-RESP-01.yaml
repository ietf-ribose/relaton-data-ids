abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the increasing use of DNSSEC and IPv6, there are more public\n
    \  evidence and concerns on IPv6 fragmentation issues due to larger DNS\n   payloads
    over IPv6.  This memo introduces an simple improvement on\n   DNS server by replying
    an additional truncated response just after\n   the normal fragmented response.
    \ It can be used to relieve users\n   suffering on DNS latency and failures due
    to large DNS response.  It\n   also can be utilized as a measuring and troubleshooting
    tool to\n   locate the issue and conquer.\n\n   REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: The
    source of the document with test\n   script is currently placed at GitHub [ATR-Github].
    \ Comments and pull\n   request are welcome.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
