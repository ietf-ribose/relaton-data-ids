abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [draft-ietf-dnsind-tsig-*.txt] provides a means of authenticating
    and\n   securing Domain Name System (DNS) queries and responses using shared\n
    \  secret keys via the TSIG resource record (RR).  However, it provides\n   no
    mechanism for setting up such keys other than manual exchange.\n   This document
    describes a TKEY RR that can be used in a number of\n   different modes to establish
    shared secret keys between a DNS\n   resolver and server.\n \n   [changes from
    last draft: add IANA considerations section, make time\n   fields module 2**32,
    minor edits, update author info, ...]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
