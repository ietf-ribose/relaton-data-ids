abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the use of DTCP certificate as an authorization
    extension in the Transport Layer Security Handshake Protocol, according to guidelines
    in RFC 5878. Extensions carried in the client and server Hello messages confirm
    that both parties support the desired authorization data types. Then if supported
    by both the client and server, DTCP certificates are exchanged in the supplemental
    data handshake TLS handshake message as specified in RFC4680.</p>"
