abstract:
- content: "<p>SDP is used in many signalling protocols at call control level (such
    as SAP, SIP, BICC), bearer control level (such as RTSP, IPBCP) and gateway control
    level (such as H.248/MEGACO, MGCP). Scope of this RFC is related to gateway control
    specific SDP usage. Gateway control protocols do usually NOT define and introduce
    any new SDP parameters, however, gateway control protocols need specific SDP parameter
    values in addition to SDP usage at call or bearer control level. Such SDP codepoints
    are collected by this RFC with the purpose of registration with IANA.</p>"
