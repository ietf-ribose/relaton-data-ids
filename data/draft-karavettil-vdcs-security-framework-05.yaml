abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the requirements and technology gaps related
    to security in the virtualized data center services (VDCS). The objective is to
    ensure end-to-end security for various types of carrier services built on virtualized
    infrastructure. The issues covered in this draft are focused on confidentiality
    and integrity of the services in the virtualized environment; including but not
    limited to infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and application (SaaS) services.
    This draft also takes into account transient nature of identity, resources and
    connectivity in the virtualized environment.</p>"
