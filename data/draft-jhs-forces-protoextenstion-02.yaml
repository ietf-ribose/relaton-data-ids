abstract:
- content: "<p>Experience in implementing and deploying ForCES architecture has demonstrated
    need for a few small extensions both to ease programmability and to improve wire
    efficiency of some transactions. This document describes extensions to the ForCES
    Protocol Specification[RFC 5810] semantics to achieve that end goal.</p>"
