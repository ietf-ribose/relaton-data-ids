abstract:
- content: <p>The framework for preparation and comparison of internationalized strings
    ("PRECIS") defines several classes of strings for preparation and comparison.
    In the framework, case mapping is defined because many protocols handle case-sensitive
    or case-insensitive string comparison and therefore preparation of the string
    is mandatory. As described in the mapping for Internationalized Domain Names in
    Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS problem statement, mappings for internationalized
    strings are not limited to case, but also width mapping and mapping of delimiters
    and other specials can be taken into consideration. This document provides guidelines
    for authors of protocol profiles of the PRECIS framework and describes several
    mappings that can be applied between receiving user input and passing permitted
    code points to internationalized protocols. The mappings described here are expected
    to be applied as Additional mapping in the PRECIS framework.</p>
