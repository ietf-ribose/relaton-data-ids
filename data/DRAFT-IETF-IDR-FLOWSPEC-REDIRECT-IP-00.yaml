abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination\n
    \  of traffic flow specification rules. This has many possible\n   applications
    but the primary one for many network operators is the\n   distribution of traffic
    filtering actions for DDoS mitigation. The\n   flow-spec standard [RFC 5575] defines
    a redirect-to-VRF action for\n   policy-based forwarding but this mechanism can
    be difficult to use,\n   particularly in networks without L3 VPNs.\n\n   This
    draft proposes a new redirect-to-IP flow-spec action that\n   provides a simpler
    method of policy-based forwarding. This action is\n   indicated by the presence
    of a new BGP extended community in the\n   flow-spec route. Many routers already
    support a redirect-to-IP\n   filter action and, in this case, the only new functionality
    implied\n   by this draft is the ability to signal the action using flow-spec.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
