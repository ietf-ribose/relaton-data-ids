abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for a host to indicate via the
    Port Control Protocol (PCP) which connections should be protected against network
    failures. These connections will then be subject to high-availability mechanisms
    enabled on the network side. This approach assumes that applications and/or users
    have more visibility about sensitive connections than any heuristic that can be
    enabled on the network side to guess which connections should be check-pointed.</p>"
