abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can be used to provide means
    of personal, terminal, and service mobility in a mobile Internet. This\ndocument
    describes two schemes for supporting service mobility in a\nSIP environment. The
    first assumes that call states are maintained\nand stored within the network and
    home network always controls calls\nand services of its subscribers. The second
    assumes that call states\nare stored in the mobile stations (MSs) and managed
    in a distributed\nmanner, and the visited network controls users' calls and services.\n\t
