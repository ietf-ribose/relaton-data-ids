abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an extension to the Interactive Connectivity\n
    \  Establishment (ICE) protocol that allows ICE agents to send and\n   receive
    candidates incrementally rather than exchanging complete\n   lists.  With such
    incremental provisioning, ICE agents can begin\n   connectivity checks while they
    are still gathering candidates and\n   considerably shorten the time necessary
    for ICE processing to\n   complete.\n\n   The above mechanism is also referred
    to as \"trickle ICE\".\n\n\t </p>\n      "
