abstract:
  content: "<p>The WG MultiMob aims at defining a basic mobile multicast solutionleveraging
    on network localized mobility management, i.e. ProxyMobile IPv6 protocol. The
    solution would be basically based onmulticast group management, i.e. IGMP/MLD,
    proxying at the accessgateway. If such a basic solution is essential from an operationalpoint
    of view, challenges with efficient resource utilization anduser perceived service
    quality still persist. These issues mayprevent large scale deployments of mobile
    multicast applications.This document attempts to identify topics for near future
    extensionof work such as modifying multimob base solution, PMIPv6 and MLD/IGMP
    for optimal multicast support, and adaptation of Handoveroptimization. Far future
    items such as extending to and modifyingof MIPv4/v6 and DSMIP, sender (source)
    mobility, consideration ofmultiple flows and multihoming will be dealt with in
    a futureversion.</p>"
