abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders informthe
    network about the congestion encountered by packets earlier inthe same flow. Today,
    the network may signal congestion to thereceiver by ECN markings or by dropping
    packets, and the receiver maypass this information back to the sender in transport-layer
    feedback.The mechanism to be developed by the ConEx WG will enable the senderto
    also relay this congestion information back into the network in-band at the IP
    layer, such that the total level of congestion isvisible to all IP devices along
    the path, from where it could, forexample, be provided as input to traffic management.</p>"
