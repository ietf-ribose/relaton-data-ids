abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF cannot ordain what standards or protocols are to be
    used on\n   networks, but the standards development process in the IETF does have\n
    \  an impact on society through its normative standards setting process.\n   This
    document aims to bring about a better understanding on the\n   political nature
    of standards and protocols.  Among other things, the\n   IETF's work affects what
    is perceived as technologically possible and\n   useful where networking technologies
    are being deployed, and its\n   standards reflect what is considered by the technical
    community to be\n   feasible and good practice.  Whereas there might not be agreement\n
    \  among the Internet protocol community on the specific political\n   nature
    of the technological development process and its outputs, it\n   is undisputed
    that standards and protocols are both products of a\n   political process, and
    they can also be used for political means.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
