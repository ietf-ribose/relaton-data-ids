abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how a server can send an HTTP request/ response
    pair, known as an exchange, with signatures that vouch for that exchange's authenticity.
    These signatures can be verified against an origin's certificate to establish
    that the exchange is authoritative for an origin even if it was transferred over
    a connection that isn't. The signatures can also be used in other ways described
    in the appendices. These signatures contain countermeasures against downgrade
    and protocol-confusion attacks.</p>"
