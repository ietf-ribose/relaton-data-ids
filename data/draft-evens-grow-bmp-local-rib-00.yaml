abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines access to the Adj-RIB-In
    and locally originated routes (e.g. routes distributed into BGP from protocols
    such as static) but not access to the BGP instance Loc-RIB. This document updates
    the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) RFC 7854 by adding access to the BGP instance
    Local-RIB, as defined in RFC 4271 the routes that have been selected by the local
    BGP speaker's Decision Process. These are the routes over all peers, locally originated,
    and after best-path selection.</p>"
