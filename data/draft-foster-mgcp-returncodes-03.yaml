abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides implementation guidelines for the use of return
    codes in RFC 3435, Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Version 1.0. Return codes
    in RFC 3435 do not cover all possible specific situations that may ever occur
    in a gateway. That is not possible and not necessary. What is important is to
    ensure that the Call Agent that receives a return code behaves appropriately and
    consistently for the given situation. The purpose of this document is to provide
    implementation guidelines to ensure that consistency.</p>"
