abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines two media types and a link relation
    type\n   for sets of links.  The media types can be used to represents links\n
    \  in a standalone fashion, in one case in the native format used in the\n   HTTP
    Link header, and in the other case in a JSON-based format.  The\n   link relation
    can be used to reference these kind of standalone link\n   sets, so that a resource
    can indicate that additional links putting\n   it into context are available someplace
    else.  One typical scenario\n   is when the number of links to put in an HTTP
    Link header field\n   becomes too big, and thus these links should be provided
    by a\n   distinct resource.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
