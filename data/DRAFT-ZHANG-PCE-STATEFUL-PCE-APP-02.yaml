abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides a solution for
    Traffic\n   Engineering (TE) based path calculation in large, multi-domain,\n
    \  multi-region, or multi-layer networks. Depending on whether a PCE\n   keeps
    information about LSPs and reserved resource usage in the\n   network or not,
    it can be categorized as either stateful or\n   stateless.\n\n   This memo describes
    general considerations for stateful PCE(s) and\n   examines its applicability
    through a number of typical scenarios. It\n   shows how stateful PCE(s) can be
    applied to facilitate these\n   applications. PCEP extensions required for stateful
    PCE usage are\n   covered in separate document(s).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
