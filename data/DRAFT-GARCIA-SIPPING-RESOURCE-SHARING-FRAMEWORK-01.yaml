abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This memo proposes a SIP framework used for advertising and
    searching\n   for shared resources, such as services or files, within a given\n
    \  community.  The memo defines the signaling used by users to signal\n   the
    availability of resources stored in their User Agents (UA).  It\n   also provides
    the signaling for users to perform searches of\n   available resources and monitor
    changes in existing resources.\n   Additionally, we provide the signaling used
    to access a resource.\n   These methods can be used in (but are not limited to)
    SIP peer-to-\n   peer systems based on centralized, semi-centralized or fully\n
    \  distributed architectures.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
