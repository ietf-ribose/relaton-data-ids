abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path\n
    \  computation in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol\n   Label Switching
    (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n\n   When a Path Computation Client
    (PCC) requests a PCE for a route, it\n   may be useful for the PCC to specify
    as constraints to the path\n   computation abstract nodes, resources, and Shared
    Risk Link Groups\n   (SRLGs) that are to be explicitly excluded from routes. Such\n
    \  constraints are termed route exclusions.\n\n   The PCE Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) is designed as a communication\n   protocol between PCCs and PCEs. This
    document presents PCEP\n   extensions for route exclusions.\n\t </p>\n      "
