abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP Flow Specification (FlowSpec) [RFC8955] has been proposed to distribute
    BGP FlowSpec NLRI to FlowSpec clients to mitigate (distributed) denial-of-service
    attacks, and to provide traffic filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service.
    Recently, traffic steering applications in the context of SRv6 using FlowSpec
    aslo attract attention. This document introduces the usage of BGP FlowSpec to
    steer packets into an SRv6 Policy.</p>"
