abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Diameter Application for Authentication
    and Authorization in Web Applications (Diameter WebAuth). This Diameter application
    is intended to be used by Diameter clients to perform authentication and authorization
    operations with a Diameter server in web-based environments. It provides facilities
    to allow web sites to authenticate their web user clients using a number of (HTTP)
    authentication schemes. In addition, it supports user authorization using dedicated
    service identifiers. Diameter WebAuth may also be used by non web-based Diameter
    clients and servers that require a lightweight authentication and authorization
    Diameter application.</p>"
