abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter type for BGP, termed
    'Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter', that can be used to perform address prefix
    based route filtering. This ORF-type supports prefix length or range based matching,
    wild-card based address prefix matching, as well as the exact address prefix matching
    for address families.</p>"
