abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo updates the TCP sender-side reaction to a congestion notification
    received via Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). The updated method is less
    conservative than the TCP reaction in response to loss. The intention is to achieve
    good throughput when the queue at the bottleneck is smaller than the bandwidth-delay-
    product of the connection. This is more likely when an Active Queue Management
    (AQM) mechanism has ECN-marked a packet than when a packet was lost. Future versions
    of this document will discuss SCTP as well as other transports using ECN.</p>"
