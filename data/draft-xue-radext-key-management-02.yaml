abstract:
- content: "<p>When a mobile device (referred to as Station (STA) in this work) tries
    to connect to a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), it needs to first perform
    mutual authentication with the EAP server of the network. As a result of successful
    authentication, a Pairwise Master Key (PMK) will be generated, and distributed
    to the STA and the Authenticator of the network by the EAP server respectively.
    The PMK is used for securing the subsequent communications between the STA and
    the Wireless Termination Point (WTP) it attaches to. In practice, the authenticator
    may not be deployed on the WTP. In this case, an approach is required to help
    the WTP to obtain the PMK. This work tries to discuss the issues related with
    this topic and proposes a RADIUS extension to address the problem.</p>"
