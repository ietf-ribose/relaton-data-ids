abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Computing optimum routes for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) across\n
    \  multiple domains in MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and GMPLS\n   networks
    presents a problem because no single point of path\n   computation is aware of
    all of the links and resources in each\n   domain. A solution may be achieved
    using the Path Computation\n   Element (PCE) architecture.\n\n   Where the sequence
    of domains is known a priori, various techniques\n   can be employed to derive
    an optimum path. If the domains are\n   simply-connected, or if the preferred
    points of interconnection are\n   also known, the Per-Domain Path Computation
    technique can be used.\n   Where there are multiple connections between domains
    and there is\n   no preference for the choice of points of interconnection, the\n
    \  Backward Recursive Path Computation Procedure (BRPC) can be used to\n   derive
    an optimal path.\n\n   This document examines techniques to establish the optimum
    path when\n   the sequence of domains is not known in advance. The document\n
    \  shows how the PCE architecture can be extended to allow the optimum\n   sequence
    of domains to be selected, and the optimum end-to-end path\n   to be derived through
    the use of a hierarchical relationship between\n   domains.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
