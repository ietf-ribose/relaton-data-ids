abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   LOOPS (Local Optimizations on Path Segments) aims to provide
    local\n   in-network loss recovery.  It can be used with tunneling protocols to\n
    \  efficiently recover lost packets on a single segment of an end-to-end\n   path
    instead of leaving recovery to the end-to-end protocol,\n   traversing the entire
    path.\n\n   [I-D.welzl-loops-gen-info] defines the information to be carried\n
    \  between LOOPS ingress and egress nodes in a generic way, giving a\n   guideline
    on defining the common elements to embed LOOPS functions in\n   various tunnel
    protocols.  The present document specifies how to\n   embed LOOPS in the overlay
    tunnel protocol chosen for the initial\n   LOOPS specification, Geneve [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].\n\n\t
