abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>OSPF, an IGP widely deployed in IP networks today, requires each
    LSA\nto be refreshed by the originating router every 30 minutes.  This\nmethod
    increases the protocol's robustness and solves potential\nproblems that may be
    caused by software bugs, as well as some\nproperties of the protocol itself. Though
    OSPF expects each LSA to be\nrefreshed independently, ABRs and ASBRs tend to originate
    Type 3/4/5\nLSAs within a short period of time, thus causing periodical network\nresource
    exhaustion by LSA refreshments.  This document discusses the\ntechniques that
    can be used to remedy this problem and provide smooth\nprotocol operation. It
    must be noted that discussed methods can be\napplied to other link-state routing
    protocols, such as IS-IS.\n\t </p>\n      "
