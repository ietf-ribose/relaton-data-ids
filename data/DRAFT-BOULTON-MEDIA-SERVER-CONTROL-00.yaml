abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a protocol for application deployment
    where\n   the application logic and media processing are distributed.  The\n   framework
    uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to establish an\n   application-level
    control mechanism between Application Servers and\n   Media Servers.\n\n   The
    motivation for this protocol is to provide an interface suitable\n   to meet the
    requirements of a distributed, centralized conference\n   system, as defined by
    the XCON work group of the IETF.\n\t </p>\n      "
