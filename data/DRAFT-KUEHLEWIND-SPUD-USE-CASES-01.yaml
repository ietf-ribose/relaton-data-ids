abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document identifies use cases for explicit cooperation
    between\n   endpoints and middleboxes in the Internet under endpoint control.\n
    \  These use cases range from relatively low level applications\n   (improving
    the ability for UDP-based protocols to traverse firewalls)\n   through support
    for new transport services (in-flow prioritization\n   for graceful in-network
    degradation of media streams).  They are\n   intended to provide background for
    deriving the requirements for a\n   Substrate Protocol for User Datagrams (SPUD),
    as discussed at the IAB\n   Stack Evolution in a Middlebox Internet (SEMI) workshop
    in January\n   2015 and the SPUD BoF session at IETF 92 in March 2015.\n\n\t </p>\n
