abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    ping/traceroute and other network diagnostic tools are widely
    used \n    in the IP networks to diagnose the network reachability, IP packet
    \n    routing and routing failure location. However, the existing \n    ping/traceroute
    tools are adaptable only to the pure networks where\n    the routing is based
    on destination address. When an IP packet \n    passes a certain equipment based
    on ACL policy routing, the \n    ping/traceroute packet routing MAY be different
    from the real \n    traffic flow routing. This will lead to an erroneous diagnostic
    \n    result.\n\t </p>\n      "
