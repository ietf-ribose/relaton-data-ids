abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document extends local routing in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)
    and\ndefines a localized routing optimization protocol between Mobility\nAccess
    Gateways within a single provider domain.  The protocol\nsupports operation over
    IPv4 transport networks, IPv4 home address\nmobility and handover.  The Local
    mobility anchor initiated and\nmobile access gateway initiated local routing are
    allowed to setup\nlocal routing path between the mobile and correspondent node
    by\nsending messages to the corresponding mobile access gateway or local\nmobility
    anchor.  If the MN &amp; CN are anchored with two different LMAs\nthen the MN-LMA
    must discover which LMA the CN is registered with\nbefore an optimized local routing
    path can be established.  Mobile\nAccess Gateways create and refresh bindings
    using proxy binding\nupdate and acknowledgement messages.\n\t </p>\n      "
