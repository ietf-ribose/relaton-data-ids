abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an algorithm and a protocol to automate DNSSEC
    Multi-Signer [RFC8901] "Multi-Signer DNSSEC Models" setup, operations and decomissioning.
    Using Model 2 of the Multi-Signer specification, where each operator has their
    own distinct KSK and ZSK sets (or CSK sets), [RFC8078] "Managing DS Records from
    the Parent via CDS/CDNSKEY" and [RFC7477] "Child-to-Parent Synchronization in
    DNS" to accomplish this.</p>
