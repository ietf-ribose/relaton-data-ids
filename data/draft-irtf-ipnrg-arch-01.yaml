abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes an architecture for delay-tolerant networks,and
    is a generalization of the architecture designed for theInterplanetary Internet:
    a communication system to provide Internet-like services across interplanetary
    distances in support of deepspace exploration. This generalization addresses networks
    whoseoperational characteristics make conventional networking approachesbecome
    either unworkable or impractical. We define a message-basedoverlay that exists
    above the transport layer of the networks onwhich it is hosted. The draft presents
    an architectural overviewfollowed by discussions of services, topology, routing,
    security,reliability and state management. It concludes with a discussion ofend-to-end
    information exchange, including an example.</p>"
