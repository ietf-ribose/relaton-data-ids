abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies protocol interfaces profiled by the
    US NSA\n   (United States National Security Agency) for NSS (National Security\n
    \  System) servers that provide public key certificates, CRLs\n   (Certificate
    Revocation Lists), and symmetric keys to NSS clients.\n   Servers that support
    these interfaces are referred to as SODP (Secure\n   Object Delivery Protocol)
    servers. The intended audience for this\n   profile comprises developers of client
    devices that will obtain key\n   management services from NSA-operated SODP servers.
    \ The profile\n   indicates which options from the profiled base specifications
    are\n   necessary to achieve interoperability with those servers.  It also\n   imposes
    requirements on client devices beyond those in the base\n   specifications.  Interfaces
    supported by SODP servers include: EST\n   (Enrollment over Secure Transport)
    and its extensions as well as CMC\n   (Certificate Management over CMS (Cryptographic
    Message Syntax)).\n\n   This profile applies to the capabilities, configuration,
    and\n   operation of all components of US National Security Systems (SP 800-\n
    \  59). It is also appropriate for other US Government systems that\n   process
    high-value information. It is made publicly available for use\n   by developers
    and operators of these and any other system\n   deployments.\n\n   This profile
    conforms to the existing requirements of NSA's\n   Commercial National Security
    Algorithms.  As operational needs evolve\n   over time, this profile will be updated
    to incorporate new commercial\n   algorithms and protocols as they are developed
    and approved for use.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
