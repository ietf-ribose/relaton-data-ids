abstract:
  content: "\t <t>We consider access technology agnostic applications that use IP
    levelQoS primitives to specify their QoS requirements. In future wirelesssystems
    (beyond what is often referred to as 3G), where mobile nodesmay access an IP backbone
    over diverse access networks, the IP levelQoS primitives are not only used to
    specify the requested IP levelservice, but also (through an access specific translation
    function)to help the mobile node's wireless link manager to configure thewireless
    bearer service. In such a scenario, the IP level QoSprimitives must meet special
    requirements in order to support thespectrum efficient management of the wireless
    resources.</p>"
