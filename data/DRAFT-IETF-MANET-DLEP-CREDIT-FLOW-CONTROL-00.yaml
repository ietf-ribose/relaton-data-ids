abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines new DLEP protocol Data Items that are
    used to\n   support credit-based flow control.  The Data Items enable separate\n
    \  but related functions: traffic classification and credit window\n   control.
    \ Traffic classification information is used to identify\n   traffic flows based
    on frame/packet content such as destination\n   address.  Credit window control
    is used to regulate when data may be\n   sent to an associated virtual or physical
    queue.  The Data Items are\n   defined in an extensible and reusable fashion.
    \ Their use will be\n   mandated in other documents defining specific DLEP extensions.
    \ This\n   document also introduces DLEP sub-data items.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
