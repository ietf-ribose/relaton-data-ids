abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SIP REFER method relies on the SIP-Specific Event Notification\n
    \  Framework.  That framework was revised by RFC6665.  This document\n   highlights
    the implications of the requirement changes in RFC6665,\n   and updates the definition
    of the REFER method, RFC3515, to clarify\n   and disambiguate the impact of those
    changes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
