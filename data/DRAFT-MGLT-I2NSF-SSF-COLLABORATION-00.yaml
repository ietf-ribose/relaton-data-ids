abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a collaboration agreement protocol.
    \ The\n   collaboration agreement makes possible individual security services\n
    \  functions (SSF) to collaborate with each other.  The collaboration is\n   mostly
    intended for SSF located in different administrative domains,\n   in which case
    the collaboration cannot be performed by a shared\n   orchestrator.\n\n   The
    collaboration between SSF in different domains assumes the\n   traffic is steered
    through the two domains.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
