abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a stateful pull model for LISP where
    ITRs can\n   subscribe with the mapping system to be notified whenever a\n   particular
    EID mapping changes.  The model uses a publish/subscribe\n   mechanism that supports
    overlapping EID registrations without having\n   to notify the ITR about every
    single prefix covered by a particular\n   subscription.  The pull model is stateful
    in the sense that it\n   requires that the mapping system maintain subscription
    state.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
