abstract:
  content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) is used to convey pathcomputation
    requests and responses between Path Computation Clients(PCCs) and Path Computation
    Elements (PCEs), and also betweencooperating PCEs. In PCEP the path computation
    requests carry detailsof the constraints and objective functions that the PCC
    wishes thePCE to apply in its computation.The mechanisms defined for indicating
    objective functions includethe capability to convey vendor-specific objective
    functions. Thisdocument defines a facility to carry vendor-specific constraints
    inPCEP.</p>"
