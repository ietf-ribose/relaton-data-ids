abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism to calculate congestion
    of a\n   tunnel segment based on RFC 6040 recommendations, and a feedback\n   protocol
    by which to send the measured congestion of the tunnel from\n   egress to ingress
    . A basic  model for measuring tunnel congestion\n   and feedback is described,
    and a protocol for carrying the feedback\n   data is outlined.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
