abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increase number of protocols and applications that rely on
    digital certificates to authenticate either the communication channel (TLS) or
    the data itself (PKIX), the need for providing an efficient revocation system
    is paramount. Although the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) allows for
    efficient lookup of the revocation status of a certificate, the distribution of
    this information via HTTP or HTTPS is not particularly efficient for high volume
    websites without incurring in high distribution costs (e.g., CDN). This draft
    describes how to provide pre-signed OCSP responses via the DNS system in order
    to leverage its distributed nature and, therefore lowering operational costs for
    Certification Authorities.</p>"
