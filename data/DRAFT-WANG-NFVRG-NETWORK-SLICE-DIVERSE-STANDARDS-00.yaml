abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As one of the significant technology in 5G, there are diverse\n
    \  industry communities and standard organizations dedicated in a\n   research
    of Network Slicing, such as IETF, 3GPP, GSMA, ETSI, etc..\n   These organizations
    and communities not only standardize network\n   slicing architecture, management,
    requirements and so on, but also\n   individually focus on specifying network
    slicing in their own ways,\n   offering diverse specifications of it.  Aiming
    at research on a\n   overall review of network slicing standard, this document
    discuss\n   diverse standards in various organizations and communities,\n   furthermore,
    analyzing the emphasis and difference between them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
