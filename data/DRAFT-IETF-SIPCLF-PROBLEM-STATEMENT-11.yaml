abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Well-known web servers such as Apache and web proxies like
    Squid\n   support event logging using a common log format.  The logs produced\n
    \  using these de-facto standard formats are invaluable to system\n   administrators
    for trouble-shooting a server and tool writers to\n   craft tools that mine the
    log files and produce reports and trends.\n   Furthermore, these log files can
    also be used to train anomaly\n   detection systems and feed events into a security
    event management\n   system.  The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) does not have
    a common\n   log format, and as a result, each server supports a distinct log\n
    \  format that makes it unnecessarily complex to produce tools to do\n   trend
    analysis and security detection.  We propose a common log file\n   format for
    SIP servers that can be used uniformly by user agents,\n   proxies, registrars,
    redirect servers as well as back-to-back user\n   agents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
