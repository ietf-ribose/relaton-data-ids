abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses AP selection method utilizing the number
    of \nframe retransmissions in addition to received signal strength (RSSI).\nIn
    a real environment, WLANs are congested by lots of mobile nodes,\nand sometimes
    influenced by other WLAN devices. They result in \ndeterioration of communication
    quality. In such environment, \neach mobile node has to select an AP with better
    performance for \nkeeping its own communication stable. To enable this, we employ
    \nthe number of frame retransmissions and RSSI as selection indexes.\nWe then
    describe an architecture design and implementation for our\nproposed scheme.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
