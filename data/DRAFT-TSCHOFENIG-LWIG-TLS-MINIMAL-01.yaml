abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely used security protocol\n
    \  that offers communication security services at the transport layer.\n   The
    initial design of TLS was focused on the protection of\n   applications running
    on top of the Transmission Control Protocol\n   (TCP), and was a good match for
    securing the Hypertext Transfer\n   Protocol (HTTP).  Subsequent standardization
    efforts lead to the\n   publication of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS),
    which added\n   the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the Datagram Congestion
    Control\n   Protocol (DCCP).  The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP),
    as\n   a more recent connection-oriented transport protocol, also benefits\n   from
    TLS support.\n\n   TLS can be customized in a variety of ways and every feature
    has a\n   certain cost.  To offer input for implementers and system architects\n
    \  this document illustrates the impact each selected TLS features has\n   on
    the overall code size.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
