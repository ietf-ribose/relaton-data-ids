abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft mainly focuses on the scalable architecture and
    publishing\n   protocol standard of REST-based SAAS cloud model Web software in
    non-\n   programming mode, stipulates the data structure pattern and data\n   exchange
    protocol for the construction and release of REST-based\n   scalable Web cloud
    service software systems.  Using the standardized\n   framework and protocol,
    users can easily and quickly design their own\n   software systems in the cloud,
    transfer and release data, which may\n   make conventional software development
    so ease to improve the\n   efficiency of complex database construction and server
    management.\n   Without having to write codes under the standard framework, users
    can\n   get consistent style background to create service, rapidly develop\n   web
    application systems with the function of standard data management\n   and data
    maintenance, and directly publish the software system to the\n   end users of
    the Internet for access and use.  And provide RESTful\n   APIs to facilitate external
    access to required service resources.\n   The framework can thus greatly shorten
    the software development life\n   cycle, and save a great deal of development
    cost and maintenance\n   overhead.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
