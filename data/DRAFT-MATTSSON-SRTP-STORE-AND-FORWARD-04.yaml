abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) was designed to
    allow\nsimple and efficient protection of RTP.  To provide this, encryption\nand
    authentication of media and control signaling are tightly coupled\nto the RTP
    session, and the information in the RTP header.  Hence, in\ngeneral, it is not
    possible to perform store-and-forward of protected\nmedia using SRTP.\n\nThis
    document gives, based on a use case analysis, requirements that\nSRTP and new
    SRTP transforms need to satisfy in order to allow secure\nstore-and-forward operation.
    \ A first outline on how to introduce the\nneeded new functionality and transforms
    in SRTP is also presented.\n\t </p>\n      "
