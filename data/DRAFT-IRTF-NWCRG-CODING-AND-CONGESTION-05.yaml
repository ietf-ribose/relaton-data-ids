abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) is a reliability mechanism
    that is\n   distinct and separate from the retransmission logic in reliable\n
    \  transfer protocols such as TCP.  Using FEC coding can help deal with\n   losses
    at the end of transfers or with networks having non-congestion\n   losses.  However,
    FEC coding mechanisms should not hide congestion\n   signals.  This memo offers
    a discussion of how FEC coding and\n   congestion control can coexist.  Another
    objective is to encourage\n   the research community to also consider congestion
    control aspects\n   when proposing and comparing FEC coding solutions in communication\n
    \  systems.\n\n   This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network\n
    \  Communications Research Group (NWCRG).  The scope of the document is\n   end-to-end
    communications: FEC coding for tunnels is out-of-the scope\n   of the document.\n\n\t
