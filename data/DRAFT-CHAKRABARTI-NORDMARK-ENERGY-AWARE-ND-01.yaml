abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) protocol has been designed
    for\n   neighbor's address resolution, unreachability detection, address\n   autoconfiguration,
    router advertisement and solicitation.  With the\n   progress of Internet adoption
    on various industries including home,\n   wireless and machine-to-machine communications,
    there is a desire for\n   optimizing legacy IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol for
    energy-\n   efficient networks and nodes.  Research indicates that often\n   networked-
    nodes require more energy than stand-alone nodes because a\n   node's energy usage
    depends on network messages it receives and\n   responds.  While reducing energy
    consumption is essential for battery\n   operated nodes in some machines, saving
    energy actually a cost factor\n   in business in general as the explosion of more
    device usage is\n   leading to usage of more servers and network infrastructure
    in all\n   sectors of the society and business.  This document describes a\n   method
    of optimizations by reducing periodic multicast messages,\n   frequent Neighbor
    Solicitation messages and discusses\n   interoperability with legacy IPv6 nodes.
    \ This document also\n   addresses the ND denial of service issues by introducing
    node\n   Registration procedure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
