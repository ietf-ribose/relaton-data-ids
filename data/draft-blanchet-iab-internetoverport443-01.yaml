abstract:
- content: "<p>Users are often connected to Internet with very few outgoing ports
    available, such as only port 80 and 443 over TCP. This situation has many implications
    on designing, deploying and using IETF protocols, such as encaspulating protocols
    within HTTP, difficulty to do traffic engineering, quality of service, peer-to-peer,
    multi-channel protocols or deploying new transport protocols. This document describes
    the situation and its implications.</p>"
