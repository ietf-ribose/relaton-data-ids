abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies an update to the Stateless IP/ICMPTranslation
    Algorithm (SIIT) described in RFC 2765. The algorithmtranslates between IPv4 and
    IPv6 packet headers (including ICMPheaders).This specification addresses both
    a stateless and a stateful mode.In the stateless mode, translation information
    is carried in theaddress itself, permitting both IPv4-&gt;IPv6 and IPv6-&gt;IPv4
    sessionestablishment with neither state nor configuration in the IP/ICMPtranslator.
    In the stateful mode, translation state is maintainedbetween IPv4 address/transport_port
    tuples and IPv6 address/transport_port tuples, enabling IPv6 systems to open sessions
    withIPv4 systems. The choice of operational mode is made by the operatordeploying
    the network and is critical to the operation of theapplications using it.Significant
    issues exist in the stateless and stateful modes that arenot addressed in this
    document, related to the address assignment andthe maintenance of the translation
    tables, respectively. Thisdocument confines itself to the actual translation.Acknowledgement
    of previous workThis document is a product of the 2008-2009 effort to define areplacement
    for NAT-PT. It is an update to and directly derivativefrom Erik Nordmark's [RFC2765],
    which similarly provides bothstateless and stateful translation between IPv4 [RFC0791]
    and IPv6[RFC2460], and between ICMPv4 [RFC0792] and ICMPv6 [RFC4443]. Theoriginal
    document was a product of the NGTRANS working group.The changes in this document
    reflect five components:1. Redescribing the network model to map to present and
    projected usage.2. Moving the address format to the framework document, to coordinate
    with other drafts on the topic.3. Description of both stateful and stateless operation.4.
    Some changes in ICMP.5. Updating references.RequirementsThe keywords MUST, MUST
    NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL,
    when they appear in thisdocument, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>"
