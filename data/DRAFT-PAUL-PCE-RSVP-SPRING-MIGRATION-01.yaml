abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a SDN environment, path computation element protocol(PCEP)\n
    \  (RFC 5440) is used between a controller and the network devices,\n   using
    which controller can setup and tear down Resource ReserVation\n   Protocol (RSVP)
    based label switched paths(LSPs) in the network\n   having Path Computation Client
    (PCC) as Label Switched Router (LSR).\n   Draft draft-sivabalan-pce-segment-routing
    extends PCEP specification\n   in order to support setup and teardown of Segment
    Routing(SR) Label\n   Switched Path(LSR). In a mixed environment where some of
    the LSPs are\n   setup using PCEP use RSVP and some LSPs are based on Segment\n
    \  routing(SR). The specifications lacks a method to advertise the\n   LSP preferenace
    to use one type of LSP over other when those are\n   setup using PCEP. This draft
    defines a method to advertise the\n   preference for any LSP which is setup using
    PCEP.\n\n   This document proposes new optional TLV that can be used to announce\n
    \  the preference of LSP which is being setup using PCEP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
