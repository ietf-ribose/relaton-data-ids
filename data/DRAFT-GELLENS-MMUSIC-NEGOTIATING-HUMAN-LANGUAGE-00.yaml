abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities,
    and\n   preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.  When\n   establishing
    interactive communication \"calls\" there needs to be a\n   way to communicate
    and ideally match (i.e., negotiate) the caller's\n   language preferences with
    the capabilities of the called party.  This\n   is especially important with emergency
    calls, where a call can be\n   routed to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)
    or call taker\n   capable of communicating with the user, or a translator or relay\n
    \  operator can be bridged into the call during setup, but this applies\n   to
    non-emergency calls as well (as an example, when calling a company\n   call center).\n\n
    \  This document describes the need and expected use, and describes a\n   solution
    using new SDP stream attributes plus an optional SIP \"hint.\"\n\n\t </p>\n      "
