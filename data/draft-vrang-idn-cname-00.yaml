abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an implementation technique for enforcing equivalence
    between different names in the Domain Name System by synthesizing CNAME records
    on the fly. It aims to describe some of the advantages and drawbacks of this approach,
    and how it fits into the overall pattern of the current efforts to provide access
    to internationalized domain names using the DNS</p>"
