abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo proposes two new RADIUS attributes with each to carryan
    Internal Port number and a Configured External Port number,both are associated
    with a specific NAT device and a specific user,and are configured on a RADIUS
    server such that when the userrequests an Internet connection, the port mapping
    information canbe conveyed to NAS that co-locates with the NAT device via RADIUSprotocol,
    and is used during the NAT operation for IP flows to andfrom that user. The two
    attributes also include an IPv4 address orIPv6 address, respectively, as the pinhole
    internal IP address atthe NAT device.</p>"
