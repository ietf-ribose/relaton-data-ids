abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Diameter is a scalable protocol to support authentication and\n
    \  authorisation inquiries.  It handles a variety of challenge and\n   response
    types for applications such as network access.  For use in\n   application protocols,
    a different class of challenge and response\n   types are needed, most commonly
    captured in SASL.  This specification\n   allows SASL handshakes to be carried
    in Diameter messages.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
