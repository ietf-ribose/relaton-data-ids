abstract:
- content: "<p>This document permits usage of Internationalized Email Addresses in
    the EPP protocol. The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), being developed
    before appearing the standards for Internationalized Email Addresses (EAI), does
    not support such email addressed. This document describes an EPP extension that
    allows EAI addresses to be used with an EPP object mapping like the EPP contact
    mapping. TO BE REMOVED on turning to RFC: The document is edited in the dedicated
    github repo (https://github.com/beldmit/eppeai). Please send your submissions
    via GitHub.</p>"
