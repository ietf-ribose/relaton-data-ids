abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DHCPv6 protocol, defined in [RFC3315] allows for multiple
    servers\n   to operate on a single network, however it does not define any way\n
    \  the servers could share information about currently active clients\n   and
    their leases.  Some sites are interested in running multiple\n   servers in such
    a way as to provide increased availability in case of\n   server failure.  In
    order for this to work reliably, the cooperating\n   primary and secondary servers
    must maintain a consistent database of\n   the lease information.  [RFC3315] allows
    for but does not define any\n   redundancy or failover mechanisms.  This document
    outlines\n   requirements for DHCPv6 failover, enumerates related problems, and\n
    \  discusses the proposed scope of work to be conducted.  This document\n   does
    not define a DHCPv6 failover protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
