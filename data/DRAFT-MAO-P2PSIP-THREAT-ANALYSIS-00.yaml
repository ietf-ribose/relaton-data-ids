abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides a threat analysis for peer-to-peer networks,\nwhere
    the system relies on each individual peer to route message,\nstore data, and provide
    services.  The threats against P2P network\ninclude those that target individual
    peers, those that target routing\nprotocol, those that target identity management,
    and those that\ntarget stored data.  Focusing on distributed hash table based
    P2P\nnetwork, we first establish a threat model and perform a triage of\nvarious
    assets in a P2P system.  We then describe each individual\nthreat in details,
    including threat description, impact of attack,\nand possible mitigations.  The
    threats and mitigations are discussed\nunder the context of feasibility and practicality,
    with the ultimate\ngoal of achieving better understanding of the threats for secure
    P2P\nsystem design.\n\t </p>\n      "
