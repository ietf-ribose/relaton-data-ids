abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Explicit multicast(Xcast)[1] is a new kind of Internet multicast,and
    encodes the list of destinations within its packet. Thisdocument specifies tunneling
    scheme of Xcast packets. Since asingle Xcast tunnel has multiple egress-nodes,
    the original Xcastpacket can be encapsulated either within a Xcast packet or within
    aunicast packet. When tunneled by Xcast-in-Xcast encapsulation, thebitmap of the
    original Xcast packet is overwritten by the bitmap ofthe tunnel Xcast packet at
    tunnel egress-nodes, in order to controlthe active destination set.</p>"
