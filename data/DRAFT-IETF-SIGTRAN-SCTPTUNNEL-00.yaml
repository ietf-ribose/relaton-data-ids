abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Simple Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [1] provides a
    \nstandard method for transporting messages over IP, with features\nsuch as multi-homing
    and multi-stream built into the protocol \nfor additional reliability and real-time
    delivery.  This memo\ndefines a method for tunneling SCTP over a single UDP port
    in\norder to simplify initial implementations.  This memo is intended\nto become
    an Experimental document and is not intended as a\nstandard of any kind.\n\t </p>\n
