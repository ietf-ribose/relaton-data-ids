abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces an information model for network policies.
    This model operates as policy model that can be linked to other information model
    such as the I2RS RIB information model. Some applications that utilize the services
    of I2RS client may require specific set of data in response to network events
    or conditions based on pre-established rules. In order to reduce the data flow
    through the network, the I2RS client needs to signal the I2RS agent to filter
    some of the collected data or events prior to transmission, or group the data
    prior to transmission to the i2rs client. This functionality is necessary to meet
    the requirements i2rs enabled services which include service-layer routing improvements,
    and control of traffic flows and exit points. The information model is based on
    extensible information model for representing policies, for example, the Policy
    Core Information Model (PCIM) (RFC3060), and an extension to this model to address
    the need for QoS management, called the Quality of Service (QoS) Policy Information
    Model (QPIM)(RFC3644) and policy based routing.</p>"
