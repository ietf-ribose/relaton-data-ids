abstract:
  content: "<p>The Internet has recently seen the emergence of applications that involvethe
    ongoing transmission, or ''pushing'', of structured data from a server toone or
    more client nodes. Most current applications send this data usingunicast communications
    - usually over TCP connections. However, similarapplications can also be implemented
    using multicast-based protocols.Multicast not only improves the scalability of
    this particular class ofapplication, but also makes possible an additional class
    of application inwhich the participants can act as peers - sending data as well
    as receiving. This Internet Draft describes the ''Multicast Attribute Framing
    Protocol''(MAFP) - a generic, attribute-based data representation, intended for
    awide variety of multicast-based applications. It is currently being usedto implement
    the ''multikit'' generic multicast session browser(http://www.lvn.com/multikit).
    This draft describes an early version ofMAFP that is likely to undergo changes
    in the future. However, it isbeing described now, in the hope that it will promote
    open discussion ofthis and similar protocols - ideally leading to the adoption
    of an open,interoperable standard for this class of application.</p>"
