abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The IETF PCN Working Group has continued its work investigating
    pre-congestion and admission control mechanisms. This work hasprogressed under
    the current charter, but has not yet consideredrelated legacy PSTN interactions
    or the need for ubiquitousconnectivity between users on dissimilar networks. The
    PCN chartercould be improved by a strong positive statement to the effectcommitting
    to future work addressing legacy networks.In that light, please consider the questions
    below which includedifferential PCN treatment based on traffic types, security,
    and PSTNinteroperability concerns. It seems helpful to have a touchstone ofsome
    concerns relative to the PSTN network and IP network Gateway inorder to confirm
    that they will be addressed in future work. Thisattempt is motivated by a desire
    to avoid the accidental omission ofa topic that may be hard to \"retrofit\" in
    later.</p>"
