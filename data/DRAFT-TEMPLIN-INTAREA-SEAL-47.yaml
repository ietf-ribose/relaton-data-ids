abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For the purpose of this document, a subnetwork is defined as
    a\n   virtual topology configured over a connected IP network routing\n   region
    and bounded by encapsulating border nodes.  These virtual\n   topologies are manifested
    by tunnels that may span multiple IP and/or\n   sub-IP layer forwarding hops,
    and can introduce failure modes due to\n   packet duplication, packet reordering,
    source address spoofing and\n   traversal of links with diverse Maximum Transmission
    Units (MTUs).\n   This document specifies a Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation\n
    \  Layer (SEAL) that addresses these issues.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
