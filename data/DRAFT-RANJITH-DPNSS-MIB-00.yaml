    (MIB)\nfor use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\nIn
    particular, it describes a set of managed objects for SNMP-based\nmanagement of
    DPNSS 1 interfaces.  DPNSS 1 is a common-channel\nsignaling system and is primarily
    intended for use between PBXs in\nprivate networks via time-slot 16 of 2.048 Mbit/s
    digital\ntransmission system. Similarly it may be used in time-slot 24 of a\n1.544
    Mbit/s digital transmission system. The DPNSS 1 protocol is\ncompletely specified
    in British Telecom Network Requirement 188\n(BTNR 188) series of specifications
    [10].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
