abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between
    two PCEs. RFC 5440 defines the Include Route Object (IRO) to specify network elements
    to be traversed in the computed path. The specification did not specify if the
    IRO contains an ordered or un-ordered list of sub-objects. During recent discussions,
    it was determined that there was a need to define a standard representation to
    ensure interoperability. An informal survey was conducted to determine the state
    of current and planned implementations with respect to IRO ordering and the handling
    of an attribute of the IRO's sub-object, the Loose hop bit (L bit). This document
    updates RFC 5440 regarding the IRO specification, based on the survey conclusion
    and recommendation.</p>"
