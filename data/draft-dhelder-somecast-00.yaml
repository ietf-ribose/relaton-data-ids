abstract:
  content: "<p>Somecast is a multi-point delivery technology that allows a packet
    tobe sent to a set of destinations. Somecast delivery means that thenetwork delivers
    one copy of a packet to each destination listed inthe packet. Somecast can be
    used in small multi-user sessions, suchas multimedia conferences and multiplayer
    games, or used with endhostmulticast for larger sessions. This document describes
    a possibleimplementation of somecast in IPv4. Somecast is implemented by usingan
    IPv4 header option that includes a list of up to 9 additionaldestination addresses.
    This document also describes how somecast canbe incrementally deployed.</p>"
