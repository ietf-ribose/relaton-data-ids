abstract:
- content: "<p>Somecast is a multi-point delivery technology that allows a packet
    to be sent to a set of destinations. Somecast delivery means that the network
    delivers one copy of a packet to each destination listed in the packet. Somecast
    can be used in small multi-user sessions, such as multimedia conferences and multiplayer
    games, or used with endhost multicast for larger sessions. This document describes
    a possible implementation of somecast in IPv4. Somecast is implemented by using
    an IPv4 header option that includes a list of up to 9 additional destination addresses.
    This document also describes how somecast can be incrementally deployed.</p>"
