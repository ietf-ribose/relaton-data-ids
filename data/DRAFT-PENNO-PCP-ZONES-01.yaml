abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A zone is a notion which denotes a routing instance, a set
    interfaces\n   or prefixes characterized by having a different address realm and/or\n
    \  security policy.  A NAT device can route packets with the same source\n   IP
    address to different zones depending on configuration policies\n   such as destination
    IP address.  This functionality has been present\n   for many years in NAT devices
    from multiple vendors.  PCP allows a\n   host to interact with a PCP-controlled
    NAT device and request an\n   external IP and port.  Therefore a PCP Server that
    controls the NAT\n   device and receives a PCP request from a host needs to know
    from\n   which NAT pool to allocate an external IP address and port.  This\n   document
    specifies an extension to PCP to support the zone concept.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
