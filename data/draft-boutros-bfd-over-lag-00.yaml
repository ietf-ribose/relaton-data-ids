abstract:
- content: "<p>The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol is used to detect
    faults on interfaces and data links. This document describes a mechanism to run
    a BFD async session per member link of a Link Aggregation (LAG) interface, BFD
    would be able to run at a much aggressive rate then Link aggregation control protocol
    (LACP), and can run in the absence of LACP, and would be able to verify L3 connectivity
    per member link.</p>"
