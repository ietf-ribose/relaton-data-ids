abstract:
- content: <p>This specification specifies how the Uniform Resource Name (URN) reserved
    for the GSMA (GSM Association) identities and its sub- namespace for the IMEI
    (International Mobile station Equipment Identity) can be used as an instance-id.
    Its purpose is to fulfil the requirements in RFC 5626 [1] that state "If a URN
    scheme other than UUID (Universally unique identifier) is used, the UA (User Agent)
    MUST only use URNs for which an RFC (from the IETF stream) defines how the specific
    URN needs to be constructed and used in the "+sip.instance" Contact header field
    parameter for outbound behavior."</p>
