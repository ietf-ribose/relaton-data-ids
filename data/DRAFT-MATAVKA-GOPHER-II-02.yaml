abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Gopher protocol is over twenty years old.  Changing practices
    and\n   unofficial extensions have caused Gopher as currently used to differ,\n
    \  but remain largely compatible with, the standard established in its\n   official
    governing document, *The Internet Gopher Protocol (a\n   distributed document
    search and retrieval protocol)*, known as *RFC\n   1436*.  Therefore, this document
    attempts to establish a contemporary\n   specification of the Gopher communications
    protocol, departing as\n   little as possible from current practice.\n\n\t </p>\n
