abstract:
- content: "<p>Knowledge and experience on how to operate IPv4 securely is available:
    whether it is the Internet or an enterprise internal network. However, IPv6 presents
    some new security challenges. RFC 4942 describes the security issues in the protocol,
    but network managers also need a more practical, operations-minded document to
    enumerate advantages and/or disadvantages of certain choices. This document analyzes
    the operational security issues in several types of network (enterprises, service
    providers and residential users) and proposes technical and procedural mitigation
    techniques. The residential users case assumes a managed ISP CPE device. Some
    very specific places of a network such as the Internet of Things and unmanaged
    home networks are not discussed in this document.</p>"
