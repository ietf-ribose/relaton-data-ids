abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selected\nmailbox.
    \ A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a\nclient that wishes to
    support this must issue a series of SELECT and\nSEARCH commands, waiting for each
    to complete before moving on to the\nnext.  This extension allows a client to
    search multiple mailboxes\nwith one command, limiting the round-trips and waiting
    for various\nsearches to complete.  This also introduces named searches, allowing\na
    client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.\n\t </p>\n      "
