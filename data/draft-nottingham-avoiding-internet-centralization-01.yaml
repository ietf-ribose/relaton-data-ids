abstract:
- content: "<p>Despite being designed and operated as a decentralized network-of-
    networks, the Internet is continuously subjected to forces that encourage centralization.
    This document offers a definition of centralization, explains why it is undesirable,
    identifies different types of centralization, catalogues limitations of common
    approaches to controlling it, and explores what Internet standards efforts can
    do to address it.</p>"
