abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Current standardization effort on the evolution of the mobile\n
    \  communication system reconsiders the mobile data plane protocol.  The\n   IETF
    DMM Working Group has work that proposes and analyzes various\n   protocols as
    alternative to the GPRS Tunneling Protocol for User\n   Plane (GTP-U) for an overlay
    deployment in between the mobile\n   device's assigned data plane anchor and its
    current radio base\n   station, which are denoted as N9 and N3 interfaces.  In
    the view of\n   some future deployment and the original intent per the very early
    DMM\n   WG charter, a mobile device's data plane anchor may be highly\n   distributed
    and re-selected for optimization throughout a mobile\n   device's communication
    with one or more correspondent services.  Such\n   re-configuration has impact
    on the packet routing in between the\n   mobile device's data plane anchor and
    the one or multiple data\n   networks hosting the services, which is denoted as
    N6 interface.\n   This draft proposes and discusses a solution to control, setup
    and\n   maintain traffic treatment policy on the cellular communication\n   system's
    N6 interface while taking the UE's PDU session settings per\n   the cellular system's
    control plane, such as QoS and locator\n   information, into account.\n\n\t </p>\n
