abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IEEE 802.16 issued the new standards for PHY and MAC providing\n
    \  broadband wireless access network.  Currently, it is being developed\n   under
    the assumption that IPv4 is used over it and the use of IPv6\n   over IEEE 802.16
    networks has not been considered yet.  Hence, this\n   draft describes several
    problems in running NDP over IEEE 802.16\n   networks and presents some proposed
    solutions for those problems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
