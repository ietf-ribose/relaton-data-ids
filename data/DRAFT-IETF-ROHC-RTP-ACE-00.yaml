abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When Real-Time Multimedia over IP is applied to cellular systems,
    it\nis critical to minimize the overhead of the IP/UDP/RTP header, as\nspectral
    efficiency is a top requirement.  Robustness to errors and\nerror bursts is also
    a must.\nExisting IP/UDP/RTP header compression schemes such as that presented\nin
    IETF RFC 2508 [CRTP], do not provide sufficient performance in\nsuch environments.
    \ This report describes a new scheme (ACE, or\nAdaptive header ComprEssion) ,
    which like RFC 2508, is based on the\nidea that most of the time IP/UDP/RTP fields
    are either constant or\ncan be extrapolated in a linear fashion.  However, ACE
    incorporates\nseveral additional concepts which enable it to provide excellent\ncompression
    efficiency (exceeds the performance of [CRTP]) along with\na high degree of error-resiliency.
    \ Some of the concepts employed,\nsuch as Variable Length Encoding (VLE), enable
    ACE to adapt to\nchanging behavior in the IP/UDP/RTP header fields, such that
    good\nefficiency and robustness characteristics are maintained over a wide\nrange
    of operating conditions.\nACE is a general framework that can be parameterized
    to account for\nthe existence/non-existence and performance characteristics of
    the\nfeedback channel.  Thus, ACE is applicable over both bi-directional\nand
    unidirectional links.\nACE is also able to perform a seamless handoff, i.e. the
    scheme can\nresume efficient compression operation immediately after handoff.\n\t
