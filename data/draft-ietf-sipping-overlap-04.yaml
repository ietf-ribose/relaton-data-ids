abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a way to map Integrated Services Digital Network
    User Part (ISUP) overlap signalling to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This
    mechanism might be implemented when using SIP in an environment where part of
    the call involves interworking with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
