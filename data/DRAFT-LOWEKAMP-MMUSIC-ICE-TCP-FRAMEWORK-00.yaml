abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The ICE-TCP mechanism is currently regarded as of limited usefulness\ndue
    to the low success rate of TCP simultaneous open for NAT\ntraversal.  This document
    presents a vision of the ICE-TCP document\nas an extensible framework for negotiating
    a variety of approaches\nfor establishing a TCP connection between NATed hosts.
    \ This document\nfurther proposes significantly extending the current set of\ncollection
    mechanisms to encompass a wide variety of technologies\nthat are currently available,
    including UPnP, SOCKS, and Teredo.\nBecause several of these technologies are
    already widely deployed,\nthe direct connection rate should be significantly higher
    than using\nstraight TCP alone.  We envision that as future TCP connection\nestablishment
    techniques are developed, they too will specify an ICE\nencoding that will allow
    their negotiation.\n\t </p>\n      "
