abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The concept of LIS for IP over ATM causes a topology mismatch
    between the link and the internetworking layer. While it introduces some inefficiency
    with CATENET based operation, it is not so much a problem unless we try to solve
    this minor problem.      Short-cutting attempts such as NHRP can't solve the inefficiency
    issue at all even though, or, just because, it utterly destroys the CATENET model,
    which resulted in inelegant modifications of existing protocols, which, in turn,
    causes scalability problems.     Moreover, the creation of short-cut VCs itself
    suffers a scalability issue.    But, CSRs (Cell Switching Routers), or RSVP-signaled
    ATM switches, make it possible to have end-to-end cell-by-cell relaying over IP
    routers. That is, there is no reason to have LISes and there is no inefficiency
    \    The way to go for the Internet is Simple Unified Networking with the CATENET
    model.\n\t </p>\n      "
