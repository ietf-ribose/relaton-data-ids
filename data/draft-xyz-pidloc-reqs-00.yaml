abstract:
- content: "<p>Use of Identifier Locator separation systems is proposed for various
    use cases to allow for efficient and service aware flexible end-to- end routing.
    A statement on the issue of privacy preservation of both users and devices identity
    and location describes major challenges identified for this problem. This document
