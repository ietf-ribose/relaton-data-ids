abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RPCP is a generic interface protocol between two entities, where\none
    entity acting as Resource Pool (RP) and other being the\nResource Pool Controller
    (RPC). The RP entity in turn may be\nacting as RPC for other RPs in a hierarchical
    manner. The resource\nbeing defined can be any hardware/software, physical/virtual\nresource.\n\nIn
    today's telecommunication world, the intelligence is being\nmoved away from the
    hardware (the embedded platform) or the\nswitching fabric to a more generic computing
    resource (high-end\nservers). These computing resources controls the call logic,\nservice
    logic and the network signalling part. This implies that\nthere is a need for
    an open interface protocol by which call\nagents or signalling agents can control
    this rather dumb hardware\nas resource pools. This helps in easy and smooth integration
    of\nthese entities even if they come from different vendors.\n\nThe Interworking
    and Gateway market is a very big market today.\nThe network architecture proposed
    for these solutions carries the\nintelligence away from the resource pools (also
    called media\ngateways) to call agents or pool controllers (also called media\ngateway
    controllers). With such network architectures the need\nfor such a protocol is
    more prominent.\n\nThere are many other needs and use of such a protocol which
    will\nbe discussed in detail in this white paper. This paper does not\ntry to
    define the complete protocol, however the basic definition\nand the protocol architecture
    will be defined.\n\nThe document first describes the application of Resource Pool\nControl
    protocol, followed by requirements from this Protocol and\nthen defines the Protocol
    Architecture with basic protocol\ndefinition. The annexure of the document gives
    few examples on\nRPCP usage.\n\t </p>\n      "
