abstract:
- content: "<p>During discussions of a document to provide a standard representation
    and encoding of Domain-Sequence within the Path Computation Element (PCE) communication
    Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and
    a PCE, or between two PCEs, it was determined that there was a need for clarification
    with respect to the ordered nature of the Include Route Object (IRO). An informal
    survey was conducted to determine the state of current and planned implementation
    with respect to IRO ordering and handling of Loose bit (L bit). This document
    updates the IRO specification based on the survey conclusion and recommendation.</p>"
