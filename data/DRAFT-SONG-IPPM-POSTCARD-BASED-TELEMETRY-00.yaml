abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a proposal which allows network OAM\n
    \  applications to collect telemetry data about any user packet.  Unlike\n   similar
    techniques such as INT and in-situ OAM, the Postcard-Based\n   Telemetry (PBT)
    does not require inserting telemetry data into user\n   packets, but directly
    exports the telemetry data to a collector\n   through separated OAM packets called
    postcards.  Two variations of\n   PBT are described in this document: one requires
    inserting an\n   instruction header to user packets to guide the data collection
    and\n   the other only marks the user packets to invoke the data collection.\n
    \  Each has its own pros and cons.  Either way, the postcards for a\n   single
    user packet are from multiple devices and need to be\n   correlated at the collector,
    which is a unique issue pertaining to\n   PBT.  Whereas, PBT provides an alternative
    to INT and address several\n   implementation and deployment challenges of the
    INT-based solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
