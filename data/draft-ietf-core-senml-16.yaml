abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a format for representing simple sensor
    measurements and device parameters in Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML). Representations
    are defined in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Concise Binary Object Representation
    (CBOR), Extensible Markup Language (XML), and Efficient XML Interchange (EXI),
    which share the common SenML data model. A simple sensor, such as a temperature
    sensor, could use one of these media types in protocols such as HTTP or the Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP) to transport the measurements of the sensor or to
    be configured.</p>"
