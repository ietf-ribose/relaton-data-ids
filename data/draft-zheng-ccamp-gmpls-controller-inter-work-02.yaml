abstract:
- content: "<p>Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control allows each
    network element (NE) to perform local resource discovery (e.g., LMP), routing
    (e.g., OSPF-TE) and signaling (e.g., RSVP-TE) in a distributed manner. On the
    other hand, with the development of software-defined transport networking technology,
    a set of NEs can be controlled via centralized controller hierarchies to address
    the issue from multi- domain, multi-vendor and multi-technology. An example of
    such centralized architecture is ACTN controller hierarchy [I-D.ietf- teas-actn-framework].
    Instead of competing with each other, both the distributed and the centralized
    control plane have their own advantage, and should be complementary in the system.
    This document describes how the GMPLS distributed control plane can interwork
    with a centralized controller system in a transport network.</p>"
