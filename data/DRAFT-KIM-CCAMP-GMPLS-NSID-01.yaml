abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents a set of requirements of the Network State
    \nInformation Database (NSID) for Traffic Engineering over Generalized \nMultiprotocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) in the view of service \nproviders. The Network State
    Information Database is required to \nimplement the network architecture for network
    models that introduce \nthe control element of IP and to optimize the utilization
    of network \nresources. And this document includes discussion about the \nconsiderations
    and necessity of the several attributes to construct \nNSID for Traffic Engineering
    over GMPLS that are extended from the \nrequirement for Traffic Engineering over
    MPLS [4]. These attributes \ncan be used to maximize the utilization of network
    resources and to \nenhance resource oriented Traffic Engineering techniques. \n\n\t
