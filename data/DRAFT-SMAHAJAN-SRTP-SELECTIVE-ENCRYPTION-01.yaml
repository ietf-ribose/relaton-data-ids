abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Selective Encryption is good mechanism to improve performance
    of\n   devices that support media encode/decode and transport and still \n   meets
    basic requirement of confidentiality. SRTP is one of the      \n   popular mechanism
    used to support confidential media transport over \n   IP channels. This draft
    suggests some enhancements to SRTP protocol \n   management to enable SRTP to
    support \"Selective Encryption\".\n\t </p>\n      "
