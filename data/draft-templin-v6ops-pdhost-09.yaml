abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which then
    use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks. This document
    considers the case when the "requesting router" is actually an end system which
    receives a delegated prefix that it can use for its own sub-delegation and/or
    multi-addressing purposes.</p>
