abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) provides
    strong\n   security and privacy properties to both endpoints once they have\n
    \  authenticated each other.  However, before an endpoint has validated\n   the
    peer's AUTH payload, it could be divulging information to an\n   untrusted host.
    \ An example of such information is the Identification\n   payload of the initiator.
    \ Another example is the fact that a host is\n   running an IKEv2 responder.  This
    document introduces a new\n   \"Initialization Authentication Code\" notify payload
    that can be\n   included in IKE_SA_INIT messages to increase their trustworthiness.\n
    \  This new protection is meant to be used in addition to current IKEv2\n   mechanisms
    and is not meant to replace the AUTH payload in any way.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
