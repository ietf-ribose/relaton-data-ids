abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Group communication services exist in a large variety of flavors
    and\n   technical implementations at different protocol layers.  Multicast\n   data
    distribution is most efficiently performed on the lowest\n   available layer,
    but a heterogeneous deployment status of multicast\n   technologies throughout
    the Internet requires an adaptive service\n   binding at runtime.  Today, it is
    difficult to write an application\n   that runs everywhere and at the same time
    makes use of the most\n   efficient multicast service available in the network.
    \ Facing\n   robustness requirements, developers are frequently forced to use
    a\n   stable, upper layer protocol provided by the application itself.\n   This
    document describes a common multicast API that is suitable for\n   transparent
    communication in underlay and overlay, and grants access\n   to the different
    multicast flavors.  It proposes an abstract naming\n   by multicast URIs and discusses
    mapping mechanisms between different\n   namespaces and distribution technologies.
    \ Additionally, this\n   document describes the application of this API for building
    gateways\n   that interconnect current multicast domains throughout the Internet.\n
    \  It reports on an implementation of the programming interface,\n   including
    a service middleware.  This document is a product of the\n   Scalable Adaptive
    Multicast (SAM) Research Group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
