abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the development of cloud computing, increasing services
    have been\n   migrated from enterprise sites to clouds, so the connections between\n
    \  sites and clouds are critical for enterprises.\n\n   SRv6 provides a sourcing
    routing mechanism to connect the enterprise\n   sites and clouds by programming
    the end-to-end path at the ingress\n   node.  In this scenario, the SRv6 packets
    may traverse multiple\n   network domains and some of them may not be SRv6-capable.\n\n
    \  In order to support SRv6 end-to-end path programming, this document\n   proposes
    the mechanism of SRv6 traversing IPv4 network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
