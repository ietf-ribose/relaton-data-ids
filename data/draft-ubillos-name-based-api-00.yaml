abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Today, networked applications typically make use of name-orientednetwork
    abstractions. There is a myriad of application developmentframeworks who provide
    abstracted APIs allowing applications to referto their peers by name. These abstractions
    normally only provideapplication-layer protocol functionality. They are normally
    uni-lateral solutions, the support for the protocol used is implied bythe service
    accessed on the remote peer(s).We suggest a unified API for networked applications.
    Isomorphic tothe existing name-based solutions, but with added network-relatedfunctionality.
    Providing an existing application-layer protocolswith network features such as
    mobility, multi-homing, IPv4/IPv6interoperability, NAT-traversal and so on...</p>"
