abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) for the Resource
    Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). The TAL allows Relying Parties in the RPKI to
    download the current Trust Anchor (TA) Certification Authority (CA) certificate
    from one or more locations and verify that the key of this self-signed certificate
    matches the key on the TAL. Thus, Relying Parties can be configured with TA keys
    but can allow these TAs to change the content of their CA certificate. In particular,
    it allows TAs to change the set of IP Address Delegations and/or Autonomous System
    Identifier Delegations included in the extension(s) (RFC 3779) of their certificate.
    This document obsoletes the previous definition of the TAL as provided in RFC
    7730 by adding support for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) (RFC 3986) that
    use HTTP over TLS (HTTPS) (RFC 7230) as the scheme.</p>"
