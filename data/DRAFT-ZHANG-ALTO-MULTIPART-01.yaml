abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many ALTO use cases involve multiple ALTO information resources
    like\n   different network maps, cost maps and property maps to achieve their\n
    \  own specific goals.  To make the ALTO client query them one by one is\n   not
    only inefficient but also error-prone.  The inconsistent\n   responses can be
    performed because of the unstable communication\n   environment, and finally conduct
    the unexpected traffic optimization.\n   Further more, some ALTO information resources
    may have correlation,\n   which means one's input parameters may depends on another
    one's\n   response.  To address those issues, some advanced query schema is\n
    \  required.  This document proposes an ALTO extension to support the\n   multiple
    ALTO resources query in the single request using the HTTP\n   multipart message
    and the existing JSON query languages.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
