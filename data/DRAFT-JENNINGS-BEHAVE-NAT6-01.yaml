abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification defines a NAT that allows IPv6-only hosts that
    are\ninside the NAT to operate with IPv4 hosts that are outside the NAT.\nIt requires
    no modifications to the v4 hosts or applications, or to\nthe operating system
    of v6 hosts, but it does require some changes to\nv6 applications.  Typically
    this specification would be used to allow\nthe hosts inside a NAT to connect to
    hosts outside it; but under some\nlimitations, it can also allow hosts outside
    to connect to hosts\ninside.\n\nThe goal of this draft is to consider what is
    the minimal feasible\napproach to this problem.  The current intention is to merge
    this\nwith the nat64 draft.  This draft is being discussed on the\nbehave@ietf.org
    list.\n\t </p>\n      "
