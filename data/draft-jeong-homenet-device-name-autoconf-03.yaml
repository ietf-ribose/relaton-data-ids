abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for DNS names of
    Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as appliances and sensors. By this scheme,
    the DNS name of an IoT device can be autoconfigured with the device's category
    and model in wired and wireless networks (e.g., home, office, shopping mall, smart
    grid, and road network). This DNS name lets IoT users (e.g., home residents and
    customers) easily identify each device for monitoring and remote-controlling it
    in a target network.</p>"
