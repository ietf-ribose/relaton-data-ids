abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the overwhelming choice of proprietary implementations
    of \n   centralized control and management of wireless access points and \n   access
    controllers there is a great demand for a standard protocol \n   and architecture
    that enables the deployment of large scale wireless \n   networks. \n    \n   This
    document describes the CAPWAP Tunneling Protocol, a protocol \n   that allows
    for the centralized control and provisioning of a large \n   number of wireless
    access points from access controllers.  It is \n   supported by an architecture
    where the MAC layer of the RF technology \n   is terminated within the AP.  This
    allows for the protocol to be \n   extensible to multiple radio technologies.
    \ It assumes an IP \n   connection between the access points and access controllers
    and has \n   signaling primitives to enable wireless station mobility between
    \n   access points.  Therefore, seamless Layer 3 subnet mobility is \n   seamlessly
    enabled by this protocol. \n\t </p>\n      "
