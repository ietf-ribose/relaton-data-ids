abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
    consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between Autonomous
    Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS and then use suitable
    modifications to the BGP path selection algorithm to route the packets along the
    paths. Such low-power paths can be identified by using the consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth
    (PWR) ratio as an additional parameter in the BGP Path Selection Algorithm. For
    re-routing the data traffic through these low-power paths, the power based best
    path is selected and advertised as per the modified algorithm proposed in this
    document. Extensions to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can be used to disseminate
    the PWR ratio metric among the AS thereby creating a collaborative approach to
    reduce the power consumption. The feasibility of our approaches is illustrated
    by applying our algorithm to a subset of the Internet. The techniques proposed
    in this paper for the Inter-AS power reduction require minimal modifications to
    the existing features of the Internet. The proposed techniques can be extended
    to other levels of Internet hierarchy, such as Intra-AS paths, through suitable
    modifications.</p>"
