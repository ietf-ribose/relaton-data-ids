abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes to relay throughput instead of congestion back
    into the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total level of throughput
    is accessible to all IP devices along the path followed by IP datagrams. The main
    advantage of this approach is that applications that are not using the TCP protocol
    as transport protocol could also apply the Conex concept to relay the throughput
    experienced on the end-to-end path back into the network.</p>"
