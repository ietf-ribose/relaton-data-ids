abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies the situations where a signature verification
    fails in a recursive security aware DNS server, and how DNS servers should handle
    these cases, and the errors that should be reported to DNS resolvers. This document
    proposes a new error to be returned by DNSSEC capable servers. A DNSSEC server
    acting as a recursive server MUST validate the signatures on RRsets in a response
    it passes on; this draft addresses the case when the data it receives fails signature
    verification. The end resolver must be notified of this occurence in such a way
    that it will not confuse it with another error.</p>"
