abstract:
- content: "<p>This document implements an accurate network delay measurement method
    based on the digital twin network. This method does not need to send measurement
    packets, change the physical network configuration, change the format of service
    packets, and do not require physical network elements to support the time synchronization
    protocol. Two- way delay and one-way delay measurement of any service packet.The
    digital twin network architecture of this document follows the NMRG working group
    paper draft-irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch-00.</p>"
