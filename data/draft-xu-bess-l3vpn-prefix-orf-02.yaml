abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for BGP,
    refered to as "L3VPN Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", that can be used to
    perform L3VPN address-prefix-based route filtering. This ORF-type supports prefix-length-
    or range-based matching, wild- card-based address prefix matching, as well as
    the exact address prefix matching for L3VPN address families. The L3VPN Address
    Prefix ORF is applicable in the Virtual Subnet context.</p>
