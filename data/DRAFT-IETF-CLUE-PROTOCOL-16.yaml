abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CLUE protocol is an application protocol conceived for
    the\n   description and negotiation of a telepresence session.  The design of\n
    \  the CLUE protocol takes into account the requirements and the\n   framework
    defined within the IETF CLUE working group.  A companion\n   document delves into
    CLUE signaling details, as well as on the SIP/\n   SDP session establishment phase.
    \ CLUE messages flow over the CLUE\n   data channel, based on reliable and ordered
    SCTP over DTLS transport.\n   Message details, together with the behavior of CLUE
    Participants\n   acting as Media Providers and/or Media Consumers, are herein\n
    \  discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
