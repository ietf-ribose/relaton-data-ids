abstract:
- content: "<p>There is an increasing use of real-time applications on IP networks.
    As these applications require certain QoS levels to operate acceptably there is
    a need for IP networks to guarantee such levels. This draft introduces a set of
    requirements that must be fulfilled in order that an MPLS network can support
    QoS-dependant IP flows as set out in the VoMPLS draft [2]. A candidate architecture
    that conforms to these requirements is then set out. The network consists of a
    session control layer, an IP Layer that is constrained through the use of MPLS
    tunnels, and a distributed management system to control those tunnels. The draft
    describes each of the essential components needed to implement such a network
    and suggests suitable technologies for each of them.</p>"
