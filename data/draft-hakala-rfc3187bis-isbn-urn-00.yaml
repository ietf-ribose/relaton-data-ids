abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The International Standard Book Number, ISBN, is a widely usedidentifier
    for monographic publications. Since 2001, there has beena URN (Uniform Resource
    Names) namespace for ISBNs. The namespaceregistration was performed in RFC 3187
    and applies to the ISBN asspecified in the original ISO Standard 2108-1992. To
    allow forfurther growth in use, the successor ISO Standard, ISO 2108-2005, hasdefined
    an expanded format for the ISBN, known as \"ISBN-13\". Thisdocument replaces RFC
    3187 and defines how both the old and new ISBNstandard can be supported within
    the URN framework and the syntax forURNs defined in RFC 2141. An updated namespace
    registration isincluded, which describes how both the old and the new ISBN formatcan
    share the same namespace.DiscussionThis draft version is the outcome of work started
    in 2008 and broughtto the IETF as a contribution to a much larger effort to revise
    thebasic URN RFCs, in order to bring them in alignment with the currentURI Standard
    (STD 63, RFC 3986), ABNF, and IANA guidelines, and toestablish a modern URN resolution
    system for bibliographicidentifiers.Until a more specific mailing list is established,
    comments arewelcome on the urn-nid@ietf.org mailing list (or sent to theauthors).</p>"
