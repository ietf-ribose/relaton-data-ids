abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method of representing rules for
    validating\n   identifier labels and alternate representations of those labels
    using\n   Extensible Markup Language (XML).  These policies, known as \"Label\n
    \  Generation Rulesets\" (LGRs), are used for the implementation of\n   Internationalized
    Domain Names (IDNs), for example.  The rulesets are\n   used to implement and
    share that aspect of policy defining which\n   labels and specific Unicode code
    points are permitted for\n   registrations, which alternative code points are
    considered variants,\n   and what actions may be performed on labels containing
    those\n   variants.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
