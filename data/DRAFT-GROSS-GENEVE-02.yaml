abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network virtualization involves the cooperation of devices
    with a\n   wide variety of capabilities such as software and hardware tunnel\n
    \  endpoints, transit fabrics, and centralized control clusters.  As a\n   result
    of their role in tying together different elements in the\n   system, the requirements
    on tunnels are influenced by all of these\n   components.  Flexibility is therefore
    the most important aspect of a\n   tunnel protocol if it is to keep pace with
    the evolution of the\n   system.  This draft describes Geneve, a protocol designed
    to\n   recognize and accommodate these changing capabilities and needs.\n\n\t
