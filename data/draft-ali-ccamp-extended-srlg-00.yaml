abstract:
- content: "<p>SRLGs play a key role in routing resiliency and capacity planning of
    multi-domain and multi-layer networks. Notion of SRLG are used to select a backup
    path that is disjoint from the primary path, to ensure disjointness of circuits
    and to avoid catastrophic partitioning outages. In the current specifications,
    SRLG is identified as a 32 bit number that is unique within an IGP domain [RFC4202].
    There are many limitations to this approach of encoding SRLGs, especially in a
    multi-layer network. This draft outlines these limitations and suggests components
    of extended SRLG encoding scheme to address them.</p>"
