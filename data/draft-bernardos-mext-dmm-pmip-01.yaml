abstract:
- content: "<p>The number of mobile users and their traffic demand is expected to
    be ever-increasing in future years, and this growth can represent a limitation
    for deploying current mobility management schemes that are intrinsically centralized,
    e.g., Mobile IPv6 and Proxy MIPv6. For this reason it has been waved a need for
    distributed and dynamic mobility management approaches, with the objective of
    reducing operators' burdens, evolving to a cheaper and more efficient architecture.
    This draft describes a solution to distribute the data forwarding plane on Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 domains, thus trying to overcome the suboptimal data path introduced
    when the LMA is traversed.</p>"
