abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document addresses the problem of IP v4 address space depletion.\nThis
    document proposes an easy, technical solution based on the use\nof two options
    in the IP packet. The IP Version is used to extend\nthe current IP v4 address
    universe to 25 to 30 billion IP addresses.\nA modified IP packet header Option
    3, the Loose Source and Record\nRouter (LSRR), is used to carry source ip version,
    source ip prefix,\ndestination ip version, and destination ip prefix in the IP
    network\npacket.  This document introduces the concepts of RIR nebulae (or IP\naddress
    nebula) and mirror prefixes (or pseudo prefixes). RIR nebulae\nare concurrent
    IP v4 address spaces which are differentiated from one\nanother by the IP Version
    in the IP network packet header. The mirror\nprefixes (/33 to /255) emulate or
    mirror standard prefixes (/0 to /31).\nThe single host route (/32 or 255.255.255.255)
    is supported in all RIR\nnebulae. The new extended IP v4 universe (a new, hypothetical
    Internet)\nis comprised of multiple IP v4 address spaces and DNS domains of 4.2\nbillion
    addresses.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
