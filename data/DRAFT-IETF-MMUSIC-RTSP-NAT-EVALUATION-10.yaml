abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes several Network Address Translator
    (NAT)\n   traversal techniques that were considered to be used for establishing\n
    \  the RTP media flows controlled by the Real-time Streaming Protocol\n   (RTSP).
    \ Each technique includes a description on how it would be\n   used, the security
    implications of using it and any other deployment\n   considerations it has.  There
    are also discussions on how NAT\n   traversal techniques relates to firewalls
    and how each technique can\n   be applied in different use cases.  These findings
    where used when\n   selecting the NAT traversal for RTSP 2.0.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
