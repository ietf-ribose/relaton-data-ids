abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo documents OSPF-lite. OSPF-lite is a link state routingprotocol,
    and a branch version of Internet Standard 54 OSPF [ref1].It is designed to be
    run internal to a single Autonomous System.Each OSPF-lite router maintains an
    identical database describingthe Autonomous System's topology. From this database,
    a routing tableis calculated by constructing a shortest-path tree.OSPF-lite has
    been designed to provide a simpler version of the OSPF protocol. A router running
    ospf-lite requires little configuration.Areas are not implemented and all designated
    Router functionality hasbeen removed from the protocol. OSPF-lite will run over
    non fullymeshed clouds with no special OSPF configuration commands required.Many
    of the Protocol complexities have been removed, and processoroverhead utilised
    in a different way. This work is intended to keeppace with the vast increases
    in processor performance, memory sizeand link capacity since OSPF was originally
    designed in 1989, withthe resulting benefits of simpler network design, configuration
    andmaintenance.The differences between this memo and RFC 2328 are highlighted
    throughout the document, but special attention should be placed onSections 2,
    7, 16, and Appendix A; the latter describes detailedpacket structures. Many of
    the differences are backward compatible innature, but it is not envisioned that
    OSPF Version 2 will interoperatewith OSPF-lite, unless multiple instances are
    running and routeredistribution is employed.The protocol has been designed with
    backward consistency in mind,as far has been possible, to allow code modules developed
    for OSPFVersion 2 to be re-utilised.This Internet Draft has been written within
    the same structure as RFC 2328, to enable a section-by-section comparison with
    previousversions of the main OSPF protocol. It is recommended that thesections
    are directly compared. The authorsâ€™ thanks in turn go thedevelopers of all of
    the features in RFC 2328, and associated RFCs,and Standards.</p>"
