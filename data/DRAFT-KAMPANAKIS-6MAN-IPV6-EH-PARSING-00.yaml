abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 is widely used on the internet today and is expected to
    be\n   deployed more as more devices (i.e. home automation) get inter-\n   connected.
    \ The IPv6 header format allows for the use of Extension\n   Headers (EH).  EHs
    could be chained together with very few existing\n   guidelines by the IPv6 protocol
    on how devices should parse them,\n   which open room for security concerns and
    inconsistencies.  This\n   document presents guidelines for parsing IPv6 EHs with
    a goal of\n   providing a common and consistent parsing methodology for IPv6\n
    \  implementers among the industry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
