abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is a working document intended to focus discussion on\n
    \  requirements for multicast in Low-power and Lossy Networks in the\n   area
    of M2M communication for control applications.  The Trickle\n   algorithm, which
    uses random re-broadcasting to assure that messages\n   arrive at all destinations,
    has been proposed in the Trickle\n   Multicast Forwarding ROLL WG draft as the
    basis for a multicast\n   routing protocol.  In this draft additional requirements
    on multicast\n   routing are presented, such as timeliness, motivated by building\n
    \  control.  Random re-broadcasting and timeliness can be difficult to\n   reconcile.
    \ This draft presents some simulation results in typical\n   control settings
    which show that achieving latencies below 400 ms is\n   feasible with Trickle.
    \ Recommendations are proposed for the current\n   Trickle Multicast Forwarding
    draft to achieve optimal performance and\n   meet the stated requirements.\n\n\t
