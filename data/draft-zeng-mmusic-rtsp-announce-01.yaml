abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an extension RTSP method, ANNOUNCE, which extends
    the core RTSP protocol [RTSP_NEW] to enable a RTSP protocol entity to push to
    the other side various types of information without the other side asking for
    it, as long as the other side has singalled the capability to support ANNOUNCE.</p>"
