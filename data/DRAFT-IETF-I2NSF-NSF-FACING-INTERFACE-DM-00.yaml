abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a YANG data model corresponding to the\n
    \  information model for Network Security Functions (NSF) facing\n   interface
    in Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF).  It\n   describes a data model
    for the features provided by generic security\n   functions.  This data model
    provides generic components whose vendors\n   is well understood, so that the
    generic component can be used even if\n   it has some vendor specific functions.
    \ These generic functions\n   represent a point of interoperability, and can be
    provided by any\n   product that offers the required Capabilities.  Also, if vendors
    need\n   additional features for its network security function, they can add\n
    \  the features by extending the YANG data model.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
