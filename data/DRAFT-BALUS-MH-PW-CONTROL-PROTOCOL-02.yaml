abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    [MS PWE3 Requirements] describes the requirements to allow
    a service\n    provider to extend the reach of pseudo-wires across multiple\n
    \   domains. A Multi-Segment PW is defined as a set of two or more\n    contiguous
    PW segments that behave and function as a single point-\n    to-point PW.\n\n
    \   The current specification of the PW Architecture [PW ARCH] defines\n    the
    PW as a single Segment entity, connecting the Attachment\n    Circuits between
    two Ultimate PEs (U-PE). The current procedures for\n    establishing a single
    segment PW (SS-PW) is described in [PW\n    Control], where typically an LDP session
    is established between the\n    ultimate PEs handling the Pseudowire End Service
    (PWES). No\n    intermediate nodes, between the PEs, are aware of the PW.\n\n
    \   The purpose of this draft is to specify new LDP extensions, end to\n    end
    signaling procedures to address the related requirements\n    specified in [MS-PWE3
    Requirements]. The proposed procedures follow\n    the guidelines defined in [RFC3036bis]
    and enable the usage of\n    addressing schemes (L2FECs) and other TLVs already
    defined for PWs\n    in [PW Control].\n\n    The solution described in the draft
    provides a MS-PW Operational\n    Model, Signaling Procedures consistent with
    the regular (SS-)PWs, in\n    order to enable seamless implementation, deployment.
    The resulting\n    MS-PW building blocks accommodate and enhance LDP-VPLS, VPWS\n
    \   solutions with minimal changes in the Information Models and\n    Software
    Modules related to the L2VPN functionality.\n\t </p>\n      "
