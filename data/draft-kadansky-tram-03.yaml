abstract:
  content: "<p>This paper describes TRAM, a scalable reliable multicast transportprotocol.
    TRAM is designed to support bulk data transfer from asingle sender to many receivers.
    A dynamically formed repair treeprovides local error recovery allowing the multicast
    group to supporta large number of receivers. TRAM provides flow control, congestioncontrol,
    and other adaptive techniques necessary to operateefficiently with other protocols.
    Several bulk data applicationshave been implemented with TRAM. TRAM has been tested
    and simulatedin a number of network environments.This update contains a new flow
    and congestion control section, anupdated and expanded security section, updated
    packet formats toaccommodate IPV6 addressing, and several other minor updates.</p>"
