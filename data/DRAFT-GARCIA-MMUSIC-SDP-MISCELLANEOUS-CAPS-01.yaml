abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism\n
    \  framework that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols\n   and
    attributes.  This framework has been extended with a media\n   capabilities negotiation
    mechanism that allows endpoints to negotiate\n   additional media-related capabilities.
    \ This negotiation is embedded\n   into the widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures.\n\n
    \  This memo extends the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow\n   endpoints
    to negotiate three additional SDP capabilities.  In\n   particular, this memo
    provides a mechanism to negotiate bandwidth\n   ('b=' line), connection data ('c='
    line), and titles ('i=' line for\n   each session or media).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
