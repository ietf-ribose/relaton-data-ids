abstract:
- content: <p>Randomness is a crucial ingredient for Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    and related security protocols. Weak or predictable "cryptographically-strong"
    pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited for malicious
    purposes. An initial entropy source that seeds a CSPRNG might be weak or broken
    as well, which can also lead to critical and systemic security problems. This
    document describes a way for security protocol implementations to augment their
    CSPRNGs using long-term private keys. This improves randomness from broken or
    otherwise subverted CSPRNGs. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research
    Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.</p>
