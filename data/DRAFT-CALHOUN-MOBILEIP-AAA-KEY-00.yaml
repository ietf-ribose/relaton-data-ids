abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>AAA servers, such as RADIUS and DIAMETER, are in use within the\nInternet
    today to provide authentication and authorization services\nfor dial-up computers.
    \ Mobile IP requires strong authentication\nbetween the mobile node and its home
    agent.  When the mobile node\nshares a security association with its home AAA
    server, however, it\nis possible to use that security association to create derivative\nsecurity
    associations between the mobile node and its home agent,\nand again between the
    mobile node and the foreign agent currently\noffering a care-of address to the
    mobile node.  This document\nspecifies extensions to the Mobile IP Registration
    Reply packet that\ncan be used to distribute such security information to the
    mobile\nnode.\n\t </p>\n      "
