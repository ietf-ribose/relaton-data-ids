abstract:
- content: "<p>The Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) allows hop-by-hop integrity
    protection of RSVP neighbors. This requires messages to be cryptographically protected
    using a shared secret between participating nodes. This document compares group
    keying for RSVP with per-neighbor or per-interface keying, and discusses the associated
    key provisioning methods as well as applicability and limitations of these approaches.
    This document also discusses applicability of encrypting RSVP messages. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
