abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines how ACME can be used by a client to obtain a
    certificate for a subdomain identifier from a certification authority. The client
    has fulfilled a challenge against a parent domain but does not need to fulfill
    a challenge against the explicit subdomain as certificate policy allows issuance
    of the subdomain certificate without explicit subdomain ownership proof.</p>"
