abstract:
- content: <p>"An Architecture for the Interface to the Routing System" (RFC 7921)
    abstractly describes a number of requirements for ephemeral state (in terms of
    capabilities and behaviors) that any protocol suite attempting to meet the needs
    of the Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) protocol has to provide. This document
    describes, in detail, requirements for ephemeral state for those implementing
    the I2RS protocol.</p>
