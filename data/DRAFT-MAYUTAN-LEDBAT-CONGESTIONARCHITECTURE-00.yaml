abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) working group
    is\n   considering protocols for an alternative congestion control protocol\n
    \  that enables a delay-insensitive networking application to minimize\n   the
    extra queueing delay it causes to other applications because of\n   additional
    queueing at the bottleneck, when these connections\n   carrying traffic for such
    applications attempt to use the available\n   bandwidth.\n\n   This document proposes
    an architectural framework for LEDBAT\n   congestion control mechanisms, based
    on existing work on congestion\n   control protocols and the requirements of the
    LEDBAT working group.\n   The architectural framework consists of a LEDBAT-congestion
    control\n   (LEDBAT-CC) suite that provides flexibility in utilizing different\n
    \  components for providing congestion control for transport connections\n   carrying
    delay-insensitive traffic.  The LEDBAT-CC suite of protocols\n   is envisioned
    to support the multiple alternative mechanisms for\n   bandwidth estimation, congestion
    detection and indication and end-\n   system flow control to comprise a network
    friendly congestion\n   avoidance protocol.\n\n   This document is inspired by
    the need to standardize the various\n   components that constitute the network
    friendly congestion control\n   protocol to avoid having to individually standardize
    a multitude of\n   distinct and monolithic solutions.\n\t </p>\n      "
