abstract:
  content: "<p>We consider looping issue of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET).Transient
    routing loops have been observed to form in Ad-hoc Networksrunning the MANET routing
    protocol with Link Layer Notification(LLN). Even when only a small quantity of
    the traffic may enterthese loops and only for brief time, the effect is to significantlyincrease
    the impact on the surrounding network and its traffic thusdegrading end-to-end
    transmission. The use of MANET routingprotocols with LLN, together with loop detection
    and discarding oflooping packet to negate the detrimental effects on surroundingtraffic
    is found to improve performance significantly.</p>"
