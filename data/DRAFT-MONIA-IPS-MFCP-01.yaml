abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes mFCP, a UDP-based [UDP] implementation\nof
    the iFCP Fibre Channel Protocol [iFCP] over metro- and\nlocal-scale IP networks.
    \ These networks are provisioned to\nhave latency, reliability, and performance
    levels comparable to\nthat of a Fibre Channel network. Storage devices use the
    Fibre\nChannel SCSI mapping in [FCP] for data transport and error\nrecovery.  mFCP
    leverages these existing mechanisms to\nfacilitate high-performance interconnection
    of Fibre Channel-\nbased storage devices over suitably provisioned IP networks.
    As\nin the case of iFCP, fibre channel frames may be transported\nnatively over
    such a network without Fibre Channel switching\nand routing elements.\n\n\t </p>\n
