abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes an extension to the HTTP protocol allowing web host
    operators to instruct user agents (UAs) to remember ("pin") the hosts' cryptographic
    identities for a given period of time. During that time, UAs will require that
    the host present a certificate chain including at least one Subject Public Key
    Info structure whose fingerprint matches one of the pinned fingerprints for that
    host. By effectively reducing the number of authorities who can authenticate the
    domain during the lifetime of the pin, pinning may reduce the incidence of man-in-the-middle
    attacks due to compromised Certification Authorities.</p>
