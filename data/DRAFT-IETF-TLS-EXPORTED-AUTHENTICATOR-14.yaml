abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism in Transport Layer Security
    (TLS)\n   for peers to provide a proof of ownership of an identity, such as an\n
    \  X.509 certificate.  This proof can be exported by one peer,\n   transmitted
    out-of-band to the other peer, and verified by the\n   receiving peer.\n\n\t </p>\n
