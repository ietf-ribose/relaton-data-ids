abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes version 2.0 of the Certificate Transparency\n
    \  (CT) protocol for publicly logging the existence of Transport Layer\n   Security
    (TLS) server certificates as they are issued or observed, in\n   a manner that
    allows anyone to audit certification authority (CA)\n   activity and notice the
    issuance of suspect certificates as well as\n   to audit the certificate logs
    themselves.  The intent is that\n   eventually clients would refuse to honor certificates
    that do not\n   appear in a log, effectively forcing CAs to add all issued\n   certificates
    to the logs.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 6962.  It also specifies a new
    TLS\n   extension that is used to send various CT log artifacts.\n\n   Logs are
    network services that implement the protocol operations for\n   submissions and
    queries that are defined in this document.\n\n   [RFC Editor: please update 'RFCXXXX'
    to refer to this document, once\n   its RFC number is known, through the document.]\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
