abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of related protocol extensions to S/MIME,
    SMTP and DNS that collectively simplify deployment of S/MIME. Particular attention
    is given to ensuring that S/MIME authenticated content is only received by end
    user clients capable of presenting the content in an acceptable manner. The proposal
    extends the ‘end-to-end’ security model of traditional S/MIME to support end-to-edge,
    edge-to-end and edge-to-edge use cases.</p>"
