abstract:
  content: <p>The GMPLS controlled Ethernet Label Switching (GELS) work isextending
    GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the establishment of EthernetLSPs. IEEE Ethernet Connectivity
    Fault Management (CFM) specifies anadjunct OAM flow to check connectivity in Ethernet
    networks. CFM canbe also used with Ethernet LSPs for fault detection and triggeringrecovery
    mechanisms. The ITU-T Y.1731 specification builds on CFMand specifies additional
    OAM mechanisms, including PerformanceMonitoring, for Ethernet networks. This document
    specifiesextensions of GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the setup of the associatedEthernet
    OAM (CFM and Y.1731) entities adding a technology specificTLV to [OAM-CONF-FWK].Changes
    from previous versionTechnology independent extensions were moved to a separate
    frameworkdocument leaving only the Ethernet specific extensions in thisdocument.Requirements
