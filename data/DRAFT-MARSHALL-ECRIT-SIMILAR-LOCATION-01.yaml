abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a new way to provide returned location\n
    \  information in LoST responses that is either of a completed or\n   similar
    form to the original input civic location, based on whether a\n   valid or invalid
    location is returned within the findServiceResponse\n   message.  This document
    defines a new extension to the\n   findServiceResponse message within the LoST
    protocol [RFC5222] that\n   enables the LoST protocol to return a completed civic
    location\n   element set for a valid response, and one or more suggested sets
    of\n   civic location information for invalid LoST responses.  These two\n   types
    of civic addresses are referred to as either \"complete\" or\n   \"similar\" locations,
    and are included as compilation of ca type xml\n   elements within the existing
    response message structure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
