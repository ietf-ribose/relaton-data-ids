abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an alternative connection model for MSRP
    UAs.\nThe model differs from the standard MSRP model, as defined in RFC4975\nand
    RFC4976, in that it uses SDP in a more conventional way when it\ncomes to conveying
    endpoint address information, and also uses\nmainstream mechanisms for NAT traversal
    instead of using MSRP relays.\n\t </p>\n      "
