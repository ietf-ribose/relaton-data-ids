abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an alternative to the certificate validation\n
    \  procedure specified in RFC 6487 that reduces aspects of operational\n   fragility
    in the management of certificates in the RPKI, while\n   retaining essential security
    features.\n\n   Where the procedure specified in RFC 6487 requires that Resource\n
    \  Certificates are rejecting entirely if they are found to over-claim\n   any
    resources not contained on the issuing certificate, the\n   validation process
    defined here allows an issuing Certificate\n   Authority to chose to communicate
    that such Resource Certificates\n   should be accepted for the intersection of
    their resources and the\n   issuing certificate.\n\n   This choice is signalled
    by form of a set of alternative Object\n   Identifiers (OIDs) of RFC 3779 X.509
    Extensions for IP Addresses and\n   AS Identifiers, and certificate policy for
    the Resource Public Key\n   Infrastructure (RFC 6484).  It should be noted that
    in case these\n   OIDs are not used for any certificate under a Trust Anchor,
    the\n   validation procedure defined here has the same outcome as the\n   procedure
    defined in RFC 6487\n\n   Furthermore this document provides an alternative to
    ROA (RFC 6482),\n   and BGPSec Router Certificate (BGPSec PKI Profiles - publication\n
    \  requested) validation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
