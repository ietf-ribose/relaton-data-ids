abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support
    the\n   needs of new applications, particularly including the applications\n   that
    are associated with 5G services.  These applications require\n   better isolation
    and have more stringent performance requirements\n   than that can be provided
    with traditional overlay VPNs.  An enhanced\n   VPN may form the underpin of 5G
    transport network slicing, and will\n   also be of use in its own right.  This
    document describes how Multi-\n   Topology Routing (MTR) as described in RFC 5120,
    RFC 4915 and\n   RFC5340, can be extended to signal the network resources allocated
    in\n   the underlay network to construct the customized virtual networks for\n
    \  enhanced VPN services, together with the Segment Routing Identifiers\n   (SIDs)
    used to identify and access the network resources allocated\n   for each virtual
    network in the data plane.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
