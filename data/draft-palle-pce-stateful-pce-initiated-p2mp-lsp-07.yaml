- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been identified as an appropriate
    technology for the determination of the paths of point- to-multipoint (P2MP) TE
    LSPs. This document provides extensions required for Path Computation Element
    communication Protocol (PCEP) so as to enable the usage of a stateful PCE initiation
    capability in recommending P2MP TE LSP instantiation.</p>"
