abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Some multicast applications, such as Video distribution, need
    an\nefficient support for moving between multicast groups.\nThis draft shows that
    the support of such application results in a\nextended move branch concept of
    GSMP to be able to move the Output\nbranch of a connection not only to another
    port but also between\nconnections with the same QoS.\n\t </p>\n      "
