abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the Minger protocol. Minger is a protocol which
    allows a mail handling entity to query a remote service and ask the question "do
    you accept mail for this email address?" It includes security in the form of a
    hashed shared secret but can also be used anonymously if desired.</p>
