abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the roles and requirements for a slice\n
    \  gateway that is a data plane function or function group for\n   connecting/disconnecting
    and compose/decompose network slice subnets\n   and providing network slices from
    end to end.  The interworkings\n   between management and control elements at
    the management and control\n   planes with the gateway function for controlling
    and orchestrating\n   end-to-end network slices are also presented in this document.\n\n\t
