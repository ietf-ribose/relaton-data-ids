abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Seamless mobility requires preserving the capability, security,
    and\nquality of service offered to a mobile node during handoffs. To\nachieve
    seamlessness, low (ideally no) latency and low (ideally\nzero) packet loss handoff
    protocols are needed. Limiting the effect\nof handoffs has the potential to improve
    handoff performance in\nterms of latency and packet loss. This draft identifies
    the problem\narea for seamless mobility and defines the scope of the work for
    the\nSeaMoby work group.\n\t </p>\n      "
