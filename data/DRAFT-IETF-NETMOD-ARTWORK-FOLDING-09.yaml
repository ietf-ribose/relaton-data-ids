abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines two strategies for handling long lines
    in\n   width-bounded text content.  One strategy is based on the historic\n   use
    of a single backslash ('\\') character to indicate where line-\n   folding has
    occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first\n   non-space (' ') character
    on the next line.  The second strategy\n   extends the first strategy by adding
    a second backslash character to\n   identify where the continuation begins and
    thereby able to handle\n   cases not supported by the first strategy.  Both strategies
    use a\n   self-describing header enabling automated reconstitution of the\n   original
    content.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
