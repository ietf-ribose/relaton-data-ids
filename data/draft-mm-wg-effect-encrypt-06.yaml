abstract:
- content: "<p>Increased use of encryption impacts operations for security and network
    management causing a shift in how these functions are performed. In some cases,
    new methods to both monitor and protect data will evolve. In other cases, the
    ability to monitor and troubleshoot could be eliminated. This draft includes a
    collection of current security and network management functions that may be impacted
    by the shift to increased use of encryption. This draft does not attempt to solve
    these problems, but rather document the current state to assist in the development
    of alternate options to achieve the intended purpose of the documented practices.</p>"
