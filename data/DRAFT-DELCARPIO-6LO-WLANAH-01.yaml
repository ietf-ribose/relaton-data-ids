abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IEEE 802.11 is an established Wireless LAN (WLAN) technology
    which\n   provides radio connectivity to a wide range of devices.  The IEEE\n
    \  802.11ah amendment defines a WLAN system operating at sub 1 GHz\n   license-exempt
    bands designed to operate with low-rate/low-power\n   consumption.  This amendment
    supports large number of stations and\n   extends the radio coverage to several
    hundreds of meters.  This\n   document describes how IPv6 is transported over
    802.11ah using\n   6LoWPAN techniques.\n\t </p>\n      "
