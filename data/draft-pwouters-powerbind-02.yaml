abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new DNSKEY flag called DELEGATION_ONLY that
    indicates that the particular zone will never sign zone data aside from records
    at the apex of the zone or delegation records for its children. That is, every
    label (dot) underneath is considered a zone cut and must have its own (signed)
    delegation. DNSSEC Validating Resolvers can use this bit to mark any data that
    violates the DELEGATION_ONLY policy as BOGUS.</p>"
