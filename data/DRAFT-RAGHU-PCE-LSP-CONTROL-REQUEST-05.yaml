abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) communication Protocol\n
    \  (PCEP) extensions provide stateful control of Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching
    (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP)\n   via PCEP, for a model
    where a Path Computation Client (PCC) delegates\n   control over one or more locally
    configured LSPs to a stateful PCE.\n   There are use-cases in which a stateful
    PCE may wish to request and\n   obtain control of one or more LSPs from a PCC.
    \ This document\n   describes a simple extension to stateful PCEP to achieve such
    an\n   objective.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
