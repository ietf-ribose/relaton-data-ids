abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The increasingly ubiquitous availability of broadband, together
    with\nflat-rate pricing, have made for increasing congestion problems on\nthe
    network, which are often caused by a small number of users\nconsuming a large
    amount of bandwidth.  In some cases, building out\nmore capacity to handle this
    new congestion may be infeasible or\nunwarranted.  As a result, network operators
    have sought other ways\nto manage congestion both from their own users and from
    other\nnetworks.  These different types of solutions have different\nstrengths
    and weaknesses, but all of them are limited in a number of\nkey ways.\n\nThis
    document discusses the problems created for operators by high-\nconsuming users
    and describes the strengths and weaknesses of a\nnumber of techniques operators
    are currently using to cope with high\nbandwidth usage.  The discussion of these
    solutions ultimately points\nto a need for a new kind of congestion accounting.\n\t
