abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Domain Name System (DNS) specifies a query type (QTYPE)
    \"ANY\".\n   The operator of an authoritative DNS server might choose not to\n
    \  respond to such queries for reasons of local policy, motivated by\n   security,
    performance or other reasons.\n\n   The DNS specification does not include specific
    guidance for the\n   behaviour of DNS servers or clients in this situation.  This
    document\n   aims to provide such guidance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
