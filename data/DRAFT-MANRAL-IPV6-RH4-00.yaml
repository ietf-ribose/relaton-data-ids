abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The functionality provided by IPv6's Type 0 Routing Header can
    be\n   exploited in order to achieve traffic amplification over a remote\n   path
    for the purposes of generating denial-of-service traffic.  \n\n   This document
    updates the IPv6 specification to the use of a new \n   IPv6 Type 4 Routing Header,
    in light of this security concern. This \n   new header provides the same functionality
    of the Routing Header\n   Type-0, while taking care of the major security concerns
    defined \n   in the draft [draft-ietf-ipv6-deprecate-rh0-01].\n\t </p>\n      "
