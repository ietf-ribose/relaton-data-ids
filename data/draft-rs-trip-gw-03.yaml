abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new application of the Telephony Routing
    over IP (TRIP) protocol. TRIP was engineered as a tool for inter- domain exchange
    of telephone routing information. However, it can also be used as a means for
    gateways and soft switches to export their routing information to a Location Server
    (LS), which may be co-resident with a proxy or gatekeeper. This LS can then manage
    those gateway resources. We discuss the motivations for this application, the
    reasons why other mechanims, such as the SIP REGISTER method, are not appropriate,
    and then show how a minimal subset of TRIP is needed for this application.</p>"
