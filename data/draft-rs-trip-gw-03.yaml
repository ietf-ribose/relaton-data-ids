abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a new application of the Telephony Routingover
    IP (TRIP) protocol. TRIP was engineered as a tool for inter-domain exchange of
    telephone routing information. However, it canalso be used as a means for gateways
    and soft switches to exporttheir routing information to a Location Server (LS),
    which may beco-resident with a proxy or gatekeeper. This LS can then manage thosegateway
    resources. We discuss the motivations for this application,the reasons why other
    mechanims, such as the SIP REGISTER method, arenot appropriate, and then show
    how a minimal subset of TRIP is neededfor this application.</p>"
