abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines a method for configuring BidirectionalForwarding
    Detection (BFD) by an IP Edge device using DHCPv4 orDHCPv6. It provides motivation
    for the new functionality, definesnew DHCP options to assist with the task and
    outlines the rules forconfiguring BFD on an IP endpoint for different network
    topologies.The document also discusses endpoint behavior upon BFD failure.Comments
    on this draft should be directed to rtg-bfd@ietf.org.</p>"
