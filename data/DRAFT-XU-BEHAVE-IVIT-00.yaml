abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a mechanism, IVIT (IVI+Tunnel), to support\nnon-IVI
    IPv6 hosts to communicate with IPv4 hosts, and vice versa.\nIVIT combines IVI
    translation and Tunnel methods with the IVI\ntranslation at the core and the tunnel
    at the edge.  In this\ndocument, IVIT provides two modes.  One is the dual-stack
    host mode,\nwhich supports the communication between a dual-stack host in an IPv4\nnetwork
    and a non-IVI IPv6 host, especially the communication\nscenario between a dual-stack
    server in an IPv4 network and a non-IVI\nIPv6 host.  The other is the CPE mode,
    which supports the\ncommunication between an IPv4-only host and a non-IVI IPv6
    host,\nespecially the bidirectional communication scenario between a private\nIPv4
    network and a non-IVI IPv6 network.  Combined with IVI, IVIT can\nsupport the
    communication between IPv4 networks and IPv6 networks\nstatelessly at the core.\n\t
