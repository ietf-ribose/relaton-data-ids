abstract:
- content: <p>The "RRSERIAL" EDNS option allows a DNS querier to request a DNS authoritative
    server to add an EDNS option in the answer of such query with the SOA serial number
    field of the origin zone which contains the answered Resource Record. This "RRSERIAL"
    data allows to debug and diagnose problems by helping to recognize the data source
    of an answer in an atomic single query, by associating the response with a respective
    zone version.</p>
