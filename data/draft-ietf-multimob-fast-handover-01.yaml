abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a multicast handover optimization mechanism
    for Proxy Mobile IPv6 to accelerate the delivery of multicast traffic to mobile
    nodes after handovers. The mechanism is based on speeding up the acquisition of
    mobile nodes' active multicast subscriptions information by the mobile access
    gateways. To do that, extensions to the current Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol are
    proposed. These extensions are not only applicable to the base solution for multicast
    support in Proxy Mobile IPv6, but also can be applied to other solutions envisioned
    as possible architectural evolutions of it. Furthermore, they are also independent
    of the role played by the mobile access gateway within the multicast network (either
    acting as multicast listener discovery proxy or multicast router).</p>"
