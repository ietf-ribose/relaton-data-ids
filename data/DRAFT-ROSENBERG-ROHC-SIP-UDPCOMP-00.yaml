abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), along with many other IP\nprotocols
    used for multimedia communications, are UDP-based, textual\nprotocols engineered
    for bandwidth rich links. As a result, these\nmessages have not been optimized
    for message size. With the planned\nusage of these protocols in wireless handsets
    as part of 2.5G and 3G\nwireless, the large size of these messages is problematic,
    primarily\nfor latency reasons. As a result, we propose a protocol shim between\nSIP
    (or any other UDP based protocol meeting our requirements) and\nUDP in order to
    efficiently compress SIP messages. Preliminary\nresults have shown compression
    gains of up to 8:1.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
