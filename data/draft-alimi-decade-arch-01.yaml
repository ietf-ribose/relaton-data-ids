abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on theInternet
    today and make up a large portion of the traffic in manynetworks. One technique
    to improve the network efficiency of P2Papplications is to introduce storage capabilities
    within the network.The DECADE Working Group has been formed with the goal of developingan
    architecture to provide this capability. This document presentsan architecture,
    discusses the underlying principles and identifiescore components and protocols
    supporting the architecture.</p>"
