abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for\n
    \  facilitating the application of virtual network abstractions to\n   network
    operation. These abstractions shall create a virtualized\n   environment supporting
    operators in viewing and controlling\n   different domains as a single virtualized
    network.  Each domain can\n   be created due to the applied technology, administrative
    zones, or\n   vendor-specific technology islands).Such an approach will facilitate\n
    \  the deployment of NFV (Network Function Virtualization) mechanisms,\n   and
    accelerate rapid service deployment of new services, including\n   more dynamic
    and elastic services, and improve overall network\n   operations and scaling of
    existing services.\n\n   This use-case considers the application of these abstractions
    within\n   the network of a single operator.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
