abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification addresses the challenges of using JavaScript Object
    Notation (JSON) with constrained devices by providing a standard set of mapping
    rules to Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) that preserve all semantic
    information, such that the original JSON string can be identically re-created.
    JSON Constrained Notation can also be used by devices as a native data format,
    which can then be represented as JSON when necessary for diagnostics, compatibility,
    and ease of integration with higher-level systems.</p>"
