abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a generic URI and HTTP-header-friendly envelope for
    carrying symmetrically encrypted, authenticated, and origin-timestamped tokens.
    It also describes one possible usage of such tokens via a simple protocol based
    on HTTP cookies. Secure Cookie Session (SCS) use cases cover a wide spectrum of
    applications, ranging from distribution of authorized content via HTTP (e.g.,
    with out-of-band signed URIs) to securing browser sessions with diskless embedded
    devices (e.g., Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) routers) or web servers with high
    availability or load- balancing requirements that may want to delegate the handling
    of the application state to clients instead of using shared storage or forced
    peering.</p>"
