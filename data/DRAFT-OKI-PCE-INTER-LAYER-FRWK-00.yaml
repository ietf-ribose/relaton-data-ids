abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A network may comprise of multiple layers. It is important to
    \nglobally optimize network resources utilization, taking into \naccount all layers,
    rather than optimizing resource utilization at \neach layer independently. This
    allows better network efficiency to \nbe achieved through a process that we call
    inter-layer traffic \nengineering. The Path Computation Element (PCE) can be a
    powerful \ntool to achieve inter-layer traffic engineering. \n      \nThis document
    describes a framework for the PCE-based path \ncomputation architecture to inter-layer
    MPLS and GMPLS traffic \nengineering. It provides suggestions for the deployment
    of PCE in \nsupport of multi-layer networks. This document also describes \nnetwork
    models where PCE performs inter-layer traffic engineering,\nand the relationship
    between PCE and a functional component called \nthe Virtual Network Topology Manager
    (VNTM).\n\t </p>\n      "
