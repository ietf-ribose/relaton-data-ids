abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, no LDP capability is exchanged for LDP applications
    like\n   IP label switching and L2VPN/PW signaling. When an LDP session comes\n
    \  up, an LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state for\n   such
    LDP applications even when the peer session may be established\n   for some other
    applications like ICCP. This document proposes a\n   solution by which an LDP
    speaker announces its disinterest or non-\n   support for IP label switching or
    L2VPN/PW application, hence\n   disabling corresponding application state exchange
    over the\n   established LDP session.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
