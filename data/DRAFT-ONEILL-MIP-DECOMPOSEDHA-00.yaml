abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 3344 [1] describes the current version of Mobile IP version
    4    \n   signaling and forwarding. The signaling and forwarding is conducted
    \n   between a Mobile Node and a Home Agent, via an optional intermediate \n   Foreign
    Agent, for a Home Address of the Mobile Node. The Home Agent \n   acts as the
    Mobile IP signaling endpoint, as well as the forwarding \n   endpoint for packet
    tunneling between the Home Agent and the MN Care \n   of Address. This document
    describes an alternative architecture in \n   which the Home Agent is the signaling
    endpoint whilst a new Tunnel \n   Agent acts as the forwarding endpoint.\n  \n\t
