abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This Draft is intended as a standards track document, obsoletingRFC
    1036, which itself dates from 1987.This Standard defines the format of Netnews
    articles and specifiesthe requirements to be met by software which originates,
    distributes,stores and displays them.Since the 1980s, Usenet has grown explosively,
    and many Internet andnon-Internet sites now participate. In addition, the Netnewstechnology
    is now in widespread use for other purposes.Backward compatibility has been a
    major goal of this endeavour, butwhere this standard and earlier documents or
    practices conflict, thisstandard should be followed. In most such cases, current
    practice isalready compatible with these changes.</p>"
