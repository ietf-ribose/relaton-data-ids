    of NTP, version 4, has been in existence for a long\ntime, but only recently been
    adopted as an IETF Standard.  In the\nmean time however, the requirements for
    higher precision of wall-\nclock services over IP networks has grown.  This document
    outlines\nsome of the requirements of wall-clock services that is not provided\nby
    NTPv4, and is intended to serve as a gap analysis.\n\t </p>\n      "
