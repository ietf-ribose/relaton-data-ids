abstract:
- content: "<p>This document illustrates a way to integrate a new class of nodes and
    links in segment routing to represent transport networks in an opaque way into
    the segment routing domain. An instance of this class would be optical networks
    that are typically transport centric. In the IP centric network, this will help
    in defining a common control protocol for packet optical integration that will
    include optical paths as 'transport segments' or sub-paths as an augmentation
    to packet paths. The transport segment option also defines a general mechanism
    to allow for future extensibility of segment routing into non-packet domains.</p>"
