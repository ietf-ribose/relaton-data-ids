abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 6155 specifies an extension for the HTTP-Enabled Location\n
    \  Delivery (HELD) Protocol allowing the use of an IP address and port\n   number
    to request a Device location based on an individual packet\n   flow.\n\n   However,
    certain kinds of NAT require that identifiers for both ends\n   of the packet
    flow must be specified in order to unambiguously\n   satisfy the location request.\n\n
    \  This document specifies an XML Schema and URN Sub-Namespace for a\n   Flow
    Identity Extension for HELD to support this requirement.\n\n   This document updates
    RFC 6155 by deprecating the port number\n   elements specified therein.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
