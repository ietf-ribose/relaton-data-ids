abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the obstacles to implementing AMT Multicast in a multi-\n
    \  network environment is the difficulty an AMT Gateway may have in\n   finding
    an AMT Relay that is optimal.  Optimal in this context means\n   that the AMT
    Relay has multicast connectivity to the Source, and its\n   location minimizes
    the unicast (tunneled) portion of the path to the\n   Gateway.  Blind use of the
    global anycast address specified for AMT\n   Relays in \"Automatic IP Multicast
    Without Explicit Tunnels (AMT)\"\n   (RFC 7450) could result in reaching an AMT
    Relay that does not have\n   multicast connectivity to the source, which would
    yield a failure to\n   obtain the multicast content; or it could result in reaching
    an AMT\n   Relay that is otherwise less than optimal.  This document proposes
    a\n   method for implementing standard DNS procedures so that an AMT\n   Gateway
    using normal DNS queries can virtually always find the\n   optimal AMT Relay for
    a given Source..\n\n\t </p>\n      "
