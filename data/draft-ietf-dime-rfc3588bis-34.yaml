abstract:
- content: "<p>The Diameter base protocol is intended to provide an Authentication,
    Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) framework for applications such as network
    access or IP mobility in both local and roaming situations. This document specifies
    the message format, transport, error reporting, accounting, and security services
    used by all Diameter applications. The Diameter base protocol as defined in this
    document obsoletes RFC 3588 and RFC 5719, and it must be supported by all new
    Diameter implementations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
