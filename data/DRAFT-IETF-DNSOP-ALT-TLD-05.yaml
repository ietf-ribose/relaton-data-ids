abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document reserves a string (ALT) to be used as a TLD label
    in\n   non-DNS contexts or for names that have no meaning in a global\n   context.
    \ It also provides advice and guidance to developers\n   developing alternate
    namespaces.\n\n   [ Ed note: This document lives in GitHub at:\n   https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-alt-tld
    . Issues and\n   pull requests happily accepted. ]\n\n   [ Question for Working
    Group.  It has been proposed that the string\n   .ALT should be replaced with
    something else e.g. .NOT-DNS.  As naming\n   discussions in the IETF are always
    short, simple, and not\n   controversial, we figured we should open these for
    discussion now.\n   We would appreciate clear feedback on preference and rationale.
