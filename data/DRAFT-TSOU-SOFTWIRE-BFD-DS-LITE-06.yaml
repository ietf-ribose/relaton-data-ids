abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In DS-Lite, the tunnel is stateless, not associated with any
    state\n   information, and the CGN function at the AFTR is stateful.\n   Currently,
    there is no failure detection and failover mechanism for\n   both stateless tunnel
    and stateful CGN function, which makes it\n   difficult to manage and diagnose
    if there is a problem.  This draft\n   analyzes the applicability of some of the
    possible solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
