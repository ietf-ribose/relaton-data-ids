abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
    provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without configuration in multi-hop
    networks with arbitrary topology and link technology, safe forwarding even during
    periods of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast
    traffic. TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate
    System) link state routing and by encapsulating traffic using a header that includes
    a hop count. Since the TRILL base protocol was approved in March 2010, active
    development of TRILL has revealed errata in the original RFC 6325 and some cases
    that could use clarifications or updates. RFC 6327 and RFC 6439 provide clarifications
    and updates with respect to Adjacency and Appointed Forwarders. This document
    provides other known clarifications, corrections, and updates to RFC 6325, RFC
    6327, and RFC 6439.</p>"
