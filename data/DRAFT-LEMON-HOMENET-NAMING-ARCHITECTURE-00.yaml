abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document recommends a naming and service discovery resolution\n
    \  architecture for homenets.  This architecture covers the publication\n   and
    resolution of names of hosts on the homenet both within the\n   homenet and on
    the public internet, and the use of such names for\n   offering and discovering
    services that exist on the homenet both\n   within the homenet and on the public
    internet.  Security and privacy\n   implications and techniques for automatically
    and administratively\n   setting security and privacy policies for such names
    are also\n   described.\n\t </p>\n      "
