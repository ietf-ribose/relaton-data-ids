abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Certain L2VPN architectures [IPLS, VPLS] rely on there being a fullmesh
    of pseudowires [PWE3-ARCH] among a set of entities. This meshis used to provide
    a 'LAN-like' service among the entities. If oneor more of these pseudowires is
    absent, so that there is not really afull mesh, various higher layers (from routing
    to bridge controlprotocols) that expect a LAN-like service may fail to work asexpected.
    Therefore it is desirable to have procedures that enablethe pseudowire endpoints
    to determine automatically whether there isreally a full mesh or not. It is also
    desirable to have proceduresthat cause the L2VPNs to adapt to pseudowire failures.
    This documentproposes a set of procedures to meet these goals. Detailed protocolencodings
    are not present, but will be added in future versions.</p>"
