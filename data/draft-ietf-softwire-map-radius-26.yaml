abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv4-over-IPv6 transition mechanisms provide IPv4 connectivity services
    over IPv6 native networks during the IPv4/IPv6 coexistence period. DHCPv6 options
    have been defined to configure clients for Lightweight 4over6, Mapping of Address
    and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E), Mapping of Address and Port using Translation
    (MAP-T) unicast softwire mechanisms, and multicast softwires. However, in many
    networks, configuration information is stored in an Authentication, Authorization,
    and Accounting (AAA) server, which utilizes the Remote Authentication Dial In
    User Service (RADIUS) protocol to provide centralized management for users. When
    a new transition mechanism is developed, new RADIUS attributes need to be defined
    correspondingly. This document defines new RADIUS attributes to carry softwire
    configuration parameters based on Address plus Port from a AAA server to a Broadband
    Network Gateway. Both unicast and multicast attributes are covered.</p>"
