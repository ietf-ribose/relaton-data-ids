abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To protect user data and privacy, Internet transport protocols
    have\n   supported payload encryption and authentication for some time.  Such\n
    \  encryption and authentication is now also starting to be applied to\n   the
    transport protocol headers.  This helps avoid transport protocol\n   ossification
    by middleboxes, mitigate attacks against the transport\n   protocol, and protect
    metadata about the communication.  Current\n   operational practice in some networks
    inspect transport header\n   information within the network, but this is no longer
    possible when\n   those transport headers are encrypted.\n\n   This document discusses
    the possible impact when network traffic uses\n   a protocol with an encrypted
    transport header.  It suggests issues to\n   consider when designing new transport
    protocols or features.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
