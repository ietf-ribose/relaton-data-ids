abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a simple state machine for stateful
    network\n   devices on a path between two endpoints to associate state with\n
    \  traffic traversing them on a per-flow basis, as well as abstract\n   signaling
    mechanisms for driving the state machine.  This state\n   machine is intended
    to replace the de-facto use of the TCP state\n   machine or incomplete forms thereof
    by stateful network devices in a\n   transport-independent way, while still allowing
    for fast state\n   timeout of non-established or undesirable flows.\n\n\t </p>\n
