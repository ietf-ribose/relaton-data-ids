abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network\n
    \  Communications Research Group (NWCRG).  This document follows the\n   taxonomy
    document [RFC8406] and considers coding as a linear\n   combination of packets
    that operate in and above the network layer.\n   In this context, this memo details
    a multi-gateway satellite system\n   to identify use-cases where network coding
    is relevant.  As example,\n   network coding operating in and above the network
    layer can be\n   exploited to cope with residual losses or provide reliable multicast\n
    \  services.  The objective is to contribute to a larger deployment of\n   such
    techniques in SATCOM systems.  This memo also identifies open\n   research issues
    related to the deployment of network coding in SATCOM\n   systems, such as the
    interaction between congestion control and\n   network coding techniques.\n\n\t
