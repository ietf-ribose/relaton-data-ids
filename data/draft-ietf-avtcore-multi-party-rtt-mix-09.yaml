abstract:
- content: <p>Real-time text mixers for multi-party sessions need to identify the
    source of each transmitted group of text so that the text can be presented by
    endpoints in suitable grouping with other text from the same source. Regional
    regulatory requirements specify provision of real-time text in multi-party calls.
    RFC 4103 mixer implementations can use traditional RTP functions for source identification,
    but the mixer source switching performance is limited when using the default transmission
    characteristics with redundancy. Enhancements for RFC 4103 real-time text mixing
    is provided in this document, suitable for a centralized conference model that
    enables source identification and source switching. The intended use is for real-time
    text mixers and multi-party-aware participant endpoints. The specified mechanism
    build on the standard use of the CSRC list in the RTP packet for source identification.
    The method makes use of the same "text/red" format as for two-party sessions.
    A capability exchange is specified so that it can be verified that a participant
    can handle the multi-party coded real-time text stream. The capability is indicated
    by use of a media attribute "rtt-mixer". The document updates RFC 4103[RFC4103]
    A specifications of how a mixer can format text for the case when the endpoint
    is not multi-party aware is also provided.</p>
