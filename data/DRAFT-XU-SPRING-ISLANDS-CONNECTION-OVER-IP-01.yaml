abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MPLS-SPRING is a source routing paradigm in which a sender
    of a\n   packet is allowed to partially or completely specify the route the\n
    \  packet takes through the network by using stacked MPLS labels.  The\n   current
    MPLS-SRPING architecture requires an end-to-end MPLS Label\n   Switched Path (LSP)
    between any two MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers\n   (e.g., two adjacent hops of a
    given explicit path).  In order to\n   enable MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers to be
    deployed even when there are\n   non-MPLS routers along the path between two MPLS-SPRING-enabled\n
    \  routers, it is desirable to have an alternative, which allows the use\n   of
    IP-based tunnels (e.g., GRE tunnels) to connect two MPLS-SPRING-\n   enabled routers.
    \ This document describes a mechanism for such usage.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
