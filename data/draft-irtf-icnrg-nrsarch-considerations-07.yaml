abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes architectural considerations and implications
    related to the use of a Name Resolution Service (NRS) in Information- Centric
    Networking (ICN). It explains how the ICN architecture can change when an NRS
    is utilized and how its use influences the ICN routing system. This document is
    a product of the Information- Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).</p>"
