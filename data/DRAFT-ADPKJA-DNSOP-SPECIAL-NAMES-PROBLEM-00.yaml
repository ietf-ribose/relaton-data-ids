abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The dominant protocol for name resolution on the Internet is
    the\n   Domain Name System (DNS).  However, other protocols exist that are\n   fundamentally
    different from the DNS, but which have syntactically-\n   similar namespaces.\n\n
    \  When an end-user triggers resolution of a name on a system which\n   supports
    multiple, different protocols for name resolution, it is\n   desirable that the
    protocol to be used is unambiguous, and that\n   requests intended for one protocol
    are not inadvertently addressed\n   using another.\n\n   [RFC6761] introduced
    a framework by which, under certain\n   circumstances, a particular domain name
    could be acknowledged as\n   being special.  This framework has been used to make
    top-level domain\n   reservations, that is, particular top-level domains that
    should not\n   be used within the DNS to accommodate parallel use of non-DNS name\n
    \  resolution protocols by end-users and avoid the possibility of\n   namespace
    collisions.\n\n   Various challenges have become apparent with this application
    of the\n   guidance provided in [RFC6761].  This document aims to document those\n
    \  challenges in the form of a problem statement, to facilitate further\n   discussion
    of potential solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
