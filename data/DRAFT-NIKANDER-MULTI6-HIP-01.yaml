abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Host Identity Protocol implements the identifier locator\n
    \  separation by introduing a new name space and a new layer to the IP\n   stack.
    \ The new structure insulates the transport layer protocols\n   from the internetworking
    layer, thereby allowing transport sessions\n   to remain unaffected even if the
    underlying IP addresses change.\n   That, in turn, seems to make it easier to
    solve the so called site\n   multi-homing problem than without introducing such
    an indirection\n   layer.\n\n   This document discusses how the proposed HIP mobility
    and\n   multi-homing solution, described separately, would fit to the IETF\n   multi6
    working group requirements.\n\t </p>\n      "
