abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IANA has created \"Protocol in the Segment ID Sub-TLV\" and
    \"Protocol\n   in the Label Stack Sub-TLV of the Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV\"\n
    \  registries under the \"Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label\n   Switched
    Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters\" registry.  RFC8287 defines the\n   code points
    for Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate\n   System to Intermediate
    System (IS-IS) protocols.\n\n   This document specifies the code point to be used
    in the Segment ID\n   sub-TLV and Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV when the Interior
    Gateway\n   Protocol (IGP) is OSPFv3.  This document also updates RFC8287 by\n
    \  clarifying that the existing \"OSPF\" code point is to be used only to\n   indicate
    OSPFv2, and by defining the behavior when the Segment ID\n   sub-TLV indicates
    the use of IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
