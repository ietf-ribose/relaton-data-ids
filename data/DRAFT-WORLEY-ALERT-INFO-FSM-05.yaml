abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The \"alert\" namespace of uniform resource names (URNs) can
    be used in\n   the Alert-Info header field of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n
    \  requests and responses to inform a VoIP telephone (user agent) of the\n   characteristics
    of the call that the user agent has originated or\n   terminated.  Based on the
    URNs in the Alert-Info header field, the\n   user agent must select an the best
    available signal to present to its\n   user to indicate the characteristics of
    the call.  This document\n   describes a method by which a user agent's designer
    can, based on the\n   user agent's signals and their meanings, construct a finite
    state\n   machine (FSM) to process the URNs to select a signal in a way that\n
    \  obeys the restrictions given in the definition of the \"alert\" URN\n   namespace.
    \ In many situations, the resulting FSM is simpler and\n   faster than the previously
    described selection algorithm.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
