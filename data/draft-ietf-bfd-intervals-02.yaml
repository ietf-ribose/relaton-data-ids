abstract:
- content: <p>Some BFD implementations may be restricted to only support several interval
    values. When such BFD implementations speak to each other, there is a possibility
    of two sides not being able to find a common interval value to run BFD sessions.
    This document defines a small set of interval values for BFD that we call "Common
    intervals", and recommends implementations to support the defined intervals. This
    solves the problem of finding an interval value that both BFD speakers can support
    while allowing a simplified implementation as seen for hardware-based BFD. It
    does not restrict an implementation from supporting more intervals in addition
    to the Common intervals.</p>
