abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] describes
    a\n   mechanism for dynamically configuring IPv4 over an IPv6-only network.\n
    \  For DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 to function with some IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire\n   mechanisms,
    the operator must obtain information about the IPv4\n   address and Port Set ID
    allocated to the DHCP 4o6 client, as well as\n   the /128 IPv6 prefix that the
    client will use as the source of IPv4-\n   in-IPv6 tunnel.  This memo defines
    a DHCPv6 container option and two\n   DHCPv6 sub-options, to communicate the source
    tunnel IPv6 address\n   between the DHCP 4o6 client and server.  It is designed
    to work in\n   conjunction with the IPv4 address allocation process.\n\n\t </p>\n
