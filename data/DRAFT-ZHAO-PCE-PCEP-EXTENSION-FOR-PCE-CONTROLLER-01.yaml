abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks deployment scenarios, service providers
    would\n   like to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in both MPLS and\n
    \  GMPLS while removing the complexity of existing signaling protocols\n   such
    as LDP and RSVP-TE.  In\n   [I-D.zhao-pce-central-controller-user-cases], we propose
    to use the\n   PCE [RFC5440] as a central controller (PCECC) so that LSP can be\n
    \  calculated/ signaled/initiated and label forwarding entries are\n   downloaded
    through a centralized PCE server to each network devices\n   along the LSP path
    while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as\n   much as possible.\n\n   This
    draft specify the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for\n   using the PCE
    as the central controller and user cases where LSPs are\n   calculated/setup/initiated
    and label forwarding entries are\n   downloaded through extending the existing
    PCE architectures and PCEP.\n\n   This document also discuss the role of PCECC
    in Segment Routing (SR).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
