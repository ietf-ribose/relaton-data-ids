abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an alternate protocol for Internet name\n
    \  resolution, designed as a prototype to facilitate conversation about\n   the
    evolution or replacement of the Domain Name System protocol.  It\n   attempts
    to answer the question: \"how would we design DNS knowing\n   what we do now,\"
    on the background of a set of properties of an\n   idealized Internet naming service.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
