abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification presents an approach to increase the security
    of\n   block cipher operation modes based on re-keying (with no additional\n   keys
    needed) during each separate message processing.  It provides an\n   internal
    re-keying mechanism called ACPKM.  This mechanism doesn't\n   require additional
    secret parameters or complicated transforms - for\n   key update only the base
    encryption function is used.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
