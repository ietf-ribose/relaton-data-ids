abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the context of virtualization, a service essentially consists
    of a\n   set of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) with each VNF building on\n
    \  top of virtualization infrastructure to implement a specific network\n   functions
    along with the data connections between VNFs.  VNFs may be\n   highly distributed
    existing in devices in data center networks,\n   mobile networks or satellite
    networks.  In some of these\n   environments, the resources are highly constrained.\n\n
    \  This draft provides seven use cases the authors have implemented in\n   demonstration
    or deployed code for the following network function\n   virtualization: cloud
    bursting, parental controls, load balancer for\n   multipath (L1-L7), WAN optimization
    that runs either between access\n   nodes and Data Centers, WAN optimization between
    mobile phones to\n   Data Centers (through access nodes), application placement\n
    \  optimization, and optimized placement of web applications utilizing\n   minimal
    data transfer.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
