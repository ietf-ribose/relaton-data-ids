abstract:
- content: <p>A Service Function Chain (SFC) defines a set of abstract Service Functions
    (SF) and ordering constraints that must be applied to packets and/or frames selected
    as a result of classification. One assumption of this document is that legacy
    service functions can participate in service function chains without supporting
    the SFC header, or even being aware of it. This document provides some of the
    mechanisms between an SFC proxy and an SFC-unaware service function (herein termed
    "legacy SF"), to identify the SFC header associated with a packet that is returned
    from a legacy SF, without an SFC header being explicitly carried in the wired
    protocol between SFC proxy and legacy SF.</p>
