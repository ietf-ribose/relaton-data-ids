abstract:
- content: "<p>The EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route can optionally carry IPv4 and IPv6
    addresses associated with a MAC address. Remote PEs can use this information to
    reply locally (act as proxy) to IPv4 ARP requests and IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation
    messages (or 'unicast-forward' them to the owner of the MAC) and reduce/suppress
    the flooding produced by the Address Resolution procedure. This EVPN capability
    is extremely useful in Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) and Data Centers (DCs)
    with large broadcast domains, where the amount of ARP/ND flooded traffic causes
    issues on routers and CEs. This document describes how the EVPN Proxy-ARP/ND function
    may be implemented to help IXPs and other operators deal with the issues derived
    from Address Resolution in large broadcast domains.</p>"
