abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends PASSporT, a token for conveying\n   cryptographically-signed
    call information about personal\n   communications, to include rich meta-data
    about a call and caller\n   that can be signed and integrity protected, transmitted,
    and\n   subsequently rendered to the called party.  This framework is\n   intended
    to include and extend caller and call specific information\n   beyond human-readable
    display name comparable to the \"Caller ID\"\n   function common on the telephone
    network.  The JSON element defined\n   for this purpose, Rich Call Data (RCD),
    is an extensible object\n   defined to either be used as part of STIR or with
    SIP Call-Info to\n   include related information about calls that helps people
    decide\n   whether to pick up the phone.  This signing of the RCD information
    is\n   also enhanced with a integrity mechanism that is designed to protect\n
    \  the authoring and transport of this information between authoritative\n   and
    non-authoritative parties generating and signing the Rich Call\n   Data for support
    of different usage and content policies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
