abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the use of the Internet Control Message Protocol
    (ICMP) to perform a variety of attacks against the Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP). Additionally, this document describes a number of widely implemented modifications
    to TCP's handling of ICMP error messages that help to mitigate these issues. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"
