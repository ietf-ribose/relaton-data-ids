abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document summarizes benefits that operators perceive to
    be\n   provided by intermediary devices that provide functions apart from\n   normal
    IP forwarding.  Such intermediary devices are often called\n   \"middleboxes\".\n\n
    \  RFC3234 defines a taxonomy of middleboxes and issues in the Internet.\n   Most
    of those middleboxes utilize or modify application-layer data.\n   This document
    primarily focuses on devices that observe and act on\n   information carried in
    the transport layer, and especially\n   information carried in TCP packets.\n\n
    \  A primary goal of this document is to provide information to working\n   groups
    developing new transport protocols, to aid understanding of\n   what might be
    gained or lost by design decisions that may affect (or\n   be affected by) middlebox
    operation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
