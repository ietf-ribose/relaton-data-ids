abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A new framework called Static Context Header Compression (SCHC)
    has\n   been designed with the primary goal of supporting IPv6 over Low Power\n
    \  Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies [RFC8724].  One of the SCHC\n   components
    is a header compression mechanism.  If used properly, SCHC\n   header compression
    allows a greater compression ratio than that\n   achievable with traditional 6LoWPAN
    header compression [RFC6282].\n   For this reason, it may make sense to use SCHC
    header compression in\n   some 6LoWPAN environments.  This document defines a
    6LoWPAN Dispatch\n   Type to signal when a packet header has been compressed by
    using SCHC\n   header compression.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
