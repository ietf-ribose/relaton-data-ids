abstract:
- content: "<p>The ubiquitous presence of the internet coupled with the increasing
    demand for high bandwidth dedicated large scale network has made it imperative
    that the multi-domain networks are facilitated by the development of GMPLS. In
    such large scale network, the high performance network survivability is a significant
    factor to resist the fault service discontinue and interruption even to decrease
    economic loss and the society impact. This document proposes a series of network
    survivability evaluation metrics and methodologies that can be used to demonstrate
    the network survivability performance in single and multi-domain GMPLS networks,
    more specifically, the network fault restoration performance.</p>"
