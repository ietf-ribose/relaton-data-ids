abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines BGP extensions and procedures that allows use
    of BFD for Multi Point Networks for fast detection and failover for upstream faults
    in Multicast VPNs. The upstream failures addressed in this proposal can be failure
    of any node between the Root PE and Leaf PE or failure between the Multicast Source
    and Root PE.</p>"
