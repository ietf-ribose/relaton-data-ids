- content: "<p>This text documents the current usage of 'P-Charge-Info', an existing
    private Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) header field (P-header) used to convey
    billing information about the party to be charged. This P-Header is currently
    used in production by several equipment vendors and carriers. This document is
    submitted to request the registration of this header field with the Internet Assigned
    Numbers Authority (IANA). NOTE: This document is a simplified version of the document
    previously known as 'draft-york-dispatch-p-charge-info'.</p>"
