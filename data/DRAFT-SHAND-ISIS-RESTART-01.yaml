abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IS-IS routing protocol (RFC 1142 [2], ISO/IEC 10589 [3]) is
    a \nlink state intra-domain routing protocol. Normally, when an IS-IS \nrouter
    is re-started, the neighboring routers detect the restart \nevent and cycle their
    adjacencies with the restarting router through \nthe down state. This is necessary
    in order to invoke the protocol \nmechanisms to ensure correct re-synchronization
    of the LSP database. \nHowever, the cycling of the adjacency state causes the
    neighbors to \nregenerate their LSPs describing the adjacency concerned. This
    in \nturn causes temporary disruption of routes passing through the \nrestarting
    router.\n\t </p>\n      "
