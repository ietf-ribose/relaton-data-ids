abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the gRPC Network Management Interface
    (gNMI),\n   a network management protocol based on the gRPC framework.  gNMI\n
    \  supports retrieval and manipulation of state from network elements\n   where
    the data is represented by a tree structure, and addressable by\n   paths.  The
    gNMI service defines operations for configuration\n   management, operational
    state retrieval, and bulk data collection via\n   streaming telemetry.  The authoritative
    gNMI specification is\n   maintained at [GNMI-SPEC].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
