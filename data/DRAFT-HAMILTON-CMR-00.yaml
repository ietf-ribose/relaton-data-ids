abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the spirit of simple, incremental improvement, we describe
    a\n   whitelist-based revocation mechanism called the \"Certificate\n   Manifest
    Register\".  This is a list of all potentially-valid\n   certificates which are
    (as of the date of production) known to have\n   been legitimately issued by the
    CA and how they are to be treated by\n   the client.  This permits certificates
    which are checked against it\n   to be presumed invalid unless listed.\n\n   Several
    recent events have cast doubt on the sufficiency of\n   blacklist-based PKIX certificate
    revocation mechanisms.  At least\n   one publicly-trusted Certification Authority
    was recently found to\n   have been penetrated by a state-backed attacker, which
    issued itself\n   several certificates valid for a particular global web search
    and\n   email provider and then removed the records that it had done so.  In\n
    \  effect, the attacker was able to cause the CA to sleepwalk.  There\n   was
    nothing that the client software developers could do to protect\n   their users
    and themselves except remove the trust in that CA's\n   root.  This event directly
    caused that particular CA's insolvency.\n\n   The Certificate Revocation List
    format and definitions (X.509v2 as\n   described in RFC 5280, its predecessors,
    and possibly its\n   successors) are used and adapted whole-hog, with no data
    format\n   changes and the alteration of one rule and one semantic to support\n
    \  whitelist-based processing.  CMR is defined to use version integer 3\n   (v4)
    to differentiate its processing path from v2 CRL.  The changes\n   from the CRL
    Profile are so minor, though, that they potentially\n   might be implemented without
    a version bump, without disruption to\n   current v2 CRL consumers.\n\n\t </p>\n
