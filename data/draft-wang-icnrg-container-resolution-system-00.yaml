abstract:
- content: "<p>We illustrate the architecture and mechanism of container resolution
    system, and to the protocol of resolving containers in ICN. The fundamental characters
    are:1)Use Interest and Data packet as the communication primitives, 2)Every routing
    node has FIB, CS, PIT tables to do packet routing and caching. Current NDN/CCN
    architecture does not require a resolution system. The routing is totally based
    on prefixes of content names, which causes scalability and mobility issues described
    in [Cisco-Name]. This draft addresses the aforementioned issues.</p>"
