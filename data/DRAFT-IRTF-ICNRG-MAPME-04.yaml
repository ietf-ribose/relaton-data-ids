abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Consumer mobility is supported in ICN by design, in virtue
    of its\n   connectionless pull-based communication model; producer mobility\n
    \  though is not natively supported.  This document describes MAP-Me, an\n   anchor-less
    solution to manage micro-mobility of content producers in\n   the CCN (Content
    Centric Networking) and NDN (Named Data Networking)\n   architectures, with support
    for latency-sensitive applications.  MAP-\n   Me consists in the combination of
    two data plane protocols, triggered\n   by producer movements, and leveraging
    ICN named-based data plane.\n   The main protocol consists in a lightweight FIB
    update process,\n   complemented by a mechanism of local notification and scoped\n
    \  discovery suitable for low latency applications and fast mobility.\n\n\t </p>\n
