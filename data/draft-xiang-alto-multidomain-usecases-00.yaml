abstract:
- content: "<p>With the development of novel network technology, such as software
    defined networking and network function virtualization, many novel multi-domain
    applications, such as flexible interdomain routing, distributed, federated machine
    learning and multi-domain collaborative dataset transfer, have been deployed.
    These applications can benefit substantially from the ALTO protocol [RFC7285],
    through which the information of multiple networks can be provided to applications.
    This document first introduces several multi-domain applications and how they
    can benefit from ALTO. It then describes a generic framework for multi-domain
    applications to use ALTO to improve the performance, followed by a discussion
    on new requirements and challenges for ALTO to better support these applications.</p>"
