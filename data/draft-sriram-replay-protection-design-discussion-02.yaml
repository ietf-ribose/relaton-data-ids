abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGPSEC protocol requires a method for protection from replay attacks,
    at least to control the window of exposure. In the context of BGPSEC, a replay
    attack occurs when an adversary suppresses a prefix withdrawal (implicit or explicit)
    or replays a previously received BGPSEC announcement for a prefix that has since
    been withdrawn. This informational document provides design discussion and comparison
    of multiple alternative replay-attack protection mechanisms weighing their pros
    and cons. It is meant to be a companion document to the standards track I-D.-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-
    rollover that will specify a method to be used with BGPSEC for replay-attack protection.</p>"
