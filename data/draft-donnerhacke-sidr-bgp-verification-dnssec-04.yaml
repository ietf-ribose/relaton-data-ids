abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes an infrastructure for real time verificationof
    routes reveived via BGP4. Some DNS query types are introduced tocheck the origin
    of a prefix and validity of the AS path. The cryptopart can be offloaded from
    the routing engine by sending a DNS queryand checking the AD bit in the DNS response.
    The proposal depends onthe DNS scalability and caching mechanisms as well as PKI
    introducedby DNSSEC.</p>"
