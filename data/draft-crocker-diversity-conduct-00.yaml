abstract:
- content: "<p>The process of producing today's Internet through a culture of open
    participation and diverse collaboration has proved strikingly efficient and effective,
    and it is distinctive among standards organizations. Historically participation
    in the IETF and its antecedent was almost entirely composed of well-funded, American,
    white, male engineers. No matter the intentions of the participants, such a narrow
    demographic distorts group dynamics, both in management and in personal interactions.
    In the case of the IETF, group interaction style can often demonstrate singularly
    aggressive behavior, often including singularly hostile tone and content. Groups
    with greater diversity make better decisions. Obtaining meaningful diversity requires
    more than generic good will and statements of principle. Many different behaviors
    can serve to reduce participant diversity or participation diversity. This paper
    discusses the nature and practicalities of IETF attention to its diverse participation
    and to the requirement for professional demeanor.</p>"
