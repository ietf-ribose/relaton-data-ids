abstract:
- content: "<p>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides a capability to carry specified
    unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely low
    data loss rates and bounded latency. Techniques used include: 1) reserving data
    plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of
    the relay nodes (bridges or routers) along the path of the flow; 2) providing
    fixed paths for DetNet flows that do not rapidly change with the network topology;
    and 3) sequentializing, replicating, tracing and eliminating duplicate packets
    at various points to ensure the availability of at least one path. The capabilities
    can be managed by configuration, or by manual or automatic network management.</p>"
