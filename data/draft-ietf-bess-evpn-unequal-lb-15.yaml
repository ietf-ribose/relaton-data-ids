abstract:
- content: "<p>EVPN enables all-active multi-homing for a CE device connected to two
    or more PEs via a LAG, such that bridged and routed traffic from remote PEs to
    hosts attached to the Ethernet Segment can be equally load balanced (it uses Equal
    Cost Multi Path) across the multi-homing PEs. EVPN also enables multi-homing for
    IP subnets advertised in IP Prefix routes, so that routed traffic from remote
    PEs to those IP subnets can be load balanced. This document defines extensions
    to EVPN procedures to optimally handle unequal access bandwidth distribution across
    a set of multi-homing PEs in order to: * provide greater flexibility, with respect
    to adding or removing individual multi-homed PE-CE links. * handle multi-homed
    PE-CE link failures that can result in unequal PE-CE access bandwidth across a
    set of multi-homing PEs.</p>"
