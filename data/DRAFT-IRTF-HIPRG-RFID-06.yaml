abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an architecture based on the Host Identity\n
    \  Protocol (HIP), for active RFIDs, i.e. Radio Frequency Identifiers\n   including
    tamper resistant computing resources, as specified for\n   example in the ISO
    14443 or 15693 standards. HIP-RFIDs never expose\n   their identity in clear text,
    but hide this value (typically an EPC-\n   Code) by a particular equation that
    can be only solved by a dedicated\n   entity, referred as the portal. HIP exchanges
    occur between HIP-RFIDs\n   and portals; they are transported by IP packets, through
    the Internet\n   cloud.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
