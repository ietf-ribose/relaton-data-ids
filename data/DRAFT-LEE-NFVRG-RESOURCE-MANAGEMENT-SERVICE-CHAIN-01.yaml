abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies problem definition and use cases of
    NFV\n   resource management in service chaining for path optimization,\n   traffic
    optimization, failover, load balancing, etc.  It further\n   describes design
    considerations and relevant framework for the\n   resource management capability
    that dynamically creates and updates\n   network forwarding paths (NFPs) considering
    resource constraints of\n   NFV infrastructure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
