abstract:
  content: "\t <t>[RFC4456] asserts that, because the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)cost
    to a given point in the network will vary across routers, \"theroute reflection
    approach may not yield the same route selectionresult as that of the full IBGP
    mesh approach.\" One practicalimplication of this assertion is that the deployment
    of routereflection may thwart the ability to achieve hot potato routing. Hotpotato
    routing attempts to direct traffic to the closest AS egresspoint in cases where
    no higher priority policy dictates otherwise.As a consequence of the route reflection
    method, the choice of exitpoint for a route reflector and its clients will be
    the egress pointclosest to the route reflector - and not necessarily closest to
    theRR clients.Section 11 of [RFC4456] describes a deployment approach and a set
    ofconstraints which, if satsified, would result in the deployment ofroute reflection
    yielding the same results as the iBGP full meshapproach. Such a deployment approach
    would make route reflectioncompatible with the application of hot potato routing
    policy.As networks evolved to accommodate architectural requirements of newservices,
    tunneled (LSP/IP tunneling) networks with centralized routereflectors became commonplace.
    This is one type of common deploymentwhere it would be impractical to satisfy
    the constraints described inSection 11 of [RFC4456]. Yet, in such an environment,
    hot potatorouting policy remains desirable.This document proposes two new solutions
    which can be deployed tofacilitate the application of closest exit point policy
    centralizedroute reflection deployments.</p>"
