abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A transport network is a server-layer network to provide connectivity\n
    \  services to its client.  The topology and tunnel information in the\n   transport
    layer has already been defined by generic Traffic-\n   engineered models and technology-specific
    models (e.g., OTN, WSON).\n   However, how the client signals are accessing to
    the network has not\n   been described.  These information is necessary to both
    client and\n   provider.\n\n   This draft describes how the client signals are
    carried over\n   transport network and defines YANG data models which are required\n
    \  during configuration procedure.  More specifically, several client\n   signal
    (of transport network) models including ETH, STM-n, FC and so\n   on, are defined
    in this draft.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
