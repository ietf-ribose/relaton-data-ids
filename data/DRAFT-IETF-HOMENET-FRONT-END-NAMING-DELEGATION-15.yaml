abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Home owners often have IPv6 devices that they wish to access
    over the\n   Internet using names.\n   Outsourcing the DNS servers to a DNS infrastructure
    protects against\n   possible DDoS attacks as well as sudden renumbering of the
    home\n   network.  It has been possible to register and populate a DNS Zone\n
    \  with names since DNS became a thing, but it has been an activity\n   typically
    reserved for experts.  This document automates the process\n   through creation
    of a Homenet Naming Authority (HNA), whose\n   responsibility is to select, sign
    and publish names to a set of\n   publicly visible servers.\n\n   This document
    describes the mechanism that enables the HNA to\n   outsource the naming service
    to the DNS Outsourcing Infrastructure\n   (DOI) via a Distribution Manager (DM).\n\n
    \  In addition, this document deals with publication of a corresponding\n   reverse
    zone.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
