abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note specifies using packets' source addresses in route
    lookups\n   as additional qualifier to be used in hop-by-hop routing decisions.\n
    \  This applies to IPv6 [RFC2460] in general with specific\n   considerations
    for routing protocol left for separate documents.\n   There is nothing precluding
    similar operation in IPv4, but this is\n   not in scope of this document.\n\n
    \  Note that destination/source routing, source/destination routing,\n   SADR,
    source-specific routing, source-sensitive routing, S/D routing\n   and D/S routing
    are all used synonymously.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
