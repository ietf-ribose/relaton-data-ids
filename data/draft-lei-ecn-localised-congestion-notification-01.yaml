abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces analyzes of ECN(Explicit Congestion Notification)in
    case of congestion of local links. 3GPP adopts and specifies shared channel for
    multiple user equipments in a cell. Other last mile access systems (e.g. xDSL
    access and Frame Relay access) have to handle congestion since bandwidth multiplexing
    is most likely considered for reducing unnecessary cost. Therefore, congestion
    in access network is to inform user equipments in case of traffic congestion utilizing
    congestion notification concepts and similar mechanisms. Besides the argument
    on the congestions of access networks, this document is also to introduce the
    use case of Conex which might be useful for the potential Conex proposals to notify
    and address the congestion of wireless access network further.</p>"
