abstract:
- content: <p>This memo provides clear definitions for Active and Passive performance
    assessment. The construction of Metrics and Methods can be described as either
    "Active" or "Passive". Some methods may use a subset of both Active and Passive
    attributes, and we refer to these as "Hybrid Methods". This memo also describes
    multiple dimensions to help evaluate new methods as they emerge.</p>
