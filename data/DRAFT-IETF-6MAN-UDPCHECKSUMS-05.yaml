abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an update of the Internet Protocol version
    6\n   (IPv6) specification (RFC2460) to improve the performance of IPv6 in\n   the
    use case when a tunnel protocol uses UDP with IPv6 to tunnel\n   packets.  The
    performance improvement is obtained by relaxing the\n   IPv6 UDP checksum requirement
    for suitable tunneling protocol where\n   header information is protected on the
    \"inner\" packet being carried.\n   This relaxation removes the overhead associated
    with the computation\n   of UDP checksums on IPv6 packets used to carry tunnel
    protocols and\n   thereby improves the efficiency of the traversal of firewalls
    and\n   other network middleboxes by such protocols.  We describe how the\n   IPv6
    UDP checksum requirement can be relaxed in the situation where\n   the encapsulated
    packet itself contains a checksum, the limitations\n   and risks of this approach,
    and define restrictions on the use of\n   this relaxation to mitigate these risks.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
