abstract:
  content: "<p>A Presence service can have constraints for delivering presenceinformation
    to devices with low data processing capabilities, smalldisplay, and limited battery
    power. Other limitations can be causedby the interface between the terminal and
    the network, i.e. overradio links with high latency and low bandwidth. This memo
    presents asolution that aids in reducing the impact of those constrains and toincrease
    efficiency, by introducing a mechanism called partialnotification.</p>"
