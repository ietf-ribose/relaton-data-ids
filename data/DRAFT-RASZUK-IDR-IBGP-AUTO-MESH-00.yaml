abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The distribution of BGP routing information within an autonomous\nsystem
    requires all border routers to be fully meshed. This\nconstitutes a significant
    operational problem in terms of\nconfiguration management.\nThis has led to the
    wide-spread adoption of route reflection\n[RFC2796], primarily in order to reduce
    the number systems which\nconfiguration must be modified in order to introduce
    or remove a new\ninternal BGP speaker. Route reflection, however, implies with
    it\ninformation reduction which is not always desired.\nThis document defines
    a discovery mechanism that is designed to\naddress the problem of introducing
    (or removing) a BGP speaker into\nan iBGP mesh without implying any other behavior
    change when compared\nto manual configuration.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
