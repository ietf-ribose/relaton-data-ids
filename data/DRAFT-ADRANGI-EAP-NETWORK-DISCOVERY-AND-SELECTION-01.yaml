abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a solution for Service Network discovery
    \nand selection that could be implemented within the existing EAP \nspecification
    framework.  The purpose of Service Network discovery \nand selection here is to
    help a WLAN client using EAP for \nauthentication to decide whether or not to
    connect to a WLAN \nAccess Network, and help it select the most appropriate Mediating
    \nNetwork as a next hop for routing AAA packets in roaming \nsituations where
    the WLAN Access Network has agreements with more \nthan one Mediating Network
    affiliated with the clientâ€™s Home \nService Network. \nThe proposed solution has
    3 components: a delivery mechanism for \nconveying Access Network and Service
    Network Information to a WLAN \nclient, a data model/syntax for structuring the
    information in a \ngeneric manner, and a method by which the WLAN client can indicate
    \nits selection to the WLAN Access Network.\n\t </p>\n      "
