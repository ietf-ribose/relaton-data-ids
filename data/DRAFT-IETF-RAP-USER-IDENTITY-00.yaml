abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the representation of user identity\n
    \  information in POLICY_DATA object [POL-EXT] for supporting policy\n   based
    admission control in RSVP. The goal of identity representation\n   is to allow
    a process on a system to securely identify the owner of\n   the communicating
    process (e.g. user id) and convey this information\n   in RSVP requests (PATH
    or RESV) in a secure manner. We describe the\n   encoding of user identity as
    RSVP policy element. Subsequently, we\n   describe representations of user identities
    for Kerberos and Public\n   Key based user authentication mechanisms. In summary
    we describe the\n   use of this identity information in an operational setting.\n\n\t
