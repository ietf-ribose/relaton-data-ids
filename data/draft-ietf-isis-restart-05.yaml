abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for a restarting router to signal
    to its neighbors that it is restarting, allowing them to reestablish their adjacencies
    without cycling through the down state, while still correctly initiating database
    synchronization. This document additionally describes a mechanism for a restarting
    router to determine when it has achieved LSP database synchronization with its
    neighbors and a mechanism to optimize LSP database synchronization, while minimizing
    transient routing disruption when a router starts. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
