abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Deployment experience has demonstrated the value of using the\n
    \  Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) architecture to\n   manage
    resources other than packet forwarding.  In that spirit, the\n   Forwarding Element
    Manager (FEM) is modelled by creating a Logical\n   Functional Block (LFB) to
    represent its functionality.  We refer to\n   this LFB as the Subsidiary Mechanism
    (SM) LFB.  A Control Element\n   (CE) that controls a Forwarding Element's (FE)
    resources can also\n   manage its configuration via the SM LFB.  This document
    introduces\n   the SM LFB, an LFB that specifies the configuration parameters
    of an\n   FE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
