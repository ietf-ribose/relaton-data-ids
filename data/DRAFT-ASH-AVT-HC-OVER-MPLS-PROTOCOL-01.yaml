abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP. When MPLS\n
    \  Labels are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels. For an\n   MPLS
    VPN, the packet header is typically 48 bytes, while the voice\n   payload is often
    no more than 30 bytes, for example. Header\n   compression can significantly reduce
    the overhead through various\n   compression mechanisms.  MPLS is used to route
    header-compressed (HC)\n   packets over an MPLS LSP without compression/decompression
    cycles at\n   each router.  Such an HC over MPLS capability increases the bandwidth\n
    \  efficiency as well as processing scalability of the maximum number of\n   simultaneous
    compressed flows that use HC at each router.  MPLS\n   pseudowires are used to
    transport the HC context and other control\n   messages between the ingress and
    egress MPLS label switched router\n   (LSR), and the pseudowires define a point
    to point instance of each\n   HC session at the header decompressor.  Standard
    HC methods (e.g.,\n   ECRTP, ROHC, etc.) are re-used to determine the context.\n\t
