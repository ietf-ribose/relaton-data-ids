abstract:
  content: "<p>This document presents different deployment models of PCN-basedadmission
    control (AC) and flow termination (FT) using packet-specific dual marking (PSDM)
    for encoding. Their major is that theyrequire only a single DSCP for packet marking
    and that they workreliably in the presence of ingress-egress aggregates (IEAs)
    withonly a very small average number of flows. Moreover, an advancedmodel even
    works with multipath routing.</p>"
