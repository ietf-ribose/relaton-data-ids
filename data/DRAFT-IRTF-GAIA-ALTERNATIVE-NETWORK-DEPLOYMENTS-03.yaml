abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a taxonomy of \"Alternative Network\n
    \  Deployments\", and a set of definitions and shared properties.  It\n   also
    surveys the technologies employed in these networks, and their\n   differing architectural
    characteristics.\n\n   The term \"Alternative Network Deployments\" includes a
    set of network\n   access models that have emerged in the last decade.  These
    networks\n   aim to bring Internet connectivity to people, using topological,\n
    \  architectural and business models different from the so-called\n   \"traditional\"
    ones, where a company deploys or leases the network\n   infrastructure for connecting
    the users, who pay a subscription fee\n   to be connected and make use of it.\n\n
    \  Several initiatives throughout the world have built large scale\n   Alternative
    Networks, using predominantly wireless technologies\n   (including long distance)
    due to the reduced cost of using unlicensed\n   spectrum.  Wired technologies
    such as fiber are also used in some of\n   these alternate networks.\n\n   The
    emergence of these networks has been motivated by a variety of\n   factors such
    as the reluctance of network operators to provide wired\n   and cellular infrastructures
    to rural/remote areas.  In these cases,\n   the networks have self-sustaining
    business models that provide more\n   localized communication services as well
    as Internet backhaul support\n   through peering agreements with traditional network
    operators.  In\n   other cases, networks are built as a complement to commercial\n
    \  Internet access provided by \"traditional\" network operators.\n\n   The present
    classification considers extant network models such as\n   Community Networks,
    which are self-organized and decentralized\n   networks wholly owned by the community;
    networks owned by individuals\n   who act as Wireless Internet Service Providers
    (WISPs); networks\n   owned by individuals but leased out to network operators
    who use them\n   as a low-cost medium to reach the underserved population, and
    finally\n   there are networks that provide connectivity by sharing wireless\n
    \  resources of the users.\n\n   Different criteria are used in order to build
    a classification e.g.,\n   the ownership of the equipment, the way the network
    is organized, the\n   participatory model, the extensibility, if they are driven
    by a\n   community, a company or a local stakeholder (public or private), etc.\n\n
    \  According to the developed taxonomy, a characterization of each kind\n   of
    network is presented in terms of specific network characteristics\n   related
    to architecture, organization, etc.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
