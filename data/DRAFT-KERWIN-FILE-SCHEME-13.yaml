abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the \"file\" Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI)\n   scheme, replacing the definition in RFC 1738.\n\n   It attempts to document
    current practices, while at the same time\n   defining a common core which is
    intended to interoperate across the\n   broad spectrum of existing implementations.\n\nNote
    to Readers (To be removed by the RFC Editor)\n\n   This draft should be discussed
    on the IETF Applications Area Working\n   Group discussion list &lt;apps-discuss@ietf.org&gt;.\n\n\t
