abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a system by which an OpenPGP client
    may\n   subscribe to an organization's public keylist to keep its keystore\n   up-to-date
    with correct keys from the correct keyserver(s), even in\n   cases where the keys
    correspond to multiple (potentially\n   uncontrolled) domains.  Ensuring that
    all members or followers of an\n   organization have their colleagues' most recent
    PGP public keys is\n   critical to maintaining operational security.  Without
    the most\n   recent keys' fingerprints and a source of trust for those keys (as\n
    \  this document specifies), users must manually update and sign each\n   others'
    keys -- a system that is untenable in larger organizations.\n   This document
    proposes a experimental format for the keylist file as\n   well as requirements
    for clients who wish to implement this\n   experimental keylist subscription functionality.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
