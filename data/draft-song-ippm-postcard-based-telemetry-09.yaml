abstract:
  content: "<p>The document describes a packet-marking variation of the Postcard-
    Based Telemetry (PBT), referred to as PBT-M. Unlike the instruction- based PBT,
    as embodied in IOAM DEX, PBT-M does not require the encapsulation of a telemetry
    instruction header, so it avoids some of the implementation challenges of the
    instruction-based PBT. However, PBT-M has unique issues that need to be considered.
    This document serves as a scheme overview and provides design guidelines applicable
    to implementations in different network protocols.</p>"
