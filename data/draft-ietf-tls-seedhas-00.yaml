abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the TLSprotocol
    1.0 [TLS] to support SEED and HAS-160.The SEED algorithm is 128-bit symmetric
    block cipher algorithm.[SEED] The HAS-160 is 160-bit secure hash function, whose
    block sizeis 512 bit. [HAS] Both algorithms are developed in Korea since 1997for
    stronger communication security. Currently, SEED is widely usedand is the mandatory
    cipher in banking and stock applications inKorea.</p>"
