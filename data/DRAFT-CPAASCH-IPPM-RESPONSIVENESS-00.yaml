abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bufferbloat has been a long-standing problem on the Internet
    with\n   more than a decade of work on standardizing technical solutions,\n   implementations
    and testing.  However, to this date, bufferbloat is\n   still a very common problem
    for the end-users.  Everyone \"knows\" that\n   it is \"normal\" for a video conference
    to have problems when somebody\n   else on the same home-network is watching a
    4K movie.\n\n   The reason for this problem is not the lack of technical solutions,\n
    \  but rather a lack of awareness of the problem-space, and a lack of\n   tooling
    to accurately measure the problem.  We believe that exposing\n   the problem of
    bufferbloat to the end-user by measuring the end-\n   users' experience at a high
    level will help to create the necessary\n   awareness.\n\n   This document is
    a first attempt at specifying a measurement\n   methodology to evaluate bufferbloat
    the way common users are\n   experiencing it today, using today's most frequently
    used protocols\n   and mechanisms to accurately measure the user-experience.  We
    also\n   provide a way to express the bufferbloat as a measure of \"Round-trips\n
    \  per minute\" (RPM) to have a more intuitive way for the users to\n   understand
    the notion of bufferbloat.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
