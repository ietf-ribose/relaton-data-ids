abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Within a trust boundary, e.g. an operator's PoP, it may be
    useful to\n   have only a few central devices do full Origin Validation using
    the\n   Resource Public Key Infrastructure, and be able to signal to an\n   internal
    sender that a received route fails Origin Validation.  E.g.\n   route reflectors
    could perform Origin Validation for a cluster and\n   signal back to a sending
    client that it sent an invalid route.\n   Routers capable of sending and receiving
    this signal can use the\n   extended community described in [RFC8097]\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
