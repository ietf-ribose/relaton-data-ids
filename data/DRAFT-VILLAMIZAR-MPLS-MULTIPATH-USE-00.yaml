abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques
    and\n   many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in\n
    \  very high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core\n   networks.
    \ MPLS-TP has strongly discouraged the use of multipath\n   techniques.  Some
    degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot be\n   avoided when operating over
    many types of multipath implementations.\n\n   Using MPLS Entropy label, MPLS
    can LSP can be carried over multipath\n   links while also providing a fully MPLS-TP
    compliant server layer for\n   MPLS-TP LSP.  This document describes the means
    of supporting MPLS as\n   a server layer for MPLS-TP.  The use of MPLS-TP LSP
    as a server layer\n   for MPLS LSP is also discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
