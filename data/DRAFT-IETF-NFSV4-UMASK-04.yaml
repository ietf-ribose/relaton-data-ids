abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In many environments, inheritable NFSv4 Access Control Entries
    (ACEs)\n   can be rendered ineffective by the application of the per-process\n
    \  umask.  This can be addressed by transmitting the umask and create\n   mode
    as separate pieces of data, allowing the server to make more\n   intelligent decisions
    about the permissions to set on new files.\n   This document proposes a protocol
    extension which accomplishes that.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
