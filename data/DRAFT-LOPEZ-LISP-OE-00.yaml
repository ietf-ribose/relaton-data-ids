abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP), allows the creation
    of\n   VPNs between routing locators (RLOCs).  As LISP encapsulated packets\n
    \  are generally expected to traverse publically routed spaces, it is\n   desirable
    to encrypt the payloads of these packets, to protect them\n   from pervasive surveillance
    attacks.  This document describes a\n   methodology to encrypt LISP encapsulated
    packets, as they traverse\n   between RLOCs.\n\n   For a full description of LISP,
    please consult [RFC6830].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
