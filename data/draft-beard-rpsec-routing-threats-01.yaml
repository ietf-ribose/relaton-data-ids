abstract:
  content: "<p>Routing protocols are subject to attacks that can harm individualusers
    or the network operations as a whole. The lack of a common setof security requirements
    has led to the use in existing routingprotocol of a variety of different security
    solutions, which providevarious levels of security coverage.The RPSEC working
    group intends to deliver in a separate document aset of security requirements
    for consideration of routing protocoldesigners. The first step in developing the
    security requirements isto analyze the threats that face routing protocols. This
    documentdescribes the threats, including threat sources and capabilities,threat
    actions, and threat consequences as well as a breakdown ofrouting functions that
    might be separately attacked.</p>"
