abstract:
- content: "<p>This document builds on the GMPLS overlay model [RFC4208] and defines
    extensions to the GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) to support route diversity
    within the core network for sets of LSPs initiated by edge nodes. A particular
    example where route diversity within the core network is desired, are dual-homed
    edge nodes. The document also defines GMPLS UNI extensions to deal with latency
    requirements for edge node initiated LSPs. This document is also applicable to
    the L1VPN framework [RFC4847] to extend the L1VPN from the basic mode to the enhanced
    mode by including additional constraints, focusing upon the overlay extension
    service model. Route Diversity for customer LSPs are common requirement applicable
    to L1VPNs. This document describes L1VPN compatible mechanisms to achieve diversity
    for sets of customer LSPs. The extended overlay service model can support other
    extensions for L1VPN signaling, for example, those related to latency requirements.</p>"
