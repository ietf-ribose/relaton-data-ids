abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The operation of a prefix delegation procedure with the DHCPv6\n
    \  protocol may need route setup and maintenance at the Delegating\n   Router,
    Requesting Router and on the entity on which the Relay agent\n   is implemented.
    \ This document describes the problem of routing\n   during DHCPv6 prefix delegation,
    and is illustrated by ADSL-type and\n   cellular-type of topologies which may
    use Relays; we refer to section\n   14 of RFC 3633 which mentions the need of
    'a protocol or other out of\n   band communication to add routing information
    for delegated\n   prefixes'.  Based on this problem, a number of requirements
    from the\n   service providers are described.\n\n   A small set of documented
    solutions are separately mentioned\n   (snooping, route injection, etc.), together
    with their pros and cons\n   according to a particular judgment.\n\n\t </p>\n
