abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Tunnel is one typical service provided by carrier IP network.\n
    \  Network Tunnel service model can provide the northbound interface of\n   network-level
    tunnel service of the controller to try to simplify the\n   Tunnel provision without
    involving too much details of Tunnel\n   implementation on the device.  This document
    gives exploratory\n   description about the requirement of network-level Tunnel
    service and\n   how to define the data model which will provide the guidance for
    the\n   future definition of the concrete data model.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
