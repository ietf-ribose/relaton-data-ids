abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an information model and the corresponding YANG
    data model for monitoring Network Security Functions (NSFs) in the Interface to
    Network Security Functions (I2NSF) framework. If the monitoring of NSFs is performed
    in a comprehensive way, it is possible to detect the indication of malicious activity,
    anomalous behavior or the potential sign of denial of service attacks in a timely
    manner. This monitoring functionality is based on the monitoring information that
    is generated by NSFs. Thus, this document describes not only a YANG data diagram
    to specify an information model for monitoring NSFs, but also the corresponding
    YANG data model for monitoring NSFs.</p>"
