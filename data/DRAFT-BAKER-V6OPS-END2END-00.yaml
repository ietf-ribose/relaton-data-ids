abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note is intended to describe the end to end problem as
    it\n   applies to a network of networks, wherein some component networks\n   independently
    run only IPv4 with or without a transition mechanism,\n   some run only IPv6 with
    or without a transition mechanism and without\n   coordination of transition mechanisms,
    and some run IPv4 and IPv6 in\n   parallel supporting native routing.\n\t </p>\n
