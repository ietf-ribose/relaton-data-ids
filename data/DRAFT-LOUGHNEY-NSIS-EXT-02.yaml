abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses the Next Steps in Signaling extensibility\n
    \  model.  This model is based upon a two-layer model, where there is a\n   transport
    layer and a signaling application model.  This two-layer\n   provides the ability
    to develope new signaling applications, while\n   retaining the use of a common
    transport layer.  This document will\n   serve as guidence on how the NSIS architecture
    can be extended.\n\t </p>\n      "
