abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document explores the common properties of optional security\n
    \  protocols and extensions, and notes that due to the base-rate fallacy\n   and
    general issues with coordinated deployment of protocols under\n   uncertain incentives,
    optional security protocols have proven\n   difficult to deploy in practice.  This
    document defines the problem,\n   examines efforts to add optional security for
    routing, naming, and\n   end-to-end transport, and extracts guidelines for future
    efforts to\n   deploy optional security protocols based on successes and failures
    to\n   date.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
