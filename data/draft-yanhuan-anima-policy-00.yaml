abstract:
  content: "<p>Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of wireless\tcommunication
    technologies. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are\twilling to provide customized
    network services in a very short\ttime to their customers. However, since network
    demands are highly\tdiverse, it is difficult to design the specific network policies\tthat
    implement the required network services for each scenario. In\tthis document,
    we propose a generic network policy model for\tfuture wireless network systems
    to meet different network demands\tbased on the typical scenarios. Meanwhile,
    to automatically and\tintelligently deploy the policies defined by this model,
    we design\ta novel architecture that orchestrates the high-level policies\tinto
    the low-level rules available in the underlying networks.</p>"
