abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of wireless communication
    technologies. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are willing to provide customized
    network services in a very short time to their customers. However, since network
    demands are highly diverse, it is difficult to design the specific network policies
    that implement the required network services for each scenario. In this document,
    we propose a generic network policy model for future wireless network systems
    to meet different network demands based on the typical scenarios. Meanwhile, to
    automatically and intelligently deploy the policies defined by this model, we
    design a novel architecture that orchestrates the high-level policies into the
    low-level rules available in the underlying networks.</p>"
