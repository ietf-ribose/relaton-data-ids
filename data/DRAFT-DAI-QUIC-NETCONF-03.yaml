abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms
    to\n   install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices.\n
    \  At present, almost all implementations of NETCONF are based on TCP\n   based
    protocol. QUIC, a new UDP-based transport protocol, can\n   facilitate to improve
    the transportation performance, information\n   security and resource utility
    when being used as an infrastructure layer\n   of NETCONF. This document describes
    how to use the QUIC protocol as the\n   transport protocol of NETCONF(It is so
    called NETCONFoQUIC).\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
