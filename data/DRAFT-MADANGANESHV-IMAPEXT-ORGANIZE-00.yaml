abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The ORGANIZE extension to Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4]
    \nspecifies the mechanism by which the client can inform the server to \nmaintain
    the entries for the messages to be organized. The \norganization of messages include
    appending, moving to a mailbox, \ndeleting messages, or changing the attributes
    of received messages. \n\nThis extension enables the lightweight IMAP clients
    to organize \ntheir messages on the server side, rather than performing it on
    the \nclient side. In addition to the information on the IMAP ORGANIZE \nextension,
    this document describes implementation of the ORGANIZE \nextension for Simple
    Mail Transfer Protocol [SMTP].\n\t </p>\n      "
