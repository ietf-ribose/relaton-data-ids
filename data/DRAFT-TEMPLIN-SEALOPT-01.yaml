abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) provides
    a\n   mid-layer header designed for the encapsulation of an inner network\n   layer
    packet within outer network layer headers.  SEAL also supports\n   a transport
    mode of operation, where the inner payload corresponds to\n   an ordinary transport
    layer payload.  However, SEAL can also provide\n   benefit when used as an IPv6
    destination option that contains a\n   digital signature inserted by the source.
    \ The source can thereafter\n   use the signature to verify that any ICMPv6 messages
    received\n   actually came from a router on the path, while destinations that\n
    \  share a secret key with the source can verify the signature to ensure\n   data
    origin authentication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
