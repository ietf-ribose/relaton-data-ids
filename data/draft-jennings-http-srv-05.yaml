abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new URI scheme called http+srv which uses
    a DNS SRV lookup to locate a HTTP server. The http+srv scheme operates in the
    same way as an http scheme but instead of the normal DNS lookup that a http scheme
    would use, it first tries an DNS SRV lookup. This memo also defines a https+srv
    scheme that operates in the same was as an https URI but uses DNS SRV lookups.
    The draft is being discussed on the apps-discuss@ietf.org list.</p>"
