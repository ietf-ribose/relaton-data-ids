abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a new perspective for the solution design
    of\n   enhanced mobility anchoring in a distributed mobility management\n   deployment.
    Mobility anchor function is composed of forwarding\n   statement management and
    forwarding path management functions. In\n   this draft, enhanced mobility anchoring
    solution design is discussed\n   in the two cases: co-located forwarding state
    and path management\n   functions on the same network entity and separated forwarding
    state\n   and path management functions on different network entities.\n\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
