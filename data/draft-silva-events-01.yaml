abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extensions to iCalendar and iTIP that allow the
    expression of imprecise and multiple alternative events in calendar objects and
    scheduling messages. Imprecise events can be used to imprecisely describe an event
    by specifying various ranked periods of time in which it could be scheduled. Alternative
    events can be used to describe an event in terms of multiple ranked event descriptions,
    imprecise or not, that could alternatively be scheduled.</p>"
