abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a system by which an OpenPGP client may subscribe
    to an organization's public keylist to keep its keystore up-to-date with correct
    keys, even in cases where the keys correspond to multiple (potentially uncontrolled)
    domains. Ensuring that all members or followers of an organization have their
    colleagues' most recent PGP public keys is critical to maintaining operational
    security. Without the most recent keys' fingerprints and a source of trust for
    those keys (as this document specifies), users must manually update and sign each
    others' keys -- a system that is untenable in larger organizations. This document
    proposes a experimental format for the keylist file as well as requirements for
    clients who wish to implement this experimental keylist subscription functionality.</p>"
