abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 in order
    to\nsupport multihomed mobile nodes (MN).  These extensions are intended\nto permit
    such mobile nodes to send and receive IP packets on\nmultiple interfaces in a
    simultaneous and possibly discriminated\nmanner when attached to a PMIPv6 domain.
    \ A typical usage of these\nextensions is to perform downlink flow discrimination
    through\nmultiple interfaces based on filtering rules (i.e. dedicate one MN\ninterface
    to VOIP traffic and another MN interface to HTTP traffic).\n\nThe proposed extensions
    to PMIPv6 attempt to increment in a backward\ncompatible manner the current PMIPv6
    specification.  In addition\nthese extensions use, when possible, existing specifications
    related\nto multihoming support at IETF and conform to the problem statement\nof
    Netext Working Group.\n\t </p>\n      "
