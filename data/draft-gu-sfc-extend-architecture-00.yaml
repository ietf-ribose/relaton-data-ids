- content: "<p>An extended architecture in service function chain is provided including
    the applications to tenants, SDN controller, network function virtualized manager
    (NFVM) and the service function node. Auto-deployed self-service is provided by
    the orchestration of SDN controller and NFV manager. Besides, fundamental configurations
    and the realizations of the service function chaining are introduced with requirements
    raised. Benefitting from the Network function virtualization (NFV) and cloud technologies,
    SFC in virtual networks can bring convenient and elastic network to the customers
