abstract:
- content: "<p>As IP and LDP Fast-Reroute are increasingly deployed, the coverage
    limitations of Loop-Free Alternates are seen as a problem that requires a straightforward
    and consistent solution for IP and LDP, for unicast and multicast. This draft
    describes an architecture based on redundant backup trees where a single failure
    can cut a point-of-local-repair from the destination only on one of the pair of
    redundant trees. One innovative algorithm to compute such topologies is maximally
    disjoint backup trees. Each router can compute its next-hops for each pair of
    maximally disjoint trees rooted at each node in the IGP area with computational
    complexity similar to that required by Dijkstra. The additional state, address
    and computation requirements are believed to be significantly less than the Not-Via
    architecture requires.</p>"
