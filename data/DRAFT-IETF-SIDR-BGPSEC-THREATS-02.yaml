abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a threat model for BGP path security\n
    \  (BGPSEC).  It assumes the context established by the SIDR WG charter,\n   as
    of April 19, 2011.  The charter established two goals for the SIDR\n   work:\n\n
    \  o  Enabling an AS to verify the authorization of an origin AS to\n      originate
    a specified set of prefixes\n\n   o  Enabling an AS to verify that the AS-PATH
    represented in a route\n      matches the path travelled by the NLRI for the route\n\n
    \  The charter further mandates that SIDR build upon the Resource Public\n   Key
    Infrastructure (RPKI), the first product of the WG.  Consistent\n   with the charter,
    this threat model includes an analysis of the RPKI,\n   and focuses on the ability
    of an AS to verify the authenticity of the\n   AS path info received in a BGP
    update.\n\n   The model assumes that BGP path security is achieved through the\n
    \  application of digital signatures to AS_Path Info.  The document\n   characterizes
    classes of potential adversaries that are considered to\n   be threats, and examines
    classes of attacks that might be launched\n   against BGPSEC.  It concludes with
    brief discussion of residual\n   vulnerabilities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
