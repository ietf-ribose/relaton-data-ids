abstract:
  content: "<p>The Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVPv1) has been on the standardstrack
    within the IETF for a number of years. During that time, thelevel of vendor support
    and deployment has been relatively slow,despite the desire of many to deploy technology
    to deliver serviceswith different levels of quality of service (QoS) to their
    customers.The reasons for this are arguably well-understood and documented andare
    not the focus of this memo. This memo is proposing a (NSISTransport Layer Protocol)
    NTLP, that is a modified version of RSVPv1specified in RFC2205. Furthermore, it
    provides design guidelines andspecifications for the development of the NLTP that
    is based on amodified version of RSVPv1.</p>"
