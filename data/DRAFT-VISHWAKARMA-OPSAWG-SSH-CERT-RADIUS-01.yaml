abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A scalable and centralized mechanism is required for a certificate-\n
    \  based administrative access to multitude of virtualized and physical\n   network
    functions.  While there are mechanisms that exist today to\n   provide secure
    administrative command-line and API-based access,\n   there are certain management
    and maintenance overheads as well as\n   certain scalability challenges related
    to it.  In this draft we\n   discuss these challenges and propose a standardized,
    centralized\n   server-based mechanism to authenticate a user over an SSH session\n
    \  using its client certificate.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
