abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Historically, any DNS RR may occur for any domain name.  Recent\n
    \  additions have defined DNS leaf nodes that contain a reserved node\n   name,
    beginning with an underscore.  The underscore construct is used\n   to define
    a semantic scope for DNS records that are associated with\n   the parent domain.
    \ This specification explores the nature of this\n   DNS usage and defines the
    \"underscore names\" registry with IANA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
