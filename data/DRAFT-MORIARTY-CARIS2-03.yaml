    2\n   workshop, sponsored by the Internet Society, took place 28 February\n   and
    1 March 2019 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.  Participants\n   spanned regional,

    response researchers,\n   vendors, and participants from standards communities.
    \ This workshop\n   continued the work started at the first CARIS workshop, with
    a focus\n   for CARIS 2 scaling incident prevention and detection as the Internet\n
    \  industry moves to a stronger and a more ubiquitous deployment of\n   session
    encryption.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
