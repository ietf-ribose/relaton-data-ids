abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two reference video traffic source models for
    evaluating RMCAT candidate algorithms. The first model statistically characterizes
    the behavior of a live video encoder in response to changing requests on target
    video rate. The second model is trace- driven, and emulates the encoder output
    by scaling the pre-encoded video frame sizes from a widely used video test sequence.
    Both models are designed to strike a balance between simplicity, repeatability,
    and authenticity in modeling the interactions between a video traffic source and
    the congestion control module.</p>"
