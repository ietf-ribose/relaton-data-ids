abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an extension to the base Application-Layer\n
    \  Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol that generalizes the concept of\n   \"endpoint
    properties\", which were so far tied to IP addresses, to\n   entities defined
    by a wide set of objects.  Further, these properties\n   are presented as maps,
    similar to the network and cost maps in the\n   base ALTO protocol.  While supporting
    the endpoints and related\n   endpoint property service defined in RFC7285, the
    protocol is\n   extended in two major directions.  First, from endpoints restricted\n
    \  to IP addresses to entities covering a wider and extensible set of\n   objects;
    second, from properties on specific endpoints to entire\n   entity property maps.
    \ These extensions introduce additional features\n   allowing entities and property
    values to be specific to a given\n   information resource.  This is made possible
    by a generic and\n   flexible design of entity and property types.\n\n\t </p>\n
