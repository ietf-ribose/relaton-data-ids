abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When IPSec tunneling is used for VPN connections, transporting
    routing\nprotocols across the encrypted tunnels becomes challenging. This\ndocument
    outlines the use of GRE encapsulation in conjunction with\nIPSec transport mode
    to support transport of dynamic routing protocols\nacross an IPSec encrypted tunnel.
    Some usage scenarios are also\naddressed in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
