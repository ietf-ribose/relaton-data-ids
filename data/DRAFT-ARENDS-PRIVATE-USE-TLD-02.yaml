abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are no defined private-use namespaces in the Domain Name
    System\n   (DNS).  For a domain name to be considered private-use, it needs to\n
    \  be future-proof in that its top-level domain will never be delegated\n   from
    the root zone.  The lack of a private-use namespace has led to\n   locally configured
    namespaces with a top-level domain that is not\n   future proof.\n\n   The DNS
    needs an equivalent of the facilities provided by BCP 5 (RFC\n   1918) for private
    internets, i.e. a range of short, semantic-free\n   top-level domains that can
    be used in private internets without the\n   risk of being globally delegated
    from the root zone.\n\n   The ISO 3166 standard is used for the definition of
    eligible\n   designations for country-code top-level Domains.  This standard is\n
    \  maintained by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency.  The ISO 3166 standard\n   includes
    a set of user-assigned code elements that can be used by\n   those who need to
    add further names to their local applications.\n\n   Because of the rules set
    out by ISO in their standard, it is\n   extremely unlikely that these user-assigned
    code elements would ever\n   conflict with delegations in the root zone under
    current practices.\n   This document explicitly reserves these code elements to
    be safely\n   used as top-level domains for private DNS resolution.\n\n\t </p>\n
