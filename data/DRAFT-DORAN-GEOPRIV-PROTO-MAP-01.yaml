abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are currently several protocols developed by different\nstandards
    organizations that implement a basic design pattern where a\nclient requests location
    from a location server and the server\nresponds with location information.  This
    document defines the Common\nLocation Interoperability Framework (CLIF), a general
    data model for\nsuch protocols, and describes how some existing geolocation protocols\ncan
    be mapped into this unified model.\n\t </p>\n      "
