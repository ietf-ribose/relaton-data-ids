abstract:
- content: <p>While there are a large number of documents discussing IP and IPv6 packet
    filtering, requirements for IPv6 firewalls have never been specified in the RFC
    series. When it comes to IPv6, the more limited experience with the protocols,
    and reduced variety of products has made it rather difficult to specify what are
    reasonable features to be expected from an IPv6 firewall. This has typically been
    a problem for network operators, who typically have to produce a "Request for
    Proposal" (from scratch) that describes such features. This document specifies
    a set of requirements for IPv6 firewalls, marked as "mandatory", "recommended",
    or "optional".</p>
