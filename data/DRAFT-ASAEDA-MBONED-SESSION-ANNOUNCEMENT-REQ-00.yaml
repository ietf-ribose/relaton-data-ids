abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [3] was used to announce\n
    \  information for all available multicast sessions to the prospective\n   receiver
    in an experimental network.  It is usefull and easy to use,\n   but difficult
    to control the SAP message transmission in a wide area\n   network.  This document
    describes the several major limitations SAP\n   has and the requirement of multicast
    session announcement in the\n   global Internet.\n\t </p>\n      "
