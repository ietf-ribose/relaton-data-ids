abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to
    configure\n   a Layer 2 Provider Provisioned VPN service.\n\n   This model is
    intended to be instantiated at management system to\n   deliver the overall service.
    \ This model is not a configuration model\n   to be used directly on network elements,
    but provides an abstracted\n   view of the Layer 2 VPN service configuration components.
    \ It is up\n   to a management system to take this as an input and use specific\n
    \  configurations models to configure the different network elements to\n   deliver
    the service.  How configuration of network elements is done\n   is out of scope
    of the document.\n\n   The data model in this document includes support for point-to-point\n
    \  Virtual Private Wire Services (VPWS) and multipoint Virtual Private\n   LAN
    services (VPLS) that use Pseudowires signaled using the Label\n   Distribution
    Protocol (LDP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) as\n   described in RFC4761
    and RFC6624.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
