abstract:
  content: "\t <t>When network congestion occurs or dynamic transient burst streamtransfers
    on a bandwidth constrained network, it is easy to causebursts of consecutive packet
    loss. Video streams are very vulnerableto packet loss because of motion compensation
    predictive coding atthe decoder. In this document, we describe a method of usingselective
    transmission to decrease the effect of random drop to videostream when necessary.
    At the same time, this document describes amethod to avoid retransmission request
    due to selective transmission.</p>"
