abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP protocol ensures correct routing of packets to mobile node
    as the mobile node changes its point of attachment with the Internet. However,
    it is also required to provide proper QoS forwarding treatment to mobile node's
    packet stream at the intermediate nodes in the network, so that QoS-sensitive
    IP services can be supported over Mobile IP. This document describes requirements
    of an IP QoS mechanism for its satisfactory operation with Mobile IP.</p>"
