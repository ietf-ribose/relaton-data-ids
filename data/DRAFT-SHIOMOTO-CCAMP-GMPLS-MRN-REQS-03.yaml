abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     Most of the initial efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have
    been \n     related to environments hosting devices with a single switching \n
    \    capability. The complexity raised by the control of such data \n     planes
    is similar to that seen in classical IP/MPLS networks. \n      \n     By extending
    MPLS to support multiple switching technologies, GMPLS \n     provides a comprehensive
    framework for the control of a multi-\n     layered network of either a single
    switching technology or multiple \n     switching technologies. In GMPLS, a switching
    technology domain \n     defines a region, and a network of multiple switching
    types is \n     referenced in this document as a multi-region network (MRN). When
    \n     referring in general to a layered network, which may consist of \n     either
    a single or multiple regions, this document uses the term, \n     Multi-layer
    Network (MLN). This draft defines a framework for GMPLS \n     based multi-region/multi-layer
    networks and lists a set of \n     functional requirements. \n\t </p>\n      "
