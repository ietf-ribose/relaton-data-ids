abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The TCP protocol relies on receivers sending accurate and timely\nfeedback
    to the sender.  Currently the sender has no means to verify\nthat a receiver is
    correctly sending this feedback according to the\nprotocol.  A receiver that is
    non-compliant has the potential to\ndisrupt a sender's resource allocation, increasing
    its transmission\nrate on that connection which in turn could adversely affect
    the\nnetwork itself.  This document presents a two stage test process that\ncan
    be used to identify whether a receiver is non-compliant.  The\ntests enshrine
    the principle that one shouldn't attribute to malice\nthat which may be accidental.
    \ The first stage test causes minimum\nimpact to the receiver but raises a suspicion
    of non-compliance.  The\nsecond stage test can then be used to verify that the
    receiver is\nnon-compliant.  This specification does not modify the core TCP\nprotocol
    - the tests can either be implemented as a test suite or as\na stand-alone test
    through a simple modification to the sender\nimplementation.\n\nStatus\n\nBy submitting

    Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that\nother groups may

    from previous drafts (to be removed by the RFC Editor)\n\nFrom -01 to -02:\n\n\nA
    number of changes made following an extensive review from Alfred\n\nHoenes.  These
    were largely to better comply with the stated aims\n\nof the previous version
    but also included some tidying up of the\n\nprotocol details and a new section
    on a possible unwanted\n\ninteraction.\n\nFrom -00 to -01:\n\n\nDraft rewritten
    to emphasise testing for non-compliance.  Some\n\nchanges to protocol to remove
    possible unwanted interactions with\n\nother TCP variants.  Sections added on
    comparison of solutions and\n\nalternative uses of test.\n\t </p>\n      "
