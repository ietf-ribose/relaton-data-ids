abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies how the elliptic curve secure remote
    protocol\n   (EC-SRP) is applied to SIP authentication. SIP Client and server\n
    \  perform mutual authenticate by using the modern 'zero knowledge'\n   method
    without disclosing the password in the process. It has low\n   computation complexity
    and low bandwidth consumption due to the use\n   of elliptical curve cryptography.
    This makes it more suitable for\n   resource-constrained environments,e.g. wireless
    network. The security\n   of the scheme is based on the computational intractability
    of the\n   elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. It is resilient to various\n
    \  kinds of attacks, including off-line dictionary attacks.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
