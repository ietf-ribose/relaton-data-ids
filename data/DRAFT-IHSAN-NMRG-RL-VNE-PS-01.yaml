abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In Network virtualization (NV) technology, Virtual Network
    Embedding\n   (VNE) is an algorithm used to map a virtual network to the substrate\n
    \  network.  VNE is the core orientation of NV which has a great impact\n   on
    the performance of virtual network and resource utilization of the\n   substrate
    network.  An efficient embedding algorithm can maximize the\n   acceptance ratio
    of virtual networks to increase the revenue for\n   Internet service provider.
    \ Several works have been appeared on the\n   design of VNE solutions, however,
    it has becomes a challenging issues\n   for researchers.  To solved the VNE problem,
    we believe that\n   reinforcement learning (RL) can play a vital role to make
    the VNE\n   algorithm more intelligent and efficient.  Moreover, RL has been\n
    \  merged with deep learning techniques to develop adaptive models with\n   effective
    strategies for various complex problems.  In RL, agents can\n   learn desired
    behaviors (e.g, optimal VNE strategies), and after\n   learning and completing
    training, it can embed the virtual network to\n   the subtract network very quickly
    and efficiently.  RL can reduce the\n   complexity of the VNE algorithm, however,
    it is too difficult to\n   apply RL techniques directly to VNE problems and need
    more research\n   study.  In this document, we presenting a problem statement
    to\n   motivate the researchers toward the VNE problem using deep\n   reinforcement
    learning.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
