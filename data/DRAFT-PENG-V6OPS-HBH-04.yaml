abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the processing of the Hop-by-Hop Options\n
    \  Header (HBH) in today's routers in the aspects of standards\n   specification,
    common implementations, and default operations.  This\n   document outlines the
    reasons why the Hop-by-Hop Options Header is\n   rarely utilized in current networks.
    \ In addition, this document\n   describes how the HBH could be used as a powerful
    mechanism allowing\n   deployment and operations of new services requiring a more
    optimized\n   way to leverage network resources of an infrastructure.  The Hop-by-\n
    \  Hop Options Header is taken into consideration by several network\n   operators
    as a valuable container for carrying the information\n   facilitating the introduction
    of new services.  The desired\n   processing behavior of the HBH and the migration
    strategies towards\n   it are also suggested.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
