abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cloud services need to interoperate across cloud providers,
    service\n   vendors and private/public domains. To enable this interoperability,\n
    \  there is need for a standard protocol for exchanging service\n   information.
    This draft describes requirements for such a protocol.\n   Current cloud implementations
    expose application level APIs, which\n   are not syntactically and semantically
    compatible with each other.\n   One approach to interoperate cloud services is
    to standardize the\n   protocol while leaving the API definition implementation
    specific.\n   Standard protocols have been used widely in the Internet and can
    be\n   extended to cloud. Use of such protocols is compatible with existing\n
    \  cloud APIs, which can exchange information in a standard protocol.\n   New
    APIs may also be developed using a standard protocol. By this, it\n   would be
    possible to interoperate diverse APIs across service\n   providers, service vendors
    and service users.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
