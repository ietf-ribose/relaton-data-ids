abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes a syntax and semantics as an extension of the
    Internet Message Format (e-mail message) allowing a Sending User of an e-mail
    message to express his or her preference for how the message content is to be
    handled by the Receiving Users. For this purpose, semantics of sets of different
    character combinations ("Privicons") are described. These can syntactically be
    integrated either in the first-line of the body, in the subject line and/or in
    a dedicated header of any e-mail message. The Privicons icon set consists of six
    different icons. They will be machine-readable. The Privicons concept is partly
    borrowing its approach from the concept of emoticons. For example, to express
    that the content may be forwarded and even be published. The Sending User could
    use the Privicon "[&gt;]", which may be followed by an additional explanations,
    such as "please share".</p>
