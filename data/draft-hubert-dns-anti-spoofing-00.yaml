abstract:
- content: "<p>The current internet climate poses serious threats to the Domain Name
    System. In the interim period before the DNS protocol can be secured more fully,
    measures can be taken to make 'spoofing' a recursing nameserver can be made many
    orders of magnitude harder. This document sets out how to achieve this improved
    security.</p>"
