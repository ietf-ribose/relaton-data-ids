abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a reference path for Large-scale Measurement
    of Broadband Access Performance (LMAP) and measurement points for commonly used
    performance metrics. Other similar measurement projects may also be able to use
    the extensions described here for measurement point location. The purpose is to
    create an efficient way to describe the location of the measurement point(s) used
    to conduct a particular measurement.</p>"
