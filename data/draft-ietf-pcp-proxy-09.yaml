abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new Port Control Protocol (PCP) functional
    element: the PCP proxy. The PCP proxy relays PCP requests received from PCP clients
    to upstream PCP server(s). A typical deployment usage of this function is to help
    establish successful PCP communications for PCP clients that cannot be configured
    with the address of a PCP server located more than one hop away.</p>"
