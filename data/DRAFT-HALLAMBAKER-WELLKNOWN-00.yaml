abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Under the current system of registration, separate requests
    are\n   required to register entries for .well-known HTTP services, discovery\n
    \  via DNS mechanisms such as SRV and NAPTR and for a URI prefix.  This\n   proposal
    encourages Web Services to adopt a consistent approach to\n   configuration through
    a 'one stop' registration system whereby\n   assignment of a .well-known identifier
    automatically assigns DNS and\n   URI prefixes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
