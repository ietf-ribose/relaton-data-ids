abstract:
- content: "<p>As the group communication become more important, the special label
    should be allocated in support of group management and maintenance. The allocation
    mechanism of group label can be applied to a point-to- multipoint communication
    in MPLS networks. Currently used label is locally significant, while this special
    label should be common object within a single MPLS domain. This document specifies
    the allocation mechanism of group label in order to perform unidirectional point-to-
    multipoint communication.</p>"
