abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a mechanism to describe 3D video streams in the
    Session Description Protocol (SDP). This includes 3D video streams composed of
    multiple video views, or of a combination of views and depth maps. Several 3D
    video formats are supported, including simulcast, video-plus-depth, and frame-packing.
    A new decoding dependency, "3dd", is defined, describing the association between
    media stream belonging to a 3D video stream. In addition, a new SDP media-level
    attribute, "3dvFormat", is defined, describing the format used by media streams
    within a 3D video stream.</p>
