abstract:
- content: <p>Building on already available security formats and message transports
    (like PGP/MIME for email), pretty Easy privacy (pEp) describes protocols to automatize
    operations (key management, key discovery, private key handling including peer-to-peer
    synchronization of private keys and other user data across devices) that have
    been seen to be barriers to deployment of end-to-end secure interpersonal messaging.
    pEp also introduces "Trustwords" (instead of fingerprints) to verify communication
    peers and proposes a trust rating system to denote secure types of communications
    and signal the privacy level available on a per-user and per-message level. In
    this document, the general design choices and principles of pEp are outlined.</p>
