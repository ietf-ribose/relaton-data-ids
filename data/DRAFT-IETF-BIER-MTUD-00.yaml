abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an IGP based mechanism for discovering
    the MTU\n   of a BIER sub-domain.  This document defines extensions to OSPF and\n
    \  IS-IS, but other protocols could potentially be extended.  MTU\n   discovery
    is usually done for a given path, while this document\n   defines it for a sub-domain.
    \ This allows the computed MTU to be\n   independent of the set of receivers.
    \ Also, the MTU is independent of\n   rerouting events within the sub-domain.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
