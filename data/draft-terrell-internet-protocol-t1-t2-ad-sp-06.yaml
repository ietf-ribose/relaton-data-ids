abstract:
  content: "<p>This paper Defines the 'IPtX Protocol Specification', and provides
    avisualization of the lack of IP Address Control, a Blunder, which maybe excused
    partly because of the impossibility of Predicting theCurrent, as well as the Future
    use and growth of the Internet.However, this requires an investigation, or Analysis
    for the Currentuse of the HD-Ratio in the IPv4 and IPv6 IP Specifications. Moreover,while
    the IPv4 IP Specification, is indeed the primary focus of thisinvestigation. To
    provide a fair comparison however, this Analysisrequires, if not mandates, the
    use of the IPt1 and IPt2 specificationsas well. The reasoning here nevertheless,
    is the difference in therespective Addressing Schematics. Where by, the Addressing
    Scheme of theformer focuses primarily on the HOST IP Address (Assignment), while
    thefocus of the latter emphasizes only the Network IP Address. Nevertheless,it
    shall be concluded, the Addressing Methods used in the Schematic also affects
    the Efficiency; 'the RATIO of Total Number of Nodes that can be attached to Service
    the Global Networking Community, and the Number of available IP Addresses used
    for the Connection'.In other words, this 'Analysis is Argument', whose focus upon
    the'HD-Ratio' and the 'CIDR Notation' establishes the foundation definingthe 'INTERNET
    PROTOCOL t1 and t2 ADDRESS SPACE' for the IPt1 and IPt2Protocol Specifications.
    Which moreover, exceeds the Mandate Defining aNew IP Addressing System specified
    as the Requirements outlined inRFC1550.</p>"
