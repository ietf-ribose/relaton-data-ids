abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The DiffServ Working Group will produce PHBs (Per Hop Behaviors)\n
    \  used to provide differentiated services.  Some of these are to be\n   standardized,
    others may have widespread use and still others may\n   remain experimental.  The
    encoding of the PHB into a codepoint of\n   the DS Field will not be standardized,
    except for the legacy,\n   precedence PHBs.  Therefore a method is needed to coordinate
    the\n   use of PHBs and codepoints, even if only for the purpose of\n   discussing
    them.  This draft addresses this coordination issue.\n\t </p>\n      "
