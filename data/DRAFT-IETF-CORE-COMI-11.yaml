abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a network management interface for\n
    \  constrained devices and networks, called CoAP Management Interface\n   (CORECONF).
    \ The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is used to\n   access datastore
    and data node resources specified in YANG, or SMIv2\n   converted to YANG.  CORECONF
    uses the YANG to CBOR mapping and\n   converts YANG identifier strings to numeric
    identifiers for payload\n   size reduction.  CORECONF extends the set of YANG
    based protocols,\n   NETCONF and RESTCONF, with the capability to manage constrained\n
    \  devices and networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
