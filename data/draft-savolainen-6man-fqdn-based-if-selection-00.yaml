abstract:
- content: "<p>A multi-homed host with multiple physical and/or virtual network interfaces
    has to select which one of the network interfaces to use for a new outgoing IPv4
    or IPv6 connection. This document describes a method to select an interface by
    using destination's fully qualified domain name and DNS suffix information received
    dynamically for each network interface. The method is useful, for example, in
    split horizon DNS and walled garden scenarios, where right network interface has
    to be selected even before DNS resolution is conducted.</p>"
