abstract:
- content: "<p>An increasing diversity of Web-connected devices and software capabilities
    has created a need to deliver optimized content for each device. This specification
    defines an extensible and configurable set of HTTP request header fields, colloquially
    known as Client Hints, to address this. They are intended to be used as input
    to proactive content negotiation; just as the Accept header field allows user
    agents to indicate what formats they prefer, Client Hints allow user agents to
    indicate device and agent specific preferences.</p>"
