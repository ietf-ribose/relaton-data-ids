abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960] specifies\nSelective
    Acknowledgements (SACKs) to allow a transport layer data\nreceiver to acknowledge
    DATA chunks which arrive out-of-order.  In\nSCTP, SACK information is advisory
    because the data receiver is\npermitted to renege; that is, later discard a DATA
    chunk which\npreviously has been SACKed.  Since delivery of a SACKed out-of-order\nDATA
    chunk is not guaranteed, a copy of this DATA chunk MUST be kept\nin the data sender's
    retransmission queue until this DATA chunk is\ncumulatively acked.\n\nThis document
    specifies Non-Renegable Selective Acknowledgements (NR-\nSACKs), an extension
    to SCTP's acknowledgment mechanism.  NR-SACKs\nenable a data receiver to explicitly
    acknowledge out-of-order DATA\nchunks that have been delivered to the receiving
    application.\n(Recall that, in SCTP, out-of-order data sometimes can be delivered.)\nNR-SACKs
    also enable a data receiver to indicate any out-of-order\nDATA chunks on which
    the receiver guarantees never to renege.  As\nopposed to SACKed DATA chunks, a
    sender can consider NR-SACKed DATA\nchunks as never requiring retransmission,
    thus freeing space in the\ndata sender's retransmission queue sooner.\n\t </p>\n
