abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft provides an applicability statement for the basic cell
    \nmode encapsulation in draft-fischer [18]. \nDraft-fischer describes methods
    to carry ATM services over IP, L2TP \nor MPLS.  The PSN (e.g., MPLS) is used to
    transport ATM layer \nservices such as those defined by ITU-T as ATM transfer
    capabilities \n[17] and ATM Forum as ATM service categories [15]. The basic \nrequirement
    is to transparently transport the ATM VCC or VPC service \nrelated information
    (e.g., traffic parameters, QoS, OAM, etc.) over \nthe Pseudo Wire (PW), over the
    packet network. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
