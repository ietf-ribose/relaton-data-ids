    and Spokes\" and \"Mesh\" solutions.  Together with discussion of the softwire
    deployment scenarios, the vulnerability to security attacks is analyzed to provide
    security protection mechanisms such as authentication, integrity, and confidentiality
    to the softwire control and data packets. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t </p>\n      "
