abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    Several algorithms have been proposed to deal with the multicast
    key \nmanagement problem. An efficient multicast key management in the case of
    \nlarge dynamic group with preplanned eviction is MARKS in which one \nreceiver's
    join or preplanned leave has no side effect on other \nreceivers. However, there
    is no effective mechanism in MARKS to expel a \nmalicious member dynamically.
    An improved MARKS in which a malicious \nmember can be expelled scalablely by
    rekeying an intermediate key is \nintroduced. And a two-layer Logical Key Tree
    based on coincident leave \ntime (called TR-LKH) which is used to maintain the
    intermediate key is \nproposed here. The described approach has outstanding performance
    in \nterms of scalability, where one member's join or preplanned leave has no
    \nside effect on other members, furthermore, the number of rekeying \nmessages
    needed to expel a member depends little on the group size. \n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
