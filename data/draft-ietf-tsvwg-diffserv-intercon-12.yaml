abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a limited common set of Diffserv PHBs and codepoints
    (DSCPs) to be applied at (inter)connections of two separately administered and
    operated networks, and explains how this approach can simplify network configuration
    and operation. Many network providers operate MPLS using Treatment Aggregates
    for traffic marked with different Diffserv Per Hop Behaviors, and use MPLS for
    interconnection with other networks. This document offers a simple interconnection
    approach that may simplify operation of Diffserv for network interconnection among
    providers that use MPLS and apply the Short-Pipe tunnel mode. While motivated
    by the requirements of MPLS network operators that use Short-Pipe tunnels, this
    document is applicable to other networks, both MPLS and non-MPLS.</p>"
