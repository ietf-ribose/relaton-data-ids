abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many Internet applications allow service delegation via the DNS.\nHowever,
    in the absence of DNSSEC, these delegations are\nunauthenticated, so clients have
    to authenticate the delegate as if\nhe were the original service.  This situation
    causes several\noperational problems.  This document describes a mechanism for\nclients
    to discover and validate information that authenticates DNS-\nbased service delegations,
    without relying on the global deployment\nof DNSSEC.\n\t </p>\n      "
