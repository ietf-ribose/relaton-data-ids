abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The KINK working group is chartered to create a standards track\nprotocol
    to facilitate centralized key management for IPsec security\nassociations as defined
    in RFC 2401, as an alternative to IKE (RFC\n2409).  Participating systems will
    use the Kerberos architecture as\ndefined in RFC 1510 (and its successors) for
    key management. The goal\nof the working group is to produce a streamlined, fast,
    easily\nmanaged, and cryptographically sound protocol without requiring\npublic
    key.\nThe working group will not require changes to either IPsec (RFC\n2401),
    or Kerberos (RFC 1510).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
