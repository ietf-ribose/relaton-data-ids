abstract:
- content: "<p>Redacted documents are designed to have a single document which allows
    different individuals to view different portions of the document basd on the attributes
    of the individual. In this document, a protocol extension to the basic PLASMA
    protocol is described that allows for multiple keys, each with a different policy,
    to be used in a single electronic document for enforcement of redaction levels.
    This document is agnostic relative to the actual format of the redacted document,
    the only requirement being that the redacted document be able to carry the PLASMA
    defined lock box.</p>"
