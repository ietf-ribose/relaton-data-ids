abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes network coding as a network function.
    \ It\n   also describes how a network coding function can be virtualized and\n
    \  integrated with virtual network functions architectures.  The network\n   coding
    function is not a traditionally implemented network function\n   in dedicated
    hardware as those that have triggered network function\n   virtualization.  It
    refers to a novel network functionality that\n   generalizes classic packet-level
    end-to-end coding.  Classic packet-\n   level end-to-end coding helps in the provision
    of quality of service\n   by trading off delay and reliability.  Network coding
    goes beyond\n   that by enabling in-network optimized re-encoding, which can provide\n
    \  both throughput gains and diverse network-controlled degrees of\n   reliability.
    \ Consequently, a virtualized network coding function can\n   serve as a flow
    engineering tool over virtualized networks (e.g. over\n   network slices).\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
