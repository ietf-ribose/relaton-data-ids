abstract:
  content: "<p>This document discusses three major questions that were posed anddiscussed
    at some length at the interim meeting in San Diego, June2002:(1) Should geopriv
    facilitate the misrepresentation of locationinformation?(2) Should the geopriv
    Location Object (LO) accommodate multiplelocations as part of a single positioning
    transaction?(3) If so, should the Location Object hold multiple locations in asingle
    object, or should the multiple locations be contained inmultiple objects?In this
    paper we propose an answer to those questions.</p>"
