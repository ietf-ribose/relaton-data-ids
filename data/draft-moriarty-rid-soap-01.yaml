abstract:
- content: "<p>Documents intended to be shared among multiple constituencies must
    share a common format and transport mechanism. The Incident Object Description
    Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a common XML format for document exchange. This
    draft outlines the SOAP wrapper for all IODEF documents and extensions to facilitate
    an inter-operable and secure communication of documents. The SOAP wrapper allows
    for flexibility in the selection of a transport protocol. The transport protocols
    will be provided through existing standards and SOAP binding, such as SOAP over
    HTTP(S) and SOAP over BEEP.</p>"
