abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS has defined mechanisms for fault detection and isolation and mechanisms
    for reliably sending an echo reply in RFC 4379. Source routed MPLS LSPs are a
    technique being proposed to address new use- cases. This document describes how
    mechanisms defined for MPLS fault detection and isolation can be applied for source
    routed LSPs.</p>"
