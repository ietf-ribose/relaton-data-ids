abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC1661] provides a standardmethod
    for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-pointlinks. PPP also defines
    an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP),which can be used to negotiate authentication
    methods, as well as anEncryption Control Protocol (ECP) [RFC1968], used to negotiate
    dataencryption over PPP links, and a Compression Control Protocol (CCP)[RFC1962],
    used to negotiate compression methods. The ExtensibleAuthentication Protocol (EAP)
    [EAP] is a PPP extension that providessupport for additional authentication methods
    within PPP. The Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol [ISAKMP]combined
    with the Oakley [Oakley] key exchange protocol enables secure,mutually authenticated
    security association exchanges between twoendpoints. This document describes how
    ISAKMP provides for thesemechanisms within EAP.</p>"
