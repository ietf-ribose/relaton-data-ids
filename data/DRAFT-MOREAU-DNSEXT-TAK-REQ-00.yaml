abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     This draft attempts to fill a portion of the gap between
    DNSSEC\n     deployment expectations and the lack of DNSSEC trust anchor key\n
    \    management solutions, protocol and procedural aspects. Specific\n     requirements
    are stated at a level of abstraction that should\n     accommodate solution alternatives
    to the issues of providing trust\n     anchor keys to DNSSEC-aware resolvers,
    and rolling those keys.\n     Nonetheless, the characteristics the DNSSEC protocols
    and the DNS\n     operation contingencies do shape many of the requirements.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
