abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the use of the Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP) for group communication, including the use of UDP/IP multicast as the default
    underlying data transport. Both unsecured and secured CoAP group communication
    are specified. Security is achieved by use of the Group Object Security for Constrained
    RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE) protocol. The target application area of this
    specification is any group communication use cases that involve resource-constrained
    devices or networks that support CoAP. This document replaces RFC 7390, while
    it updates RFC 7252 and RFC 7641.</p>"
