abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Somewhat over a decade ago, the IETF responded to a series
    of\n   perceived problems with the then-IAB by restructuring the way in\n   which
    the IAB and IESG were constituted and assigning all standards-\n   approval and
    closely-related processes to the IESG.  In retrospect,\n   that decision has had
    serious downsides: among them are the\n   observations that the IESG has become
    overloaded to the point that\n   the role requires an unreasonable level of investment
    and that the\n   intertwining of managing WGs and then reviewing and approving
    their\n   products has led to confusion and the risk, and sometimes the\n   appearance,
    of inherent conflicts of interest and abuses.  This\n   document proposes to re-separate
    the \"steering\" and \"WG management\"\n   functions that were orginally the IESG's
    responsibility from the\n   \"final review and standards approval\" roles and
    respecifies the\n   standards approval process in that context.\n\n   The general
    concepts outlined in this document have been discussed\n   informally in the community
    for some time.  This document is provided\n   as a specific proposal to facilitate
    a focused discussion.\n\t </p>\n      "
