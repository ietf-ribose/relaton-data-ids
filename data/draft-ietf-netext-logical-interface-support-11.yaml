abstract:
- content: "<p>A Logical-interface is a software semantic internal to the host operating
    system. This semantic is available in all popular operating systems and is used
    in various protocol implementations. The Logical-interface support is required
    on the mobile node attached to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, for leveraging various
    network-based mobility management features such as inter-technology handoffs,
    multihoming and flow mobility support. This document explains the operational
    details of Logical-interface construct and the specifics on how the link-layer
    implementations hide the physical interfaces from the IP stack and from the network
    nodes on the attached access networks. Furthermore, this document identifies the
    applicability of this approach to various link-layer technologies and analyzes
    the issues around it when used in conjunction with various mobility management
    features.</p>"
