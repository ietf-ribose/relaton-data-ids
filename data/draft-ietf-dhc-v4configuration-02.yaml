abstract:
- content: "<p>As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, some service providers are taking
    the approach of deploying IPv6 only networks, without dual- stack functionality
    for IPv4. However, access to IPv4 based services is still an ongoing requirement
    and approaches such as IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire tunnels are being developed to meet
    this need. In order to provision end-user's hosts with the necessary IPv4 configuration,
    a number of different mechanisms have been proposed. This memo discusses the benefits
    and drawbacks of each, with the aim of recommending a single approach as the basis
    for future work.</p>"
