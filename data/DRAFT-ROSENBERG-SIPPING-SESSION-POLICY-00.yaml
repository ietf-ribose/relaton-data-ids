abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) was designed to support\nestablishment
    and maintenance of end-to-end sessions. Proxy servers\nprovide call routing, authentication
    and authorization, mobility, and\nother signaling services that are independent
    of the session.\nEffectively, proxies provide signaling policy enforcement. However,\nnumerous
    scenarios have arisen which require the involvement of\nproxies in some aspect
    of the session policy. SIP has no support for\nsuch capabilities, as the community
    has generally considering\ninvolvement of proxies in session details 'evil'. Practical\nimplementations
    have therefore resorted to non-standard manipulation\nof SDP messages in order
    to enforce session policy. These\nimplementations are fragile and frought with
    problems. In this\ndocument, we discuss a middle-ground approach which permits
    proxies\nlimited involvement in session policy, but retains the robustness\nthat
    derives from the current prohibition on SDP manipulation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
