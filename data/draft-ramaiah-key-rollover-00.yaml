abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes mechanisms to achieve Key rollover for TCP
    connections that are using the TCP MD5 digest as described in RFC 2385. The mechanisms
    presented here do not require TCP protocol changes. The mechanisms are not just
    limited to TCP MD5 digest Key rollover but can be used for any shared Key based
    TCP security option.</p>"
