abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a mechanism
    to load-\n   balance traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).  An ingress Label\n
    \  Switching Router (LSR) cannot insert ELs for packets going into a\n   given
    tunnel unless an egress LSR has indicated via signaling that it\n   has the capability
    to process ELs, referred to as Entropy Label\n   Capability (ELC), on that tunnel.
    \ In addition, it would be useful\n   for ingress LSRs to know each LSR's capability
    of reading the maximum\n   label stack depth and performing EL-based load-balancing,
    referred to\n   as Entropy Readable Label Depth (ERLD).  This document defines
    a\n   mechanism to signal these two capabilities using OSPF and OSPFv3.\n   These
    mechanism is particularly useful in the environment where\n   Segment Routing
    (SR) is used, where label advertisements are done via\n   protocols like OSPF
    and OSPFv3.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
