abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IEEE 802.1 has developed standards as part of its Data Center\n
    \  Bridging (DCB) activity to (1) efficiently minimize data loss due to\n   queue
    overflow for selected classes of traffic within Local Area\n   Networks (LANs)
    meeting certain conditions and (2) provide means to\n   allocate the available
    bandwidth on links to different classes of\n   traffic. These standards are now
    in IEEE Std 802.1Qbb-2011, IEEE Std\n   802.1Qaz-2011, and the Congestion Notificaiton
    freature in IEEE Std\n   802.1Q-2011.\n\n   This document briefly explains these
    standards and discusses the\n   support of these IEEE 802 standards in TRILL switches
    (devices that\n   implement the IETF TRILL protocol standard).\n\n\n\t </p>\n
