abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an architecture that allows clients to\n
    \  dynamically discover designated resolvers that offer encrypted DNS\n   services,
    and use them in an adaptive way that improves privacy while\n   co-existing with
    locally provisioned resolvers.  These resolvers can\n   be used directly when
    looking up names for which they are designated.\n   These resolvers also provide
    the ability to proxy encrypted queries,\n   thus hiding the identity of the client
    requesting resolution.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
