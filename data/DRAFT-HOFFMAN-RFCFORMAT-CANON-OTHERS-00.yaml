abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a modernized text-based canonical format
    for\n   RFCs that explicitly allows external art as a normative part of the\n
    \  RFC.  If the RFC Editor chooses this format, they will also publish\n   non-canonical
    versions of RFCs in order to accomodate the largest\n   target audience of readers.
    \ Having a simple, stable canonical format\n   and a varying number of non-canonical
    formats that can change over\n   time allows the RFC Editor to add useful formats,
    particularly in\n   HTML, that can keep up with the needs of all RFC readers.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
