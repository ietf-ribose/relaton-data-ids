abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This paper, opening with the historical that documents the
    source\n   of the Binary Enumeration Error, utilizes the proof of 'Fermat's\n
    \  Last Theorem' (Normative References - [1], [2] and [3]), the\n   Mathematics
    of Quantification, and the Logic of Set Theory, to\n   prove that the Binary System
    represents a 'Closed and Finite'\n   Alternate Mathematical Field. That is, using
    the Elementary Laws\n   of Algebra, with the Basic Principles from Analytic Geometry,\n
    \  provides the final clarification simplifying the proof for the\n   correction
    of the Counting Errors and the Logical Foundation for\n   the New Binary System.
    And more importantly, this also establishes\n   the basic foundational principles
    for 3 State Ternary Logic. In\n   other words, using an askew, or mathematically
    incorrect Binary\n   System, defined as the misinterpretation of ZERO, sustains
    the\n   Counting Error (an Accumulating Propagation) levying a substantial\n   loss
    of IP Addresses in the IPv4 IP Specification, affecting as\n   well the Address
    Pool Total for the IPv6 Specification. Hence,\n   from the foregoing foundation
    an unquestionable proof concludes;\n   the Elementary Mathematical 'Resolution
    of the Counting Error in\n   the Binary Systemâ€™ &amp; the 'Fall of Differential
    Calculus' -\n   [4. IANA Considerations].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
