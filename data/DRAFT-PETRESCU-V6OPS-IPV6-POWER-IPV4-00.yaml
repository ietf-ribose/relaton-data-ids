abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft documents preliminary results of measuring the power\n
    \  consumption of using IPv6 vs using IPv4 on typical applications on a\n   smartphone.
    \ The smartphone is connected on a 4G cellular network\n   with either an IPv6
    connection, or with an IPv4 connection, but not\n   both simultaneously.\n\n   The
    preliminary results expose a roughly 5% increase in power\n   consumption on IPv6.
    \ More experiments are planned as future work\n   that may confirm or infirm these
    figures.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
