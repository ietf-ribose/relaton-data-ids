abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When split-horizon DNS is deployed by a network, certain domains
    are\n   only resolvable by querying the network-designated DNS server.  DNS\n
    \  clients which use DNS servers not provided by the network need to\n   route
    those DNS domain queries to the network-designated DNS server.\n   This document
    informs DNS clients of split-horizon DNS, their DNS\n   domains, and is compatible
    with encrypted DNS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
