abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides\n   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n
    \  computation in response to a Path Computation Client (PCC) request.\n   The
    Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multi-Protocol\n   Label Switching
    (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs) using PCEP.\n\n
    \  A Path Computation Client (PCC) can synchronize an LSP state\n   information
    to a Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE).  The\n   stateful PCE extension
    allows a redundancy scenario where a PCC can\n   have redundant PCEP sessions
    towards multiple PCEs.  In such a case,\n   a PCC gives control of a LSP to only
    a single PCE, and only one PCE\n   is responsible for path computation for this
    delegated LSP.\n\n   There are some use cases, where an inter-PCE stateful communication\n
    \  can bring additional resiliency in the design, for instance when some\n   PCC-PCE
    session fails.  The inter-PCE stateful communication may also\n   provide a faster
    update of the LSP states when such an event occurs.\n   Finally, when, in a redundant
    PCE scenario, there is a need to\n   compute a set of paths that are part of a
    group (so there is a\n   dependency between the paths), there may be some cases
    where the\n   computation of all paths in the group is not handled by the same
    PCE:\n   this situation is called a split-brain.  This split-brain scenario\n
    \  may lead to computation loops between PCEs or suboptimal path\n   computation.\n\n
    \  This document describes the procedures to allow a stateful\n   communication
    between PCEs for various use-cases and also the\n   procedures to prevent computations
    loops.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
