abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Opportunistic Wireless Encryption, defined in RFC 8110, specifies
    an\n   extension to the IEEE Std 802.11 to provide for opportunistic\n   (unauthenticated)
    encryption to a specific wireless access point\n   (AP).  This memo extends the
    method to allow the establishment of OWE\n   keying material to other APs before
    connection establishment to these\n   APs, thus enabling a fast transition mode
    for OWE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
