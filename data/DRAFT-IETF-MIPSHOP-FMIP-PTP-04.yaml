abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers specification currently does not\n
    \  explicitly define prefix management over point-to-point links when a\n   mobile
    node uses a prefix to formulate a new care-of-address.  In\n   this document a
    mechanism is developed for a previous access router\n   to request unique prefixes
    from a new access router, and in turn, the\n   previous access router advertises
    the prefixes to the mobile node for\n   a new care-of-address configuration.  Extensions
    to Mobile IPv6 Fast\n   Handovers specification are also specified in this document.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
