abstract:
- content: <p>This document updates RFC6265 by defining a "First-Party-Only" attribute
    which allows servers to assert that a cookie ought to be sent only in a "first-party"
    context. This assertion allows user agents to mitigate the risk of cross-site
    request forgery attacks, and other related paths to cross-origin information leakage.</p>
