abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the dynamic allocation of shared IPv4 addresses
    to clients using the DHCPv4 protocol. Address sharing allows a single IPv4 address
    to be allocated to multiple, active clients simultaneously, each client being
    differentiated by a unique set of L4 source ports. The changes necessary to existing
    DHCPv4 client and server behaviour are described and a new DHCPv4 option for provisioning
    clients with shared IPv4 addresses is included. Due to the nature of sharing IP
    addresses, there are necessarily some limitations to the applicability. This memo
    describes those limitations and recommends suitable architectures and technologies
    where address sharing may be utilized.</p>"
