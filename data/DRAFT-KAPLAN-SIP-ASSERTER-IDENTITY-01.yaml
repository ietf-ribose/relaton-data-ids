abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes private extensions to the Session \nInitiation
    Protocol (SIP) that enable a network of trusted SIP \nservers to identify the
    asserter of private user identity defined \nin RFC 3325.  The use of these extensions
    is only applicable \ninside a set of administrative domains with previously agreed-upon
    \npolicies for generation, transport and usage of such information.  \nThis document
    does NOT offer a general identity model suitable for \nuse between different trust
    domains, or use in the Internet at \nlarge.\n\t </p>\n      "
