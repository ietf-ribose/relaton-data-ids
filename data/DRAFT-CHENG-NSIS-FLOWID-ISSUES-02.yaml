abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In current NSIS signaling, there are two main functions depending
    on\n   Flow ID, i.e. signaling message routing, data packet classification.\n
    \  Specifically, the same information carried by the MRI is also used to\n   derive
    the packet classification at NSLP layer.  This arrangement\n   assumes that identical
    information is required by the two functions\n   at two different layers, and
    thus has limitations.  With the\n   introduction of NSIS applications in more
    complicated scenarios, such\n   assumption can no longer hold.  Therefore, keeping
    the dependency\n   between the two functions hinders the development of NSIS.
    \ Efforts\n   have been made in different NSLP layer applications to extend the\n
    \  relationship, e.g.  QoS NSLP.  This draft studied the possibility of\n   disjoining
    the information for the two functions.  Problems faced by\n   the current system
    and different remedy options are discussed.  With\n   these details, it is intended
    to help the reader to evaluate the\n   feasibility of redefining the packet classification
    information\n   signaling in NSIS.\n\t </p>\n      "
