abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes MASQUE Obfuscation.  MASQUE Obfuscation
    is a\n   mechanism that allows co-locating and obfuscating networking\n   applications
    behind an HTTPS web server.  The currently prevalent\n   use-case is to allow
    running a proxy or VPN server that is\n   indistinguishable from an HTTPS server
    to any unauthenticated\n   observer.  We do not expect major providers and CDNs
    to deploy this\n   behind their main TLS certificate, as they are not willing
    to take\n   the risk of getting blocked, as shown when domain fronting was\n   blocked.
    \ An expected use would be for individuals to enable this\n   behind their personal
    websites via easy to configure open-source\n   software.\n\n   This document is
    a straw-man proposal.  It does not contain enough\n   details to implement the
    protocol, and is currently intended to spark\n   discussions on the approach it
    is taking.  Discussion of this work is\n   encouraged to happen on the MASQUE
    IETF mailing list masque@ietf.org\n   or on the GitHub repository which contains
    the draft:\n   https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
