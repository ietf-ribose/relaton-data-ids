abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The proposed 3GPP's 5G core nextgen architecture (5GC) offers\n
    \  flexibility to introduce new user and control plane function,\n   considering
    the support for network slicing functions, that allows\n   greater flexibility
    to handle heterogeneous devices and applications.\n   In this draft, we provide
    a short description of the proposed 5GC\n   architecture, including recent efforts
    to provide cellular Local Area\n   Network (LAN) connectivity, followed by extensions
    to 5GC's control\n   and user plane to support Packet Data Unit (PDU) sessions
    from\n   Information-Centric Networks (ICN).  In addition, ICN over 5GLAN is\n
    \  also described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
