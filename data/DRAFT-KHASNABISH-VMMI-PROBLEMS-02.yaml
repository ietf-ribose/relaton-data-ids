abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this draft, we discuss the challenges and requirements related
    to\n   migration, mobility, and interconnection of Virtual Machines (VMs)and\n
    \  Virtual Network Elements (VNEs).  VM migration scheme across IP\n   subnets
    is needed to implement virtual computing resources sharing\n   across multiple
    network administrative domains.  For the seamless\n   online migration in various
    scenarios, many problems are needed to be\n   resolved on the control plane.  The
    VM migration process should be\n   adapted to these aspects.  We also describe
    the limitations of\n   various types of virtual local area networking (VLAN) and
    virtual\n   private networking (VPN) techniques that are traditionally expected\n
    \  to support such migration, mobility, and interconnections.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
