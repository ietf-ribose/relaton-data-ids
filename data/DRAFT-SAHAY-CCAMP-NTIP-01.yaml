abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes the transport network interface protocol
    (NTIP) \nfor photonic cross connects (PXC). NTIP is implemented between a PXC
    \nand transport network element (TNEs), also known as line systems. \nNTIP is
    a protocol that uses TCP/IP for the transport of information \nrelated to defect
    notification, trace monitoring, adjacency \ndiscovery, and diagnostic messages
    between directly attached PXC and \nTNE. The use of TCP as the transport protocol
    ensures reliable and \nin-sequence delivery of NTIP messages.\n\t </p>\n      "
