abstract:
- content: "<p>The CAPWAP protocol supports two modes of operation: Split and Local
    MAC (medium access control), which has been described in [RFC5415].There are many
    functions in IEEE 802l.11 MAC layer that have not yet been clearly defined whether
    they belong to either the WTP (Wireless Termination Points) or the AC (Access
    Controller)in the Split and Local modes. Because different vendors have their
    own definition of these two models, depending upon the vendor many MAC layer functions
    continue to be mapped differently to either the WTP or AC. If there is no clear
    definition of split MAC and local MAC, then operators will not only need to perform
    vendor specific configurations in their network but will continue to experience
    difficulty in interoperating WTPs and ACs from different vendors.</p>"
