abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides the method that autonomously and dynamically
    schedules TSCH slotframe based on the current traffic load. In the introduction
    part, we introduce some basic knowledge on TSCH and RPL. After this, we introduce
    some existing TSCH schedulers and their limitations. They are classified as centralized,
    distributed, and autonomous. Then, we propose a novel autonomous and dynamic TSCH
    cell scheduler. With this, each node schedules its own TSCH slotframe and allocates
    additional cells based on the current traffic load without any negotiation or
    traffic overhead. Since they allocate additional cells only when needed, energy
    efficient operation can be achieved simultaneously.</p>"
