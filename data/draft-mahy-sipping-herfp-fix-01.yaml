abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The SIP protocol defines a role for proxy servers which can forwardrequests
    to multiple contacts associated with a specific resource orperson. While each
    of these contacts is expected to send a responseof some kind, responses for each
    branch are not necessarily sent backto the original requester. The proxy server
    forwards only the \"best\"final response back to the original request. This behavior
    causes asituation known as the Herterogeneous Error Response Forking Problem(HERFP)
    in which the original requester has no opportunity to see orfix a variety of potentially
    repairable errors. This documentdescribes a backwards compatible solution to the
    HERFP problem forINVITE transactions.</p>"
