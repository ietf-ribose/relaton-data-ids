abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Opportunistic SMTP TLS does not enforce electronic mail delivery\n
    \  using TLS leading to potential loss of privacy and security.  We\n   propose
    an optional mail header extension \"mandatory-secure-mail-\n   delivery:\" and
    SMTP EHLO response extension \"MSMD\" that indicates\n   mail must be delivered
    privately using TLS and with integrity using\n   DKIM, and thereby provide a security
    guarantee to the user.  When\n   mail is sent with the header indicating privacy
    and integrity and if\n   the receiving party does not support this, the mail is
    instead\n   bounced.  To protect the mail after delivery, the destination SMTP\n
    \  server must advertise its capabilities as part of the EHLO response,\n   and
    the sender can choose whether the destination is able to honor\n   the privacy
    requirements specified on the mail header.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
