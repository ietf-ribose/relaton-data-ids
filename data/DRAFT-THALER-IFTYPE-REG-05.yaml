abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The registration and use of interface types (\"ifType\" values)\n
    \  predated the use of IANA Considerations sections and YANG modules,\n   and
    so confusion has arisen about the interface type allocation\n   process.  Tunnel
    types were then added later, with the same\n   requirements and allocation policy
    as interface types.  This document\n   updates RFC 2863, and provides updated
    guidelines for the definition\n   of new interface types and tunnel types, for
    consideration by those\n   who are defining, registering, or evaluating those
    definitions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
