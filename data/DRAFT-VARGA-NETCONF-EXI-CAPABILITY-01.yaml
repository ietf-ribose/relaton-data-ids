abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms
    to\n   install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices\n
    \  via exchange of XML messages in textual representation.  Efficient\n   XML
    Interchange (EXI) is a W3C-recommended binary representation of\n   XML Information
    Set, which is more efficient from both CPU and\n   bandwidth utilization perspective.
    \ This document defines a\n   capability-based extension to the NETCONF protocol
    that allows peers\n   to agree to exchange protocol messages using EXI encoding.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
