abstract:
- content: "<p>National policy defines telephone numbering governance. One area of
    such governance are the policies applied to the Secure Telephone Identity Credentials
    defined in RFC 8226. Nations have policies for the acceptable trust anchors for
    these credentials. This document defines an IANA registry that enables a SIP call
    recipient in one country to validate the signature, as defined in RFC 8224, that
    originates in another country useing an appropriate trust anchor for the signer's
    certification path, per the origination country's trust anchor policy.</p>"
