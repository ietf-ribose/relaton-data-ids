abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Many operators may deploy network infrastructures that useunidirectional
    links such as broadcast satellite links or digital TVlinks (...), which are capable
    of carrying IP traffic. In order totransparently integrate these links in their
    infrastructure, they mayuse a link-layer tunnelling mechanism such as defined
    in [RFC3077].The purpose of this document is to attempt to identify any potentialsecurity
    implications related to this mechanism in order to helpoperators set up adequate
    securing mechanisms.</p>"
