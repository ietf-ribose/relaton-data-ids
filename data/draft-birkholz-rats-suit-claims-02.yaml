abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) architecture defines
    Conceptual Messages as input and output of the appraisal process that assesses
    the trustworthiness of remote peers: Evidence and Attestation Results. Based on
    the Trustworthiness Vectors defined in Trusted Path Routing, this document defines
    a core set of Claims to be used in Evidence and Attestation Results for the Software
    Update for the Internet of Things (SUIT) Workflow Model. Consecutively, this document
    is in support of the Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning (TEEP) architecture,
    which defines the assessment of remote peers via RATS and uses SUIT for evidence
    generation as well as a remediation measure to improve trustworthiness of given
    remote peers.</p>"
