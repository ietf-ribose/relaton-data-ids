abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an ESP encapsulation for IPsec, allowing\n
    \  intermediate devices to ascertain if ESP-NULL is being employed and\n   hence
    inspect the IPsec packets for network monitoring and access\n   control functions.
    \ Currently in the IPsec standard, there is no way\n   to differentiate between
    ESP encryption and ESP NULL encryption by\n   simply examining a packet.\n\t </p>\n
