abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath TCP has shown how a reliable transport protocol can\n
    \  efficiently use multiple paths for a given connection.  We leverage\n   the
    experience gained with Multipath TCP to propose simple extensions\n   that enable
    QUIC to efficiently use multiple paths during the\n   lifetime of a QUIC connection.\n\n\t
