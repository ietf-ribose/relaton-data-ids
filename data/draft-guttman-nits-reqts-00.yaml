abstract:
- content: "<p>Networks in the Small (NITS) are a particular class of networks. These
    networks may be established in the home, in small offices or even on an impromptu
    basis. NITS networks typically do not have and should not be expected to have
    network infrastructure such as DHCP servers, DNS and the like. These networks
    may have only occasional connectivity to larger networks where these services
    exist.</p>"
