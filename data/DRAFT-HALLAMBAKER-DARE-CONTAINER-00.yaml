abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes DARE Container, a message and file
    syntax\n   that allows a sequence of data frames to be represented with\n   cryptographic
    integrity, signature and encryption enhancements to be\n   constructed in an append
    only format.  The format supports data\n   integrity checks using digest chains
    and Merkle trees.  The simplest\n   supports efficient append only write operations
    and efficient read\n   operations in either the forward or reverse direction.
    \ Support for\n   efficient random-access reads may be provided through the use
    of\n   binary trees or index records appended to the end of the file.\n\n   This
    document is also available online at\n   http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-dare-container.html\n
