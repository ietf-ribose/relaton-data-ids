abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Virtualization Overlay networks using Ethernet VPN (EVPN) as
    control plane may use Ingress Replication or PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)-based
    trees to convey the overlay Broadcast, Unknown unicast and Multicast (BUM) traffic.
    PIM provides an efficient solution to avoid sending multiple copies of the same
    packet over the same physical link, however it may not always be deployed in the
    Network Virtualization Overlay core network. Ingress Replication avoids the dependency
    on PIM in the Network Virtualization Overlay network core. While Ingress Replication
    provides a simple multicast transport, some Network Virtualization Overlay networks
    with demanding multicast applications require a more efficient solution without
    PIM in the core. This document describes a solution to optimize the efficiency
    of Ingress Replication trees.</p>"
