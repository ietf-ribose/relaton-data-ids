abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes an experimental Proportional Rate Reduction
    (PRR) algorithm as an alternative to the widely deployed Fast Recovery and Rate-Halving
    algorithms. These algorithms determine the amount of data sent by TCP during loss
    recovery. PRR minimizes excess window adjustments, and the actual window size
    at the end of recovery will be as close as possible to the ssthresh, as determined
    by the congestion control algorithm.</p>"
