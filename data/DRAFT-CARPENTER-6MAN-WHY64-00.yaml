abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IPv6 unicast addressing format includes a separation between
    the\n   prefix used to route packets to a subnet and the interface identifier\n
    \  used to specify a given interface connected to that subnet.\n   Historically
    the interface identifier has been defined as 64 bits\n   long, leaving 64 bits
    for the prefix.  This document discusses the\n   reasons for this fixed boundary
    and the issues involved in treating\n   it as a variable boundary.\n\n\t </p>\n
