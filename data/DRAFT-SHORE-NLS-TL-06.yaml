abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The RSVP model for communicating requests to network devices along
    a\ndatapath has proven useful for a variety of applications beyond what\nthe protocol
    designers envisioned, and while the architectural model\ngeneralizes well the
    protocol itself has a number of features that\nlimit its applicability to applications
    other than IntServ.  Network\nLayer Signaling uses the RSVP on-path communication
    model and\nprovides a lightweight transport layer for non-QoS signaling\napplications,
    such as discovery or diagnostics.  It is based on a\n\"two-layer\" architecture
    that divides protocol function into\ntransport and application.  This document
    describes the transport\nprotocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
