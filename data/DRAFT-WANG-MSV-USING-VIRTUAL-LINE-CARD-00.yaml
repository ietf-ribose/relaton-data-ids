abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are many example procedures in our mind which can benefit
    from\n   the service virtualization and the service pooling.  Therefore, we\n
    \  come up with this idea of multi-service virtualization, not only\n   supports
    service resource pooling to realize intelligent resource\n   sharing, but also
    makes the service much more flexible and reliable.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
