abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF Standards Track solution for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
    Linear Protection is provided in RFCs 6378, 7271, and 7324.\n\n This document
    describes the pre-standard implementation of MPLS-TP Linear Protection that has
    been deployed by several network operators using equipment from multiple vendors.
    At the time of publication, these pre-standard implementations were still in operation
    carrying live traffic.\n\n The specified mechanism supports 1+1 unidirectional/bidirectional
    protection switching and 1:1 bidirectional protection switching. It is purely
    supported by the MPLS-TP data plane and can work without any control plane.\n\t
