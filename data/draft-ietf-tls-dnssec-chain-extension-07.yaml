abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a new TLS extension for transport of a DNS record
    set serialized with the DNSSEC signatures needed to authenticate that record set.
    The intent of this proposal is to allow TLS clients to perform DANE authentication
    of a TLS server without needing to perform additional DNS record lookups. It is
    not intended to be used to validate the TLS server's address records.</p>"
