abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document reviews the certificate validation procedure
    specified\n   in RFC6487 and highlights aspects of operational management of\n
    \  certificates in the RPKI in response to the movement of resources\n   across
    registries, and the associated actions of Certification\n   Authorities to maintain
    certification of resources during this\n   movement.  The document describes an
    alternative validation procedure\n   that reduces the operational impact of certificate
    management during\n   resource movement.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
