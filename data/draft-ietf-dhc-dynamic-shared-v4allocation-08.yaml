abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the dynamic allocation of shared IPv4 addresses
    to clients using DHCPv4. Address sharing allows a single IPv4 address to be allocated
    to multiple active clients simultaneously, each client being differentiated by
    a unique set of transport layer source port numbers. The necessary changes to
    existing DHCPv4 client and server behavior are described and a new DHCPv4 option
    for provisioning clients with shared IPv4 addresses is included. Due to the nature
    of IP address sharing, some limitations to its applicability are necessary. This
    memo describes these limitations and recommends suitable architectures and technologies
    where address sharing may be utilized.</p>"
