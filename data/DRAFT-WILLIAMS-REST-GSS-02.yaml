abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an application-layer authentication
    protocol\n   in Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) applications using Generic\n
    \  Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-API)\n   mechanisms.
    \ The GSS-API is used, for simplicity, via the Simple\n   Authentication and Security
    Layers (SASL) mechanism bridge known as\n   \"GS2\".  This approach to authentication
    allows for simplicity,\n   pluggability, mutual authentication, and channel binding,
    all with no\n   changes to any vbe ersion of HTTP nor the Transport Layer Security\n
    \  (TLS).\n\n   Although this is an application-layer protocol, we hope that it
    will\n   be implemented in HTTP stacks for ease of use.  That is, this\n   protocol
    should be implemented at the HTTP application programming\n   interface (API)
    layer wherever possible even though it is an\n   application-layer protocol.  We
    hope that the use of authentication\n   at the application layer will make REST-GSS
    deployable.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
