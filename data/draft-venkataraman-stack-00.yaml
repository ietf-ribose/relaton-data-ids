abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Any operating protocol functions on the basis of a communicationstack.
    While a layered approach towards a comprehensive stackdevelopment amends itself
    very well to division of labour andabstraction of problems, care must be taken
    to ensure that layersare so designed that they leverage benefits of using one
    another.In other words, layers should be so designed such that they arehighly
    optimised for usage with one another. An essential feature of pervasive computing
    will be Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs).The two primary constraints to system
    design in MANETs are bandwidthand energy. We bring out the essential properties
    of layers in any general stack which make it highly efficient and practicable.
    We call this a “stack aware” architecture. We go on to exemplify this with the
    case of “helper nodes” in a MANET topology, and discuss the potentialbenefits
    of having them as a necessary ingredient for routing. We alsobring out their significance
    in every layer of the integrated stack,using the OSI layers as a reference model.</p>"
