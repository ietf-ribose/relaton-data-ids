abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo specifies the base architecture for IPsec compliant\n
    \  systems.  The goal of the architecture is to provide various security\n   services
    for traffic at the IP layer, in both the IPv4 and IPv6\n   environments.  This
    document describes the goals of such systems,\n   their components and how they
    fit together with each other and into\n   the IP environment.  It also describes
    the security services offered\n   by the IPsec protocols, and how these services
    can be employed in the\n   IP environment.  This document does not address all
    aspects of IPsec\n   architecture.  Subsequent documents will address additional\n
    \  architectural details of a more advanced nature, e.g., use of IPsec\n   in
    NAT environments and more complete support for IP multicast.  The\n   following
    fundamental components of the IPsec security architecture\n   are discussed in
    terms of their underlying, required functionality.\n   Additional RFCs (see Section
    1.3 for pointers to other documents)\n   define the protocols in (a), (c), and
    (d).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
