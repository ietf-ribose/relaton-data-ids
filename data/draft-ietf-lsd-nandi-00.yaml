abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There are existing communities of LDAP, X.500 and Whois++ serverson
    the Internet. An LDAPv3 server can be a part of one of more ofthese communities.
    LDAP directory services would benefit fromreduced naming conflicts and increased
    ability to locate serversand information both within LDAP islands and between
    LDAP andother communities. This document recommends guidelines for namingand interconnection
    of LDAP servers to enable the existence ofcommunities of a loosely coupled LDAP-based
    directory service thatcan leverage the X.500 knowledge model and the existinginfrastructure
    of names from the Domain Name System (DNS). Thiswill facilitate the establishment
    of a global naming plan and theinterconnection of a global directory.</p>"
