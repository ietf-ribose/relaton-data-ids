abstract:
- content: "<p>The more and more complicated ISP networks are required a new interaction
    mechanism between their customers and their networks. A flexible Network Abstract
    Interface (NAI) is needed to provide abstracted network information and capability
    to network customers and receive customized orders from them. This document introduces
    an architecture that allows network administrators to create their specific Network
    Abstract Interface.</p>"
