abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP clients rarely make use of the Date header field when making requests.
    This document describes considerations for using the Date header field in requests.
    A method is described for correcting erroneous in Date request header fields that
    might arise from differences in client and server clocks. The risks of applying
    that correction technique are discussed.</p>"
