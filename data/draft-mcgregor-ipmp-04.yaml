abstract:
- content: "<p>The practice and need for active network measurement is well established,
    however current tools are not well suited to this task, mostly because the protocols
    which they employ have not been designed for measurement of the modern Internet.
    The IP Measurement Protocol (IPMP) is based on packet-probes, and is designed
    to allow routers to participate in measurements by the insertion of path information
    as the probe passes between a pair of hosts. IPMP is tightly constrained and easy
    to implement.</p>"
