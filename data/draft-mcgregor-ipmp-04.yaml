abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The practice and need for active network measurement is wellestablished,
    however current tools are not well suited to thistask, mostly because the protocols
    which they employ have notbeen designed for measurement of the modern Internet.The
    IP Measurement Protocol (IPMP) is based on packet-probes, andis designed to allow
    routers to participate in measurements by theinsertion of path information as
    the probe passes between a pair ofhosts. IPMP is tightly constrained and easy
    to implement.</p>"
