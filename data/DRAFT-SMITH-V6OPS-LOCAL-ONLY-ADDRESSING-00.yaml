abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For certain types or models of devices it should be clear and
    obvious\n   that, by default, they should not be reachable from the global IPv6\n
    \  Internet, or able to reach the global IPv6 Internet, even though the\n   network
    they are attached to provides global IPv6 Internet\n   connectivity.  This memo
    proposes that these types of devices refuse\n   to configure and use global IPv6
    Internet addresses by default.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
