abstract:
- content: "<p>Domain contact information over DNS provides a vehicle for exchanging
    contact information in a programmatic and reliable manner. DNS has a ubiquitous
    presence within the internet infrastructure and will act as a reliable publication
    method for contact information exchange. This RFC provides an agreed upon structure,
    voluntarily, to publish points of contact for domains. This document outlines
    the methodology for utilizing DNS TXT records for voluntary publication of various
    forms of contact. The intended purpose is to provide a faster means of reliable
    contact for professionals, cyber-defense of domains.</p>"
