abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft captures the authors' personal opinions and is intended
    to serve as input to the discussion for the solution in the DNA WG. It presents
    a few assumptions for DNA solution. The draft proposes the solution to be based
    on 1) Link Identifier, 2) RA optimized for DNA and 3) Quick delivery of an RA
    and sketches what rough shape DNA solution will take. It also enumerate a few
    tasks to be worked on and issues to be resolved for efficient DNA solution.</p>"
