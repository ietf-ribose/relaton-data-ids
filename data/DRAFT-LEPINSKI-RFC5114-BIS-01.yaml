abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes eight Diffie-Hellman groups that can
    be used\n   in conjunction with IETF protocols to provide security for Internet\n
    \  communications.  The groups allow implementers to use the same groups\n   with
    a variety of security protocols, e.g., SMIME, Secure Shell\n   (SSH), Transport
    Layer Security (TLS), and Internet Key Exchange\n   (IKE).\n\n   All of these
    groups comply in form and structure with relevant\n   standards from ISO, ANSI,
    NIST, and the IEEE.  These groups are\n   compatible with all IETF standards that
    make use of Diffie-Hellman or\n   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman cryptography.\n\n
    \  These groups and the associated test data are defined by NIST on\n   their
    web site [EX80056A], but have not yet (as of this writing) been\n   published
    in a formal NIST document.  Publication of these groups and\n   associated test
    data, as well as describing how to use Diffie-Hellman\n   and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
    for key agreement in all of the\n   protocols cited below, in one RFC, will facilitate
    development of\n   interoperable implementations and support the Federal Information\n
    \  Processing Standard (FIPS) validation of implementations that make\n   use
    of these groups.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
