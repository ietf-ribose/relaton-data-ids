abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a problem statement and general requirements\n
    \  for distributed autonomous configuration of multiple aspects of\n   networks,
    in particular carrier networks. The basic model is that\n   network elements need
    to negotiate configuration settings with each\n   other to meet overall goals.
    The document describes a generic\n   discovery and negotiation behavior model.
    The document also reviews\n   whether existing management and configuration protocols
    may be\n   suitable for autonomic networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
