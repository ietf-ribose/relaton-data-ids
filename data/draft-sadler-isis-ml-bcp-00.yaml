abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Work has started in the ITU, the IETF IP over Optical Working Group,and
    in the OIF to specify the requirements for ASON NNI routing.One of the requirements
    identified is support for multi-levelhierarchies.IS-IS is one of the candidate
    protocols to provide thisfunctionality. Therefore, methods for multi-level IS-IS
    routingneed to be developed.This draft documents one that provides multi-level
    routing throughthe 'stacking' of Level 2 IS-IS instances. The method is possibleusing
    existing extensions to IS-IS. It also provides insight intosome of the resulting
    operational issues.</p>"
