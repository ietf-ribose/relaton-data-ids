abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the protocol almost exclusively
    used\n   in the Internet to exchange routing information between network\n   domains.
    \ Due to this central nature, it's important to understand\n   the security measures
    that can and should be deployed to prevent\n   accidental or intentional routing
    disturbances.\n\n   This document describes measures to protect the BGP sessions
    itself\n   (like TTL, MD5, control plane filtering) and to better control the\n
    \  flow of routing information, using prefix filtering and\n   automatization
    of prefix filters, max-prefix filtering, AS path\n   filtering, route flap dampening
    and BGP community scrubbing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
