abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents results from the survey to gather information\n
    \  from people who have implemented MPTCP, in particular to help\n   progress
    the protocol from Experimental to Standards track.\n\n   The document currently
    includes answers from four teams: a Linux\n   implementation from UCLouvain, a
    FreeBSD implementation from\n   Swinburne, an anonymous implementation in a commercial
    OS, and a\n   NetScalar Firmware implementation from Citrix Systems, Inc. Thank-\n
    \  you!\n\n   In summary, we have four independent implementations of all the
    MPTCP\n   signalling messages, with the exception of address management, and\n
    \  some interoperabiity testing has been done by the other three\n   implementations
    with the 'reference' Linux implementation.  So it\n   appears that the RFC is
    (at least largely) clear and correct.  On\n   address management, we have only
    one implementation of ADD_ADDR with\n   two teams choosing not to implement it.
    \ We have one implementation\n   of the working group's coupled congestion control
    (RFC6356) and none\n   of the MPTCP-aware API (RFC6897).\n\n   The main suggested
    improvements are around\n\n   o  how MPTCP falls back (if the signalling is interrupted
    by a\n      middlebox): (1) corner cases that are not handled properly, (2) at\n
    \     the IETF, the MPTCP community should work with middlebox vendors,\n      either
    to reduce or eliminate the need for fallback or to\n      understand the middlebox
    interactions better.\n\n   o  security: both better MPTCP security (perhaps building
    on SSL) and\n      a lighter weight mechanism, preferably both in one mechanism.\n\n
    \  It is hoped that the next version can include information from any\n   other
    implementations.  If you are an implementer and want to\n   contribute your answers,
    please see the -01 version of this document\n   for a blank survey ready to be
    filled in.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
