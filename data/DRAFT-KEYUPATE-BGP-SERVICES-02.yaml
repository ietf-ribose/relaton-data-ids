abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A variety of services, such as NATs, firewalls, or caches,
    can be\n   embedded in a service provider network or instantiated in data\n   centers
    attached to the network.  This document proposes extensions\n   to BGP that facilitate
    discovery of such service instances by\n   interested clients and allows dissemination
    of service information,\n   such as services capabilities or capacities, thoughtout
    the network\n   domain.  The proposed extensions allow for optimal routing of\n
    \  requests to service instances that can optimally serve them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
