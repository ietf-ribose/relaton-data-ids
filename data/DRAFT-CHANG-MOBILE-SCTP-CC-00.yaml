abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a novel error and congestion control
    \n   algorithm for mobile Stream Control Transmission Protocol (mSCTP).  \n   This
    algorithm is simple but very effective means to minimize the \n   lost packet
    recovery time as well as the handover latency by \n   capitalizing on the transport
    layer awareness of the mobility. \n\t </p>\n      "
