abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Host Identity Protocol [RFC5201] is a secure signaling
    protocol\n   with a cryptographic namespace.  It provides the communicating peers\n
    \  with a cryptographic puzzle mechanism to protect against Denial of\n   Service
    (DoS) attacks exploiting the computation and memory overheads\n   of the protocol
    exchange.  This document specifies an extension of\n   the protocol that enables
    an on-path network entity to assist in the\n   choice of the puzzle difficulty
    in case of an attack.  Furthermore,\n   it defines a modification of the puzzle
    mechanism that enables a host\n   to delegate puzzle solving to an on-path network
    entity.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
