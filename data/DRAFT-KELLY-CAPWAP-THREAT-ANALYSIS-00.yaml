abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Early Wireless LAN (WLAN) deployments feature a \"fat\" Access
    Point\n   (AP) which serves as a standalone interface between the wired and\n
    \  wireless network segments.  However, this model raises scaling,\n   mobility,
    and manageability issues, and the CAPWAP protocol [CAPWAP]\n   is being developed
    in reponse.  CAPWAP effectively splits the fat AP\n   functionality into two network
    elements, and the communication\n   channel between these components may traverse
    potentially hostile\n   hops.  This document analyzes the security exposure resulting
    from\n   the introduction of CAPWAP, and summarizes the associated security\n
    \  considerations for CAPWAP implementations and deployments.\n\t </p>\n      "
