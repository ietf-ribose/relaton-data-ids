abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are several scenarios involving multi-hop heterogeneous\n
    \  wireless networks requiring reliable and available features combined\n   with
    multi-access edge computing, such as Industry 4.0.  This\n   document discusses
    mechanisms to allow a terminal influencing the\n   selection of a MEC host for
    instantiation of the terminal-targeted\n   MEC applications and functions, and
    (re)configuring the RAW network\n   lying in between the terminal and the selected
    MEC host.  This\n   document assumes IETF RAW and ETSI MEC integration, fostering\n
    \  discussion about extensions at both IETF and ETSI MEC to better\n   support
    these scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
