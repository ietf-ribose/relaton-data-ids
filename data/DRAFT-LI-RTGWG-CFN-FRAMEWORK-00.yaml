abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Compute First Networking (CFN) leverages both computing and\n
    \  networking status to help determine the optimal edge among multiple\n   edge
    sites with different geographic locations to serve a specific\n   edge computing
    request. Requests for the same service can be\n   determined and dispatched to
    different edges based on service\n   requirements, network and computing resource
    conditions and other\n   factors to achieve better load balancing and system efficiency.
    The\n   request needs to be dispatched to the selected edge in real time and\n
    \  the subsequent packets from the same flow should be served by the\n   same
    edge for flow affinity. This document describes a framework of\n   CFN to achieve
    the desired features.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
