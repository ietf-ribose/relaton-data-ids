abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines some terms related to the Generic AAA\narchitecture.
    The first section describes some broad aspects of such\nan architecture.  The
    second section looks at the various aspects and\ntypes of policy that come into
    play in an AAA architecture.  The\nthird section will describe some of the components
    of a single\npolicy.  This work is preliminary and is expected to be complimented\nby
    other work from the AAAARCH research group such as [POLICY MODEL]\nand [POLICY
    ACCOUNTING].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
