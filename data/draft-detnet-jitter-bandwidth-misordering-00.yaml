abstract:
- content: "<p>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) can provide data transmission with
    end-to-end bounded latency and extremely low packet loss for user's services.
    In order to better control and manage deterministic network services. It is necessary
    to measure and monitor DetNet QoS information. As introduced in [I-D.chen-detnet-loss-delay],
    packet loss rates and end-to-end delay can be measured by using passive Performance
    Measurement (PM) in MPLS-based DetNet encapsulation. This document implement three
    new QoS related attribute to support passive Performance Measurement for DetNet
    service.</p>"
