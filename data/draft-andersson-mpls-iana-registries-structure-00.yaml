abstract:
- content: "<p>The structure of the MPLS IANA registries is not entirely intuitive.
    This document proposes a clarification. The intention is to make a structure that
    is implicit in the MPLS IANA registries clearly visible. This document does not
    change any RFC, nor are the content of any registry touched.</p>"
