abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The S/MIME protocols Message Specification (RFC 5751), Cryptographic\n
    \  Message Syntax (RFC 5652), S/MIME Certificate Handling (RFC 5750) and\n   Enhanced
    Security Services for S/MIME (RFC 2634) specify a consistent\n   way to securely
    send and receive MIME messages providing end to end\n   integrity, authentication,
    non-repudiation and confidentiality.  This\n   document identifies a number of
    interoperability, technical,\n   procedural and policy related issues that may
    result in end-to-end\n   security services not being achievable.  To resolve such
    issues, this\n   document profiles domain-based signing and encryption using S/MIME,\n
    \  such as specifying how S/MIME signing and encryption can be applied\n   between
    a Message Submission Agent (MSA) and a Message Delivery Agent\n   (MDA) or between
    2 Message Transfer Agents (MTA).\n\n   This document is also registering 2 URI
    scheme: \"smtp\" and \"submit\"\n   which are used for designating SMTP/SMTP Submission
    servers\n   (respectively), as well as SMTP/Submission client accounts.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
