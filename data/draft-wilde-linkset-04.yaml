abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines two media types and a link relation type
    for sets of links. The media types can be used to represents links in a standalone
    fashion, in one case in the native format as used in the HTTP Link header, and
    in the other case in a JSON-based format. The link relation type can be used by
    a resource to point at another resource that provides a set of links, including
    links in which the former resource participates. One typical scenario is when
    the number of links to put in an HTTP Link header becomes too big, and thus these
    links should be provided in another way.</p>"
