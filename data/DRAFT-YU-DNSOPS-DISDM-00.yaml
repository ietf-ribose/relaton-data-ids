abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DM (Distribution Master) is used to transfer zone file data
    between\n   the registry and the authoritative server.  The centralized DM system\n
    \  has the risk of a single point of failure.  The distributed DM\n   architecture
    allows nodes to join and exit at any time to solve the\n   single point of failure
    problem.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
