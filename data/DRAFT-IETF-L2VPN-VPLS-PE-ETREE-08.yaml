abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A generic Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) solution which
    uses\n   VLANs to indicate root or leaf traffic is specified for Ethernet-\n   Tree
    (E-Tree) services. A VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model is\n   illustrated as an example
    for the solution. In the solution, E-Tree\n   VPLS PEs are interconnected by PWs
    which carry the VLAN indicating\n   the E-Tree attribute, the MAC address based
    Ethernet forwarding\n   engine and the PW work in the same way as in RFC 4762
    and RFC 4448\n   respectively. A signaling mechanism is further described for
    E-Tree\n   capability and VLAN mapping negotiation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
