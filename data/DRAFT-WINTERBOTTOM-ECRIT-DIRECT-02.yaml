abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The specified IETF emergency services architecture puts a strong\nemphasis
    on emergency call and emergency messaging via the Voice\nService Provider (VSP)
    / Application Service Provider (ASP).  There\nare two reasons for this design
    decision: The call routing via the\nVSP/ASP is more natural as it follows the
    standard communication\npattern and transition deployments assume non-updated
    end hosts.\n\nAs the deployment of the Location-to-Service Translation protocol\nprogresses
    there are possibilities for upgraded end devices to\ndirectly communicate with
    the IP-based emergency services network\nwithout the need to interact with a VSP/ASP,
    which simplifies the\ntask of regulators as the involved parties are within the
    same\njurisdiction.\n\nThis memo describes the procedures and operations of a
    generic\nemergency calling client utilizing the available building blocks.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
