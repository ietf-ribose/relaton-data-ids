abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Efficient delivery of real-time multicast traffic imposes on the
    \nunderlying network infrastructure the burden of supporting Quality of \nService
    (QoS). This can be quite a complex issue in a Differentiated \nServices (DiffServ)
    IP network, especially if multicast users are \nallowed to dynamically join and
    leave the multicast tree. In fact, since \nDiffServ lacks of explicit reservation
    states, i) a replicating node \ncannot test whether a corresponding reservation
    exists on an output \nlink, and ii) upon a dynamic join of a QoS multicast user,
    the DiffServ \nnetwork lacks of control functions to verify whether resources
    are \navailable along the new path. In this document, we present a solution to
    \nsupport dynamic multicast with QoS over a DiffServ network. Our solution \ncombines
    two ideas. First, resource availability along a new QoS path is \nverified via
    a probe-based approach. Second, QoS is maintained by \nmarking replicated packets
    with a special DSCP value, before forwarding \nthem on the QoS path. We are fully
    aware that the possible application \nof the principles described in this draft
    in the Internet raises many \nissues, which we do not address. Our aim, then,
    is not proposing a \nfully-fledged solution, but contributing to the on-going
    discussions in \nthe international arena on these matters, by means of what we
    may see \nalso as a problem statement document. \n\t </p>\n      "
