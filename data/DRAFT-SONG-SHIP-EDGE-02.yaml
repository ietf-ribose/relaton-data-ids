abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To mitigate the IPv6 header overhead in edge networks, this
    draft\n   proposes to use short hierarchical addresses excluding the network\n
    \  prefix within edge networks.  An edge network can be further\n   organized
    into a hierarchical architecture containing one or more\n   levels of networks.
    \ The border routers for each hierarchical level\n   are responsible for address
    augmenting and pruning when a packet\n   leaves or enter a lower level network.
    \ Specifically, the top-level\n   border routers convert the internal IP header
    to and from the\n   standard IPv6 header.  This draft presents an incrementally\n
    \  deployable scheme allowing packet header to be effectively compressed\n   in
    edge networks without affecting the network interoperability.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
