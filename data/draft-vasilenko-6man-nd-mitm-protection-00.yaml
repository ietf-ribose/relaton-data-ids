abstract:
- content: "<p>Privacy protection is the bigger and bigger concern of many governments
    and public in general. ND has a few open man-in-the- middle attack vectors. MITM
    is considered among the most dangerous attack types because of information leakage.
    This document proposes minimal modifications for ND to protect IPv6 nodes against
    still open MITM attacks. It could be implemented gradually on any nodes, with
    the biggest benefit from support on routers.</p>"
