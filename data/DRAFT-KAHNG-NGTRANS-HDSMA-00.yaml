abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the requirements for MIPv4/MIPv6 transition.
    \nResearches  on  the  IPv4  to  IPv6,  or  IPv6  to  IPv4,  transition \nmechanisms
    are actively being conducted. These transition mechanisms \nassume that hosts
    are attached to the network statically. Currently, \ndevelopments of communication
    mechanisms are developed individually \nand differently. This means that the effects
    of considering mobile \nnode (MN) roaming in IPv4/IPv6 transition networks have
    not been \ninvestigated. Therefore, this document proposes the requirements and
    \nanalysis of different routing architecture of MIPv4/MIPv6 transition \nnetwork.\n\t
