abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) permits
    Domain\n   Owners to coordinate with Mail User Agents (MUAs) to display brand-\n
    \  specific Indicators next to properly authenticated messages.  There\n   are
    two aspects of BIMI coordination: a scalable mechanism for Domain\n   Owners to
    publish their desired Indicators, and a mechanism for Mail\n   Transfer Agents
    (MTAs) to verify the authenticity of the Indicator.\n   This document specifies
    how Domain Owners communicate their desired\n   Indicators through the BIMI Assertion
    Record in DNS and how that\n   record is to be interpreted by MTAs and MUAs.  MUAs
    and mail-\n   receiving organizations are free to define their own policies for\n
    \  making use of BIMI data and for Indicator display as they see fit.\n\n\t </p>\n
