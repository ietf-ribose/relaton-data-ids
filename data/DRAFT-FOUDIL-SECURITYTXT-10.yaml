abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When security vulnerabilities are discovered by researchers,
    proper\n   reporting channels are often lacking.  As a result, vulnerabilities\n
    \  may be left unreported.  This document defines a format\n   (\"security.txt\")
    to help organizations describe their vulnerability\n   disclosure practices to
    make it easier for researchers to report\n   vulnerabilities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
