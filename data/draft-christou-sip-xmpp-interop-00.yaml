abstract:
  content: <p>This document is intended to serve as a reference point for developers
    and operators implementing the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) within their networks. This document does
    not define any new protocols but does define the different reference models for
    deployment of combined use of SIP and XMPP ("CUSAX") clients and SIP- XMPP interworking
    to ensure consistency across the community.</p>
