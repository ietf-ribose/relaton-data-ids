    that are assigned a 4-octet AS number may want the BGP UPDATE messages they receive
    from their customers or peers to include a 4-octet AS specific BGP extended community.
    This document defines a new sub-type within the four-octet AS specific extended
    community to facilitate this practice.</p>"
