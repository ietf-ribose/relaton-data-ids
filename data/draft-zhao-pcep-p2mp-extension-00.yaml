abstract:
  content: <p>Point-to-point Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and GeneralizedMPLS
    (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) maybe established using
    signaling techniques, but their paths may firstbe determined. The Path Computation
    Element (PCE) has beenidentified as an appropriate technology for the determination
    of thepaths of P2MP TE LSPs.This document describes extensions to the PCE Communication
    ProtocolPCEP) to handle requests and responses for the computation of pathsfor
    P2MP TE LSPs.Conventions used in this documentThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
    "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
    and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
    [RFC2119].</p>
