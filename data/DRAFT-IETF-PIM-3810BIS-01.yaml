abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC 2710, and it specifies Version 2
    of the\n   Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol (MLDv2).  MLD is used by an\n
    \  IPv6 router to discover the presence of multicast listeners on\n   directly
    attached links, and to discover which multicast addresses\n   are of interest
    to those neighboring nodes.  MLDv2 is designed to be\n   interoperable with MLDv1.
    \ MLDv2 adds the ability for a node to\n   report interest in listening to packets
    with a particular multicast\n   address only from specific source addresses or
    from all sources\n   except for specific source addresses.\n\n   This document
    obsoletes RFC 3810.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
