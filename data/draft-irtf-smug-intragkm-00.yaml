abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for intra-domain group keymanagement
    for IP multicast security, based on the framework of[HCD00]. In order to support
    multicast groups, the domain is dividedinto a number of administratively-scoped
    'areas'. A host-member ofa multicast group is defined to reside within one (and
    only one) ofthese areas. The purpose of placing host-members in areas is toachieve
    flexible and efficient key management, particularly in theface of the problem
    of changes (joining, leaving, ejections) in themembership of a multicast group.
    A separate administratively-scopedarea control-group is defined for each (data)
    multicast group, forthe express purpose of key management and other control-messagedelivery.</p>"
