abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for intra-domain group key management
    for IP multicast security, based on the framework of [HCD00]. In order to support
    multicast groups, the domain is divided into a number of administratively-scoped
    'areas'. A host-member of a multicast group is defined to reside within one (and
    only one) of these areas. The purpose of placing host-members in areas is to achieve
    flexible and efficient key management, particularly in the face of the problem
    of changes (joining, leaving, ejections) in the membership of a multicast group.
    A separate administratively-scoped area control-group is defined for each (data)
    multicast group, for the express purpose of key management and other control-message
    delivery.</p>"
