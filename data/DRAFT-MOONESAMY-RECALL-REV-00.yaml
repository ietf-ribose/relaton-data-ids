abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The procedures for initiating a recall specified in RFC 7437
    restrict\n   signatories to those who are \"nomcom qualified\".  This document\n
    \  suggests those limitations were unanticipated and undesirable side-\n   effects
    and proposes to remove them.  It also proposes that remote\n   participants should
    be allowed to seek redress through the procedures\n   and decreases the number
    of signatories required for a recall\n   petition.\n\n   This document is intended
    to update RFC 7437.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
