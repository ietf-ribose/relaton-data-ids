abstract:
- content: "<p>The terms on-path attacker and Man-in-the-Middle Attack have been used
    in a variety of ways, sometimes interchangeably, and sometimes meaning different
    things. This document offers an update on terminology for network attacks. A consistent
    set of terminology is important in describing what kinds of attacks a particular
    protocol defends against, and which kinds the protocol does not.</p>"
