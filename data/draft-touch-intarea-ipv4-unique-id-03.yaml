abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The IPv4 Identification (ID) field enables fragmentation andreassembly,
    and as currently specified is required to be uniquewithin the maximum lifetime
    on all IP packets. If enforced, thisuniqueness requirement would limit all connections
    to 6.4 Mbps.Because this is obviously not the case, it is clear that existingsystems
    violate the current specification. This document updates thespecification of the
    IP ID field to more closely reflect currentpractice and to more closely match
    IPv6, so that the field is definedonly when a packet is actually fragmented and
    that fragmentationoccurs only at originating hosts or their equivalent. Whenfragmentation
    occurs, this document recommends that the ID field beunique within the reordering
    context, rather than an arbitrary,unenforced upper bound on packet lifetime.</p>"
