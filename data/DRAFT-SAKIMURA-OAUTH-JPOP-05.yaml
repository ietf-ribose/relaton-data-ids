abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification describes how to use JWT POP (Jpop) tokens
    that\n   were obtained through [POPKD] in HTTP requests to access OAuth 2.0\n
    \  protected resources.  Only the party in possession of the\n   corresponding
    cryptographic key for the Jpop token can use it to get\n   access to the associated
    resources unlike in the case of the bearer\n   token described in [RFC6750] where
    any party in posession of the\n   access token can access the resource.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
