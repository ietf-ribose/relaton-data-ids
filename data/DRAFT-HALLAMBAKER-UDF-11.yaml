abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes means of generating Uniform Data Fingerprint\n
    \  (UDF) values and their presentation as text sequences and as URIs.\n   Uses
    of UDF fingerprints include but are not limited to creating\n   Strong Internet
    Names (SINs).\n\n   Cryptographic digests provide a means of uniquely identifying
    static\n   data without the need for a registration authority.  A fingerprint
    is\n   a form of presenting a cryptographic digest that makes it suitable\n   for
    use in applications where human readability is required.  The UDF\n   fingerprint
    format improves over existing formats through the\n   introduction of a compact
    algorithm identifier affording an\n   intentionally limited choice of digest algorithm
    and the inclusion of\n   an IANA registered MIME Content-Type identifier within
    the scope of\n   the digest input to allow the use of a single fingerprint format
    in\n   multiple application domains.\n\n   Alternative means of rendering fingerprint
    values are considered\n   including machine-readable codes, word and image lists.\n\n
