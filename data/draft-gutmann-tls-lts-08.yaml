abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an update of TLS 1.2 for long-term support
    on systems that can have multi-year or even decade-long update cycles, one that
    incoporates as far as possible what's already deployed for TLS 1.2 but with the
    security holes and bugs fixed. This document also recognises the fact that there
    is a huge amount of TLS use outside the web content-delivery environment with
    its resource-rich hardware and software that can be updated whenever required
    and provides a long-term stable, known-good version that can be deployed to systems
    that can't roll out ongoing changes on a continuous basis.</p>"
