abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes an application level protocol for the standard\ncommunication
    of e2e QoS compliance information using a protocol\nbased on Hypertext Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP), which forms the basis\nfor the World Wide Web, and Session Description
    Protocol (SDP).\nQuality HTTP (Q-HTTP) provides a mechanism for latency, jitter,\nbandwidth
    an packet loss negotiation and monitoring, alerting\nwhenever one of the negotiated
    conditions is violated.\n\nImplementation details on the actions to be triggered
    upon\nreception/detection of QoS alerts exchanged by the protocol are out\nof
    scope of this draft, it is application dependant (e.g. increase\nquality, reduce
    bit-rate) or even network dependant (e.g. change\nconnection's quality profile).\n\t
    </p>\n      "
