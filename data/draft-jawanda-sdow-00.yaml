abstract:
  content: "<p>In this document, a concept of main directory agent (MDA) is introduced.The
    main directory agent utilizes conjoined operations of Mobile IP andSLP including
    new proposed extensions. The MDA expedites service &amp;location discovery process
    for mobile hosts and provides local systemadministrators with control over the
    usage of deployed services. Itprovides a mechanism for local system administrators
    to enforce localpolicies for the allocation of local access resources when desired.
    The MDA based service discovery by mobile hosts is particularlyeffective in the
    case of wireless networks. Wireless links havesubstantially lower bandwidth, suffer
    from higher error rates and needto support higher mobility of hosts/data terminals
    compared to wiredlinks (e.g. LAN). Thus, to disseminate any information to mobile
    hostsover the wireless links the multicasting or broadcasting paradigmshould be
    used sparingly. In view of this, optional extensions to Mobile IP and SLP protocol
    arerecommended and discussed in this document. Again, the intent is tomake the
    overall service discovery process expeditious and effectivefor mobile hosts.</p>"
