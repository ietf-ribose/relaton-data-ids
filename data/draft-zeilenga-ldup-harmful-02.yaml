abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the last few years there has been significant development of Lightweight
    Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) replication mechanisms supporting a multi-master
    service model. While multi-master replication may be useful in some situations,
    the deployment of multi-master replication alters the standard LDAP service model
    in a manner which can be harmful. Specifically, the LDAP service model properties
    of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) would be lost. This
    memo discusses the LDAP service model, how multi-master replication alters the
    service model, and how this alteration is harmful to existing directory applications.</p>"
