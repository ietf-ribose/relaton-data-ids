abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how a service node can dynamically
    terminate\n   EVPN virtual private wire transport service (VPWS) from access nodes\n
    \  and offer Layer 2, Layer 3 and Ethernet VPN overlay services to\n   Customer
    edge devices connected to the access nodes. Service nodes\n   using EVPN will
    advertise to access nodes the L2, L3 and Ethernet VPN\n   overlay services it
    can offer for the terminated EVPN VPWS transport\n   service. On an access node
    an operator can specify the L2 or L3 or\n   Ethernet VPN overlay service needed
    by the customer edge device\n   connected to the access node that will be transported
    over the EVPN-\n   VPWS service between access node and service node.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
