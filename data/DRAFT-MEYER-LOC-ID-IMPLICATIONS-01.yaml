abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent work on Locator/ID Separation has focused primarily
    on the\n   control plane protocols concerned with finding Identifier-to-Locator
    \   mappings.  However, experience gained with a trial deployment of a\n   system
    designed to implement Locator/ID Separation has revealed two\n   general classes
    of problems which must be resolved after the mapping\n   is found: The Locator
    Path Liveness Problem and the State\n   Synchronization Problem.  These problems
    have implications for the\n   data plane as well as the control plane.\n\t </p>\n
