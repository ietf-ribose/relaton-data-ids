abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is
    to\n   bridge the gap between network and applications by provisioning\n   network
    related information.  This allows applications to make\n   informed decisions,
    for example when selecting a target host from a\n   set of candidates.\n\n   Therefore
    an ALTO server provides network and cost maps to its\n   clients.  However, those
    maps can be very large, and portions of\n   those maps may change frequently (the
    cost map in particular).\n\n   This draft presents a method to provide incremental
    updates for these\n   maps.  The goal is to reduce the load on the ALTO client
    and server\n   by transmitting just the updated portions of those maps.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
