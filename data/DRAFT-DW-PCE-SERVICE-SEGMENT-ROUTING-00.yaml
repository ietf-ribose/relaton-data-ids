abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) technology leverages the source routing
    and\n   tunneling paradigms where a source node can choose a path without\n   relying
    on hop-by-hop signaling.  The same mechanism can also be\n   utilized for Service
    Function Chaining (SFC) to steer packets through\n   service functions performing
    specific services such as DPI, Firewall,\n   accounting etc.\n\n   This document
    specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element\n   Protocol (PCEP) that
    allow a stateful PCE to compute and instantiate\n   SR-TE paths that have service
    functions (SF) (or service segments)\n   involved.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
