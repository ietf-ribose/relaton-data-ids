abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   A SIP Back-To-Back User Agent (B2BUA) refers to the concatenation
    of\n   a SIP User Agent Client (UAC) and a SIP User Agent Server (UAS).  A\n   transparent
    B2BUA is a particular type of B2BUA that forwards SIP\n   messages in a SIP proxy-like
    way, and that also benefits from some\n   features of a User Agent (UA) element.
    \ This document recommends best\n   current practices for the implementation of
    such a transparent B2BUA.\n   Developing transparent B2BUAs that meet this set
    of requirements will\n   greatly increase the likelihood that SIP applications
    will function\n   properly.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
