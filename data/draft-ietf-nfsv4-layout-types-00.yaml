abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides help in distinguishing between the requirements
    for Network File System (NFS) version 4.1's Parallel NFS (pNFS) and those those
    specifically directed to the pNFS File Layout. The lack of a clear separation
    between the two set of requirements has been troublesome for those specifying
    and evaluating new Layout Types.</p>"
