abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes opportunistic encryption (OE) as designed
    and implemented by the Linux FreeS/WAN project. OE uses the Internet Key Exchange
    (IKE) and IPsec protocols. The objective is to allow encryption for secure communication
    without any pre-arrangement specific to the pair of systems involved. DNS is used
    to distribute the public keys of each system involved. This is resistant to passive
    attacks. The use of DNS Security (DNSSEC) secures this system against active attackers
    as well.\n\n As a result, the administrative overhead is reduced from the square
    of the number of systems to a linear dependence, and it becomes possible to make
    secure communication the default even when the partner is not known in advance.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t </p>\n      "
