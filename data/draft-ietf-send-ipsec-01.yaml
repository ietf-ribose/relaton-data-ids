abstract:
  content: "<p>IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol to discover othernodes
    on the link, to determine each other's link-layer addresses, tofind routers and
    to maintain reachability information about the pathsto active neighbors. If not
    secured, ND protocol is vulnerable tovarious attacks. This document specifies
    an extension to IPsec forsecuring ND. Contrary to the original ND specifications
    that alsocalled for use of IPsec, this extension does not require the creationof
    a large number of manually configured security associations.</p>"
