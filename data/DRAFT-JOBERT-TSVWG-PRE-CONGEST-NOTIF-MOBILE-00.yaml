abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobile networks may be divided into two main segments: the
    radio\n   segment, and the wireline segment. This document highlights that the\n
    \  algorithms leading to pre-congestion notification (e.g. ECN marking)\n   are
    usually significantly different for these two segments, and not\n   defined or
    documented in general over the radio segment. It also\n   explains that using
    ECN bits leads to having a unique signal for\n   notifying a pre-congestion related
    to two separate segments with\n   very different notification algorithms. Some
    consequences are\n   questioned, as well as the potential benefits of being able
    to\n   identify where the congestion comes from. This document finally\n   discusses
    the possibility to take into account the radio conditions\n   of the terminals
    when counting the volume of congestion over the\n   radio segment.\n\n\t </p>\n
