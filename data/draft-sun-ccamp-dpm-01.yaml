abstract:
  content: "\t <t>When setting up a label switched path (LSP) in Generalized MPLS
    andMPLS/TE networks, the completion of the signaling process does notnecessarily
    mean that the cross connection along the LSP have beenprogrammed accordingly and
    in a timely manner. Meanwhile, thecompletion of signaling process may be used
    by applications asindication that data path has become usable. The existence of
    thisdelay and the possible failure of cross connection programming, ifnot properly
    treated, will result in data loss or even applicationfailure. Characterization
    of this performance can thus helpdesigners to improve the application model and
    to build more robustapplications. This document defines a series of performance
    metricsto evaluate the availability of data path in the signaling process.Status
