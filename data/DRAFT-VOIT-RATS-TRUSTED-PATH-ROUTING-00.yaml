abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are end-users who believe encryption technologies like
    IPSec\n   alone are insufficient to protect the confidentiality of their highly\n
    \  sensitive traffic flows.  This specification describes two\n   alternatives
    for protecting these sensitive flows as they transit a\n   network.  In both alternatives,
    protection is accomplished by\n   forwarding sensitive flows across network devices
    currently appraised\n   as trustworthy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
