abstract:
  content: "<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) makes use of a hierarchical namingscheme.
    The validity of a particular name in the DNS is governed byprotocol, operational
    and policy considerations.The IETF has identified particular domain names to have
    specialconsiderations associated with their use. These domain names havebeen identified
    in various documents in the RFC series. Thisdocument describes the creation of
    an IANA registry to catalogue suchdomain names and provides direction about how
    this registry should bemaintained.This document does not identify any new domain
    name as having specialconsiderations associated with its use.</p>"
