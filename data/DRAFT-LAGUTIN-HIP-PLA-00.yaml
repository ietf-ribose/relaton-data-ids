abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines extensions to provide Packet Level\nAuthentication
    (PLA) functionality for the HIP protocol.  PLA\nprovides strong hop-by-hop security
    features that allow intermediate\nnodes to detect the hostile traffic quickly,
    and drop the traffic\nbefore it reaches the destination and can consume resources
    in the\ntarget network.\n\nUnlikely other similar solutions, PLA does not require
    excessive\nsignaling or state in verifying nodes, and is path-independent,\nmaking
    it suitable for dynamic environments, such as ad-hoc networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
