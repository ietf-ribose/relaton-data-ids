abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node to connect to the same
    Proxy\n   Mobile IPv6 domain through different interfaces.  However, the\n   ability
    of movement of selected flows from one access technology to\n   another is missing
    in the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol.  This\n   document describes extensions
    to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol that\n   are required to support network based
    flow mobility over multiple\n   physical interfaces.\n\n   The extensions required
    consist on the operations performed by the\n   local mobility anchor and the mobile
    access gateway to manage the\n   prefixes assigned to the different interfaces
    of the mobile node, as\n   well as how the forwarding policies are handled by
    the network to\n   ensure consistent flow mobility management.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
