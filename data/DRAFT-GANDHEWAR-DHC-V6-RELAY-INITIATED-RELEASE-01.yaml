abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) is\n
    \  initiated by a DHCPv6 client.  A DHCPv6 server can force DHCPv6\n   client
    to send RENEW or INFORMATION-REQUEST by sending a RECONFIGURE\n   message.  There
    may be multiple DHCPv6 network devices connected in\n   between a DHCPv6 client
    and a server, each one reserving resources\n   for the DHCPv6 client.  There are
    no DHCPv6 messages that a relay can\n   initiate in order to control the client
    binding.\n\n   A DHCPv6 client may not always send a RELEASE message when it no\n
    \  longer needs the IPv6 address or prefix and network resources for the\n   associated
    services it is using.  This document specifies a way to\n   request release to
    be initiated by an intermediate DHCPv6 network\n   device, e.g.  DHCPv6 relay,
    on behalf of DHCPv6 client.  This helps\n   to relinquish network resources sooner
    than the lease expiration\n   time.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
