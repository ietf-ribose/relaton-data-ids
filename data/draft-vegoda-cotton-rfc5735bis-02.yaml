abstract:
- content: "<p>This document obsoletes RFC 5735 and updates RFC 6441. It describes
    the global and other specialized IPv4 address blocks that have been assigned by
    the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). It does not address IPv4 address
    space assigned to operators and users through the Regional Internet Registries,
    nor does it address IPv4 address space assigned directly by IANA prior to the
    creation of the Regional Internet Registries. It also does not address allocations
    or assignments of IPv6 addresses or autonomous system numbers.</p>"
