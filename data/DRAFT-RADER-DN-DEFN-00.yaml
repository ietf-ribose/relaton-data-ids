abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A number of policy and technical development efforts related to
    the \nDNS are underway within the engineering community, ICANN-circles and \nelsewhere
    due to the evolving scope and utility of DNS, domain name \nregistries and related
    entities. It is important that accepted \ndefinitions act as the foundation for
    this work. This document is an \nattempt to create an optional starting point
    for the requisite \ndialogue that will ultimately foster the determination and
    \nacceptance of these new technical and contractual protocols. This \ndocument
    obsoletes &lt;draft-rader-dnwhois-defn-00.txt&gt;, &lt;draft-ietf-\nprovreg-dn-defn-01.txt&gt;
    and &lt;draft-rader-dn-defn-00&gt;.\n\t </p>\n      "
