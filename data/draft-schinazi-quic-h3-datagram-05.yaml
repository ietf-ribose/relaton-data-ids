abstract:
- content: "<p>The QUIC DATAGRAM extension provides application protocols running
    over QUIC with a mechanism to send unreliable data while leveraging the security
    and congestion-control properties of QUIC. However, QUIC DATAGRAM frames do not
    provide a means to demultiplex application contexts. This document defines how
    to use QUIC DATAGRAM frames when the application protocol running over QUIC is
    HTTP/3 by adding an identifier at the start of the frame payload. Discussion of
    this work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF mailing list (quic@ietf.org
    (mailto:quic@ietf.org)) or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft:
    https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/draft-h3-datagram.</p>"
