abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document enumerates requirements for emergency calls in
    VoIP and\n   general Internet multimedia systems.  We divide the requirements
    into\n   'trunk replacement' and 'end-to-end'.  Trunking solutions only\n   exchange
    the emergency call center's circuit-switched access by an\n   IP-based system.
    \ The requirements for end-to-end IP-based emergency\n   calling address functional
    and security issues for determining the\n   correct emergency address, for identifying
    the appropriate emergency\n   call center and for identifying the caller and its
    location.  While\n   we focus on systems that employ the Session Initiation Protocol\n
    \  (SIP), many of the requirements may also apply to other environments,\n   such
    as those using H.248/Megaco, MGCP or H.323.\n\t </p>\n      "
