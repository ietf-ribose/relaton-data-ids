abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network stratum and application stratum form a federation to\n
    \  faciliate user's access.  Network operator acts as Identity Provider\n   (IdP),
    and application reuses underlying network's security\n   capabilities to simlify
    application's access.  This document is to\n   introduce such federated cross-layer
    access use case and message\n   flows.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
