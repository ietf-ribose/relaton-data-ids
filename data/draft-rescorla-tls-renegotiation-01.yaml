abstract:
  content: "<p>SSL and TLS renegotiation are vulnerable to an attack in which theattacker
    forms a TLS connection with the target server, injectscontent of his choice, and
    then splices in a new TLS connection froma client. The server treats the client's
    initial TLS handshake as arenegotiation and thus believes that the initial data
    transmitted bythe attacker is from the same entity as the subsequent client data.This
    draft defines a TLS extension to cryptographically tierenegotiations to the TLS
    connections they are being performed over,thus preventing this attack.</p>"
