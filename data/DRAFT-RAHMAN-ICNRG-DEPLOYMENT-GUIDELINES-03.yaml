abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is now reaching technological\n
    \  maturity after many years of fundamental research and\n   experimentation.
    \ This document provides a number of deployment\n   considerations in the interest
    of helping the ICN community move\n   forward to the next step of live deployments.
    \ First, the major\n   deployment configurations for ICN are described including
    the main\n   overlay and underlay approaches.  Then proposed deployment migration\n
    \  paths are outlined to address major practical issues such as network\n   and
    application migration.  Next, selected ICN trial experiences are\n   summarized.
    \ Finally, protocol areas that require further\n   standardization are identified
    to facilitate future interoperable ICN\n   deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
