abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 6363 describes a framework for using Forward Error Correction\n
    \  (FEC) codes with applications in public and private IP networks to\n   provide
    protection against packet loss.  The framework supports\n   applying FEC to arbitrary
    packet flows over unreliable transport and\n   is primarily intended for real-time,
    or streaming, media.  However\n   FECFRAME as per RFC 6363 is restricted to block
    FEC codes.  The\n   present document extends FECFRAME to support convolutional
    FEC Codes,\n   based on a sliding encoding window, in addition to Block FEC Codes.\n
    \  This is done in a backward compatible way.  During multicast/\n   broadcast
    real-time content delivery, these codes significantly\n   improve robustness in
    harsh environments, with less repair traffic\n   and lower FEC-related added latency.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
