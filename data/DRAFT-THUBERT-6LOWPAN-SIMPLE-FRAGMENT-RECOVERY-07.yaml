abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Considering that the IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280 bytes and that an
    an\n802.15.4 frame can have a payload limited to 74 bytes in the worst\ncase,
    a packet might end up fragmented into as many as 18 fragments\nat the 6LoWPAN
    shim layer.  If a single one of those fragments is\nlost in transmission, all
    fragments must be resent, further\ncontributing to the congestion that might have
    caused the initial\npacket loss.  This draft introduces a simple protocol to forward
    and\nrecover individual fragments that might be lost over multiple hops\nbetween
    6LoWPAN endpoints.\n\t </p>\n      "
