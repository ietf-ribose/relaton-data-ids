abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Saratoga transfer protocol. Saratoga was
    originally developed to transfer remote-sensing imagery efficiently from a low-Earth-orbiting
    satellite constellation, but is useful in many other scenarios, including ad-hoc
    peer-to-peer communications, large-scale scientific sensing, and grid computing.
    Saratoga is a simple, lightweight, content dissemination protocol that builds
    on UDP, and optionally uses UDP-Lite. Saratoga is intended for use when moving
    files or streaming data between peers which may have permanent, sporadic or intermittent
    connectivity, and is capable of transferring very large amounts of data reliably
    under adverse conditions. The Saratoga protocol is designed to cope with highly
    asymmetric link or path capacity between peers, and can support fully-unidirectional
    data transfer if required. Saratoga can also cope with very large files for exascale
    computing. In scenarios with dedicated links, Saratoga focuses on high link utilization
    to make the most of limited connectivity times, while standard congestion control
    mechanisms can be implemented for operation over shared links. Loss recovery is
    implemented via a simple negative-ack ARQ mechanism. The protocol specified in
    this document is considered to be appropriate for experimental use on private
    IP networks.</p>"
