abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC3748, provides
    a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication methods. EAP-Transport
    Layer Security (EAP-TLS) and other TLS-based EAP methods are widely deployed and
    used for network access authentication. Large certificates and long certificate
    chains combined with authenticators that drop an EAP session after only 40 - 50
    round-trips is a major deployment problem. This document looks at this problem
    in detail and describes the potential solutions available.</p>"
