abstract:
- content: "<p>Perhaps the most intrusive form of Internet mail abuse, the unsolicited
    mail problem is a chronic aggravation that users are generally powerless to stop
    or prevent. Many forums have played host to endless criticism of the problem,
    particularly leveled against those who engage in the activity and their tactics,
    but few solutions have come to the forefront that provide users an adequate defense.
    While economic and social influences define the human side of the problem, the
    permissiveness of the Internet mail architecture with regard to the freedoms it
    grants senders, as well as the fixed relationship between mailbox and address,
    are the critical factors that provide opportunity to those who would abuse it.</p>"
