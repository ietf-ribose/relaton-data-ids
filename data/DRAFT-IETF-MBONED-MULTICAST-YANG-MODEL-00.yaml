abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document intents to provide a general and all-round multicast\n
    \  YANG data model, which tries to stand at a high level to take full\n   advantages
    of existed multicast protocol models to control the\n   multicast network, and
    guides the deployment of multicast service.\n   And also, there will define several
    possible RPCs about how to\n   interact between multicast YANG data model and
    multicast protocol\n   models.  This multicast YANG data model is mainly used
    by the\n   management tools run by the network operators in order to manage,\n
    \  monitor and debug the network resources used to deliver multicast\n   service,
    as well as gathering some data from the network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
