abstract:
- content: "<p>A Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) server can experience temporary
    overload because one or more clients are sending requests to the server at a higher
    rate than the server is capable or willing to handle. This document defines a
    new CoAP response code for a server to indicate that a client should reduce the
    rate of requests.</p>"
