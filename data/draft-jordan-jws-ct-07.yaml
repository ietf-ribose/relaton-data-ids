abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a method for extending the scope of the JSON
    Web Signature (JWS) specification, called JWS/CT (JWS "Clear Text"). By combining
    the detached mode of JWS with the JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS), JWS/CT enables
    JSON objects to remain in the JSON format after being signed. In addition to supporting
    a consistent data format, this arrangement also simplifies documentation, debugging,
    and logging. The ability to embed signed JSON objects in other JSON objects, makes
    the use of counter-signatures straightforward. This informational specification
    has been produced outside the IETF, is not an IETF standard, and does not have
    IETF consensus. The intended audiences of this document are JSON tool vendors
    as well as designers of JSON-based cryptographic solutions.</p>
