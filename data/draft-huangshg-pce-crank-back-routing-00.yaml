abstract:
- content: "<p>Path computation in large multi-layer and multi-region networks is
    complex and may require special computational components and cooperation between
    different network domains, whereby a failure affect to establish a path or a failure
    of an existing path may be corrected by a new path computation and fresh signaling.
    This document specifies the crank-back routing mechanism based on re- routing
    in crank back Path Computation Element (PCE). When a Path Computation Client (PCC)
    requests a PCE for a route, it may be useful for the PCC to specify Crank-back
    routing to the path computation, abstract nodes, resources, and domains that are
    to be explicitly excluded from the computed route. Such mechanism is termed Crank-
    back routing. The PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) is designed as a communication
    protocol between PCCs and PCEs. To support this mechanism, function of PCE and
    procedure of PCEP signaling performance are extended.</p>"
