abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CPEs are designed to provide IP connectivity to home networks.
    \ Most\n   CPEs assigns IP addresses to the nodes of the home network which\n
    \  makes it a good candidate for hosting the naming service.  With IPv6,\n   the
    naming service makes nodes reachable from the home network as\n   well as from
    the Internet.\n\n   However, CPEs have not been designed to host such a naming
    service\n   exposed on the Internet.  This MAY expose the CPEs to resource\n   exhaustion
    which would make the home network unreachable, and most\n   probably would also
    affect the home network inner communications.\n\n   In addition, DNSSEC management
    and configuration may not be well\n   understood or mastered by regular end users.
    \ Misconfiguration MAY\n   also results in naming service disruption, thus these
    end users MAY\n   prefer to rely on third party naming providers.\n\n   This document
    describes a homenet naming architecture where the CPEs\n   manage the DNS zone
    associates to its home network, and outsource\n   both DNSSEC management and naming
    service on the Internet to a third\n   party designated as the Public Authoritative
    Servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
