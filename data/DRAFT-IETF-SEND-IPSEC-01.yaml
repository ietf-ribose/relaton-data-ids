abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol to discover
    other\nnodes on the link, to determine each other's link-layer addresses, to\nfind
    routers and to maintain reachability information about the paths\nto active neighbors.
    \ If not secured, ND protocol is vulnerable to\nvarious attacks.  This document
    specifies an extension to IPsec for\nsecuring ND.  Contrary to the original ND
    specifications that also\ncalled for use of IPsec, this extension does not require
    the creation\nof a large number of manually configured security associations.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
