abstract:
- content: "<p>The STRINT workshop assembled one hundred participants in London for
    two days in early 2014 to discuss how the technical community, and in particular
    the IETF and the W3C, should react to Pervasive Monitoring and more generally
    how to strengthen the Internet in the face of such attacks. The discussions covered
    issues of terminology, the role of user interfaces, classes of mitigation, some
    specific use cases, transition strategies (including opportunistic encryption),
    and more. The workshop ended with a few high-level recommendations, which it is
    believed could be implemented and which could help strengthen the Internet. This
    is the report of that workshop.</p>"
