abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how media stream selection can be achieved
    in\n   both a conferencing scenario and peer to peer communication.  To\n   allow
    endpoints to select specific media streams, all available media\n   in the session
    must be identifiable and there is a need for messages\n   than can be securely
    transported between endpoints and network nodes.\n   This document also describes
    a way to distribute the identification\n   information to all participating endpoints.
    \ The necessary messages\n   can potentially be mapped onto several different
    encodings, and this\n   document proposes one mapping that uses an extended version
    of the\n   Binary Floor Control Protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
