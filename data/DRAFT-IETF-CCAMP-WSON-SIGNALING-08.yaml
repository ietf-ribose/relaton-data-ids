abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol
    Label\n   Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of Wavelength Switched\n   Optical
    Networks (WSON).  Such extensions are applicable in WSONs\n   under a number of
    conditions including: (a) when optional\n   processing, such as regeneration,
    must be configured to occur at\n   specific nodes along a path, (b) where equipment
    must be configured\n   to accept an optical signal with specific attributes, or
    (c) where\n   equipment must be configured to output an optical signal with\n
    \  specific attributes. In addition this memo provides mechanisms to\n   support
    distributed wavelength assignment with choice in distributed\n   wavelength assignment
    algorithms. These extensions build on previous\n   work for the control of lambda
    and G.709 based networks, i.e. update\n   RFC6205, to make it applicable to WSON-LSC
    capable equipment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
