abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This extension to IODEF (RFC 5070) is designed to aid in the
    sharing\n   and dissemination of digital forensics information.  The goal is to\n
    \  allow a tool independent format to share information between\n   organizations
    focused on digital forensics: drive images, file\n   carving, metadata, and related
    hashes.  As with IODEF and its\n   extensions, it is defined using XML.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
