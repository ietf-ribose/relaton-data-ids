abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks deployment scenarios, service providers
    would\n   like to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in both MPLS and\n
    \  GMPLS while removing the complexity of existing signalling protocols\n   such
    as LDP and RSVP-TE.  PCE has been proposed to be used as a\n   central controller
    (PCECC) so that LSP can be calculated/setup/\n   initiated and label forwarding
    entries are downloaded through a\n   centralized PCE server to each network devices
    along the path while\n   leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible.\n\n
    \  This document specifies the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions\n   when
    the PCE functions as one of the central controller components in\n   Segment Routing(SR).\n\n\t
