abstract:
  content: "<p>Real Time Communications (RTC) tools are becoming as prevalent andessential
    for users on the Internet as email. While RTC tools can,like email, be implemented
    directly by users in a point-to-pointfashion, they are often provided for or on
    behalf of a community ofusers within an administrative domain. As the use of these
    toolsgrows, users increasingly have the need to communicate with users notonly
    within their own community but with those in other communitiesas well. In practice,
    each community is controlled by someauthority, and so there is a need to provide
    for easier establishmentof connectivity between communities, and the management
    of the inter-community link. This document contains an initial list ofrequirements
    for provisioning and managing connectivity betweencommunities.</p>"
