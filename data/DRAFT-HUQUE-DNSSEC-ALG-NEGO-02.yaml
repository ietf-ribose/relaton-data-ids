abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a DNS extension that allows a DNS client
    to\n   specify a list of DNSSEC algorithms, in preference order, that the\n   client
    desires to use.  A DNS server upon receipt of this extension\n   can choose to
    selectively respond with DNSSEC signatures using the\n   most preferred algorithm
    they support.  This mechanism may make it\n   easier for DNS zone operators to
    support signing zone data\n   simultaneously with multiple DNSSEC algorithms,
    without significantly\n   increasing the size of DNS responses.  It will also
    allow an easier\n   way to transition to new algorithms while still retaining
    support for\n   older DNS validators that do not yet support the new algorithms.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
