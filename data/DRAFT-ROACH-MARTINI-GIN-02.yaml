abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a mechanism by which a SIP server acting
    as a\ntraditional Private Branch Exchange (PBX) can register with a SIP\nService
    Provider (SSP) to receive phone calls for extensions\ndesignated by phone numbers.
    \ In order to function properly, this\nmechanism relies on the fact that the phone
    numbers are fully\nqualified and globally unique.\n\t </p>\n      "
