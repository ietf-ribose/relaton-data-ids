abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The \"persistently full buffer\" problem has been discussed
    in the IETF\n   community since the early 80's [RFC896].  The IRTF's End-to-End\n
    \  Working Group called for the deployment of active queue management\n   (AQM)
    to solve the problem in 1998 [RFC2309].  Despite the awareness,\n   the problem
    has only gotten worse as Moore's Law growth in memory\n   density fueled an exponential
    increase in buffer pool size.  Efforts\n   to deploy AQM have been frustrated
    by difficult configuration and\n   negative impact on network utilization.  This
    problem, recently\n   christened \"bufferbloat\", [TSVBB2011] [BB2011] has become\n
    \  increasingly important throughout the Internet but particularly at\n   the
    consumer edge.\n\n   This document describes a general framework called CoDel
    (Controlled\n   Delay) [CODEL2012] that controls bufferbloat-generated excess
    delay\n   in modern networking environments.  CoDel consists of an estimator,
    a\n   setpoint, and a control loop.  It requires no configuration in normal\n
    \  Internet deployments.  CoDel comprises some major technical\n   innovations
    and has been made available as open source so that the\n   framework can be applied
    by the community to a range of problems.  It\n   has been implemented in Linux
    (and available in the Linux\n   distribution) and deployed in some networks at
    the consumer edge.  In\n   addition, the framework has been successfully applied
    in other ways.\n\n   Note: Code Components extracted from this document must include
    the\n   license as included with the code in Section 5.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
