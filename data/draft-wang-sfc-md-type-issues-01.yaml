abstract:
- content: "<p>Service function chain is the definition of an ordered set of service
    functions. After instantiated, the service function path is created and the classified
    traffic is steered through the corresponding service function path and then forwarded
    to the final destination. Metadata (MD) is conveyed in SFC data plane which provides
    the ability to exchange context information between classifiers and SFs, among
    SFs, and between external systems and SFs. This document is motivated to state
    an issue when MD Type = 0x1 and discuss which Metadata Type in more appropriate
    to be mandate in SFC data plane.</p>"
