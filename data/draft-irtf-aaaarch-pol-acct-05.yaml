abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes policy-based accounting which is an approachto
    provide flexibility to accounting architectures. Accountingpolicies describe the
    configuration of an accounting architecture ina standardized way. They are used
    to instrument the accountingarchitecture and can be exchanged between AAA entities
    in order toshare configuration information.This document describes building blocks
    and message sequences forpolicy-based accounting in the generic AAA architecture
    [RFC2903].Examples are given for the usage of accounting policies in differentscenarios.
    Furthermore it is shown how accounting components can beintegrated into the AAA
    authorization framework [RFC2904]. Thisdocument does not propose a language for
    the description ofaccounting policies. It is rather assumed that a suitable policylanguage
    can be chosen from existing or upcoming standards.</p>"
