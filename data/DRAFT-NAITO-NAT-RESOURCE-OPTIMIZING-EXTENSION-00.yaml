abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When NAT is used in address resource restricted environment,
    or when\n   a lot of users are located under a NAT device, IP address and port\n
    \  resources may be eaten up, and it brings severe bad effects on user\n   experiences.
    \ This situation can be greatly mitigated by tweaking\n   mapping behavior and
    session timer handling at NAT function.  This\n   document proposes to NAT IP
    address and port resource optimizing\n   extension for address resource restricted
    environment.  One extension\n   is to enable simultaneous use of a port for different
    transport\n   sessions, and the other is to make use of TCP timestamp for TIME_WAIT\n
    \  Assassination.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
