abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends the specification of the Discovery Proxy
    for\n   Multicast DNS-Based Service Discovery.  It describes a lightweight\n   relay
    mechanism, a Discovery Relay, which allows Discovery Proxies to\n   provide service
    on multicast links to which they are not directly\n   attached.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
