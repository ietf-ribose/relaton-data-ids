abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The United States Government has published the NSA Commercial\n
    \  National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite, which defines cryptographic\n   algorithm
    policy for national security applications.  This document\n   specifies the conventions
    for using the United States National\n   Security Agency's CNSA Suite algorithms
    with the Secure Shell\n   Transport Layer Protocol and the Secure Shell Authentication\n
    \  Protocol.  It applies to the capabilities, configuration, and\n   operation
    of all components of US National Security Systems that\n   employ IPSec.  US National
    Security Systems are described in NIST\n   Special Publication 800-59.  It is
    also appropriate for all other US\n   Government systems that process high-value
    information.  It is made\n   publicly available for use by developers and operators
    of these and\n   any other system deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
