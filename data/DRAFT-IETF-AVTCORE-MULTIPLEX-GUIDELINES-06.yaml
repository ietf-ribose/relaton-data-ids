abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a flexible protocol
    that\n   can be used in a wide range of applications, networks, and system\n   topologies.
    \ That flexibility makes for wide applicability, but can\n   complicate the application
    design process.  One particular design\n   question that has received much attention
    is how to support multiple\n   media streams in RTP.  This memo discusses the
    available options and\n   design trade-offs, and provides guidelines on how to
    use the\n   multiplexing features of RTP to support multiple media streams.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
