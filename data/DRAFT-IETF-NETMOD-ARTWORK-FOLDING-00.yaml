abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a simple and yet time-proven strategy
    for\n   handling long lines in artwork in drafts using a backslash ('\\')\n   character
    where line-folding has occurred.  The strategy works on any\n   text based artwork,
    but is primarily intended for sample text and\n   formatted examples and code,
    rather than for graphical artwork.  The\n   approach produces consistent results
    regardless of the content and\n   uses a per-artwork header.  The strategy is
    both self-documenting and\n   enables automated reconstitution of the original
    artwork.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
