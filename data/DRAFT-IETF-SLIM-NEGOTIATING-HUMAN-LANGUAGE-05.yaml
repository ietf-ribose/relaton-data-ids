abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities,
    and\n   preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.  When\n   establishing
    interactive communication (\"calls\") there needs to be a\n   way to negotiate
    (communicate and match) the caller's language and\n   media needs with the capabilities
    of the called party.  This is\n   especially important with emergency calls, where
    a call can be\n   handled by a call taker capable of communicating with the user,
    or a\n   translator or relay operator can be bridged into the call during\n   setup,
    but this applies to non-emergency calls as well (as an\n   example, when calling
    a company call center).\n\n   This document describes the need and a solution
    using new SDP stream\n   attributes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
