abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is the definition of an IMAP command for reporting spam.\n\n
    \  Spam can be flagged using the $Junk and $NotJunk keywords.  Spam\n   reporting
    is meant to correspond to a command to be run on the IMAP\n   server, in order
    to tune filters and possibly mitigate further\n   attempts.  This behavior can
    be obtained by moving message to a\n   special folder that is being observed by
    the server.\n\nPurpose\n\n   This is a cleanup of an existing draft and its sole
    purpose is to\n   discuss whether its core is good for APPSAWG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
