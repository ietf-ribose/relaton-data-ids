abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An Entity Attestation Token (EAT) provides a signed (attested)
    set of\n   claims that describe state and characteristics of an entity,\n   typically
    a device like a phone or an IoT device.  These claims are\n   used by a Relying
    Party to determine how much it wishes to trust the\n   entity.\n\n   An EAT is
    either a CWT or JWT with some attestation-oriented claims.\n   To a large degree,
    all this document does is extend CWT and JWT.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
