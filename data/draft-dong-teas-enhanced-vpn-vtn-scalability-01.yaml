    to support the needs of new applications, particularly including the applications
    that are associated with 5G services. VPN+ could be used to provide network slicing

    which have demanding requirement. With the requirement for VPN+ services increase,
    scalability would become an important factor for deployment of VPN+. This document
    describes the scalability considerations in the control plane and data plane to
    enable VPN+ services, some optimization mechanisms are also described.</p>"
