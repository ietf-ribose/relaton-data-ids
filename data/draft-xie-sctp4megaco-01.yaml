abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the use of the Simple Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP) [1], for carrying MEGACO [2] messages between an MGC and an MG.
    SCTP is currently being developed by IETF SIGTRAN Working Group. The framework
    architecture defined in RFC 2719 [3] can be used as a guideline for transporting
    MEGACO messages using SCTP. MEGACO implementations targeting for high capacity
    and high availability deployment can especially benefit from the stream capability,
    redundant network support, congestion avoidance, and strong security features
    provided by SCTP.</p>"
