abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes performance, reliability and privacy
    problems\n   inherent when using a remotely situated vendor-provided Teredo\n
    \  server, which is a common default in current implementations, and\n   then
    discussed why configuring servers manually is bad and difficult.\n   It recommends
    two partial solutions, and gives a final recommendation\n   combining both solutions
    using anycast IPv4 and a well known DNS\n   hostname.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
