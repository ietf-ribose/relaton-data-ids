abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the problem statement and use cases
    of\n   IPv6-based vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation\n   Systems
    (ITS).  The main scenarios of vehicular communications are\n   vehicle-to-vehicle
    (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and\n   vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications.
    \ First, this document\n   explains use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.
    \ Next, for\n   IPv6-based vehicular networks, it makes a gap analysis of current\n
    \  IPv6 protocols (e.g., IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management,\n   and
    Security &amp; Privacy), and then lists up requirements for the\n   extensions
    of those IPv6 protocols for IPv6-based vehicular\n   networking.\n\n\t </p>\n
