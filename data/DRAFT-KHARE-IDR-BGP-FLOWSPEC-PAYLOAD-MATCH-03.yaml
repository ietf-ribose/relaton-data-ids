abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The rise in frequency, volume, and pernicious effects of DDoS
    attacks\n   has elevated them from fare for the specialist to generalist press.\n
    \  Numerous reports detail the taxonomy of DDoS types, the varying\n   motivations
    of their attackers, as well as the resulting business and\n   reputation loss
    of their targets.\n\n   BGP FlowSpec (RFC 5575, \"Dissemination of Flow Specification
    Rules\")\n   can be used to rapidly disseminate filters that thwart attacks, being\n
    \  particularly effective against the volumetric type.  Operators can\n   use
    existing FlowSpec components to match on pre-defined packet\n   header fields.
    \ However recent enhancements to forwarding plane\n   filter implementations allow
    matches at arbitary locations within the\n   packet header and, to some extent,
    the payload.  This capability can\n   be used to detect highly amplified attacks
    whose attack signature\n   remains relatively constant while values in the packet
    header vary,\n   as well as the burgeoning variety of tunneled traffic.\n\n   We
    define a new FlowSpec component, \"Flexible Match Conditions\", with\n   similar
    matching semantics to those of existing components.  This\n   component will allow
    the operator to define bounded match conditions\n   using bit offsets and a variety
    of match types.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
