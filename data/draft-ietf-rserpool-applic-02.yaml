abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the applicability of the reliable server pool
    architecture and protocols to applications which want to have High avialebility
    services. This is accomplished by using redundant servers and failover between
    servers of the same pool in case of server failure. Processing load in a pool
    may de distributed/shared between the members of the pool according to a certain
    policy. Also some guidance is given on the choice of underlying transport protocol
    (and corresponding transport protocol mapping) for transporting application data
    and Rserpool specific control data.</p>"
