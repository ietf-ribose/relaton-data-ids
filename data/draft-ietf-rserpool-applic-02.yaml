abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the applicability of the reliable server
    poolarchitecture and protocols to applications which want to have Highavialebility
    services. This is accomplished by using redundantservers and failover between
    servers of the same pool in case ofserver failure. Processing load in a pool may
    de distributed/sharedbetween the members of the pool according to a certain policy.
    Alsosome guidance is given on the choice of underlying transport protocol(and
    corresponding transport protocol mapping) for transportingapplication data and
    Rserpool specific control data.</p>"
