abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Repair path mechanism is an important element in IP/LDP fast
    reroute.\n   In this document we propose a way to calculate local repair paths\n
    \  using alternative shortest paths. The solution can provide complete\n   coverage
    for all destinations within an IGP area that can possibly be\n   protected.\n\n
    \  In this document we also suggested an \"Explicit Path with Loose\n   Segment\"
    model that can be used to characterize, classify, and\n   analyse repair paths.
    We proved some of the common properties of\n   loose segments, and showed that
    the model can be used to characterize\n   all existing fast reroute solutions.\n\t
