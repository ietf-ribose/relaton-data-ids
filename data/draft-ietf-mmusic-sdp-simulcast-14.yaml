abstract:
- content: "<p>In some application scenarios, it may be desirable to send multiple
    differently encoded versions of the same media source in different RTP streams.
    This is called simulcast. This document describes how to accomplish simulcast
    in RTP and how to signal it in the Session Description Protocol (SDP). The described
    solution uses an RTP/RTCP identification method to identify RTP streams belonging
    to the same media source and makes an extension to SDP to indicate that those
    RTP streams are different simulcast formats of that media source. The SDP extension
    consists of a new media-level SDP attribute that expresses capability to send
    and/or receive simulcast RTP streams.</p>"
