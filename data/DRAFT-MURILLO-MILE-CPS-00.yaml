abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft document will extend the Incident Object Description\n
    \  Exchange Format (IODEF) defined in [RFC5070] to support the reporting\n   of
    incidents dealing with attacks to physical infrastructure through\n   the utilization
    of IT means as a vehicle or as a tool.  These systems\n   might also be referred
    as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Operational\n   Technology Systems, Industrial
    Control Systems, Automatic Control\n   Systems, or simply Control Systems.  These
    names are used\n   interchangeably in this document.  In this context, an incident
    is\n   generally the result of a cybersecurity issue whose main goal is to\n   affect
    the operation of a CPS.  It is considered that any\n   unauthorized alteration
    of the operation is always malign.  This\n   extension will provide the capability
    of embedding structured\n   information, such as identifier- and XML-based information.
    \ In its\n   current state, this document provides important considerations for\n
    \  further work in implementing Cyber-Physical System incident reports,\n   either
    by utilizing any already existing industry formats (XML-\n   encoded) and/or by
    utilizing atomic data.\n\n   In addition, this document should provide appropriate
    material for\n   helping making due considerations in making an appropriate decision\n
    \  on how a CPS reporting is done: 1) through a data format extension to\n   the
    Incident Object Description Exchange Format [RFC5070], 2) forming\n   part of
    an already existing IODEF-extension for structured\n   cybersecurity information
    (currently draft\n   draft-ietf-mile-sci-11.txt), or others.  While the format
    and\n   contents of the present document fit more the earlier option, these\n
    \  can also be incorporated to the later.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
