abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS ping and traceroute mechanism as described in RFC 8029 and related
    extensions for SR as defined in RFC 8287 is very useful to precisely validate
    the control plane and data plane synchronization. There is a possibility that
    all intermediate or transit nodes may not have been upgraded to support these
    validation procedures. A simple mpls ping and traceroute mechanism comprises of
    ability to traverse any path without having to validate the control plane state.
    RFC 8029 supports this mechanism with Nil FEC. The procedures described in RFC
    8029 are mostly applicable when the Nil FEC is used as intermediate FEC in the
    label stack. When all labels in label stack are represented using single Nil FEC,
    it poses some challenges. This document introduces new TLV as additional extension
    to exisiting Nil FEC and describes mpls ping and traceroute procedures using Nil
    FEC with this additional extensions to overcome these challenges.</p>"
