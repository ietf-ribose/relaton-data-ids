abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a protocol that provides IP reachability
    for\n   mobile users. Like IP Mobility Support, RFC 2002, each mobile node is\n
    \  accessible by its home address, regardless of its current location in\n   the
    Internet. When away from home, a mobile node acquires a care-of\n   address indicating
    its current location. It registers the care-of\n   address with a registration
    server (RS). The RS sets up a twice\n   network address translation table on a
    RAT device. The RAT device\n   transparently routes datagrams destined for the
    mobile node's home\n   address to the care-of address using twice network address\n
    \  translation. The protocol requirements for the mobile node is\n   minimal.
    End-users can have mobility support easily as registration\n   is done using widely
    available applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
