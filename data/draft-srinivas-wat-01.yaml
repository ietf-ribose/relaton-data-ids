abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft specifies Web Address Translation (WAT) mechanism. Thescheme
    allows user to hide or rewrite the backend (and internal)domain addresses. The
    scheme is based on a suite of URL translationschemes without requiring any of
    the backend application servers to be reconfigured This allows to host multiple
    applications on different virtual servers via a single domain. The analogy is
    similar to NAT except that the proposed implementation scheme operates at the
    web application layer and brings the value of web address translation mechanism
    up into the network than doing the functions only in the web servers at the end
    point.</p>"
