abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a framework and service level requirements\n
    \  for Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs). This framework is\n   intended
    to aid in developing and standardizing protocols and\n   mechanisms to support
    interoperable L1VPNs.\n\n   The document examines motivations for L1VPNs, high
    level (service\n   level) requirements, and outlines some of the architectural
    models\n   that might be used to build L1VPNs.\n\t </p>\n      "
