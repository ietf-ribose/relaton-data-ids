abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a discussion tool for the Softwire meeting at
    IETF 84 in Vancouver. Significant differentiating features between the MAP approach
    (proposed standards MAP-T and MAP-E) and the unified approach (proposed standard
    4rd) are presented in tabular format. Its purpose is to facilitate decision making,
    and is therefore temporary.</p>"
