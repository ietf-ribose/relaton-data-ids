abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the INFO usage for IP-surveillance\n
    \  application. SIP is used as a means of incorporating terminals of\n   different
    vendors. In this draft, mid-control\n   commands, for example, retrieving server
    images or saving images in\n   the server are defined and delivered as session
    names of INVITE messages.\n   IN addition to that, INFO definitions specific to
    the\n   application are described. For example, camera control like PTZ(Pen,\n
    \  Tilt, Zoom) information is defined for the purpose of\n   standardization of
    controls. \n\t </p>\n      "
