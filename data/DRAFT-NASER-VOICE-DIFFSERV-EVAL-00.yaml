abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We study the performance of the Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and
    the\n   interpolated ON-OFF voice over the differentiated services\n   Internet.
    \ Both the Premium and Assured services are tested, and\n   their relative performance
    is investigated. Using these services, at\n   the DS3 rate, the call handling
    capacity can be doubled, at the\n   expense of packetization delay and a few milliseconds
    packet delay.\n   Also, at a reasonable load level, if the Assured flows are smooth\n
    \  their playout delay could be limited to a few milliseconds. This is\n   true
    even in the presence of the higher-priority Premium flows.  The\n   loss rate
    of the Assured packets at the RIO buffer is observed to be\n   within the order
    of 10^(-06), where as the best effort packet loss\n   rate is within the order
    of 10^(-02).  Finally, shaping the Premium\n   traffic reaches diminishing returns;
    shaping could often exceedingly\n   increase the end-to-end delay and jitter of
    the Premium traffic.\n \n   A pdf or ps version of this document is available
