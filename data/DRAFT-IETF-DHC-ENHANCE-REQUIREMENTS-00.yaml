abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a widely
    \ndeployed framework for host registration and configuration [DHC]. \nDHCP, however,
    was designed only for fixed hosts on physically secure\nLANs. Other protocols
    fill some of the gap. PPP [PPP] is a good \nsolution for many commercial service
    providers (where framing is \nneeded). Mobile IP [MIP] is ideal for registering
    and configuring\nroaming users (when transparent address binding is needed). This
    \nstill leaves many environments where there is no ideal solution,\nsuch as: roaming
    users who do not need transparent address binding\ne.g., a mobile web browser),
    and commercial service providers \nwho want to support home networking with multiple
    nodes. This draft\nproposes DHCP as the best protocol to meet these new needs,
    because \nit leave open how (and whether) to provide other functions, such as
    \nframing (e.g., PPP), locating (e.g., Mobile IP in co-located mode), \ninter-domain
    AAA (e.g., [AAAR]), or address distribution (e.g., \n[DAAP]). We describe and
    solicit feedback on seven new requirements \nthat would be placed on DHCP to meet
    these needs.  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
