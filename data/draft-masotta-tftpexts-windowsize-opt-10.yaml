abstract:
- content: "<p>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, file
    transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a remote host.
    One of its primary uses is the early stages of nodes booting from a Local Area
    Network. TFTP has been always used because it is very simple to implement. However,
    the choice of a lock-step schema is not the most efficient for use on a LAN. This
    document describes a TFTP option which allows the client and server to negotiate
    a windowsize of consecutive blocks to send as an alternative for replacing the
    single block lock-step schema. The TFTP Option Extension mechanism is described
    in [2].</p>"
