abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-\n
    \  Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  It can compute optimal paths for\n   traffic
    across a network and can also update the paths to reflect\n   changes in the network
    or traffic demands.\n\n   PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched
    Paths\n   (LSPs), which are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path\n
    \  Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).  But SDN has a\n   broader
    applicability than signaled (G)MPLS traffic-engineered (TE)\n   networks, and
    the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range of\n   use cases.  PCEP has
    been proposed as a control protocol for use in\n   these environments to allow
    the PCE to be fully enabled as a central\n   controller.\n\n   A PCE-based Central
    Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of\n   a distributed control plane
    by blending it with elements of SDN and\n   without necessarily completely replacing
    it.  Thus, the LSP can be\n   calculated/set up/initiated and the label forwarding
    entries can also\n   be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network
    device\n   along the path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much\n
    \  as possible.\n\n   This document specifies the procedures and PCEP extensions
    when a\n   PCE-based controller is also responsible for configuring the\n   forwarding
    actions on the routers, in addition to computing the paths\n   for packet flows
    in a segment routing (SR) network and telling the\n   edge routers what instructions
    to attach to packets as they enter the\n   network.  PCECC is further enhanced
    for SR SID (Segment Identifier)\n   allocation and distribution.\n\n\t </p>\n
