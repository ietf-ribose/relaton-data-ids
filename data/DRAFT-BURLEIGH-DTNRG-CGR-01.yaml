  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes Contact Graph Routing (CGR), a procedure
    for\ncomputing efficient Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) bundle forwarding\nroutes
    between source and destination endpoints when connectivity\nbetween pairs of neighboring
    bundle protocol agents in the network is\nscheduled and episodic rather than continuous.\n\t
