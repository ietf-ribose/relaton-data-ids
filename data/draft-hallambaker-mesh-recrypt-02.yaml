abstract:
- content: "<p>independent A messaging infrastructure providing full end-to end security
    is presented. Unlike existing approaches such as S/MIME and OpenPGP, Mesh/Recrypt
    uses proxy re-encryption to preserve full end-to-end security with individual
    user and device keys in situations such as the user having multiple decryption
    devices and messages being set to mailing lists. This document shows the use of
    Mesh/Recrypt to address the principle use cases Mesh/Recrypt is designed to address.
    These include asynchronous messaging such as mail and controlled documents and
    synchronous messaging applications such as chat, voice and video. This document
    is also available online at http://prismproof.org/Documents/draft-hallambaker-mesh-recrypt.html
