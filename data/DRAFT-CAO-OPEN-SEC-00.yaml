abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This position paper introduces an architecture of opening the\n
    \  operator's security capability to third party smart object\n   applications.
    \ With this architecture, the authentication, integrity\n   and encryption capabilities
    can be wrapped up as Application\n   Programming Interfaces and provided to third
    party application\n   developers.  So the third party applications do not have
    to spare\n   energy on these basic security functionalities.  As a consequence,\n
    \  the barrier for new applications is lowered, and it avoids the need\n   of
    providing security by multiple applications and hence saves the\n   computing
    and communication resources on constrained nodes.\n\n   Note: This document is
    submitted for the IAB Workshop on Smart Object\n   Security on March 23, 2012,
    Paris.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
