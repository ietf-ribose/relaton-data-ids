abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Next-Steps-in-Signalling (NSIS) working group of the IETF
    is \nconsidering the requirements for QoS signalling protocols [2]. One \nelement
    of this, and follow up work, is to develop a framework within \nwhich existing
    and proposed protocols can be analysed, and which \ncaptures how QoS signalling
    protocols should interact, both with each \nother and with other components of
    the Internet, such as routing \nprotocols or AAA mechanisms. Because of this aspect
    of interactions, \nthe scope of an NSIS framework is necessarily broader than
    the scope \nof any new NSIS protocol. \nPrevious work suggests that a complete
    QoS signalling framework is a \nmajor undertaking. This Internet Draft outlines
    the principal \ncomponents of such a framework and their interrelationships. It
    could \nbe used as a starting point for more detailed investigation of \nindividual
    components. It could also be used to refine the scope of \nNSIS more precisely,
    both in terms of what functions are to be \nconsidered and how many variant approaches
    are relevant. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
