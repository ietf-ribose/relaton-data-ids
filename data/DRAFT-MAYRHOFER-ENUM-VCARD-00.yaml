abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo registers the Enumservice \"vCard\" using the URI schemes\n
    \  \"http\" and \"https\" according to the IANA Enumservice registration\n   process
    described in RFC3671.  This Enumservice is to be used to\n   refer from an ENUM
    domain name to the vCard of the entity using the\n   corresponding E.164 number.\n\n
    \  Clients may use information gathered from those vCards before, during\n   or
    after inbound or outbound communication takes place.  For example,\n   a callee
    might be presented with the name and association of the\n   caller before he picks
    up the call.\n\t </p>\n      "
