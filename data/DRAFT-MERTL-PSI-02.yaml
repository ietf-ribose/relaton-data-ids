abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a protocol that builds upon UDP/IP to transport\n
    \  illumination and control data for stage, architectural and other\n   illumination
    requirements.\n\n   It may be understood as a spiritual successor of the traditional
    DMX\n   (Digital MultipleX) specification series, removing it's limitations\n
    \  and adding flexibility and usability enhancements like auto-discovery\n   and
    metadata, among other useful features.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
