    IM (text, audio or video) which can be sent in case of the\nreceiver is too busy
    to type/speak/record for a reply.  These short\nIM (here after referred as QA
    - Quick Answer) can be created, stored\nand used when needed.  This document defines
    a new QA content type\nand XML namespace that conveys QA between two entities.
    \ The QAs are\ndelivered to the instant messaging sender in the same manner as
    the\ninstant messages themselves.\n\t </p>\n      "
