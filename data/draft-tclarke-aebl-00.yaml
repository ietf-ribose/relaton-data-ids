abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents an RDF [refs.RDF] vocabulary for describing an application
    extension bundle [refs.aeb]. An application extension bundle, otherwise known
    as an add-on, extension, plug-in, suite, or package, is an encapsalation of all
    the data needed to add functionality to a plug-in based application. An integral
    piece of an application extension bundle is the metadata describing the bundle.
    The described RDF vocabulary contains required and optional metadata fields used
    by an application extension bundle to describe itself.</p>"
