abstract:
  content: "<p>The document describes a SingleSignON solution to WWW seen as one Giant
    computer. As WWW use increases, on average an user has many service login accounts
    they have to manage. It would be better for most users at the expense of some
    security risk to have one password for all the services and a WWW shell and a
    control panel. Also the WWW as an intelligent being could show information to
    an user interpreting their needs from all their accounts.</p>"
