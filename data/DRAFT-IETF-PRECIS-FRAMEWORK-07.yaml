abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Application protocols using Unicode code points in protocol
    strings\n   need to properly prepare such strings in order to perform valid\n
    \  comparison operations (e.g., for purposes of authentication or\n   authorization).
    \ This document defines a framework enabling\n   application protocols to perform
    the preparation and comparison of\n   internationalized strings (a.k.a.  \"PRECIS\")
    in a way that depends on\n   the properties of Unicode code points and thus is
    agile with respect\n   to versions of Unicode.  As a result, this framework provides
    a more\n   sustainable approach to the handling of internationalized strings\n
    \  than the previous framework, known as Stringprep (RFC 3454).  A\n   specification
    that reuses this framework can either directly use the\n   PRECIS string classes
    or subclass the PRECIS string classes as\n   needed.  This framework takes an
    approach similar to the revised\n   internationalized domain names (IDNs) in applications
    (IDNA)\n   technology (RFC 5890, RFC 5891, RFC 5892, RFC 5893, RFC 5894) and\n
    \  thus adheres to the high-level design goals described in the IAB's\n   recommendations
    regarding IDNs (RFC 4690), albeit for application\n   technologies other than
    the Domain Name System (DNS).  This document\n   obsoletes RFC 3454.\n\n\t </p>\n
