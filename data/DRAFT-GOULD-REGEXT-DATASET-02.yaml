abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a Data Set File (DSF) format that can
    be used\n   to define and pass bulk data between a client and a server.  This\n
    \  format is extensible to pass any set of simple data types in a set of\n   records
    contained in the body of the file.  The file format also\n   supports storing
    the result of processing the data set that MAY be\n   generated by the server
    and returned to the client.  The file format\n   consists of an XML definition
    header and a Comma-Separated Values\n   (CSV) data section delimited by \"-----BEGIN
    DATA SET-----\" and \"-----\n   END DATA SET-----\" lines.  The XML definition
    header defines the\n   format of the CSV data section, contains additional meta-data,
    and\n   optionally includes a digital signature to identify the source and\n   ensure
    that the data has not been tampered with between the parties\n   (source, client,
    and server).  The interface (manual or automated)\n   that is used to submit the
    file and receive the result file is not\n   defined within this document.\n\n\t
