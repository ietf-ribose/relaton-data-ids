abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Efficient QoS resource management is needed for a host of existing
    and\never-increasing new services. For service performance, flexibility, and\nreduced
    cost it is preferable to provide integration of these services on a\nshared network.
    \ Such integration and sharing is facilitated by QoS resource\nmanagement techniques
    described in the draft which are applicable to\nMPLS-based networks.  Such QoS
    resource management techniques are used in\nPSTNs to standardize service classification,
    bandwidth allocation, bandwidth\nprotection, and priority routing treatment for
    all network services.  In the\ndraft we illustrate the principles of QoS resource
    management and describe\ntheir application to MPLS-based networks. In the proposed
    QoS resource\nmanagement method, bandwidth is allocated in discrete changes to
    each of\nthree virtual networks (VNs) corresponding to high-priority key services,\nnormal
    priority services, and best-effort lower priority services.\nBandwidth changes
    in VN bandwidth capacity are determined by edge\nswitch/routers based on an overall
    aggregated bandwidth demand for VN\ncapacity (not on a per-connection demand basis).
    \ Based on the aggregated\nbandwidth demand, these edge switch/routers make periodic
    discrete changes\nin bandwidth allocation, that is, either increase or decrease
    bandwidth on\nthe constraint-based routing label switched paths (CRLSPs) constituting
    the\nVN bandwidth capacity. We propose to add optional parameters in the\nconstraint-based
    routing label distribution protocol (CRLDP) for QoS\nresource management.  In
    particular, we propose an optional depth-of-search\n(DoS) type/length/value (TLV)
    parameter in the CRLDP label request message\nto control the bandwidth allocation
    on individual links in a CRLSP.  In\naddition, we propose an optional modify-TLV
    parameter in the CRLDP label\nrequest message to allow modification of the assigned
    traffic parameters\n(such as peak data rate, committed data rate, etc.) of an
    already existing\nCRL\n\t </p>\n      "
