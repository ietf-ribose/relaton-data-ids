abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Governments around the world continue to search for new bands
    of\n   radio spectrum which can be used by the expanding wireless\n   communications
    industry to provide more services in the usable\n   spectrum.  The concept of
    allowing secondary transmissions (licensed\n   or unlicensed) in frequencies occupied
    by a primary user is a\n   technique to \"unlock\" existing spectrum for new use.
    \ An obvious\n   requirement is that these secondary transmissions do not interfere\n
    \  with the primary use of the spectrum.  One interesting observation is\n   that
    often, in a given physical location, the primary user(s) may not\n   be using
    the entire band allocated to them.  The available spectrum\n   for a secondary
    use would then depend on the location of the\n   secondary user.  The fundamental
    issue is how to determine for a\n   specific location and specific time, if any
    of the primary spectrum\n   is available for secondary use.  Academia and Industry
    have studied\n   multiple cognitive radio mechanisms for use in such a scenario.
    \ One\n   simple mechanism is to use a geospatial database that records the\n
    \  primary users occupation, and require the secondary users to check\n   the
    database prior to selecting what part of the spectrum they use.\n   Such databases
    could be available on the Internet for query by\n   secondary users.  This document
    discusses the problems that need to\n   be addressed for enabling the use of white
    space spectrum by\n   obtaining information from such a database.\n\n\t </p>\n
