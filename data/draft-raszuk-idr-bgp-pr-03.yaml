abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP protocol contains number of built in mechanisms which records
    information about the routers which have processed a specific piece of reachability
    information critical to insuring only loop free paths are chosen by the protocol.
    For instance, the AS_PATH, CLUSTER_LIST and ORIGINATOR_ID attributes carry information
    designed to insure permanent routing loops are not formed in the path chosen towards
    a particular destination. However, there are no provisions to record other useful
    information along the path, metadata about the routers through which reachability
    information has passed which can be helpful to the operator in order to enhance
    end to end visibility of the BGP control plane. In order to solve this problem
    this document proposes a new single BGP attribute designed as an generic and extensible
    container to carry number of new optional information corresponding to the BGP
    speakers given BGP advertisement (or withdraw) message traverses.</p>"
