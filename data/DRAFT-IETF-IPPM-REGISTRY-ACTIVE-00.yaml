abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines the Active Performance Metrics sub-registry
    of the\n   Performance Metric Registry.  This sub-registry will contain Active\n
    \  Performance Metrics, especially those defined in RFCs prepared in the\n   IP
    Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF, and possibly\n   applicable
    to other IETF metrics.  Three aspects make IPPM metric\n   registration difficult:
    (1) Use of the Type-P notion to allow users\n   to specify their own packet types.
    (2) Use of flexible input\n   variables, called Parameters in IPPM definitions,
    some of which\n   determine the quantity measured and others of which should not
    be\n   specified until execution of the measurement. (3) Allowing\n   flexibility
    in choice of statistics to summarize the results on a\n   stream of measurement
    packets.\n\n   This memo proposes a way to organize registry entries into columns\n
    \  that are well-defined, permitting consistent development of entries\n   over
    time (a column may marked NA if it is not applicable for that\n   metric).  The
    design is intended to foster development of registry\n   entries based on existing
    reference RFCs, whilst each column serves\n   as a check-list item to avoid omissions
    during the registration\n   process.  Every entry in the registry, before IANA
    action, requires\n   Expert review as defined by concurrent IETF work in progress\n
    \  \"Registry for Performance Metrics\" (draft-manyfolks-ippm-metric-\n   registry).\n\n
    \  The document contains two examples: a registry entry for an active\n   Performance
    Metric entry based on RFC3393 and RFC5481, and a registry\n   entry for an end-point
    Performance Metric based on RFC 7003.  The\n   examples are for Informational
    purposes and do not create any entry\n   in the IANA registry.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
