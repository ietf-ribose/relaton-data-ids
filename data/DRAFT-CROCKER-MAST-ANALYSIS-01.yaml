abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>An IP Address serves the dual roles as references to a 'place'
    on\nthe Internet and to a host on the Internet, labeled 'locator' and\n'identifier',
    respectively. Systems that use IP Addresses as\nidentifiers cannot support dynamic
    changes in the mapping between\nthe identifier and the locator. For a system to
    use a different\nIP Address pair, participants must initiate a new exchange.  In\nthe
    case of TCP, this means a new connection. In recent years,\nthere have been efforts
    to overcome this limitation, through\ndifferent approaches at different places
    in the Internet\narchitecture. This paper reviews the basic requirements for\nsupport
    of multiaddressing (mobility and multihoming), and the\nefforts to support them.
    Barriers to adoption, administrative\noverhead, and operational efficiency are
    of particular concern.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
