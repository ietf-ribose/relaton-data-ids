abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
    provides support for flow level multi-pathing for both unicast and multi-destination
    traffic in networks with arbitrary topology. Active-active access at the TRILL
    edge is the extension of these characteristics to end stations that are multiply
    connected to a TRILL campus. In this document, the edge RBridge (TRILL switch)
    group providing active-active access to such an end station can be represented
    as a Virtual RBridge. Based on the concept of Virtual RBridge along with its pseudo-nickname,
    this document facilitates the TRILL active-active access of such end stations.</p>"
