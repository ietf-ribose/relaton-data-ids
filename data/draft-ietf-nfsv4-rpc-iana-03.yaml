abstract:
  content: "<p>Network services based on RPC [RFC1831] use program numbers ratherthan
    well known transport ports to permit clients to find them, anduse authentication
    flavor numbers to define the format of theauthentication data passed. The assignment
    of RPC program numbersand authentication flavor numbers is still performed by
    SunMicrosystems, Inc. This is inappropriate for an IETF standardprotocol, as such
    work is done well by the Internet Assigned NumbersAuthority (IANA). This document
    defines how IANA will maintain andassign RPC program numbers and authentication
    flavor numbers.</p>"
