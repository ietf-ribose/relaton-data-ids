abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Remote access over the internet and IP mobility are currently
    being\n   addressed as two separate problems. The L2TP specification is\n   defining
    a protocol, or rather a tunnel control mechanism to solve\n   the remote access
    problem. On the other hand, the Mobile IP working\n   group has been solving the
    mobility problem. Nevertheless, the same\n   solution applies to both problems,
    namely, tunneling.\n \n   This document defines a Tunnel Set-up Protocol (TSP)
    that solves\n   both problems using a common approach. TSP is heavily based on
    the\n   control messages defined by Mobile IP.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
