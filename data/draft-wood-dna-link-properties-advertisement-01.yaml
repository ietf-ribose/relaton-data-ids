abstract:
  content: "<p>Routers are increasingly connected to a variety of smart modems.Such
    a modem's incoming and outgoing link rates can be varied overtime with adaptive
    coding and modulation to suit the channelcharacteristics. The link rate and conditions
    offered by the modemto connected devices therefore vary. For connected devices
    tocondition traffic and get the most out of the modem's link capacity,they need
    to know the modem's link conditions. This documentdescribes one simple method
    for the modem to advertise link rate andother characteristics, via UDP messages,
    and discusses alternativeapproaches to communicating this information.</p>"
