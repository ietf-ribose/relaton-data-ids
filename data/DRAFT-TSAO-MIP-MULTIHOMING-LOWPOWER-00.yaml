abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  It is expected that future mobile devices will equip multiple
    \n  wireless interfaces in order to access the Internet ubiquitously. For \n  such
    a multimode mobile node (MMN) that might have multiple home \n  addresses to associate
    with its interfaces, the MMN has to keep its \n  interfaces awake to listen the
    packets to these home addresses (HoAs).\n  Therefore, the MMN consumes a considerable
    energy to maintain the \n  reachablilities of these HoAs/interfaces. The draft
    presents the \n  benefits to use multiple care-of addresses and/or home addresses
    to \n  save the idle-mode power consumption of an MMN, and also discusses \n  the
    impacts and the requirements of the existing IETF protocols to \n  support the
    proposed low power operations.  \n\t </p>\n      "
