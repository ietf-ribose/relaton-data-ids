abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service Providers commonly use BGP/MPLS VPNs [RFC 4364] as
    the\n   technology for providing wide-area virtual private network\n   services.
    This technology has proven to scale to a very large\n   number of VPNs and attachment
    points, and it is well suited for\n   extending VPN connectivity to end-systems
    operating in a multi-\n   tenant environments. Virtualized end-system environment
    imposes\n   additional requirements to MPLS/BGP VPN technology when applied to\n
    \  end-system networking, which are defined in this document.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
