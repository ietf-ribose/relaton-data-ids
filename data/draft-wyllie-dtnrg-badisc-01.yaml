abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN), Bundle Agents form
    anoverlay network that forwards DTN bundles between their source anddestination
    applications. This document describes a mechanism thatBundle Agents can use to
    discover when they are in contact with oneanother and optionally provide information
    on the additionalproperties of current or future contacts, such as duration andcapabilities.
    This information can be used to trigger bundleforwarding or make future bundle
    scheduling decisions.</p>"
