abstract:
- content: "<p>When small payloads are transmitted through a packet-switched network,
    the resulting overhead may result significant. This is stressed in the case of
    LISP, where a number of headers have to be added to each packet. This document
    proposes to send together, into a single packet, a number of small packets, which
    are in the buffer of a ITR, having the same ETR as destination. This way, they
    will share a single LISP header, and therefore bandwidth savings can be obtained,
    and a reduction in the overall number of packets sent to the network can be achieved.</p>"
