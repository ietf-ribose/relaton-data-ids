abstract:
- content: "<p>Route tagging plays an important role in external BGP [RFC4271] relations,
    in communicating various routing policies between peers. It is also a very common
    best practice among operators to propagate various additional information about
    routes intra-domain. The most common tool used today to attach various information
    about routes is through the use of BGP communities [RFC1997]. Such information
    is important to allow BGP speakers to perform some mutually agreed actions without
    the need to maintain a separate offline database for each tuple of prefix and
    associated set of action entries. This document defines a new encoding which will
    enhance and simplify what can be accomplished today with the use of BGP communities.
    The most important addition this specification makes over currently defined BGP
    communities is the ability to specify, carry as well as use for execution an operator's
    defined set of parameters. It also provides an extensible platform for any new
    community encoding needs in the future.</p>"
