abstract:
  content: "<p>A cryptographically generated address (CGA) is an IPv6 addressgenerated
    by applying a hash function over the public key of a nodeand some additional parameters.
    CGA ownership can be asserted onlyby the node claiming the address, but is readily
    verifiable using thepublic-key of that node by any other entity. Such addressauthorization
    is also plausible using symmetric keys, where a nodegenerating the self-identifying
    address shares a key with theverifier or its agent. This document specifies symmetric-key
    basedaddress (SBA) generation. The infrastructure support comes withseveral advantages
    including proxy-mode operation; the symmetric keyusage results in efficient operation;
    and finally the use of keyedhashing provides security advantages over CGAs.</p>"
