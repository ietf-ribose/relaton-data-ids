abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the management of versioning within the NFSv4
    family of protocols. It covers the creation of minor versions, the addition of
    optional features to existing minor versions, and the correction of flaws in features
    already published as Proposed Standards. The rules relating to the construction
    of minor versions and the interaction of minor version implementations that appear
    in this document supersede the minor versioning rules in RFC5661.</p>"
