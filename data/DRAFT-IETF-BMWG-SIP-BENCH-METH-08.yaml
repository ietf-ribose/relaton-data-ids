abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Session\n
    \  Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance as described in SIP\n   benchmarking
    terminology document.  The methodology and terminology\n   are to be used for
    benchmarking signaling plane performance with\n   varying signaling and media
    load.  Both scale and establishment rate\n   are measured by signaling plane performance.
    \ The SIP Devices to be\n   benchmarked may be a single device under test (DUT)
    or a system under\n   test (SUT).  Benchmarks can be obtained and compared for
    different\n   types of devices such as SIP Proxy Server, SBC, and server paired\n
    \  with a media relay or Firewall/NAT device.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
