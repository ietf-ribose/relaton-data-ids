abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is
    a data\n   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small\n
    \  code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the\n   need
    for version negotiation.\n\n   In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition
    of CBOR tags.\n   RFC 7049 defines two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (RFC 3339 date/time\n
    \  string) and tag 1 (Posix \"seconds since the epoch\").  Since then,\n   additional
    requirements have become known.  This specification\n   defines a CBOR tag for
    an RFC 3339 date text string, for applications\n   needing a date representation
    without a time.  It is intended as the\n   reference document for the IANA registration
    of the CBOR tag defined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
