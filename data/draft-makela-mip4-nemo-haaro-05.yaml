  content: "\t <t>This document describes a Home Agent assisted Route Optimizationfunctionality
    to IPv4 Network Mobility Protocol. The function isdesigned to facilitate optimal
    routing in cases where all nodes areconnected to a single Home Agent, thus the
    use case is RouteOptimization within single organization or similar entity. Thefunctionality
    adds possibility to discover eligible peer nodes basedon information received
