abstract:
- content: "<p>The temporary addresses described by RFC4941 makes it more difficult
    for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to track the hosts,and it is
    necessary to the home networks,but in the enterprise networks, it is not necessary,
    and some network administrators want to disable the temporary addresses. This
    document tries to provide a solution to these network administrators,and they
    can specify whether the prefixes can be used to generate the temporary addresses.</p>"
