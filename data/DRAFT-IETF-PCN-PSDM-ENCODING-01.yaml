abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a link-specific and load-\ndependent
    packet re-marking mechanism and provides in Differentiated\nServices networks
    feedback to egress nodes about load conditions\nwithin the domain.  It is used
    to support admission control and flow\ntermination decision in a simple way.  This
    document proposes how PCN\nmarks can be encoded into the IP header for packet-specific
    dual\nmarking (PSDM).  PSDM encoding provides three different codepoints:\nnot-ETM,
    not-ThM, and PM.  Excess-traffic-marking may re-mark not-\nETM-packets to PM and
    threshold-marking may re-mark not-ThM-packets\nto PM.\n\nStatus\n\nThis memo is
    posted as an Internet-Draft with an intent to eventually\nbe published as an experimental
    RFC.\n\t </p>\n      "
