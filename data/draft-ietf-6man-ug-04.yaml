abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 addressing architecture includes a unicast interface identifier
    that is used in the creation of many IPv6 addresses. Interface identifiers are
    formed by a variety of methods. This document clarifies that the bits in an interface
    identifier have no generic meaning and that the identifier should be treated as
    an opaque value. In particular, RFC 4291 defines a method by which the Universal
    and Group bits of an IEEE link-layer address are mapped into an IPv6 unicast interface
    identifier. This document clarifies that those two bits are significant only in
    interface identifiers that are derived from an IEEE link-layer address, and updates
    RFC 4291 accordingly.</p>"
