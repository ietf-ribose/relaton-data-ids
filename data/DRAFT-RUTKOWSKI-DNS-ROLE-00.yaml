abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document analyzes the surrounding legal jurisdictional, operational,
    and functional requirements and practices in light of potential transitions of
    Internet DNS name and numbering responsibilities and administration.  It notes
    that although international and domestic bodies like the ITU or FCC possess jurisdiction
    in this area, they are likely to be receptive to participating in and sanctioning
    some form of new adhoc international and domestic alliances effected by service
    providers and operations bodies.                                                         Such
    an approach would also provide a measure of immunity from litigation, and comport
    with traditional Internet community preferences for distributed bottom-up solutions
    undertaken by existing ISP and operations communities whose interests are most
    affected, rather than top-down single organization oversight and control.\n\t
