abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document contains a rough outline of a potential solution toIPv6
    multihoming in order to stimulate discussion.This proposed solution uses 126 bit
    identifiers which are hashes ofpublic keys (know as Cryptographically-based Identifiers)
    which arecreated in an autonomous fashion by every node. When there is a needto
    verify whether a new locator should be used with an identifierthan a public-key
    based challenge-response is used.The proposal allows locator rewriting by (border)
    routers, andensures that the upper layer protocols can operate unmodified in amultihomed
    setting using the stable identifiers.</p>"
