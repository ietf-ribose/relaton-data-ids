abstract:
- content: "<p>A Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) in a fixed wireline access network
    is an Ethernet-centric IP edge router and the aggregation point for subscriber
    traffic. Control Plane (CP) and User Plane (UP) Separation (CUPS) for such a BNG
    improves flexibility and scalability but requires various communication between
    the UP and the CP. China Mobile, Huawei Technologies, and ZTE have developed a
    simple CUPS control channel Protocol (S-CUSP) to support such communication. This
    document is not an IETF standard and does not have IETF consensus. S-CUSP is presented
    here to make its specification conveniently available to the Internet community
    to enable diagnosis and interoperability.</p>"
