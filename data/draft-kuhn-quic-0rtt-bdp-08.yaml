abstract:
- content: "<p>0-RTT mechanisms reduce the time it takes for the first bytes of application
    data to be processed in a transport connection and can greatly reduce connection
    latency during setup. The 0-RTT transport features described by quic-transport
    help clients establish secure connections with a minimal number of round-trips.
    This document describes a generic method to exchange path parameters relating
    to transport. The additional transport parameters can help a connection that continues
    after an interruption or restarts by sharing connection properties. They can be
    used to increase the performance for a path with large RTT.</p>"
