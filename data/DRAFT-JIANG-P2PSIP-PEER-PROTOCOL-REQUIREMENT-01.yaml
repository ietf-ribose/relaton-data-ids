abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   In this draft, we present what P2PSIP should achieve - a
    distributed\n   location service.  Then we compare the differences between C/S
    SIP\n   and P2P SIP and point out that some features which are not\n   standardized
    in C/S SIP should be addressed in the P2P SIP case.\n   After analyzing some problems,
    some requirements of Peer protocol are\n   proposed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
