abstract:
  content: "<p>Today, with the rapid rise of home networking, there is a need forsimple
    mechanisms of IPv4 address allocation and name resolution. Thisdocument describes
    the behavior of the mini-DHCP server, a small scaleDHCP server that is typically
    implemented as part of a home gateway.As described in this document, the mini-DHCP
    server is capable ofallocating addresses either in single or multi-segment networks.
    Itsupports dynamic DNS, and is capable of automatically detecting thepresence
    of a full-fledged DHCP server, or other mini-DHCP servers, andshutting down as
    required.</p>"
