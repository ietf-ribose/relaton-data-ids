abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, with the rapid rise of home networking, there is a need for
    simple mechanisms of IPv4 address allocation and name resolution. This document
    describes the behavior of the mini-DHCP server, a small scale DHCP server that
    is typically implemented as part of a home gateway. As described in this document,
    the mini-DHCP server is capable of allocating addresses either in single or multi-segment
    networks. It supports dynamic DNS, and is capable of automatically detecting the
    presence of a full-fledged DHCP server, or other mini-DHCP servers, and shutting
    down as required.</p>"
