abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow for setting
    up\n   networks so that traffic is distributed in an optimal way and does\n   not
    rely on centralized deployed anchors to provide IP mobility\n   support.\n\n   There
    are many different approaches to address Distributed Mobility\n   Management,
    as for example extending network-based mobility protocols\n   (like Proxy Mobile
    IPv6), or client-based mobility protocols (as\n   Mobile IPv6), among others.
    \ This document follows the former\n   approach, and proposes a solution based
    on Proxy Mobile IPv6 in which\n   mobility sessions are anchored at the last IP
    hop router (called\n   mobility anchor and access router).  The mobility anchor
    and access\n   router is an enhanced access router which is also able to operate
    as\n   local mobility anchor or mobility access gateway, on a per prefix\n   basis.
    \ The document focuses on the required extensions to\n   effectively support simultaneously
    anchoring several flows at\n   different distributed gateways.\n\n   This document
    introduces the concept of distributed logical\n   interface, which is a software
    construct that allows to easily hide\n   the change of anchor from the mobile
    node.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
