abstract:
- content: "<p>SRv6 mobile user plane is standardized in IETF. It accomplishes the
    mobile user-plane functions in a simple, flexible and scalable manner, by utilizing
    the network programming nature of SRv6. It leverages common native IPv6 data plane
    and creates interoperable overlays with underlay optimization. This document discusses
    the solution approach and its architectural benefits of common data plane across
    domains and across overlay/ underlay.</p>"
