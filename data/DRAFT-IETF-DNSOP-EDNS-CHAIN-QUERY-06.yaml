abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an EDNS0 extension that can be used by
    a\n   security-aware validating resolver configured to use a Forwarder to\n   send
    a single query, requesting a complete validation path along with\n   the regular
    query answer.  The reduction in queries potentially\n   lowers the latency and
    reduces the need to send multiple queries at\n   once.  This extension mandates
    the use of source IP verified\n   transport such as TCP or UDP with EDNS-COOKIE
    so it cannot be abused\n   in amplification attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
