abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document addresses issues that arise when TCP is used
    to support\n   traffic that exhibits periods where the transmission rate is limited\n
    \  by the application rather than the congestion window.  It updates TCP\n   to
    allow a TCP sender to restart quickly following either an idle or\n   application-limited
    interval.  The method is expected to benefit\n   application-limited TCP applications,
    while also providing an\n   appropriate response if congestion is experienced.\n\n
    \  It also evaluates TCP Congestion Window Validation, CWV, an IETF\n   experimental
    specification defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that\n   CWV sought to address
    important issues, but failed to deliver a\n   widely used solution.  This document
    therefore proposes an update to\n   the status of RFC 2861 by recommending it
    is moved from Experimental\n   to Historic status, and that it is replaced by
    the current\n   specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
