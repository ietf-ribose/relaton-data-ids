abstract:
  content: <p>Concerns about the growth of the global routing table has led toproposals
    for short-term FIB-reduction and long-term RIB-reductionsolutions. The simplest
    type of FIB-reduction solution is "FIBaggregation", whereby individual routers
    locally reduce the FIB sizewithout any changes to external operation. The draft[I-D.zhang-fibaggregation]
    describes and analyzes several FIBaggregation schemes. This current draft describes
    and analyzesanother point in the design space, called SMALTA. Compared to theapproaches
    in [I-D.zhang-fibaggregation], SMALTA provides betteraggregation and does not
    introduce non-routable entries in the FIB,but is also more complex.</p>
