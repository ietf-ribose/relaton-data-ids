abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes version 2 of the Web Cache Communication\n
    \  Protocol (WCCP).  The WCCP V2 protocol specifies interactions between\n   one
    or more routers and one or more web-caches.  The interaction may\n   take place
    within an IPv4 or IPv6 network.  The purpose of the\n   interaction is to establish
    and maintain the transparent redirection\n   of selected types of traffic flowing
    through a group of routers (or\n   similar devices).  The selected traffic is
    redirected to a group of\n   web-caches (or other traffic optimisation devices)
    with the aim of\n   optimising resource usage and lowering response times.\n\n
    \  The protocol does not specify any interaction between the web-caches\n   within
    a group or between a web-cache and a web-server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
