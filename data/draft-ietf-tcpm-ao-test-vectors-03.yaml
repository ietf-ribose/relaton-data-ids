abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides test vectors to validate implementations of
    the two mandatory authentication algorithms specified for the TCP Authentication
    Option over both IPv4 and IPv6. This includes validation of the key derivation
    function (KDF) based on a set of test connection parameters as well as validation
    of the message authentication code (MAC). Vectors are provided for both currently
    required pairs of KDF and MAC algorithms: one based on SHA-1 and the other on
    AES-128. The vectors also validate both whole TCP segments as well as segments
    whose options are excluded for middlebox traversal.</p>"
