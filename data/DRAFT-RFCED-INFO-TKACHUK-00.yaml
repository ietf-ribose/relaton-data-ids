abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo is the specification of the code page, which was
    originally\n   developed for the transmission of texts in the Ukrainian language\n
    \  through networks, and in particular the networks, employing Unix\n   operating
    systems. It is, however, operating-system-neutral, and is\n   used in various
    situations, just as its Russian language counterpart\n   KOI-8R.\n     \n   With
    some minor exceptions, this specification can be considered\n   to be an extension
    of KOI8-R (RFC-1489). The present edition of the\n   specification is the result
    of the wide concensus reached after many\n   prolonged exchanges and discussions,
    which took place in Ukraine and\n   on some Usenet conferences covering Ukraine
    and read by the public\n   who employs the Ukrainian language.\n\t </p>\n      "
