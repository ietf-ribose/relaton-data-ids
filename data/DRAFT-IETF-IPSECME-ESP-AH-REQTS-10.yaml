abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document updates the Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation
    Requirements for the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header
    (AH). It also adds usage guidance to help in the selection of these algorithms.\n\n
    ESP and AH protocols make use of various cryptographic algorithms to provide confidentiality
    and/or data origin authentication to protected data communications in the IP Security
    (IPsec) architecture. To ensure interoperability between disparate implementations,
    the IPsec standard specifies a set of mandatory-to- implement algorithms. This
    document specifies the current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP
    and AH, specifies algorithms that should be implemented because they may be promoted
    to mandatory at some future time, and also recommends against the implementation
    of some obsolete algorithms. Usage guidance is also provided to help the user
    of ESP and AH best achieve their security goals through appropriate choices of
    cryptographic algorithms.\n\t </p>\n      "
