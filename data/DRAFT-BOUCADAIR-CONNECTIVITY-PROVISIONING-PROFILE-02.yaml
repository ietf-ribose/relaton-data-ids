abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Connectivity Provisioning Profile
    (CPP)\n   and proposes a CPP Template to capture IP connectivity requirements\n
    \  to be met in the context of delivery of services (e.g.  Voice over IP\n   or
    IP TV) which are to be plugged upon an IP/MPLS infrastructure.\n   The CPP defines
    the set of IP transfer parameters to be supported by\n   the underlying IP/MPLS
    transport network together with a reachability\n   scope and bandwidth/capacity
    needs.  Appropriate performance metrics\n   such as one-way delay, one-way delay
    variation are used to\n   characterize an IP transfer service.  Both global and
    restricted\n   reachability scopes can be captured in the CPP.\n\n   Having the
    generic CPP template allows for (1) automating the process\n   of service negotiation
    and activation, thus accelerating service\n   provisioning, (2) setting the (traffic)
    objectives of Traffic\n   Engineering functions and service management functions
    and (3)\n   enriching service and network management systems with 'decision-\n
    \  making' capabilities based on negotiated/offered CPPs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
