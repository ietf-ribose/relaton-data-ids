abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
    records\n   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet\n
    \  traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document is\n   to
    assist the IPPM WG in designing a solution for those deployments\n   where the
    integrity of IOAM data fields is a concern.  This document\n   proposes several
    methods to ensure the integrity of IOAM data fields.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
