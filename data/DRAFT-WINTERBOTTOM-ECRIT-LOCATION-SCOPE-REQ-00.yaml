abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Special kinds of services require user location information
    to be\n   authenticated and validated within a specific operating domain.  An\n
    \  example of such a service is the emergency services network, where\n   the
    location of a caller is known with in the domain of the telephone\n   network,
    while the name or true identity of the caller is not\n   intrinsically known.
    \ This paper describes the entities and key\n   requirements necessary to provide
    such a service in an internet\n   environment.\n\t </p>\n      "
