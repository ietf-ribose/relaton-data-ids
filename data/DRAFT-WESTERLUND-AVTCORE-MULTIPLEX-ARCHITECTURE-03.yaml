abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a flexible protocol possible
    to\n   use in a wide range of applications and network and system\n   topologies.
    \ This flexibility and the implications of different\n   choices should be understood
    by any application developer using RTP.\n   To facilitate that understanding,
    this document contains an in-depth\n   discussion of the usage of RTP's multiplexing
    points; the RTP session\n   and the Synchronisation Source Identifier (SSRC).
    \ The document tries\n   to give guidance and source material for an analysis
    on the most\n   suitable choices for the application being designed.\n\n\t </p>\n
