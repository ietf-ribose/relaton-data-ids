abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Elliptic curves with pairing are useful tools for constructing\n
    \  cryptographic primitives.  In this memo, we specify domain parameters\n   of
    Barreto-Naehrig curve (BN-curve) [5].  The BN-curve is an elliptic\n   curve suitable
    for pairings and allows us to achieve high security\n   and efficiency of cryptographic
    schemes.  This memo specifies domain\n   parameters of two 254-bit BN-curves [1]
    [2] which allow us to obtain\n   efficient implementations and domain parameters
    of 224, 256, 384, and\n   512-bit BN-curves which are compliant with ISO/IEC 15946-5[3].\n
    \  Furthermore, this memo organizes differences between types of\n   elliptic
    curves specified in ISO document and often used in open\n   source softwares,
    which are called M-type and D-type\n   respectively[21].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
