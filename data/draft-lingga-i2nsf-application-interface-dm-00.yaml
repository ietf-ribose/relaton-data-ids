abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an information model and a YANG data model
    for the Application Interface between an Interface to Network Security Functions
    (I2NSF) Analyzer and Security Controller in an I2NSF system in a Network Functions
    Virtualization (NFV) environment. The information model and YANG data model is
    based on the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface for enabling feedback delivery based
    on the information received from the Network Security Function (NSF).</p>"
