    considerations about the address selection issues mainly raised in [RFC5220].
    This considerations led to the revision of RFC 3484 [RFC6724], and Address Selection
    DHCP option. Although it does not perfectly match the current state, this document
    captures the past discussion and considerations for the historical record.</p>"
