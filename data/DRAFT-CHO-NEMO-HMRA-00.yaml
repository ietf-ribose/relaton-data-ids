abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     This document describes needs for hierarchical mobile router\n
    \    advertisement for nested mobile networks. When ingress and egress\n     interfaces
    of a Mobile Router are both wireless, the MR cannot\n     distinguish the Router
    Advertisement of the parent MR from the RA\n     of the child MR. To maintain
    hierarchical information of wireless\n     nested mobile networks, RA message
    needs to be extended to deliver\n     additional information for hierarchy.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
