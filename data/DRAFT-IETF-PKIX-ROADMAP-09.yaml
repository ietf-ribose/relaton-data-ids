abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides an overview or 'roadmap' of the work done
    by \nthe IETF PKIX working group. It describes some of the terminology \nused
    in the working group's documents, and the theory behind an \nX.509-based Public
    Key Infrastructure, Privilege Management \nInfrastructure (PMI), and Time Stamping
    and Data Certification \nInfrastructures. It identifies each document developed
    by the PKIX \nworking group, and describes the relationships among the various
    \ndocuments. It also provides advice to would-be PKIX implementors \nabout some
    of the issues discussed at length during PKIX development, \nin hopes of making
    it easier to build implementations that will \nactually interoperate. \n    \n\n\t
