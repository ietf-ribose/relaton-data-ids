abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document aims at simple, interoperable, and automated
    PKI\n   management operations covering typical use cases of industrial and\n   IoT
    scenarios.  This is achieved by profiling the Certificate\n   Management Protocol
    (CMP), the related Certificate Request Message\n   Format (CRMF), and HTTP-based
    or CoAP-based transfer in a succinct\n   but sufficiently detailed and self-contained
    way.  To make secure\n   certificate management for simple scenarios and constrained
    devices\n   as lightweight as possible, only the most crucial types of operations\n
    \  and options are specified as mandatory.  More special and complex use\n   cases
    are supported as well, by features specified as recommended or\n   optional.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
