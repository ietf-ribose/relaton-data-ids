abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) provides a
    reliable\n   communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar
    to\n   the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  With the widespread\n   deployment
    of Network Address Translators (NAT), specialized code has\n   been added to NAT
    functions for TCP that allows multiple hosts to\n   reside behind a NAT function
    and yet share a single IPv4 address,\n   even when two hosts (behind a NAT function)
    choose the same port\n   numbers for their connection.  This additional code is
    sometimes\n   classified as Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT).\n\n   This
    document describes the protocol extensions needed for the SCTP\n   endpoints and
    the mechanisms for NAT functions necessary to provide\n   similar features of
    NAPT in the single point and multipoint traversal\n   scenario.\n\n   Finally,
    a YANG module for SCTP NAT is defined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
