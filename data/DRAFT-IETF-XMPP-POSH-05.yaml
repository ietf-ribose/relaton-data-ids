abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Experience has shown that it is difficult to deploy proper
    PKIX\n   certificates for TLS in multi-tenant environments.  As a result,\n   domains
    hosted in such environments often deploy applications using\n   certificates that
    identify the hosting service, not the hosted\n   domain.  Such deployments force
    end users and peer services to accept\n   a certificate with an improper identifier,
    resulting in degraded\n   security.  This document defines two methods that make
    it easier to\n   deploy certificates for proper server identity checking in non-HTTP\n
    \  application protocols.  While these methods were developed for use in\n   the
    Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a Domain\n   Name Association
    (DNA) prooftype, they might also be usable in other\n   non-HTTP application protocols.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
