abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are some situations in which multiplexing a number of
    small\n   packets into a bigger one is desirable.  For example, a number of\n
    \  small packets can be sent together between a pair of machines if they\n   share
    a common network path.  Thus, the traffic profile can be\n   shifted from small
    to larger packets, reducing the network overhead\n   and the number of packets
    per second to be managed by intermediate\n   routers.\n\n   This document describes
    Simplemux, a protocol able to encapsulate a\n   number of packets belonging to
    different protocols into a single\n   packet.  It includes the \"Protocol\" field
    on each multiplexing\n   header, thus allowing the inclusion of a number of packets
    belonging\n   to different protocols (multiplexed packets) on a packet of another\n
    \  protocol (tunneling protocol).\n\n   In order to reduce the overhead, the size
    of the multiplexing headers\n   is kept very low (it may be a single byte when
    multiplexing small\n   packets) .\n\n\t </p>\n      "
