abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes the use of the RSA Signature algorithm [RSA]
    as \nan authentication algorithm within the revised IPSEC Encapsulating \nSecurity
    Payload [ESP] and the revised IPSEC Authentication Header \n[AH]. The use of a
    digital signature algorithm such as RSA provides \norigin authentication, even
    when ESP and AH are used to secure group \ndata flows. \nFurther information on
    the other components necessary for ESP and AH \nimplementations is provided by
    [ROADMAP].\n\t </p>\n      "
