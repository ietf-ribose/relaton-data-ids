abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In Mobile-IPv6, Mobile Node is dependent on a single Home Agent
    for \nthe seamless roaming over the Internet. Mobile-IPv6 also allows  \ndeployment
    of multiple Home Agents on the subnet for providing \ncontinuous service to Mobile
    Node in case of serving Home Agent \nfailure. But switching of service from the
    failed Home Agent to \nanother functional Home Agent on the Home Subnet is problematic
    and \nthe base Mobile-IPv6 specifications does not currently have\nwell-described
    solutions. This document aims to describe and \nillustrate these problems, and
    propose some guidelines for possible \nsolutions.\n\t </p>\n      "
