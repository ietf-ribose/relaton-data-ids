abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a data model for security management
    that is\n   based on Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) by using\n
    \  Network Functions Virtualization (NFV).  This document proposes a\n   security
    management architecture based on I2NSF framework.  Note that\n   the I2NSF framework
    consists of I2NSF User, Security Management\n   System (i.e., Security Controller
    and Developer's Management System),\n   and NSF instances in the lowest layer
    of the framework.  I2NSF User\n   consists of Application Logic, Policy Updater,
    and Event Collector.\n   Security Controller consists of Security Policy Manager
    and NSF\n   Capability Manager.  This document explains a data model to perform\n
    \  the missions for a security service (i.e., VoIP-VoLTE) in I2NSF\n   security
    management system.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
