abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Host Discovery and Configuration Protocol (SHDCP) provides
    a mechanism used when an Internet host with almost no configuration has to be
    discovered and, at the same time, configured to some IPv4 network. This task can
    not be accomplished by DHCP. Other known protocols are too complicated or proprietary.
    The key feature of the proposed protocol is simplicity.</p>"
