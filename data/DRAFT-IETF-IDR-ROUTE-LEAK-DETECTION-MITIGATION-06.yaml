abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 7908 provides a definition of the route leak problem, and
    also\n   enumerates several types of route leaks.  This document first\n   examines
    which of those route-leak types are detected and mitigated\n   by the existing
    origin validation (OV) [RFC 6811].  It is recognized\n   that OV offers a limited
    detection and mitigation capability against\n   route leaks.  This document specifies
    enhancements that significantly\n   extend the route-leak prevention, detection,
    and mitigation\n   capabilities of BGP.  One solution component involves intra-AS\n
    \  messaging from ingress router to egress router using a BGP Community\n   or
    Attribute.  This intra-AS messaging prevents the AS from causing\n   route leaks.
    \ Another solution component involves carrying a per-hop\n   route-leak protection
    (RLP) field in BGP updates.  The RLP fields are\n   proposed to be carried in
    a new optional transitive attribute, called\n   BGP RLP attribute.  The RLP attribute
    helps with detection and\n   mitigation of route leaks at ASes downstream from
    the leaking AS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
