abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the general problem of network stratum
    query\nfor application optimization. Network Stratum query is an ability to\nquery
    the network from an application controller such as those used\nin Data Centers
    so that application controller decisions such as\nserver assignment or virtual
    machine instantiation/migration could be\nperformed with better knowledge of the
    underlying network conditions.\n\nAs application servers are distributed geographically
    across Data\nCenters, many application-related decisions such as which server
    to\nassign a new client or where to instantiate/migrate virtual machines\nwill
    suffer from sub-optimality unless the underlying network\nconditions are factored
    in the decision process. The lack of network\nawareness may result in not meeting
    the end-user service objective\nfor some key applications like video gaming/conferencing
    that require\nstringent latency and bandwidth requirement.\n\t </p>\n      "
