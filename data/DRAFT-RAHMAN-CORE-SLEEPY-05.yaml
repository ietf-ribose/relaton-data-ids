abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is a specialized web transfer protocol for constrained
    devices.\n   These devices typically have some combination of limited battery\n
    \  power, small memory footprint and low throughput links.  It is\n   expected
    that in CoAP networks there will be a certain portion of\n   devices that are
    \"sleepy\" and which may occasionally go into a sleep\n   mode (i.e. go into a
    low power state to conserve power) and\n   temporarily suspend CoAP protocol communication.
    \ This document\n   proposes a minimal and efficient mechanism building on the
    Resource\n   Directory (RD) functionality to enhance sleepy node support in CoAP\n
    \  networks.  The RD functionality may be incorporated as part of a CoAP\n   Proxy.\n\n\t
