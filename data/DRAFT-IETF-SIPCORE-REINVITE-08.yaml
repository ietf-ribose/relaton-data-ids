abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The procedures for handling SIP re-INVITEs are described in RFC
    3261.  Implementation and deployment experience has uncovered a number of issues
    with the original documentation, and this document provides additional procedures
    that update the original specification to address those issues.  In particular,
    this document defines in which situations a UAS (User Agent Server) should generate
    a success response and in which situations a UAS should generate an error response
    to a re-INVITE.  Additionally, this document defines further details of procedures
    related to target-refresh requests. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t </p>\n      "
