abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF is currently proposing an\narchitecture
    for controlling media services.  The Session Initiation\nProtocol (SIP) will be
    used as the signalling protocol which provides\nmany inherent capabilities for
    message routing.  In addition to such\nsignalling properties, a need exists for
    intelligent, application\nlevel media service selection based on non-static signalling\nproperties.
    \ This is especially true when considered in conjunction\nwith deployment architectures
    that include 1:M and M:M combinations\nof Application Servers and Media Servers.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
