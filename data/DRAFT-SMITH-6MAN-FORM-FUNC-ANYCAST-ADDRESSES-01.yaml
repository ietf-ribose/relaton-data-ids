abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, IPv6 anycast addresses are chosen from within the
    existing\n   IPv6 unicast address space, with the addresses nominated as anycast\n
    \  addresses through configuration.  An alternative scheme would be to\n   have
    a special class of addresses for use as anycast addresses.  This\n   memo proposes
    a distinct general anycast addressing class for IPv6,\n   and a more specific
    scheme for functional anycast addresses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
