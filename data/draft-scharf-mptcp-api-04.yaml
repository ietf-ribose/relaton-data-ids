abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Multipath TCP (MPTCP) adds the capability of using multiple paths
    toa regular TCP session. Even though it is designed to be totallybackward compatible
    to applications, the data transport differscompared to regular TCP, and there
    are several additional degrees offreedom that applications may wish to exploit.
    This documentsummarizes the impact that MPTCP may have on applications, such aschanges
    in performance. Furthermore, it discusses compatibilityissues of MPTCP in combination
    with non-MPTCP-aware applications.Finally, the document describes a basic application
    interface forMPTCP-aware applications that provides access to multipath addressinformation
    and a level of control equivalent to regular TCP.</p>"
