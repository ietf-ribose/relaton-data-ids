abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTCP with a new
    RTCP\nXR (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding media\ntransmission
    or reception quality, as proposed in RFC5968.  This memo\nsuggests that a new
    block should contain a single metric or a small\nnumber of metrics relevant to
    a single parameter of interest or\nconcern, rather than containing a number of
    metrics which attempt to\nprovide full coverage of all those parameters of concern
    to a\nspecific application.  Applications may then \"mix and match\" to\ncreate
    a set of blocks which covers their set of concerns.  Where\npossible, a specific
    block should be designed to be re-usable across\nmore than one application, for
    example, for all of voice, streaming\naudio and video.\n\t </p>\n      "
