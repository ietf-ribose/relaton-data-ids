abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a key management protocol for a mobile
    \ncomputer to securely obtain keying material with an access router \nin a visited
    link for use as the local binding security \nassociation with the router. The
    protocol enables an IPv6 node to \nutilize the access router as its temporary
    home agent and continue \nto receive packets destined to its care-of address with
    the \ntemporary home agent as well as to send packets from this care-of \naddress
    when the nodes change its access router. To support this \noperation, two new
    types of mobility headers and one Neighbor \nDiscovery option are defined. All
    IPv6 nodes MAY support this \nprotocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
