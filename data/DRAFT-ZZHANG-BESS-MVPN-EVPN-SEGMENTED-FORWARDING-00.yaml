abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RFC6513] and [RFC6514] specify MVPN Inter-AS Segmentation\n
    \  procedures.  [RFC7524] specifies MVPN Inter-Area Segmentation\n   procedures.
    \ [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-bum-procedure-updates] specifies\n   EVPN BUM Inter-Region
    Segmentation Procedures.  Several other\n   documents also touch upon the segmentation
    topic.  The forwarding at\n   the segmentation points has been assumed to be label
    switching,\n   subject to certain limitations.  The purpose of this document is
    to\n   provide a review of segmentation points' available forwarding options\n
    \  and limitations, and to clarify and expand some procedures.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
