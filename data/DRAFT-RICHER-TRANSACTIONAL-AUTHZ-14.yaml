abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a mechanism for delegating authorization
    to a\n   piece of software, and conveying that delegation to the software.\n   This
    delegation can include access to a set of APIs as well as\n   information passed
    directly to the software.\n\n   This document has been prepared by the GNAP working
    group design team\n   of Kathleen Moriarty, Fabien Imbault, Dick Hardt, Mike Jones,
    and\n   Justin Richer.  This document is intended as a starting point for the\n
    \  working group and includes decision points for discussion and\n   agreement.
    \ Many of the features in this proposed protocol can be\n   accomplished in a
    number of ways.  Where possible, the editor has\n   included notes and discussion
    from the design team regarding the\n   options as understood.\n\t </p>\n      "
