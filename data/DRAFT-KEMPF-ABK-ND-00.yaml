abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When an IPv6 node receives a Router Advertisement, how does it
    \nknow that the node which sent the advertisement is authorized to \nannounce
    that it routes the prefix? When an IPv6 node receives a \nNeighbor Advertisement
    message, how does it know that the node \nsending the message is, in fact, authorized
    to claim the binding? \nThe answer is, in the absence of a preconfigured IPsec
    security \nassociation among the nodes on the link and the routers, they \ndon't.
    In this draft, a lightweight protocol is described for \nsecuring the signaling
    involved in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery. The \nprotocol allows a node receiving a
    Router Advertisement or a \nNeighbor Advertisement to have the confidence that
    the message was \nauthorized by the legitimate owner of the address or prefix
    being \nadvertised without requiring a preconfigured IPsec security \nassociation.
    A certain degree of infrastructural support is \nrequired, but not any more than
    is currently common for public \naccess IP networks. The protocol is based on
    some results in \nidentity based cryptosystems that allow a publicly known \nidentifier
    to function as a public key.\n\t </p>\n      "
