abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain
    experts\n   to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models\n
    \  in the Internet of Things.  It was created as a common language for\n   use
    in the development of the One Data Model liaison organization\n   (OneDM) definitions.
    \ Tools convert this format to database formats\n   and other serializations as
    needed.\n\n   An SDF specification describes definitions of SDF Objects and their\n
    \  associated interactions (Events, Actions, Properties), as well as the\n   Data
    types for the information exchanged in those interactions.\n\n   A JSON format
    representation of SDF 1.0 is defined in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
