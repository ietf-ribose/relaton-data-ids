abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP has been used as the routing protocol in many hyper-scale
    data\n   centers.  This document proposes a BGP neighbor autodiscovery\n   mechanism
    that greatly simplifies BGP deployments.  This mechanism is\n   very useful for
    those hyper-scale data centers where BGP is used as\n   the routing protocol.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
