abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft requests development of detailed specifications for
    the\ntechnical and operational requirements for an Internet-based\nInternational
    Emergency Preparedness Scheme (IEPS) as\ndefined by ITU-T Recommendation E.106.
    Public\ntelecommunications services have long had such a\nscheme, to ensure priority
    handling of telephone\ncommunications, such as during natural disasters.  As a\nwide
    range of communication services increasingly rely\nupon the family of specifications
    related to Internet\nProtocol (IP), IETF work needs to include consideration\nand
    provision for supporting IEPS. This work needs to\nbe addressed in two phases
    concurrently - 1) interface\nfor transition from today's public switched telephone\nnetwork
    (PSTN) to IP-based network telephony services,\nand 2) additional and enhanced
    capabilities, such as\napplication-specific IEPS services.  An Email list for
    discussion\nand a Web site for background and documents has been established\nto
    assist the work\n\t </p>\n      "
