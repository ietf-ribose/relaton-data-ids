abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p> This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB)\n for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n
    \  In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of the\n   DYMO
    MANET Routing process on a router.  The DYMO MIB also reports\n   state information,
    i.e., Routing Information Base entries,\n   performance metrics, i.e., counter
    of the number Routing Messages,\n   and notifications.  In addition to configuration,
    this additional state and performance information is useful to management stations\n
    \  troubleshooting routing problems.\n\t </p>\n      "
