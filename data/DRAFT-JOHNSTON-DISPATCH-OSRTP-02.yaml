abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Opportunistic Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (OSRTP) allows\n
    \  encrypted media to be used in environments where support for\n   encryption
    is not known in advance, and not required.  OSRTP is an\n   implementation of
    Opportunistic Security, as defined in RFC 7435.\n   OSRTP does not require advanced
    SDP extensions or features and is\n   fully backwards compatible with existing
    secure and insecure\n   implementations.  OSRTP is not specific to any key management\n
    \  technique for SRTP.  OSRTP is a transitional approach useful for\n   migrating
    existing deployments of real-time communications to a fully\n   encrypted and
    authenticated state.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
