abstract:
- content: "<p>CMLP is proposed as a tool System and Network Administrators can use
    to rapidly identify maintenance work performed on local and remote networked hosts
    including routers, switches, servers, and firewalls as well as other networked
    devices. The primary drivers for creation of CMLP are improving network availability
    and decreasing restoral time through rapid identifiation of change activity in
    the enterprise network environment.</p>"
