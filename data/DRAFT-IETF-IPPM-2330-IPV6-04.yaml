abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo updates the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework
    RFC\n   2330 with new considerations for measurement methodology and testing.\n
    \  It updates the definition of standard-formed packets in RFC 2330 to\n   include
    IPv6 packets, deprecates the definition of minimum standard-\n   formed packet,
    and augments distinguishing aspects of packets,\n   referred to as Type-P for
    test packets in RFC 2330.  This memo\n   identifies that IPv4-IPv6 co-existence
    can challenge measurements\n   within the scope of the IPPM Framework.  Exemplary
    use cases include,\n   but are not limited to IPv4-IPv6 translation, NAT, protocol\n
    \  encapsulation, IPv6 header compression, or use of IPv6 over Low-Power\n   Wireless
    Area Networks (6LoWPAN).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
