abstract:
- content: "<p>The Email Address Internationalization (SMTPUTF8) extension allows
    UTF-8 characters in mail header fields. Upgraded POP and IMAP servers support
    internationalized Email messages. If a POP/IMAP client does not support Email
    Address Internationalization, POP/IMAP servers cannot send Internationalized Email
    Headers to the client and cannot remove the message. To avoid the situation, this
    document describes a conversion mechanism for internationalized Email messages
    to be in traditional message format. In the process, message elements requiring
    internationalized treatment are recoded or removed and receivers are able to know
    that they received messages containing such elements even if they cannot treat
    the internationalized elements.</p>"
