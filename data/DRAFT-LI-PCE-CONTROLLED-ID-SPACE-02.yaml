abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides\n   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n
    \  computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n   The
    Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol\n   Label Switching
    (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs) using PCEP.  Furthermore,
    PCEP can be used for computing paths\n   in SR networks.\n\n   Stateful PCE provide
    active control of MPLS-TE LSPs via PCEP, for a\n   model where the PCC delegates
    control over one or more locally\n   configured LSPs to the PCE.  Further, stateful
    PCE could also create\n   and delete PCE-initiated LSPs itself.  A PCE-based central
    controller\n   (PCECC) simplify the processing of a distributed control plane
    by\n   integrating with elements of Software-Defined Networking (SDN).\n\n   In
    some use cases, such as PCECC or Binding Segment Identifier (SID)\n   for Segment
    Routing (SR), there are requirements for a stateful PCE\n   to make allocation
    of labels, SIDs, etc.  These use cases require PCE\n   aware of various identifier
    spaces where to make allocations on\n   behalf of PCC.  This document describes
    a mechanism for PCC to inform\n   the PCE of the identifier space under its control
    via PCEP.  The\n   identifier could be MPLS label, SID or any other to-be-defined\n
    \  identifier to be allocated by a PCE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
