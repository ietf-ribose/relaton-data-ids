abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the major advantages of SCTP is that it supports multi-homed
    communication. A multi-homed SCTP end-point has the ability to withstand network
    failures by migrating the traffic from an inactive network to an active one. However,
    if the [RFC4960] specified failover operation is followed there can be a significant
    delay in the migration to the active destination addresses, thus severely reducing
    the effectiveness of SCTP multi-homed operation. The memo complements RFC4960
    by the introduction of the Potentially Failed state and associated new Quick Failover
    operation to apply during network failure and specifies for SCTP senders to support
    this more performance optimal failover procedure as an add-on to the [RFC4960]
    failover operation. The memo in addition complements [RFC4960] by introduction
    of alternative switchover operation modes for the data transfer path management
    after a failover. These operation modes offer for more performance optimal operation
    in some network environments. From the perspective of this memo the implementation
    of the additional switchover operation modes is considered optional. The procedures
    defined require only minimal modifications to the current specification. The procedures
    are sender-side only and do not impact the SCTP receiver.</p>"
