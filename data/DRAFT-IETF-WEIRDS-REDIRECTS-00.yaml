abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The traditional WHOIS protocol has several important shortcomings,\n
    \  and over the past few years several approaches to a better WHOIS have\n   been
    discussed and proposed.\n\n   Among these shortcomings, different registries operate
    different\n   WHOIS services.  For users this implies that several WHOIS queries
    to\n   different registries may be necessary in order to obtain data for a\n   given
    resource.\n\n   This document describes a proof-of-concept redirection service
    for\n   RESTful WHOIS queries as implemented by LACNIC.  This service allows\n
    \  users to query a single WHOIS service and be redirected to the\n   authoritative
    registry.\n\n   The main goal of this document is to encourage discussion on the\n
    \  topics of Joint WHOIS services and query redirection in a RESTful\n   WHOIS
    world.\n\n   The solution implemented by LACNIC proposed here applies to numbering\n
    \  resources (IPv4, IPv6 and autonomous system numbers).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
