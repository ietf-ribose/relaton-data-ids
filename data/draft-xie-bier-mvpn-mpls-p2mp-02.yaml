abstract:
- content: "<p>MVPN is a widely deployed multicast service with mLDP or RSVP-TE P2MP
    as the P-tunnel. Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that
    provides optimal multicast forwarding without requiring intermediate routers to
    maintain any per-flow state by using a multicast-specific BIER header. This document
    introduces a seamless transition mechanism from legacy MVPN using mLDP/RSVP-TE
    P2MP to MVPN using BIER by combining P2MP and BIER to form a P2MP based BIER as
    the P-tunnel. This will leverage the widely supported P2MP capability in both
    data-plane and control-plane, and will help introducing BIER in existing multicast
    networks to shift multicast delivery from MVPN using mLDP/RSVP-TE P2MP by two
    means: It is easier and more efficient for legacy routers to support BIER forwarding
    on the basis of widely supported P2MP forwarding, and it is more seamless for
    existing multicast networks to deploy BIER when some routers do not support BIER
    forwarding.</p>"
