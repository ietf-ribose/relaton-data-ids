abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IPv4 migrating to IPv6 is a network layer's issue, it is not easy
    tomandate all the applications in the host to change in the firstplace, the network
    layer may have to have a solution to support theconventional IPv4 appliations
    during the IPv6 migration such as inthe dual stack or IPv6 only network, especially
    when multipleapplications need to be supported. This document describes amechanism
    for providing a host-based IPv6 translation technologywhich could guarantee IPv4
    application backward compatibility.Applications need not necessarily to understand
    what the networkconnection and the destination's IP family type are. A well-knownprefix
    could be used when the destination is public IPv4 Internet'saddress.</p>"
