abstract:
- content: "<p>The interfaces of RESTful, hypertext-driven applications consist of
    reusable, self-descriptive components such as Internet media types and link relation
    types. This document defines a template that application designers can use to
    describe their application's interface in a structured way so that other parties
    can develop interoperable clients and servers or reuse the components in their
    own applications.</p>"
