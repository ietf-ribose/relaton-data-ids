abstract:
- content: "<p>The BULK DNS resource record type defines a method of pattern-based
    creation of DNS resource records based on numeric substrings of query names. The
    intent of BULK is to simplify generic assignments in a memory-efficient way that
    can be easily shared between the primary and secondary nameservers for a zone.</p>"
