abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a model for configuring and mapping
    PMIP QoS\n   parameters of a mobile network session to the corresponding\n   connection
    at a WiFi Access Point. In congested network conditions,\n   it is useful for
    an MN's flows to be policed and shaped at the WLC\n   and WiFi AP to match  bandwidth
    constraints or service priority of\n   the user's subscription. Applying similar
    QoS management at the WiFi\n   AP and WLC allows optimal use of network resources.
    Currently, the\n   WiFi AP does not have information on the MNs subscribed bandwidth,
    or\n   relative priority of its flows or services for per user QoS handling\n
    \  at the WiFi AP. This document provides a model for mapping PMIP QoS\n   to
    corresponding 802.11e QoS parameters.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
