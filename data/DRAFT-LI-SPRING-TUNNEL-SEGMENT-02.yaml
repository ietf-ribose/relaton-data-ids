abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a new type of segment, Tunnel Segment,
    for\n   the segment routing (SR).  Tunnel segment can be used to reduce SID\n
    \  stack depth of SR path, span the non-SR domain or provide\n   differentiated
    services.\n\n   Forwarding mechanisms and requirements of control plane and data\n
    \  models for tunnel segments are also defined.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
