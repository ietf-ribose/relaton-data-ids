abstract:
- content: <p>Preparation and comparison of internationalized strings ("precis") framework
    [I-D.ietf-precis-framework] is defining several classes of strings for preparation
    and comparison. In the document, case mapping is defined because many of protocols
    handle case sensitive or case insensitive string comparison and therefore preparation
    of string is mandatory. As described in IDNA mapping [RFC5895] and precis problem
    statement [I-D.ietf-precis-problem-statement], mappings in internationalized strings
    are not limited to case, but also width, delimiters and/or other specials are
    taken into consideration. This document is a guideline for authors of protocol
    profiles of precis framework and describes the mappings that must be considered
    between receiving user input and passing permitted code points to internationalized
    protocols.</p>
