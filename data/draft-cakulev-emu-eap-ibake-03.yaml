abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is an authentication framework
    which supports multiple authentication methods. This document defines an authentication
    method for EAP called EAP-IBAKE, which is based on the Identity-Based Authenticated
    Key Exchange (IBAKE) protocol. The IBAKE method provides mutual authentication
    through the use of identity-based encryption. In addition to mutual authentication
    this method also provides perfect forward and backwards secrecy.</p>"
