abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual network which
    has a\n   customized network topology and a set of dedicated or shared network\n
    \  resources allocated from the underlying network infrastructure.\n   Multiple
    VTNs can be created by network operator for using as the\n   underlay for one
    or a group of VPNs services to provide enhanced VPN\n   (VPN+) services.  In packet
    forwarding, some fields in the data\n   packet needs to be used to identify the
    VTN the packet belongs to, so\n   that the VTN-specific processing can be executed.\n\n
    \  This document proposes a mechanism to carry the VTN-ID in an MPLS\n   packet
    to identify the VTN the packet belongs to.  The procedure for\n   processing the
    VTN ID is also specified.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
