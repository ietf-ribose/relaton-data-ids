abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the operations performed by a forward-proxy
    or reverse-proxy, when using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) in group
    communication scenarios. Such CoAP proxy processes a single request, sent by a
    CoAP client over unicast, and distributes the request over IP multicast to a group
    of CoAP servers. It then collects the individual responses from these CoAP servers
    and sends these responses to the CoAP client such that the client is able to distinguish
    the responses and their origin servers through addressing information.</p>"
