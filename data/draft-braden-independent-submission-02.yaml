abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the procedures by which authors of RFC Independent
    Submission documents grant the community "incoming" rights for copying and using
    the text. It also specifies the "outgoing" rights the community grants to readers
    and users of those documents, and it requests that the IETF Trust manage the outgoing
    rights to effect this result. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>
