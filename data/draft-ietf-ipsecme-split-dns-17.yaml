abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines two Configuration Payload Attribute Types (INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN
    and INTERNAL_DNSSEC_TA) for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2).
    These payloads add support for private (internal-only) DNS domains. These domains
    are intended to be resolved using non-public DNS servers that are only reachable
    through the IPsec connection. DNS resolution for other domains remains unchanged.
    These Configuration Payloads only apply to split- tunnel configurations.</p>"
