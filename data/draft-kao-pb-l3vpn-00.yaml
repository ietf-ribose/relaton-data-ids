abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may use
    an IEEE 802.1ad PBN (Provider Bridge Network) to provide IP Virtual Private Network
    Service for its customers. This method extends the BGP/MPLS IP VPN service to
    allow IP VPN service to be offered using a PBN instead. This document specifies
    the way in which this is done.</p>"
