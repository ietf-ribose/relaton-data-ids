abstract:
- content: "<p>EVPN and PBB-EVPN introduce a family of solutions for multipoint Ethernet
    services over MPLS/IP network with many advanced capabilities among which their
    multi-homing capabilities. These solutions define two types of multi-homing for
    an Ethernet Segment (ES): 1) Single-Active and 2) All-Active, where an Ethernet
    Segment is defined as a set of links between the multi-homed device/network and
    the set of PE devices that they are connected to. Some Service Providers want
    to extend the concept of the physical links in an ES to Ethernet Virtual Circuits
    (EVCs) where many of such EVCs can be aggregated on a single physical External
    Network-to- Network Interface (ENNI). An ES that consists of a set of EVCs instead
    of physical links is referred to as a virtual ES (vES). This draft describes the
    requirements and the extensions needed to support vES in EVPN and PBB-EVPN.</p>"
