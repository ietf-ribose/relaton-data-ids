abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Babel is a routing protocol based on the distance-vector algorithm\n
    \  augmented with mechanisms for loop avoidance and starvation\n   avoidance.
    \ In this document, we argue that there exist niches where\n   Babel is useful
    and that are not adequately served by more mature\n   protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n
