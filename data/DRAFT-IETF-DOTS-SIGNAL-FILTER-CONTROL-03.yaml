abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an extension to the DOTS signal channel\n
    \  protocol so that DOTS clients can control their filtering rules when\n   an
    attack mitigation is active.\n\n   Particularly, this extension allows a DOTS
    client to activate or de-\n   activate existing filtering rules during a DDoS
    attack.  The\n   characterization of these filtering rules is supposed to be conveyed\n
    \  by a DOTS client during an idle time by means of the DOTS data\n   channel
    protocol.\n\nEditorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)\n\n   Please update
    these statements within the document with the RFC\n   number to be assigned to
    this document:\n\n   o  \"This version of this YANG module is part of RFC XXXX;\"\n\n
    \  o  \"RFC XXXX: Controlling Filtering Rules Using Distributed Denial-\n      of-Service
    Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Signal Channel\";\n\n   o  reference: RFC XXXX\n\n
    \  o  [RFCXXXX]\n\n   Please update these statements with the RFC number to be
    assigned to\n   the following documents:\n\n   o  \"RFC SSSS: Distributed Denial-of-Service
    Open Threat Signaling\n      (DOTS) Signal Channel Specification\" (used to be\n
    \     [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel])\n\n   o  \"RFC DDDD: Distributed Denial-of-Service
    Open Threat Signaling\n      (DOTS) Data Channel Specification\" (used to be\n
    \     [I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel])\n\n   Please update the \"revision\" date
    of the YANG module.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
