abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [I-D.kreeger-nvo3-hypervisor-nve-cp-01] discusses requirements
    for\n   Hypervisor-to-NVE Control Plane Protocol Functionality.  The IEEE\n   has
    developed a protocol called VSI Discovery Protocol (VDP)\n   specified in [IEEE8021Qbg].
    This protocol is intended to address the\n   same basic problems at layer two
    as the Hypervisor-to-NVE protocol\n   needs to address at layer three.  Simply
    by adding the ability to\n   carry layer three addresses to VDP using the extensibility
    features\n   built into the protocol, VDP may be used as the Hypervisor-to-NVE\n
    \  Control Plane protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
