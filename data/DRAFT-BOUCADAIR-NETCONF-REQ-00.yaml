abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Given the ever-increasing importance of configuration tasks
    for the \n   provisioning of a wide range of IP resources, networks, and services
    \n   in today's Internet, this draft aims at listing the basic \n   requirements
    that should drive the specification of a protocol to \n   convey configuration
    information towards network devices. This memo \n   doesn't aim at listing candidate
    protocols to convey such \n   information, nor at choosing one of these. This
    draft basically \n   describes a whole set of issues a service provider has to
    deal with, \n   hence a list of requirements to better address such issues.  \n
    \   \n\t </p>\n      "
