abstract:
- content: "<p>The IDN Working Group is working on proposals for internationalized
    domain names that might become a standard in the IETF. Before a single full proposal
    can be made, competing proposals must be compared on a wide range of requirements
    and desired features. This document compares the many parts of a comprehensive
    protocol that have been proposed. It is the companion document to 'Requirements
    of Internationalized Domain Names' [IDN-REQ], which lays out the requirements
    for the internationalized domain name protocol.</p>"
