abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In Real-time multimedia applications using multiple media streams
    in\n   point to point and multipoint calls can benefit from options that\n   will
    enable them to pause and resume media streams as well as to\n   indicate a mute
    state.  This document describes the difference\n   between pause and mute and
    describes how to provide this required\n   functionality.  This document updates
    RFC5104.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
