abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multi-Protocol BGP (MP-BGP) has support for distributing next-hop\n
    \  information for multiple address families using one AFI/SAFI Network\n   Layer
    Reachability Information (NLRI).  [RFC5549] specifies the\n   extensions necessary
    to allow advertising IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI\n   with a Next Hop address that
    belongs to the IPv6 protocol.  While the\n   next-hop info is learnt via MP-BGP,
    certain procedures are needed to\n   enable traffic forwarding.  This document
    describes PIM extensions\n   and the use-cases for multicast forwarding in various
    scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
