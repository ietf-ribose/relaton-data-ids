abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a product of the work of MIF architecture design team.
    It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues, experienced by nodes
    that can be attached to multiple networks. The framework defines the notion of
    a Provisioning Domain (PVD) - a consistent set of network configuration information,
    and PVD-aware nodes - nodes which learn PVDs from the attached network(s) and/or
    other sources and manage and use multiple PVDs for connectivity separately and
    consistently.</p>"
