abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a simple protocol, BMP, which can be
    used to\n   monitor BGP sessions.  BMP is intended to provide a more convenient\n
    \  interface for obtaining route views for research purpose than the\n   screen-scraping
    approach in common use today.  The design goals are\n   to keep BMP simple, useful,
    easily implemented, and minimally\n   service-affecting.  BMP is not suitable
    for use as a routing\n   protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
