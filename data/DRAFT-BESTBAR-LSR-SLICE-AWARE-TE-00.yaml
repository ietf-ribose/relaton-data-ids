abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A slice aggregate is a collection of packets that match a slice\n
    \  policy selection criteria and are given the same forwarding\n   treatment.
    \ Slice Aggregate aware Traffic Engineering (SA-TE) is a\n   mechanism that facilitates
    Traffic Engineering (TE) path selection to\n   take into account the available
    network resources associated with a\n   specific slice aggregate.  This document
    specifies the Interior\n   Gateway Protocol (IGP) extensions for support of SA-TE.
    \ This\n   includes the generalization of the semantics of a number of IGP\n   extensions
    already defined for existing MPLS Traffic Engineering in\n   [RFC3630], [RFC4124],
    [RFC5305] and additional IGP extensions beyond\n   those.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
