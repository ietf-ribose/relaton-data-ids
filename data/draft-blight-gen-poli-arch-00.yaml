abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Out goal is describe a simple policy framework (or architecture)
    which is bothpractical to implement, and easy to extend. Our framework is driven
    by the in-formation which needs to be exchanged, and the communication system
    required toimplement it. We view policies as a specification for network management
    systems, and have constructed our framework based on that assumption. We forces
    us to consider amore general architecture, than one based on QoS assumptions alone.</p>"
