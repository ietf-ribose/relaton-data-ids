abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic\n
    \  Control Plane.  To do this a Secure Key Infrastructure is\n   bootstrapped.
    \ This is done using manufacturer-installed X.509\n   certificates, in combination
    with a manufacturer's authorizing\n   service, both online and offline.  We call
    this process the\n   Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol.\n
    \  Bootstrapping a new device can occur using a routable address and a\n   cloud
    service, or using only link-local connectivity, or on limited/\n   disconnected
    networks.  Support for deployment models with less\n   stringent security requirements
    is included.  Bootstrapping is\n   complete when the cryptographic identity of
    the new key\n   infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device.  The\n
    \  established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued\n   certificate
    to the device as well.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
