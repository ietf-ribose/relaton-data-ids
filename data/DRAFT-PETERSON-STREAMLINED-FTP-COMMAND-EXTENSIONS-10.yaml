abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies FTP commands to download thumbnails of
    remote\nimages, remove entire directory trees, request the amount of storage\nspace
    available to the user, and to request the size of a remote\ndirectory and its
    contents.  The commands are designed to reduce the\nnumber of server / client
    exchanges, provide information that was not\npreviously available, and to reduce
    bandwidth requirements for some\nhigher level operations.\n\t </p>\n      "
