abstract:
  content: "<p>Point to point (P2P) communication between arbitrary IPv6 routers andhosts
    in a Low power and Lossy Network (LLN) is a key requirement formany applications.
    RPL, the IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs,constrains the LLN topology to a Directed
    Acyclic Graph (DAG) andrequires the P2P routing to take place along the DAG links.
    Such P2Proutes may be significantly suboptimal and may lead to trafficcongestion
    near the DAG root. This document describes a P2P routediscovery mechanism complementary
    to RPL base functionality. Thismechanism allows an RPL-aware IPv6 router or host
    to discover andestablish on demand one or more routes to another RPL-aware IPv6router
    or host in the LLN such that the discovered routes meet thespecified cost criteria.</p>"
