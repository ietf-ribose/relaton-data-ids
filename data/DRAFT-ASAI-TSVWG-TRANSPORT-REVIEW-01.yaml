abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document reviews the architectural design of the transport\n
    \  layer.  In particular, this document separates the transport layer\n   into
    two sublayers; the data path and the data flow layers.  The data\n   path layer
    provides functionality on the data path, such as\n   connection handling, path
    quality and trajectory monitoring, waypoint\n   management, and congestion control.
    \ The data flow layer provides\n   additional functionality upon the data path
    layer, such as flow\n   control for the receive buffer management, retransmission
    for\n   reliable data delivery, and transport layer security.  The data path\n
    \  layer multiplexes multiple data flow layer protocols and provides\n   data
    path information to the data flow layer to control data\n   transmissions, such
    as prioritization and inverse multiplexing for\n   multipath protocols.\n\n\t
