abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the use of encrypted ESP for secure IP communication,
    the\n   compression of IP payload is only possible with complex frameworks,\n
    \  such as RObust Header Compression (ROHC).  Such frameworks are too\n   complex
    for numerous use cases and especially for IoT scenarios,\n   which makes IPsec
    not being used here, although it offers\n   architectural benefits.\n\n   ESP
    Header Compression (EHC) defines a flexible framework to compress\n   communications
    protected with IPsec/ESP.  Compression and\n   decompression is defined by EHC
    Rules orchestrated by EHC Strategies.\n   The necessary state is hold within the
    IPsec Security Association and\n   can be negotiated during key agreement, e.g.
    with IKEv2.\n\n   The document specifies the necessary parameters of the EHC Context
    to\n   allow compression of ESP and the most common included protocols, such\n
    \  as IPv4, IPv6, UDP and TCP and the corresponding EHC Rules.  It also\n   defines
    the Diet-ESP EHC Strategy which compresses up to 32 bytes per\n   packet for traditional
    IPv6 VPN and up to 66 bytes for IPv6 VPN sent\n   over a single TCP or UDP session.\n\n\t
