abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To support IP mobility, mobile IPv4 was designed for IPv4 network
    \nand the mobility extension for IPv6 has been also drafted. However, \nmobile
    IPv4 and mobile IPv6 are not compatible to each other so \nthat a mobile IPv4
    host can not function properly while it changes \nits point of attachment to IPv6
    networks and vice versa. The \ndocument specifies an architecture and mechanisms
    to solve mobility \nproblems in IPv4 and IPv6 interconnected networks. The solution
    \npresents a dual stack model that implements a new address mapper \non mobile
    hosts. The address mapper on a mobile host associates the \nhome address in one
    protocol such as IPv4 with a care-of-address \nin the other protocol, i.e. IPv6.
    It dispatches IPv4/IPv6 packets \nto proper layers of the protocol stack, and
    provides transparent \nservices to upper layers regardless of the attached networks.
    \nTherefore, the new architecture facilitates the mobility of hosts \nin IPv4
    and IPv6 interconnected networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
