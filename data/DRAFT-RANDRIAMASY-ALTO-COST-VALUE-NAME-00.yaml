abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF ALTO protocol provides guidance to content delivery\n
    \  applications such as P2P or Content Delivery Networks (CDN), which\n   have
    to select one or several hosts or endpoints from a set of\n   candidates that
    are able to provide a desired data resource.  This\n   guidance shall be based
    on parameters that affect performance and\n   efficiency of the data transmission
    between the hosts, for instance\n   the topological distance or the routing cost
    between them.  To this\n   end, ALTO Servers deployed by Network Operators (NO),
    provide\n   requesting ALTO Clients with information, currently such as the NO-\n
    \  centric view on the network topology, the candidate application\n   endpoints
    with attributes such as their connectivity type.\n\n   The present draft proposes
    to extend the cost information provided by\n   the ALTO protocol by providing,
    for a same cost metric, several\n   possible cost values.  Which value to provide
    depends on qualitative\n   criteria as opposed to quantitative criteria such as
    time.  The\n   purpose is to allow a finer grained decision on which application\n
    \  endpoint or sub network to access given that their routing cost\n   values
    may depend on criteria suh as the access technology of the end\n   system consuming
    the resources or the policy applied for the client\n   requesting ALTO information.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
