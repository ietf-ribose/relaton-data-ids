abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to allow a mail sender to
    specify a\n   complaint feedback loop address as an email header and how a mail\n
    \  receiver can use it.  This document also defines the rules for\n   processing
    and forwarding such a complaint.  The motivation for this\n   arises out of the
    absence of a standardized and automated way to\n   provide a complaint feedback
    loop address to mailbox providers.\n   Currently, providing and maintaining such
    an address is a manual to a\n   time-consuming process for mail senders and mailbox
    providers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
