abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies transfer protocols for instant messages
    and\npresence information.  The Presence Information Transfer Protocol\n(PITP)
    allows clients to set presence information for presentities\nthey control and
    to request presence information from other\npresentities.  The Instant Message
    Transfer Protocol (IMTP) allows\nclients to send and receive instant messages.
    \ Both protocols can also\nbe used to relay instant message and presence requests
    between servers\nas necessary.\nThese protocols are specified in the same document
    because they have\nvery similar structure.  However, they are two logically separate\nprotocols.
    \ Sections specific to one or the other protocol will be\nrecognizeable by a leading
    'PITP' or 'IMTP'.\n\t </p>\n      "
