abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies an HTTP authentication scheme for use whencredentials
    are validated by an out-of-band mechanism (not definedhere) and later communicated
    to the server through the use of acookie. Which out-of-band mechanism should be
    used, and how, isdescribed by the 401 (Unauthorized) response body. It is commonpractice
    that this mechanism is an HTML form, sending the user'scredentials with the use
    of an HTTP POST request to a tier URL whichwill set a cookie in response; though
    this document doesn't precludethe use of other mechanisms.</p>"
