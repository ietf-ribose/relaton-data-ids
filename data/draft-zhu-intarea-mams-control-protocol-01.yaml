abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple communication
    networks based on different technology implementations and network architectures
    like WiFi, LTE, DSL. In such multi- connectivity scenario, it is desirable to
    combine multiple access networks or select the best one to improve quality of
    experience for a user and improve overall network utilization and efficiency.
    This document presents the control plane protocols, as well as describes control
    plane procedures for configuring the user plane in a multi access management services
    (MAMS) framework that can be used to flexibly select the combination of uplink
    and downlink access and core network paths, and user plane treatment for improving
    network efficiency and enhanced application quality of experience.</p>"
