abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As described in [I.D-boucadair-sfc-framework], the dynamic\n
    \  enforcement of a Service-derived, adequate forwarding policy for\n   packets
    entering a network that supports such advanced Service\n   Functions has become
    a key challenge for operators and service\n   providers.\n\n   This document is
    based on [I.D-boucadair-sfc-framework] and focusing\n   on discussing how the
    Service Functions are discovered and\n   provisioned and how Service Function
    Chaining path is setup.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
