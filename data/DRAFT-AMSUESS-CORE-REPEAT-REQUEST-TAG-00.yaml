abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines two optional extensions to the Constrained\n
    \  Application Protocol (CoAP): the Repeat option and the Request-Tag\n   option.
    \ Each of these options when integrity protected, such as with\n   DTLS or OSCOAP,
    protects against certain attacks on CoAP message\n   exchanges.\n\n   The Repeat
    option enables a CoAP server to verify the freshness of a\n   request by requiring
    the CoAP client to make another request and\n   include a server-provided challenge.
    \ The Request-Tag option allows\n   the CoAP server to match message fragments
    belonging to the same\n   request message, fragmented using the CoAP Block-Wise
    Transfer\n   mechanism.  This document also specifies additional processing\n
    \  requirements on Block1 and Block2 options.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
