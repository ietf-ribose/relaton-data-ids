abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a method for Safely Turning Authentication\n
    \  Credentials Into Entropy (STACIE) using an efficient Zero Knowledge\n   Password
    Proof (ZKPP), and is provided as a standalone component\n   suitable for use as
    a building block in other protocol development\n   efforts.  The scheme was created
    to fill the emerging need for a\n   standard which allows a single low entropy
    password to be used for\n   user authentication and the derivation of strong encryption
    keys.\n   The design is modular, and is conservative in its use of an arbitrary\n
    \  one-way cryptographic hash function.  The security of the scheme\n   depends
    on the difficulty associated with reversing the hash function\n   output back
    into the plain text input.  STACIE attempts to make\n   discovering the plain
    text input through the use of brute force more\n   difficult by correlating the
    amount of processing to the length of a\n   user's plain text password.  The shorter
    the plain text password, the\n   more processing is required, with the amount
    of additional,\n   artificially required, work scaling exponentially for each
    character.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
