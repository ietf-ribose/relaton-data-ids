abstract:
- content: <p>Administrative groups (commonly referred to as "colors" or "link colors")
    are link attributes that are advertised by link state protocols like IS-IS (Intermediate
    System to Intermediate System) and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and used for
    traffic engineering. These administrative groups have initially been defined as
    a fixed- length 32-bit bitmask. As networks grew and more use-cases were introduced,
    the 32-bit length was found to be constraining and hence extended administrative
    groups were introduced in the link state protocols. The 32-bit administrative
    groups are already advertised as link attributes in BGP-LS. This document introduces
    extensions to BGP-LS (Border Gateway Protocol Link-State) for advertisement of
    the extended administrative groups.</p>
