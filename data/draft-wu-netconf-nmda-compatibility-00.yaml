abstract:
- content: "<p>NMDA architectural framework eliminates the need to duplicate data
    structures to provide separate configuration and operational state sections and
    uses different datastores and new protocol operations to distinct configuration
    from operation state. However when a server needs to support both NMDA client
    and non-NMDA clients, it is not clear whether a NMDA compliant server can use
    existing operation to return the same results with &lt;rpc-reply&gt; as non-NMDA-aware
    server does. This document identifies some of the major challenges, and provides
    solutions that are able to mitigate those challenges and smooth the migration
    towards NMDA deployment.</p>"
