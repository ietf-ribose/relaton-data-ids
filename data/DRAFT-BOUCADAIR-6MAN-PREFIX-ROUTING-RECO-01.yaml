abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The length of IP prefixes to be manipulated by forwarding and
    routing\n   processes is policy-based; no maximum length must be assumed by\n
    \  design.  This document sketches a recommendation to be followed by\n   forwarding
    and routing designs with regards to the prefix length.\n   The aim is to avoid
    hard-coded routing and forwarding designs that\n   exclude some IP prefix lengths.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
