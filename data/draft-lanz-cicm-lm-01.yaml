abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an abstract model for high assurance cryptographic
    modules. It defines the relevant terminology and high- level descriptions of the
    types of services and operations offered by such modules. The goal is to provide
    a common vocabulary for discussing the programming of high assurance modules.
    Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the mailing list at cicm@ietf.org.</p>"
