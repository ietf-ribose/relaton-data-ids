abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 addresses can differ in a number of properties, such as scope,
    stability, and intended usage type. This document analyzes the impact of these
    properties on aspects such as security, privacy, interoperability, and network
    operations. Additionally, it identifies challenges and gaps that currently prevent
    systems and applications from leveraging the increased flexibility and availability
    of IPv6 addresses.</p>"
