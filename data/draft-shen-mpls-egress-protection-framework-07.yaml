abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a fast reroute framework for protecting IP/
    MPLS services and MPLS transport tunnels against egress node and egress link failures.
    In this framework, the penultimate-hop router of an MPLS tunnel acts as the point
    of local repair (PLR) for egress node failure, and the egress router of the MPLS
    tunnel acts as the PLR for egress link failure. Each of them pre-establishes a
    bypass tunnel to a protector. Upon an egress node or link failure, the corresponding
    PLR performs local failure detection and local repair, by rerouting packets over
    the corresponding bypass tunnel. The protector in turn performs context label
    switching or context IP forwarding to send the packets to the ultimate service
    destination(s). This mechanism can be used to reduce traffic loss before global
    repair reacts to the failure and control plane protocols converge on the topology
    changes due to the failure. The framework is applicable to all types of IP/MPLS
    services and MPLS tunnels. Under the framework, service protocol extensions may
    be further specified to support service label distribution to the protector.</p>"
