abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Workflow is intuitive and powerful paradigm for capturing business\n
    \  processes, reasoning about them, and process specifications to\n   produce
    corresponding implementations that are supported by the\n   information systems.
    There has been a growing acceptance of workflow\n   technology in numerous application
    domains such as\n   telecommunications, software engineering, manufacturing, production,\n
    \  finance and banking, laboratory sciences, healthcare, shipping and\n   office
    automation.\n \n   In the last few years, pervasive network connectivity, exploded\n
    \  growth of Internet and web technologies has changed our computational\n   landscape
    to distributed, heterogeneous and network centric computing\n   model from centralized,
    desktop-oriented, and homogenous computing.\n   This has raised challenging requirements
    for workflow technologies in\n   terms being required to support heterogeneous,
    distributed computing\n   infrastructures, interoperability, scalability and availability.\n
    \n   The main objective of this document is to identify various business\n   requirements
    for Internet based Workflow Access Protocol to\n   instantiate, control and monitor
    the workflow process instances.\n   Definition and administration of process specifications
    are not\n   discussed in this requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
