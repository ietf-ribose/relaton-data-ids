abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SUPA will define a generic policy model, an imperative ECA
    (Event\n   Condition Action) policy information model and a declarative (intent-\n
    \  based) policy information model which is the extension of the generic\n   model,
    and a set of policy data models which will make use of the\n   common concepts
    defined in the generic model.  This memo will explore\n   some typical use cases
    and demonstrate the applicability of SUPA\n   policy models.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
