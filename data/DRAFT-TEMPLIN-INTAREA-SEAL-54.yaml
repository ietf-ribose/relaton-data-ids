abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation\n
    \  Layer (SEAL) developed by Boeing.  SEAL operates over virtual\n   topologies
    configured over connected IP network routing regions\n   bounded by encapsulating
    border nodes.  These virtual topologies are\n   manifested by tunnels that may
    span multiple IP and/or sub-IP layer\n   forwarding hops, where they may incur
    packet duplication, packet\n   reordering, source address spoofing and traversal
    of links with\n   diverse Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs).  SEAL uniquely addresses\n
    \  these issues through the encapsulation and messaging mechanisms\n   specified
    in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
