abstract:
  content: "<p>Legislators writing laws that would limit or prohibit the sending ofunsolicited
    bulk email (UBE) or unsolicited commercial email (UCE) havebegun to include rules
    that require mail servers to include particularwording in the SMTP banner. To
    date, this wording has had two distinctpurposes: to warn senders that they may
    not send UBE or UCE to that SMTPhost, and to state the physical location of the
    host so that the sender mayknow which laws apply. This document is meant to help
    clarify how such legislation might beworded, and to help increase interoperability
    of various laws. It is notmeant to be a standard of any kind, but is meant only
    for its informationalvalue.</p>"
