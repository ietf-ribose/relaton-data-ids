abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285]
    is to bridge the gap between network and applications by providing network related
    information to non-priviledged, application-level clients. This allows applications
    to make informed decisions, for example when selecting a target host from a set
    of candidates. Therefore an ALTO Server provides network and cost maps to its
    clients. However, those maps can be very large, and portions of those maps may
    change frequently (cost maps in particular). This draft presents a method to provide
    incremental updates for these maps. The goal is to reduce the load on the ALTO
    Client and Server by transmitting just the updated portions of those maps.</p>"
