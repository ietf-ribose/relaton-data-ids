abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft offers a proposal to form a new IAB program called
    the RFC\n   Editor Future Development Program.  This proposal is based on the\n
    \  discussions held during three virtual meetings in September and\n   October
    2019, and requests a new program, open to all, that will\n   drive consensus around
    any changes to the RFC Editor model through\n   extensive community engagement
    and outreach to a broad set of\n   stakeholder communities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
