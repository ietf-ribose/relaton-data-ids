abstract:
- content: "<p>Due to their critical role in a network, the protection of routing
    equipements is crucial, particularly against subversion attacks. For this purpose,
    we integrate a trusted plane in the network equipments related to the routing
    protocols (e.g. OSPF, BGP, RIP). This trusted plane is realized by a trusted element
    embedded or connected to the network equipment.</p>"
