abstract:
- content: "<p>DiffServ mechanisms have been developed to support Quality of Service
    (QoS). However, the level of assurance that can be provided with DiffServ without
    substantial over-provisioning is limited. Pre- Congestion Notification (PCN) investigates
    the use of per-flow admission control to provide the required service guarantees
    for the admitted traffic. While admission control will protect the QoS under normal
    operating conditions, an additional flow pre-emption mechanism is necessary in
    the times of heavy congestion (e.g. caused by route changes due to link or node
    failure). This document provides a problem statement on the addition of flow admission
    control and flow pre-emption functionality to a DiffServ network, in particular
    for the support of real time services such as voice and video.</p>"
