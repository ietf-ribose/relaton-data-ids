abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The RADIUS protocol defined in RFC 2865 has limited support
    for\n   authentication and encryption of RADIUS packets.  The protocol\n   transports
    data in the clear, although some parts of the packets can\n   have obfuscated
    content.  Packets may be replayed verbatim by an\n   attacker, and client-server
    authentication is based on fixed shared\n   secrets.  This document specifies
    how the Datagram Transport Layer\n   Security (DTLS) protocol may be used as a
    fix for these problems.  It\n   also describes how implementations of this proposal
    can co-exist with\n   current RADIUS systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
