abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobile IPv6 capable mobile nodes can roam between networks
    that\n   belong to their home service provider as well as others. Roaming in\n
    \  foreign networks is enabled as a result of the service level and\n   roaming
    agreements that exist between operators. One of the key\n   protocols that allows
    this kind of a roaming mechanism to be enabled\n   is Diameter. This Internet
    Draft specifies a new application to\n   Diameter that enables Mobile IPv6 roaming
    in networks other than its\n   home.\n\t </p>\n      "
