abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies transfer protocols for instant messages andpresence
    information. The Presence Information Transfer Protocol(PITP) allows clients to
    set presence information for presentitiesthey control and to request presence
    information from otherpresentities. The Instant Message Transfer Protocol (IMTP)
    allowsclients to send and receive instant messages. Both protocols can alsobe
    used to relay instant message and presence requests between serversas necessary.These
    protocols are specified in the same document because they havevery similar structure.
    However, they are two logically separateprotocols. Sections specific to one or
    the other protocol will berecognizeable by a leading 'PITP' or 'IMTP'.</p>"
