abstract:
- content: "<p>Today's transport protocols offer a variety of functionality based
    on the notion that the network is to be treated as an unreliable communication
    medium. Some, like TCP, establish a reliable connection on top of the unreliable
    network while others, like UDP, simply transmit datagrams without a connection
    and without guarantees into the network. These fundamental differences in functionality
    have a significant impact on how COIN approaches can be designed and implemented.
    Furthermore, traditional transport protocols are not designed for the multi-party
    communication principles that underlie many COIN approaches. This document discusses
    selected characteristics of transport protocols which have to be adapted to support
    COIN functionality.</p>"
