abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a globally scalable and hierarchical approach\n
    \  to multicast session directory service architecture.  This approach\n   allows
    for sessions to be discovered using keywords as soon as they\n   are registered
    with the system.  It allows session registration to be\n   tagged with geographical
    data to provide location-based search\n   capability to the end users.  It is
    able to assign URI strings to\n   multicast sessions.  This document provides
    a general overview of the\n   architecture and describes the protocol used.  The
    architecture is\n   able to operate in networks supporting either traditional
    ASM or the\n   newer SSM.\n\t </p>\n      "
