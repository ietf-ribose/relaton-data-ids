abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies CCNx CLEAN - content-locked encryption
    and\n   authentication of nameless objects.  CLEAN describes how to\n   transparently
    encrypt content objects in FLIC Manifests\n   [I-D.irtf-icnrg-flic].  Relevant
    decryption information is carried in\n   native FLIC nodes, i.e., without any
    extensions or modifications to\n   FLIC.  CLEAN transparently encrypts public
    data and supports\n   application-specific configuration for private data.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
