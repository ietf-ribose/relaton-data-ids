abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the increasing interest in the potential use of blockchain\n
    \  systems for virtual assets, there is a need for virtual assets to\n   have
    mobility across blockchain systems.  An interoperability\n   architecture is needed
    to permit the flow of virtual assets between\n   blockchain systems.  The architecture
    must recognize that there are\n   different blockchain systems, and that the interior
    constructs in\n   these blockchains maybe incompatible with one another.  Gateway
    nodes\n   perform the transfer of virtual assets between blockchain systems\n
    \  while masking the complexity of the interior constructs of the\n   blockchain
    that they represent.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
