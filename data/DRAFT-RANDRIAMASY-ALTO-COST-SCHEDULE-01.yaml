abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is
    to\n   bridge the gap between network and applications by provisioning\n   network
    related information.  This allows applications to make\n   informed decisions,
    for example when selecting a target host from a\n   set of candidates.  The ALTO
    problem statement [RFC5693] considers\n   typical applications as file sharing,
    real-time communication and\n   live streaming peer-to-peer networks.  Recently
    other use cases\n   focused on Content Distribution Networks and Data Centers
    have\n   emerged [draft-jenkins-alto-cdn-use-cases-01].\n\n   The present draft
    proposes to extend the cost information provided by\n   the ALTO protocol.  The
    purpose is to broaden the decision\n   possibilities of applications to not only
    decide 'where' to connect\n   to, but also 'when' to connect.  This is useful
    to applications that\n   have a degree of freedom on when to schedule data transfers,
    such as\n   non-instantaneous data replication between data centers.  The draft\n
    \  therefore specifies a new cost mode, called the \"schedule\" mode.  In\n   this
    mode the ALTO server offers cost maps that contain link ratings\n   that are valid
    for a given timeframe (e.g. hourly) for a period of\n   time (e.g. a day).  Besides
    the functional time-shift enhancement\n   providing multi-timeframe cost values
    the extansion also allows the\n   saving of a number of ALTO transactions and
    thus resources on the\n   ALTO server and clients.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
