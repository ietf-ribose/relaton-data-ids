abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on the
    Internet today and make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks.  In
    P2P applications, one technique for reducing the transit and uplink P2P traffic
    is to introduce storage capabilities within the network.  Traditional caches (e.g.,
    P2P and Web caches) provide such storage, but they can be complex (e.g., P2P caches
    need to explicitly support individual P2P application protocols), and do not allow
    users to manage resource usage policies for content in the cache.  This document
    discusses the introduction of in-network storage for P2P applications and shows
    the need for a standard protocol for accessing this storage.  This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.\n\t </p>\n      "
