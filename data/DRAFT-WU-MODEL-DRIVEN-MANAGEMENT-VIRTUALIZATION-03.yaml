abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Model driven service and network management provides a programmatic\n
    \  and standards-based way of representing virtual services or networks\n   and
    configuration to the network device that are used to construct\n   the service.
    \ It can be used at various phases of service and network\n   management life
    cycle such as service instantiation, service\n   provision, optimization, monitoring,
    and diagnostic.  Also, it can be\n   designed to automate network management and
    provide closed-loop\n   control for the sake of agile service creation, delivery
    and\n   maintenance.\n\n   This document provides a framework that describes and
    discusses an\n   architecture for service and network management automation with
    YANG\n   Modeling technologies.  An applicability of YANG data model to\n   automation
    of virtualized network service is also investigated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
