abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo describes the process through which individuals, workinggroups
    and external standards bodies can influence the development ofMPLS and GMPLS standards.
    With respect to standardization, thisprocess means that (G)MPLS extensions and
    changes can be done throughthe IETF only, the body that created the (G)MPLS technology.
    TheIETF will not publish a (G)MPLS technology extension RFC outside ofthe processes
    described here.</p>"
