abstract:
- content: <p>Constrained Devices as they are used in the "Internet of Things" need
    security. One important element of this security is that devices in the Internet
    of Things need to be able to decide which operations requested of them should
    be considered authorized, need to ascertain that the authorization to request
    the operation does apply to the actual requester, and need to ascertain that other
    devices they place requests on are the ones they intended. On the ACE mailing
    list, an activity to create specifications for such authenticated authorization
    for constrained devices is contemplated, leading to protocol proposals such as
    [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize] or [I-D.seitz-ace-oscoap-profile]. One potential
    work item complementing this protocol work is an Authorization Information Format
    (AIF). This document provides a strawman for such a format that should enable
    further discussion of the objectives for its development.</p>
