abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document identifies and discusses use-cases and high level\n
    \  requirements for transport technology independent OAM that need to\n   interface
    multi-layer or multi-domain transport networks to cover\n   heterogeneous networking
    technologies.  As providers face multi-layer\n   networks and diverse transport
    technologies, generic and integrated\n   OAM is desirable for simplifying network
    operations and maintenance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
