abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Consider large networks deploying traditional PIM multicast
    service.\n   Typically, each portion of these large networks have their own\n
    \  mandates and requirements.\n\n   It might be desirable to deploy BIER technology
    in some part of these\n   networks to replace traditional PIM services.  In such
    cases\n   downstream PIM states need to be signaled over BIER Domain toward the\n
    \  source.\n\n   This draft explains the procedure to signal PIM joins and prunes\n
    \  through a BIER Domain, as such enable provisioning of traditional PIM\n   services
    through a BIER Domain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
