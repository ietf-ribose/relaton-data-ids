    As the Internet grows, so does the participation by engineers worldwide. Remote
    participation with more than one person is considered a hub. Three types of remote
    hubs are defined. Each has its own characteristics. - Remote Participation Hubs
    - Remote Viewing Hubs - Enduring Local Meetups This document defines a Remote
    Participation Hub (RPH). Other documents define the other types of hubs. A common
    structure of sections will be used as far as possible for all hub types.</p>"
