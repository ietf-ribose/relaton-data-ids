abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a unified IPv6 transition framework.
    \ This\n   framework makes use of the flow-based packet forwarding technology,\n
    \  which can simplify the implementation of both control plane and data\n   plane
    operations of transition mechanisms.  The purpose of this work\n   is to provide
    an integrated and flexible framework to implement and\n   deploy the most popular
    translation and tunneling mechanisms, such as\n   NAT64, DS-Lite, Lightweight
    4over6 and MAP-E. This framework can\n   benefit the industry by reducing the
    cost of implementation,\n   providing flexibility for deployment, and enabling
    transition\n   mechanisms to coexist and cooperate in the common infrastructure.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
