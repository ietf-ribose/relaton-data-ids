abstract:
- content: "<p>SIMPLE (SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions)
    is a protocol suite for instant messaging (IM) service, but it is inefficient
    in processing session-mode instant message due to its complex signaling processes
    and heavy header overheads, which makes it difficult to meet the QoE (quality
    of experience) requirement, especially in the usage scenario of mobile Internet
    and other traffic sensitive networks. This document describes an alternative Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) extension for instant messaging service. The extension
    uses the publish-subscribe mode to simplify signaling procedures and introduces
    message user agent (MUA) to publish and receive message, and message broker (MB)
    as an intermediary to exchange messages between MUAs. Message is tagged with a
    topic, and the lightweight message format is more suitable for traffic sensitive
    networks.</p>"
