abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to be routed, a fragmented 6LoWPAN packet must be\n
    \  reassembled at every hop of a multihop link where lower layer\n   fragmentation
    occurs.  Considering that the IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280\n   bytes and that an an
    802.15.4 frame can have a payload limited to 74\n   bytes in the worst case, a
    packet might end up fragmented into as\n   many as 18 fragments at the 6LoWPAN
    shim layer.  If a single one of\n   those fragments is lost in transmission, all
    fragments must be\n   resent, further contributing to the congestion that might
    have caused\n   the initial packet loss.  This draft introduces a simple protocol
    to\n   forward and recover individual fragments that might be lost over\n   multiple
    hops between 6LoWPAN endpoints.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
