abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies a Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload
    format to be used for transporting video encoded with JPEG XS (ISO/IEC 21122).
    JPEG XS is a low-latency, lightweight image coding system. Compared to an uncompressed
    video use case, it allows higher resolutions and video frame rates while offering
    visually lossless quality, reduced power consumption, and encoding-decoding latency
    confined to a fraction of a video frame.</p>"
