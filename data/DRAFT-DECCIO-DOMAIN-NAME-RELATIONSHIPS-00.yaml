abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Various Internet protocols and applications require some mechanism\n
    \  for identifying relationships between Domain Name System (DNS) names.\n   In
    this document we provide examples of protocols and applications\n   for which
    knowledge of these relationships is useful, if not\n   required.  Further we discuss
    the various types of domain name\n   relationships, review current needs and solutions,
    and identify\n   considerations for solution sets.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
