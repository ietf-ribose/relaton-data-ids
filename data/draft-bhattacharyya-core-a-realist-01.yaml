abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents extensions to Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP) to enable RESTful Real-time Live Streaming for improving the Quality of
    Experience (QoE) for delay-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The
    overall architecture is termed ''Adaptive RESTful Real-time Live Streaming for
    Things (A- REaLiST)''. It is particularly designed for applications which rely
    on real-time augmented vision through live First Person View (FPV) feed from constrained
    remote agents like Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), etc. These extensions provide
    the necessary hooks to help solution designers ensure low-latency transfer of
    streams and, for contents like video, a quick recovery from freeze and corruption
    without incurring undue lag. A-REaLiST is an attempt to provide an integrated
    approach to maintain the balance amongst QoE, resource-efficiency and loss resilience.
    It provides the necessary hooks to optimize system performance by leveraging contextual
    intelligence inferred from instantaneous information segments in flight. These
    extensions equip CoAP with a standard for efficient RESTful streaming for Internet
    of Things (IoT) contrary to HTTP-streaming in conventional Internet.</p>"
