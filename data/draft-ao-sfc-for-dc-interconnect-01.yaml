abstract:
- content: "<p>In a SFC, sometimes some SFs are provided by several DC networks, which
    means these SFs my locates in different DC network . How to establish such SFC
    that is across several DCs is what the draft wants to present. In this document,
    a hierarchical SFC method is proposed. It covers data plane, control plane to
    archieve such hierarchical SFC. And it includes requirements of the SFC Gateway
    for every DC network that provide SF for SFC.</p>"
