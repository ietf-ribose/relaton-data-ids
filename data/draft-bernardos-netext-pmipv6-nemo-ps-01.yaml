abstract:
- content: "<p>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). PMIPv6 enables
    mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across gateways without
    changing the IP address. Current PMIPv6 specification does only support the movement
    of hosts within the localized mobility domain. A mobile network (commonly referred
    to as a NEMO, NEtwork that MOves) can also benefit from the network-based localized
    mobility support provided by PMIPv6, but in a limited way. This I-D describes
    what can be done with current standardized protocols, and describes the problem
    statement of fully supporting network mobility in Proxy Mobile IPv6. The goal
    of this document is to present the problem -- and the use cases where this problem
    is relevant to be solved -- to collect feedback from the community about the interest
    in working on this problem.</p>"
