abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). PMIPv6enables
    mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam acrossgateways without changing
    the IP address.Current PMIPv6 specification does only support the movement of
    hostswithin the localized mobility domain. A mobile network (commonlyreferred
    to as a NEMO, NEtwork that MOves) can also benefit from thenetwork-based localized
    mobility support provided by PMIPv6, but in alimited way. This I-D describes what
    can be done with currentstandardized protocols, and describes the problem statement
    of fullysupporting network mobility in Proxy Mobile IPv6.The goal of this document
    is to present the problem -- and the usecases where this problem is relevant to
    be solved -- to collectfeedback from the community about the interest in working
    on thisproblem.</p>"
