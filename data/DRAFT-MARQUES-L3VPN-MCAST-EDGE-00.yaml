abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In data-center networks it is common to use Clos network topologies\n
    \  [clos] in order to provide a non-blocking switched network.  In these\n   topologies
    it is often not desirable to provide native IP multicast\n   service.\n\n   This
    document defines a multicast replication algorithm along with\n   its control
    and data forwarding procedures that provides a multicast\n   service for a BGP
    IP VPN network without assuming that the underlying\n   infrastructure supports
    IP multicast.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
