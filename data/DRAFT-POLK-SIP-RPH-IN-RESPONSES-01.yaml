abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Resource-Priority Header
    is \nignored in SIP responses, according to RFC 4412.  This was a\ndesign choice
    during RFC 4412's development. This is now considered \na bad design choice in
    certain scenarios.  This document corrects \nRFC 4412's communications model by
    optionally allowing a SIP server \nor user agent (UA) to process the Resource-Priority
    Header in a \nresponse.\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\t </p>\n
