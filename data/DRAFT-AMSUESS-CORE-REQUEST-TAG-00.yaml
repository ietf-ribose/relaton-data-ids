abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes an optional extension to the Constrained\n
    \  Application Protocol (CoAP, [RFC7252] and [RFC7959]) that allows\n   matching
    of request blocks.  This primarily serves to transfer the\n   security properties
    that Object Security of CoAP (OSCOAP,\n   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security]) provides
    for single requests to\n   blockwise transfers.  The security of blockwise transfer
    in OSCOAP is\n   reflected on in a dedicated section.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
