abstract:
  content: "<p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS, also known as Transparent LANService)
    is a useful Service Provider offering. A common scenariowhere this offering is
    made is in the metro area, where severalMulti-Tenant buildings are connected to
    an Office, and severalOffices are connected by a metro area network. The Service
    Providerplaces a simple, low-cost box (MTU) in each building; these MTUs haveuplinks
    to some box (PE) in one or more Offices. In such a scenario,it is useful to decouple
    the functions needed to offer VPLS acrossthe MTU and PE; this document proposes
    one way of accomplishing that.</p>"
