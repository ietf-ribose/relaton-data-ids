abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS, also known as Transparent LAN Service)
    is a useful Service Provider offering. A common scenario where this offering is
    made is in the metro area, where several Multi-Tenant buildings are connected
    to an Office, and several Offices are connected by a metro area network. The Service
    Provider places a simple, low-cost box (MTU) in each building; these MTUs have
    uplinks to some box (PE) in one or more Offices. In such a scenario, it is useful
    to decouple the functions needed to offer VPLS across the MTU and PE; this document
    proposes one way of accomplishing that.</p>"
