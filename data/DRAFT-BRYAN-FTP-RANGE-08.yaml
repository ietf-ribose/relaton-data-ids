abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The File Transfer Protocol offers the REST command to designate
    a\n   starting point for a transfer, but does not currently offer any\n   method
    to specify an end point.  This document specifies a new FTP\n   RANG command to
    be used by clients to designate an octet range to a\n   file, including a start
    and end point.  This range can be used to\n   permit restarts and repairs of interrupted
    data transfers in STREAM\n   mode, among other things.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
