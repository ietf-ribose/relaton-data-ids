abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An application server can voluntarily identify itself to a
    push\n   service using the described technique.  This identification\n   information
    can be used by the push service to attribute requests\n   that are made by the
    same application server to a single entity, and\n   reduce the need for endpoint
    secrecy by being able to associate\n   subscriptions with an application server.
    \ An application server is\n   further able include additional information the
    operator of a push\n   service can use to contact the operator of the application
    server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
