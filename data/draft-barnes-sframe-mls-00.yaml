abstract:
- content: "<p>Secure Frames (SFrame) defines a compact scheme for encrypting real-
    time media. In order for SFrame to address cases where media are exchanged among
    many participants (e.g., real-time conferencing), it needs to be augmented with
    a group key management protocol. The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides
    continuous group authenticated key exchange, allowing a group of participants
    in a media session to authenticate each other and agree on a group key. This document
    defines how the group keys produced by MLS can be used with SFrame to secure real-time
    sessions for groups.</p>"
