abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This paper defines the requirements for a DNS-based architecture
    and\nprotocols for mapping a telephone number to a set of attributes\n(e.g., URLs)
    which can be used to contact a resource associated with\nthat number. There are
    many possible protocols that can be\nconsidered for a telephone number mapping
    service.  The purpose of\nthis document is to focus discussion on a DNS-based
    solution.  The\nintention is to enumerate the expectations of such a solution
    and to\nclarify the scope.\n\t </p>\n      "
