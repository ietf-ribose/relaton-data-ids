abstract:
- content: "<p>The arrangements relating to administrative support for the IETF were
    created more than ten years ago. Since then, there has been considerable change
    in the tasks and in our own expectations. The IETF community has discussed these
    changes and the problems they cause. The community has some sense of the properties
    they expect from future arrangements, including those related to structure, organization,
    personnel, and transparency. This document is a product of a design team, focused
    on providing additional information to the community about solution options, as
    well as supporting analysis of the implications of those options. To be clear,
    the community is responsible for adopting any recommendations or making any final
    decisions.</p>"
