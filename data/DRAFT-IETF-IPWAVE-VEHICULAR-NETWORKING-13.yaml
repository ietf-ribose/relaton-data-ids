abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the problem statement and use cases
    of\n   IPv6-based vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation\n   Systems
    (ITS).  The main scenarios of vehicular communications are\n   vehicle-to-vehicle
    (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and\n   vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications.
    \ First, this document\n   explains use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.
    \ Next, it\n   makes a problem statement about key aspects in IPv6-based vehicular\n
    \  networking, such as IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management, and\n   Security
    &amp; Privacy.  For each key aspect, this document specifies\n   requirements
    for IPv6-based vehicular networking.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
