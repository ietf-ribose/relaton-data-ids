abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       This document defines a hybrid naming scheme for unifying
    all kinds\n       of information including resources, services and data. With
    many\n       proposals of novel network architectures emerging, such as DONA,
    ICN,\n       NDN, the location-based routing starts to transfer to the content-based\n
    \      ones. Currently, it is incompatible that many different information\n       naming
    schemes are adopted in  different network proposals,\n       respectively, i.e.
    flat names in DONA, hierarchical names in NDN. The\n       proposed naming scheme
    adopts a hybrid naming structure, which includes\n       hierarchical component,
    flat component and attribute component. The\n       hybrid naming (hn) scheme
    enables to identify different routing\n       information uniformly, and provides
    many great advantages, such as\n       high aggregation, limited length, suffix
    holes remission, fuzzy\n       matching support and good compatibility with IPv4/IPv6,
    DONA and so on.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
