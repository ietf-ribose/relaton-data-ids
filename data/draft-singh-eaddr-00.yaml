abstract:
  content: "\t <t>ENUM uses NAPTR DNS Resource Records (RRs) to map an E.164 telephonenumber
    to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) of other ways ofcontacting (for example,
    by email) a specific resource. This memoproposes an ENUM-like service called EADDR
    where an email address,instead of a telephone number, is used as the key to fetch
    othercontact URIs. At human level, EADDR seems more useful than ENUMbecause it
    is easier to remember an email address than a telephonenumber as the key. At machine
    level, both services are equallyuseful.</p>"
