abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RFC4379] describes the LSP Ping mechanism to detect data plane\n
    \  failures.  In some deployment scenario for the LSP traceroute, a\n   replying
    LSR may not have the available route to the initiator, and\n   the echo reply
    message sent to the initiator would be discarded.\n   Thus, the basic idea of
    traceroute procedure to localize fault could\n   not be achieved.  This document
    describes extensions to LSP Ping\n   mechanism to enable the replying LSR to have
    the capability to relay\n   the echo reply by a set of routable intermediate nodes
    to the\n   initiator.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
