abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Numerous authentication mechanisms are in use today on the Internet.\nIt
    is desirable to give administrators the choice of which mechanisms\nto support
    in their deployments and to give users the choice which\nmechanisms to use.  This
    document offers terminology designed to be\neasily understandable by users and
    administrators of Internet\nservices, while being meaningful to designers and
    developers of these\nservices and associated Internet protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
