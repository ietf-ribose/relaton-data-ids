abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>            The main intent of this document is to define a Media
    Gateway Control \n            Protocol (MGCP) package to control the reporting
    of metrics supported \n            by the VoIP metrics block in RTCP Extended
    Reports as specified in [RFC \n            3611]. It also allows the call agent
    to control whether or not the \n            gateway will request a peer device
    via SDP to send the VoIP metrics \n            block in RTCP Extended Reports
    and whether it will respond positively \n            to such requests from the
    peer device. Besides this primary focus, this \n            MGCP RTCP-XR Package
    \                            4/12/2007 \n            package also allows the reporting
    of metrics defined for RTCP Sender \n            Reports and Receiver Reports
    [RFC 3550] and the reporting of session \n            description parameters (based
    on the ones defined in RFC 2327, RFC 2198 \n            etc.). \n\n\t </p>\n      "
