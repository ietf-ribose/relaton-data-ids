abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the deployment of BGP/MPLS VPN,the PE(Provider Edge)Device
    should\nmaintain all the VPN routes of the VPNs which it belong to.When there
    \nare many VPNs converged by a PE,and the capacity of PE is relevant\nlimited,then
    the bottleneck will be encountered.Another problem is \nthat the current BGP/MPLS
    VPN model is something of a 'Plane Modle'\nwhere the demand of the performance
    of the PE device are all the \nsame no matter which layer the PE device is belongs
    to.However,the \ntypical network is 'Core-Convergence-Access(Edge)' model,and
    the \nperformance of the device is superior in Core Layer and inferior in \nAccess
    Layer,and the scale of network is large in Access Layer and \nsmall in Core Layer,the
    routes are converged in every layer,so in \ncurrent 'Plane Modle',when PE device
    push to the edge layer,it has \nto maintain more VPN routes,this makes it difficult
    to extend the PE\ndevice to edge layer.This document defines an model of Hierarchy
    of \nProvider Edge Device in BGP/MPLS VPN,where Hierarchy of Provider \nEdge Device
    can be composed of several device and every device take \non the different part,partake
    the function of the former \nconcentrative PE,we call this model 'Hierarchy Model',In
    this model\nthe demand of performance in Routing and Switching is strict to the
    \nPE device in High layer,loose to the PE device in edge layer.\n \n   One HoPE
    can be composed of a SPE and UPES connected to the SPE, \n   or be composed of
    a high-level SPE and HoPEs connected the high \n   level SPE and and build up
    a new HoPE.This build is called nesting \n   of HoPE,and this kind of nesting
    can be done for many times.Thus the \n   former HoPE connect to the high-level
    SPE as a role of UPE,and the \n   new HoPE can connect a single UPE too.\n\t </p>\n
