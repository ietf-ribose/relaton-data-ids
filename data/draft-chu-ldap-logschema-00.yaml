abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In order to facilitate remote administration and auditing of LDAPserver
    operation, it is desirable to provide the server's operationallogs themselves
    as a searchable LDAP directory. These logs may alsobe used as a persistent change
    log to support various replicationmechanisms. This document defines a schema that
    may be used torepresent all of the requests that have been processed by an LDAPserver.
    It may be used by various applications for auditing, flightrecorder, replication,
    and other purposes.</p>"
