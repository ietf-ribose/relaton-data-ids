abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) specification\n
    \  defines the concept of Provider-defined Identifiers (PIDs) as the\n   aggregation
    of network endpoints for network nodes.  Each PID can be\n   associated with a
    set of endpoint addresses, e.g. aggregating\n   endpoints that use the same network
    access point.\n\n   This document focuses on mobile networks and introduces proposes
    the\n   toidea of using use cells of cellular access networks as an\n   aggregation
    points.  This allows applications to make decisions based\n   on the path cost
    of using the current cell as a network attachment\n   point, or to even choose
    which network access points network\n   attachment point to select.  Use cases
    are described which can\n   benefit from this.  The draft elaborates on possible
    ALTO\n   modifications enabling such use cases.  The intent of the draft is to\n
    \  start discussion on the topic.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
