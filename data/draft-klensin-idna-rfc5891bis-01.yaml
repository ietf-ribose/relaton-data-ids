abstract:
- content: "<p>The IDNA specifications for internationalized domain names combine
    rules that determine the labels that are allowed in the DNS without violating
    the protocol itself and an assignment of responsibility, consistent with earlier
    specifications, for determining the labels that are allowed in particular zones.
    Conformance to IDNA by registries and other implementations requires both parts.
    Experience strongly suggests that the language describing those responsibilities
    was insufficiently clear to promote safe and interoperable use of the specifications
    and that more details and some specific examples would have been helpful. Without
    making any substantive changes to IDNA, this specification updates two of the
    core IDNA documents (RFC 5980 and 5891) and the IDNA explanatory document (RFC
    5894) to provide that guidance and to correct some technical errors in the descriptions.</p>"
