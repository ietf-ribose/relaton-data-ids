abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In interdomain routing environment, it is often observed Multiple
    Origin \nASes and it causes instability in interdomain routing. To work around\nits
    problem, this draft describes the mechanism of automatically \nintegrity check
    about origin AS. In this approach, BGP router compares\nwith the origin AS in
    BGP UPDATE and origin AS in IRR database. \nAlso this draft defines messages between
    BGP router and IRR-DB to \ntransmit query and reply packet. And by introducing
    the cache mechanism \nin BGP router, it can apply route flapping environment.\n\n\t
