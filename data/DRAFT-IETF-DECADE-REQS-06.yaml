abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The target of the DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE)
    system\n   is to provide an open and standard in-network storage system for\n
    \  applications, primarily P2P (peer-to-peer) applications, to store,\n   retrieve
    and manage their data.  This draft enumerates and explains\n   requirements, not
    only for storage and retrieval, but also for data\n   management, access control
    and resource control, that should be\n   considered during the design and implementation
    of a DECADE-\n   compatible system.  These are requirements on the entire system;
    some\n   of the requirements may eventually be implemented by an existing\n   protocol
    with/without some extensions (e.g., a protocol used to read\n   and write data
    from the storage system).  The requirements in this\n   document are intended
    to ensure that a DECADE-compatible system\n   architecture includes all of the
    desired functionality for intended\n   applications.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
