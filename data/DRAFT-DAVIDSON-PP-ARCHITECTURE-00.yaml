abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the architectural framework for constructing\n
    \  secure and privacy-preserving instantiations of the Privacy Pass\n   protocol
    (as described in [draft-davidson-pp-protocol]).  The\n   framework refers to the
    entire ecosystem of Privacy Pass clients and\n   servers.  This document makes
    recommendations on how this ecosystem\n   should be constructed to ensure the
    privacy of clients and the\n   security of all participating entities.\n\n\t </p>\n
