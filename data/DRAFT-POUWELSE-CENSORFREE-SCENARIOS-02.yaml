abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes some scenarios in which one can imagine
    that\n   the ability of authoritarian regime to censor news dissemination is\n
    \  reduced.  It tries to draw some conclusions about what's desirable\n   and
    what's not acceptable for users in those scenarios.\n\n   The CensorFree objective
    is to standardize the protocols for\n   microblogging on smartphones with a focus
    on security and censorship\n   resistance.  Microblog entries are short text messages,
    possibly\n   enriched with pictures or streaming video.  The goal is to devise\n
    \  protocols which guard against all known forms of censorship such as:\n   cyberspace
    sabotage, digital eavesdropping, infiltration, fraud,\n   Internet kill switches
    and lawyer-based attacks with the best known\n   protective methods.\n\n\t </p>\n
