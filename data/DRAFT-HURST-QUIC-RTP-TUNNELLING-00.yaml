abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   QUIC is a UDP-based transport protocol for stream-orientated,\n
    \  congestion-controlled, secure, multiplexed data transfer.  RTP\n   carries
    real-time data between endpoints, and the accompanying\n   control protocol RTCP
    allows monitoring and control of the transfer\n   of such data.  With RTP and
    RTCP being agnostic to the underlying\n   transport protocol, it is possible to
    multiplex both the RTP and\n   associated RTCP flows into a single QUIC connection
    to take advantage\n   of QUIC features such as low-latency setup and strong TLS-based\n
    \  security.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
