abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes structures within a QuickTime movie file
    which\npermit easy transmission of the media content over RTP.  This\nspecification
    is intended to assist those who wish to stream stored\nmovies over RTP, those
    wishing to prepare movies for streaming, and\nfor those who might wish to record
    into QuickTime while preserving\nRTP information. The bit-stream(s) of RTP packets
    are normally\ncompliant with the RTP payload definitions for their content, and\nfull
    inter-operability can be achieved. Each QuickTime media track\nwithin a movie
    is sent over a separate RTP session and synchronized\nusing standard RTP techniques.
    This specification builds on the\npublished QuickTime file format specification.\n\t
