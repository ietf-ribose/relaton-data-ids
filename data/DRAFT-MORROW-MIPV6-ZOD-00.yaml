abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Under certain circumstances the desired effects of diversion can
    be \nachieved with no per-packet transport overhead. This draft describes \nthese
    circumstances as well as the per-packet bearer processing and \ngeneral signaling
    requirements of some proposals that strive to \nremove the need for this overhead.
    The first proposal is referred to \nas Zero-Overhead Diversion (ZOD). The second
    is referred to as More \nRobust Zero-Overhead Diversion (MR. ZOD). Mobile IP and
    load \ndistribution are examples of the useful application of diversion. \n\n\t
