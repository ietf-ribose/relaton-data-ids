abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an end-to-end secure infrastructure
    that makes computers easier to use by making them more secure. The Mesh provides
    a set of protocol and cryptographic building blocks that enable encrypted data
    stored in the cloud to be accessed, managed and exchanged between users with the
    same or better ease of use than traditional approaches which leave the data vulnerable
    to attack. This document provides an overview of the Mesh data structures, protocols
    and examples of its use. This document is also available online at http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-mesh-
    architecture.html [1] .</p>"
