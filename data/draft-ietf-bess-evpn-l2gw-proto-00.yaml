abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing EVPN multi-homing load-balancing modes defined are Single-Active
    and All-Active. Neither of these multi-homing mechanisms adequately represent
    ethernet-segments facing access networks with Layer-2 Gateway protocols such as
    G.8032, (M)STP, REP, MPLS-TP, etc. These loop-preventing Layer-2 protocols require
    a new multi-homing mechanism defined in this draft.</p>"
