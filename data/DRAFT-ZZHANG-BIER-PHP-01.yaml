abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) can be used as provider
    tunnel\n   for MVPN/GTM [RFC6514] [RFC7716] or EVPN BUM [RFC7432].  It is\n   possible
    that not all routers in the provider network support BIER\n   and there are various
    methods to handle BIER incapable transit\n   routers.  However the MVPN/EVPN PEs
    are assumed to be BIER capable -\n   they are BFIRs/BFERs.  This document specifies
    a method to allow BIER\n   incapable routers to act as MVPN/EVPN PEs with BIER
    as the transport,\n   by having the upstream BFR (connected directly or indirectly
    via a\n   tunnel) of a PE remove the BIER header and send the payload to the\n
    \  PE.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
