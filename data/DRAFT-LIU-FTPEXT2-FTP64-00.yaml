abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The File transfer protocol, which was originally defined in
    RFC 114\n   and published in 1971, well before TCP and IP were created.  However,\n
    \  it is still in wide use.  Many FTP servers implement RFC 959, which\n   requires
    IPv4.  RFC 2428 defines extensions that allow FTP to work\n   over IPv6 by introducing
    the EPRT and EPSV commands.  When IPv6 FTP\n   clients attempt to communicate
    with IPv4 FTP servers through an\n   IPv6-IPv4 translator, only certain combinations
    of FTP client and\n   server behavior lead to successful file transfers.  This
    document\n   proposes the best current practice for IPv6 FTP client\n   implementations
    in the IPv6-IPv4 translation scenario, allowing file\n   transfers to succeed
    without the presence of an ALG (Application\n   Layer Gateway).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
