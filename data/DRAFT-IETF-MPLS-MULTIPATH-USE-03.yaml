abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques
    and\n   many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in\n
    \  very high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core\n   networks.
    \ MPLS-TP has strongly discouraged the use of multipath\n   techniques.  Some
    degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot be\n   avoided when operating over
    many types of multipath implementations.\n\n   Using MPLS Entropy label, MPLS
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be\n   carried over multipath links while also
    providing a fully MPLS-TP\n   compliant server layer for MPLS-TP LSPs.  This document
    describes the\n   means of supporting MPLS as a server layer for MPLS-TP.  The
    use of\n   MPLS-TP LSPs as a server layer for MPLS LSPs is also discussed.\n\n\t
