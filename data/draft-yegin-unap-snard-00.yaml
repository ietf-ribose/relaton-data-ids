abstract:
  content: "<p>Internet access through public networks require authentication ofclients
    and networks to each other. While there are currently usedlink-layer protocols
    such as PPP, it is very desirable to provide anetwork-layer solution that can
    work across multiple types of links.Authentication of roaming clients is generally
    handled by AAAprotocols. In order to use AAA between the network and the client,
    weneed a protocol to carry required messages. This draft defines how wecan extend
    the standard router discovery protocol to use it as a carrier for the authentication
    purposes.</p>"
