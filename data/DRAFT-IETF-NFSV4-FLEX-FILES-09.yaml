abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Parallel Network File System (pNFS) allows a separation
    between\n   the metadata (onto a metadata server) and data (onto a storage\n   device)
    for a file.  The flexible file layout type is defined in this\n   document as
    an extension to pNFS which allows the use of storage\n   devices in a fashion
    such that they require only a quite limited\n   degree of interaction with the
    metadata server, using already\n   existing protocols.  Client side mirroring
    is also added to provide\n   replication of files.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
