abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This Internet Draft is one of a pair written at the request of oneof
    the SPIRITS Working Group co-chairs in order to elicit discussionon what extended
    functionality SPIRITS may be used to provide; thePINT work has similar requirements
    for a definition of the buildingblocks that might be used in future services (and
    so need to besupported by the protocol). This note provides the 'mirror image'
    ofthe associated SPIRITS draft, listing functional building blocks thatmay be
    executed in response to future PINT protocol requests.</p>"
