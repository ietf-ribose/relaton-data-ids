abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an extendible architecture whereby an event
    \nsubscriber (client) may specify the rules for SIP event notification \nfrom
    the notifier (server). Potential solutions meeting the \narchitecture specification
    are also provided in the annexes.  \nRequirements for event filtering were previously
    described in [1].\n\t </p>\n      "
