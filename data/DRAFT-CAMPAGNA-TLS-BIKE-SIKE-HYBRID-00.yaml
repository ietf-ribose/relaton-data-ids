abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes new hybrid key exchange schemes for
    the\n   Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which are based on combining\n
    \  Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) with one of the Bit Flipping Key\n   Exchange
    (BIKE) or the Supersingular Isogeny Key Exchange (SIKE)\n   schemes.  In particular,
    this document specifies the use of BIKE or\n   SIKE in combination with ECDHE
    as a hybrid key agreement in a TLS 1.2\n   handshake, together with the use of
    ECDSA or RSA for authentication.\n   Hybrid key exchange refers to executing two
    separate key exchanges\n   and subsequently feeding the two resulting shared secrets
    into the\n   existing TLS Pseudo Random Function (PRF), in order to derive a\n
    \  master secret.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
