abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An attribute is defined for Session Traversal Utilities for
    NAT\n   (STUN) that allows for declarations of bandwidth limits on the\n   negotiated
    flow.  The application of this attribute is the\n   negotiation of bandwidth between
    a Traversal Using Relays around NAT\n   (TURN) client and a TURN server.\n\n\t
