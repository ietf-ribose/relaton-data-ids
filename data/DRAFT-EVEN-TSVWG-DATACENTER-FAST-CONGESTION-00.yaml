abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A good congestion control for data centers (DC) should provide
    low\n   latency, fast convergence and high link utilization.  Since multiple\n
    \  applications with different requirements may run on the DC network it\n   is
    important to provide fairness between different applications that\n   may use
    different congestion algorithms.  An important issue from the\n   user perspective
    is to achieve short Flow Completion Time (FCT).\n   This document proposes data
    center congestion control direction\n   aiming to achieve high performance while
    proving fairness.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
