abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new multicast forwarding\n
    \  paradigm which doesn't require an explicit tree-building protocol nor\n   intermediate
    routers to maintain any multicast state.  BIER has two\n   types of encapsulation
    formats: one is MPLS-BIER encapsulation, the\n   other is non-MPLS-BIER encapsulation.
    \ This document proposes a\n   mechanism of encapsulating non-MPLS-BIER packets
    over UDP tunnels.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
