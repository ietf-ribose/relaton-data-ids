abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The communication path between two Hosts within a Proxy Mobile
    IPv6\n   domain is artificially long - it involves the LMA, even if straight\n
    \  paths exist (under same MAG, or MAG-to-MAG).  Localized Routing\n   PMIPv6-LR
    concepts developped by NETEXT WG make use of LRI/LRA\n   messages to achieve optimized
    MAG-to-MAG straight paths.  This may\n   prove inconvenient for the network operator,
    in that it may loose\n   ability to control traffic (LMA control point is skipped).\n\n
    \  In this draft we present a middle-ground solution.  It employs new\n   Intermediary
    Anchors (IAs) in the paths between MAGs and offers\n   points of control of traffic
    useful for QoS and lawful interception.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
