abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BGP protocol contains number of built in mechanisms which
    records\n   information about the routers which have processed a specific piece\n
    \  of reachability information critical to insuring only loop free paths\n   are
    chosen by the protocol.  For instance, the AS_PATH, CLUSTER_LIST\n   and ORIGINATOR_ID
    attributes carry information designed to insure\n   permanent routing loops are
    not formed in the path chosen towards a\n   particular destination.  However,
    there are no provisions to record\n   other useful information along the path,
    metadata about the routers\n   through which reachability information has passed
    which can be\n   helpful to the operator in order to enhance end to end visibility
    of\n   the BGP control plane.\n\n   In order to solve this problem this document
    proposes a new single\n   BGP attribute designed as an generic and extensible
    container to\n   carry number of new optional information corresponding to the
    BGP\n   speakers given BGP advertisement (or withdraw) message traverses.\n\n\n\t
