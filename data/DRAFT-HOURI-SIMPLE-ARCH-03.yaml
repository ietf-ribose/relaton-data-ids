abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document collects information required for the creation
    a\n   complete Presence and IM system using SIMPLE and other IETF\n   protocols.
    \ This information has been spread out across numerous\n   other internet drafts
    and RFCs.  The document tries to put everything\n   together, discussing the servers
    involved, security mechanisms, call\n   flows, etc.  The goal of this document
    is that someone, who is not an\n   expert in the IETF protocols, can read this
    document and understand\n   how the IETF protocols can be used for building a
    complete system and\n   how it should work.  SPECIFCATIONS SECTION TO BE UPDATED
    SHORTLY\n\t </p>\n      "
