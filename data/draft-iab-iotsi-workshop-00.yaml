abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a summary of the 'Workshop on Internet of Things
    (IoT) Semantic Interoperability (IOTSI)' [IOTSIWS], which took place in Santa
    Clara, CA, on March 17-18, 2016. The main goal of the workshop was to foster a
    discussion on the different approaches used by companies and standards developing
    organizations to accomplish interoperability at the application layer. This report
    summarizes the discussions and lists recommendations to the standards community.
    The views and positions in this report are those of the workshop participants
    and do not necessarily reflect those of the authors and the Internet Architecture
    Board (IAB), which organized the workshop.</p>"
