abstract:
- content: "<p>Consumer mobility is supported in ICN by design, in virtue of its connectionless
    pull-based communication model; producer mobility though is not natively supported.
    This document describes MAP-Me, an anchor-less solution to manage micro-mobility
    of content producers in the CCN (Content Centric Networking) and NDN (Named Data
    Networking) architectures, with support for latency-sensitive applications. MAP-
    Me consists in the combination of two data plane protocols, triggered by producer
    movements, and leveraging ICN named-based data plane. The main protocol consists
    in a lightweight FIB update process, complemented by a mechanism of local notification
    and scoped discovery suitable for low latency applications and fast mobility.</p>"
