- content: "<p>This document specifies version 4+ of the Internet Protocol (IPv4+).
    IPv4 is very successful,Simple and beautiful. continuation and expansion of the
    IPv4 is necessary. Existing systems, devices only need to upgrade the software
    to support IPv4+, without the need to update new hardwares,saving investment costs.
    Ipv4+ is also an interstellar Protocol, so the Internet will evolve into a star
    Internet.</p>"
