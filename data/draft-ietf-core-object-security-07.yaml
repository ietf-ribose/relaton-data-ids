abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments
    (OSCORE), a method for application-layer protection of the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP), using CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE). OSCORE provides
    end-to-end encryption, integrity and replay protection, as well as a secure message
    binding. OSCORE is designed for constrained nodes and networks and can be used
    whereever CoAP can be used, and also with HTTP. OSCORE may be used to protect
    group communications as is specified in a separate draft.</p>"
