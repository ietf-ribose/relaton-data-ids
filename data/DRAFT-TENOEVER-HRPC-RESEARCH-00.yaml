abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The increased intertwinement of Internet and society increases
    the\n   impact of the Internet on the lives of individuals.  Because of this,\n
    \  the design and development of the architecture of the Internet also\n   has
    an increasing impact on society.  This has led to an increasing\n   recognition
    that human rights [UDHR] [ICCPR] [ICESCR] have a role in\n   the development and
    management of the Internet [HRC2012] [UNGA2013]\n   [NETmundial].  It has also
    been argued that the Internet should be\n   strenghtened as a human rights enabeling
    environment [Brown].\n\n   This document provides a proposal for a glossary to
    discuss the\n   relation between human rights and Internet protocols, an overview
    of\n   the discussion, a proposal for the mapping of the relation between\n   human
    rights and technical concepts, and a proposal for guidelines\n   for human rights
    considerations, similar to the work done on the\n   guidelines for privacy considerations
    [RFC6973].\n\n   Discussion of this draft at: hrpc@irtf.org //\n   https://www.irtf.org/mailman/listinfo/hrpc\n\n\t
