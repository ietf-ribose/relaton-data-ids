abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC 1123 and RFC 1536.  This document
    requires\n   the operational practice of permitting DNS messages to be carried\n
    \  over TCP on the Internet as a Best Current Practice.  This\n   operational
    requirement is aligned with the implementation\n   requirements in RFC 7766.  The
    use of TCP includes both DNS over\n   unencrypted TCP, as well as over an encrypted
    TLS session.  The\n   document also considers the consequences of this form of
    DNS\n   communication and the potential operational issues that can arise\n   when
    this Best Current Practice is not upheld.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
