abstract:
- content: "<p>Discovery of the Path Computation Element (PCE) within an IGP area
    or routing domain is possible using OSPF and IS-IS IGP discovery. However, it
    has been established that in certain deployment scenarios PCEs may not wish, or
    be able to participate within the IGP process. In those scenarios, it is beneficial
    for the Path Computation Client (PCC) (or other PCE) to discover PCEs via an alternative
    mechanism to using an IGP discovery. This document specifies the requirements,
    use cases, procedures and extensions to support PCE discovery along with certain
    relevant information type and capability discovery via DNS.</p>"
