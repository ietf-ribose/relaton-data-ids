abstract:
  content: "<p>The IPv6 Addressing scheme mandates provider addressing to achieveaggregation.
    Multi-homing is a fact of life. Current proposals toreconcile these requirements
    involve mitigation, by constrainingdeployment topologies to avoid loss of aggregation
    in the backboneonly. This draft views the combined requirement as equivalent tothe
    use of loose source routing by hosts, and makes some outlineproposals as to how
    this can be achieved.</p>"
