abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Server Cache Synchronization Protocol SCSP [1], [2], [3], [4]
    is used\n   to solve the generalized cache synchronization/cache -replication\n
    \  problem for distributed protocol entities. In a client-server\n   paradigm,
    SCSP synchronizes caches (or a portion of the caches) of a\n   set of server entities
    of a particular protocol which are bound to a\n   Server Group.\n \n   This document
    provided a security analysis of the current SCSP\n   framework and identified
    potential threats to the protocol operation.\n   Possible solutions to secure
    the SCSP from potential attacks are\n   presented and discussed.\n\t </p>\n      "
