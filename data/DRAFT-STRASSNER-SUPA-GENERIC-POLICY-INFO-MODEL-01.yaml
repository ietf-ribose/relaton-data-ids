abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) addresses
    the\n   needs of operators and application developers to represent\n   multiple
    types of policy rules. This document defines a single\n   common extensible framework
    for representing different types of\n   policy rules, in the form of a set of
    information models, that is\n   independent of language, protocol, repository,
    and the level of\n   abstraction of the content of the policy rule. This enables
    a\n   common set of concepts defined in this set of information models\n   to
    be mapped into different data models that use different\n   languages, protocols,
    and repositories to optimize their usage.\n   The definition of common policy
    concepts also provides better\n   interoperability by ensuring that each data
    model can share a set\n   of common concepts, independent of its level of detail
    or the\n   language, protocol, and/or repository that it is using.\n\n   Specifically,
    this document defines three information models:\n\n\t </p>\n      "
