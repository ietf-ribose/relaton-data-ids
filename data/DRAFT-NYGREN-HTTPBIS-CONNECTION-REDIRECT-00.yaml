abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo presents a method for allowing an HTTP server to
    provide\n   hints in its HTTP responses to a user-agent that indicate the user\n
    \  could be better off connecting to a different IP than what they are\n   currently
    connected to.  This is highly relevant in a multi-homed\n   server world where
    DNS may not have all of the relevant state\n   necessary to make a proper routing
    decision.  Additionally it is done\n   in a manner that does not require application
    level changes as could\n   be the case for an application level redirect such
    as a 3xx response\n\n\t </p>\n      "
