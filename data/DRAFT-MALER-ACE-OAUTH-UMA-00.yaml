abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Authentication and authorization are fundamental security features\n
    \  used in Internet and Web applications.  Providing the same level of\n   security
    functionality to the Internet of Things (IoT) environment as\n   well is a logical
    enhancement and reduces the risk of unauthorized\n   access to personal data.\n\n
    \  IoT devices, however, have limitations in terms of processing power,\n   memory,
    user interface, Internet connectivity, etc.  Since many use\n   cases span Web
    and IoT environments and the question of \"Web\" vs.\n   \"IoT\" can in some cases
    be considered a continuum, it is required to\n   find security solutions that
    can accommodate the capabilities and\n   constraints of both environments without
    significant compromises.\n\n   Thus, an approach of adapting already standardized
    and deployed\n   authentication and authorization technologies is worth examining.\n
    \  This document describes how the Web Authorization Protocol (OAuth) in\n   combination
    with User-Managed Access (UMA) can be used for an IoT\n   environment to bring
    Web-scale authorization services to the IoT\n   world.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
