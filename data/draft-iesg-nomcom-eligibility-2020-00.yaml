abstract:
  content: "<p>The 2020-2021 Nominating Committee (NomCom) needs to be formed between
    IETF 107 and IETF 108, and the issue of eligibility of who can serve on that NomCom
    needs clarification. This document provides a one-time interpretation of the eligibility
    rules that is required for the exceptional situation of the cancellation of the
    in-person IETF 107 meeting. This document only affects the seating of the 2020-2021
    NomCom, and does not set a precedent for the future.</p>"
