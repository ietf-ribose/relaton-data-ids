abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new Source Description (SDES) item called SRCNAME,
    which uniquely identifies a single media source, like a camera or a microphone.
    It also enables identification of the encoding to support when multiple ones are
    produced. That way anyone receiving the SDES information from a set of interlinked
    RTP sessions can determine which SSRCs are logically related to the same media
    source and encoding. In addition the new SDES item is also defined for usage with
    both a header extension and with the SDP source specific media attribute ("a=ssrc").
    Enabling an end-point to receive the SRCNAME with the relevant RTP packets, as
    well as RTCP, or learn the source bindings through signalling, ahead of receiving
    RTP and RTCP packets.</p>
