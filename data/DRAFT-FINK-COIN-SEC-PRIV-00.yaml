abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the growing interconnection of devices, cyber-security
    and data\n   protection are of increasing importance.  This is especially the
    case\n   regarding cyber-physical systems due to their close entanglement with\n
    \  the physical world.  Misbehavior and information leakage can lead to\n   financial
    and physical damage and endanger human lives and well-\n   being.  Thus, hard
    security and privacy requirements are necessary to\n   be met.  Furthermore, thorough
    investigation of incidents is\n   essential for ultimate protection.  In-network
    computing allows the\n   processing of traffic and data directly in the network
    and at line-\n   rate.  Thus, the in-network computing paradigm presents a promising\n
    \  solution for efficiently providing security and privacy mechanisms as\n   well
    as event analysis.  This document discusses select mechanisms to\n   demonstrate
    how in-network computing concepts can be applied to\n   encounter current shortcomings
    of cyber-security and data privacy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
