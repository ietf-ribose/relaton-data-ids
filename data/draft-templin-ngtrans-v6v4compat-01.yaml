abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies an IPv6-IPv4 compatibility aggregatableglobal
    unicast address format and its application for incrementalIPv6 deployment for
    hosts and routers within predominantly IPv4-basedIntranets. This document assumes
    that, during the IPv4 to IPv6 co-existence and transition phase, many sites will
    deploy IPv6incrementally (not all at once) on hosts and routers within theirpre-existing
    IPv4 interior routing domains; especially those siteswhich have large and complex
    pre-existing IPv4 infrastructures. Insuch cases, the address format and methods
    described in this documentwill enable IPv6 deployment for hosts and routers which
    do not sharea common multiple access datalink with their default IPv6 gateways.</p>"
