abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     The  Network Access Server is the initial entry point to
    a network for\n     the majority of users of network services.  It is the first
    device  in\n     the  network to provide services to an end user, and acts as
    a gateway\n     for all further services.  As such, its importance to users  and
    \ ser-\n     vice  providers alike is paramount.  However, the concept of a Network\n
    \    Access Server has grown up  over  the  years  without  being  formally\n
    \    defined or analyzed.  This document offers a framework for the defini-\n
    \    tion and analysis of a modern Network Access Server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
