abstract:
- content: "<p>Middle Box discovery is one of the problems that the Midcom architecture
    has not yet solved. This document compares two Middle box discovery solutions:
    The decoupled model where the Middle Box discovery is handled by a separate protocol
    than the MIDCOM protocol vs the combo model were the MIDCOM protocol and the discovery
    protocol are the same.</p>"
