abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a new multicast routing protocol for
    use\n   over ad hoc networks. The protocol is called AMRIS, short for Ad hoc\n
    \  Multicast Routing protocol utilizing Increasing id-numberS. The\n   conceptual
    idea behind AMRIS is to assign every node in a multicast\n   session with an id-number.
    A delivery tree rooted at a particular\n   node called Sid joins up the nodes
    participating in the multicast\n   session. The relationship between the id-numbers(and
    the node that\n   owns it) and Sid is that the id-numbers increase in numerical
    value\n   as they radiate from the root of the delivery tree. The significance\n
    \  of the Sid is that it has the smallest id-number within that\n   multicast
    session. Utilizing the id-numbers, nodes are able to adapt\n   rapidly to changes
    in link connectivity. Recovery messages due to\n   link breakages are confined
    to the region where it occurred.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
