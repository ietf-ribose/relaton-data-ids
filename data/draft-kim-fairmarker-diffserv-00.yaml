abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines Fair Marker (FM), which can be used as a component
    in a Differentiated Services traffic conditioner. FM controls token distribution
    from the token bucket to the flows originating from the same subscriber network,
    in order to enforce fairness among them. FM may use different fair token allocation
    algorithms. Presently, we assume that FM is used to mark packets for Assured Forwarding.</p>"
