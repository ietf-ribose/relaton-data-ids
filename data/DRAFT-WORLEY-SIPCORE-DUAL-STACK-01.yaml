abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) environment, the procedures
    of RFC\n   3263 by which a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) client contacts a\n
    \  server may not suffice to provide a good user experience.  This\n   document
    describes \"Happy Eyeballs\" modifications -- modifications of\n   the procedures
    of RFC 3263, as well as additional client procedures\n   -- which improve the
    SIP user experience in many circumstances.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
