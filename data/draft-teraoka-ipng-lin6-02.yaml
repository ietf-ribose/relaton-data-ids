abstract:
  content: "<p>LIN6 is a protocol supporting mobility and multi-homing in IPv6. LIN6introduces
    the node id, not the interface id, for each node. Each nodecan be identified by
    its node id no matter where the node is connectedand no matter how many interfaces
    the node has. In the IPv6 layer,64-bit node id called LIN6 ID is used while 128-bit
    node-id called LIN6generalized ID is used above the Transport layer. TCP connections
    andsecurity associations can be preserved even if the node moves to anothersubnet
    or the node changes the using interface in a multi-homingenvironment without modifying
    TCP or IPsec. In comparison with MobileIPv6, LIN6 has several advantages in terms
    of header overhead and faulttolerance.</p>"
