abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes how to construct DNSSEC NSEC resource
    records\n   that cover a smaller range of names than called for by [-records].\n
    \  By generating and signing these records on demand, authoritative name\n   servers
    can effectively stop the disclosure of zone contents\n   otherwise made possible
    by walking the chain of NSEC records in a\n   signed zone.\n\t </p>\n      "
