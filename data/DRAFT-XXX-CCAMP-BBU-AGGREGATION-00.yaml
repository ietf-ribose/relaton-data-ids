abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a usecase, called BBU aggregation,
    for\n   integreting radio and optical networks.  It aims to compact several\n
    \  low-utilized BBU cards into one BBU to improve the BBU utilization.\n   A flexible
    optical fronthaul network is connecting BBU and RRU to\n   enable BBU aggregation
    by recongfiguring the lightpath between BBU\n   and RRU.  The procedure of the
    usecase is based on the unified radio\n   and optical control archtecture, and
    an extended OpenFlow protocol is\n   introduced to realize the procedure.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
