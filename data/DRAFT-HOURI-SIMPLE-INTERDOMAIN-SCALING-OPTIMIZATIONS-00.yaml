abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   The document suggests various optimizations for presence
    that uses\n   the SIP/SIMPLE protocol.  The suggestions are based on a separate\n
    \  document that contains scaling analysis and requirements.  The\n   current
    document reviews only suggestions that are not yet part of\n   the work of the
    various SIP working groups while approved and in-work\n   optimizations are reviewed
    in the scaling document.  The intention\n   here is to keep these suggestions
    at this document as a place holder\n   until a set of requirements will be discussed
    and accepted and the\n   work on optimizations will commence.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
