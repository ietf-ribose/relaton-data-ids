abstract:
- content: "<p>Many protocols support users under domain names, but HTTP does not.
    This specification defines a header for user names, independent of authenticated
    identities, and a link to userinfo in HTTP URIs. This intergrates naturally with
    HTTP, and results in a more refined resource authentication model, in support
    of advanced usage scenarios.</p>"
