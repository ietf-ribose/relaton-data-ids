abstract:
  content: "<p>The Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocoluses
    a core-based tree to forward multicast datagrams to members ofa multicast group.
    Currently there is no method for relocating thecore or Rendezvous Point (RP) for
    a group. Administratively chosenRP's lead to low performance as the sources and
    receivers in themulticast group join and leave the group.This draft presents a
    mechanism for dynamically relocating the RP toa position that minimizes the tree
    cost and improves performance.</p>"
