abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document identifies a SIP/SIMPLE profile for inter-domain\n
    \  communications and documents best current practices regarding\n   security
    and \"good citizenship\" behavior that operators should use\n   when interconnecting
    two or more clouds using SIP/SIMPLE.  The\n   purpose of this document is to serve
    as the reference for the SIP/\n   SIMPLE community towards inter-domain interoperability
    and also to\n   identify new requirements specific to the inter-domain interface.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
