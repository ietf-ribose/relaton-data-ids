abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of the Locator/ID Separation
    Protocol\n   (LISP) to create multiple independent and survivable network overlays\n
    \  that are interconnected by a transit overlay.  The transit overlay is\n   referred
    to as the \"uberlay\" and provides connectivity and control\n   plane abstraction
    between overlays.  Structuring the network into\n   multiple network overlays
    allows each overlay to scale independently.\n   The different network overlays
    are autonomous from a control and data\n   plane perspective to enable failure
    survivability across overlays.\n   The hierarchical structure of the multi-overlay
    network\n   interconnected by an uberlay provides optimizations to the forwarding\n
    \  of unicast traffic as well as the replication of multicast traffic in\n   both
    the overlay and underlay.  This document specifies the\n   mechanisms and procedures
    for the distribution of control plane\n   information across overlay sites and
    in the uberlay as well as the\n   lookup and forwarding procedures for unicast
    and multicast traffic\n   within and across overlays.  The specification also
    defines the\n   procedures to support inter-overlay mobility of EIDs and their\n
    \  integration with the intra-overlay EID mobility procedures defined in\n   draft-ietf-lisp-eid-mobility.\n\n\n\t
