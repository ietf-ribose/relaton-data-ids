abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes structures within a QuickTime movie file
    whichpermit easy transmission of the media content over RTP. Thisspecification
    is intended to assist those who wish to stream storedmovies over RTP, those wishing
    to prepare movies for streaming, andfor those who might wish to record into QuickTime
    while preservingRTP information. The bit-stream(s) of RTP packets are normallycompliant
    with the RTP payload definitions for their content, andfull inter-operability
    can be achieved. Each QuickTime media trackwithin a movie is sent over a separate
    RTP session and synchronizedusing standard RTP techniques. This specification
    builds on thepublished QuickTime file format specification.</p>"
