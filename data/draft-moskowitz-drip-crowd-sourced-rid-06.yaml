abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes using the ASTM Broadcast Remote ID (B-RID) specification
    in a "crowd sourced" smart phone environment to provide much of the ASTM and FAA
    envisioned Network Remote ID (N-RID) functionality. This crowd sourced B-RID data
    will use multilateration to add a level of reliability in the location data on
    the Unmanned Aircraft (UA). The crowd sourced environment will also provide a
    monitoring coverage map to authorized observers.</p>
