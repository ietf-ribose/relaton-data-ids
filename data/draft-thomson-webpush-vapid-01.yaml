abstract:
  content: "<p>An application server can voluntarily identify itself to a push service
    using the described technique. This identification information can be used by
    the push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application server
    to a single entity, and reduce the need for endpoint secrecy by being able to
    associate subscriptions with an application server. An application server is further
    able include additional information the operator of a push service can use to
    contact the operator of the application server.</p>"
