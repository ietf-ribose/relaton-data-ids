abstract:
- content: "<p>Layer separation is a powerful concept in system architecture. In the
    area of mobility, by separating GTP-U that is the overlay tunnel, and the IP transport
    network that is the underlay, the operation of the mobile network and the transport
    network can be separated, allowing them to evolve independently. However, evolving
    individually at each layer promotes local optimization and may result in non-optimal
    solutions overall in the long run. When a drastic architectural transition is
    required, for example, in the 5G era where various SLAs and completely new data
    intensive services are assumed, it is necessary to reconsider the architecture
    holistically, not from the viewpoint of individual part. One of important value
    propositions of SRv6 mobile user plane is to create overlay with underlay optimization.
    This document discusses the architecture implication of applying SRv6 mobile user
    plane. Then it takes 5G use cases as an example, and describes how these use cases
    are simply and effectively realized. Thus it shows that SRv6 mobile use plane
    is a right architectural choice for 5G era.</p>"
