abstract:
- content: "<p>Constrained nodes are small devices which are limited in terms of processing
    power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission capacity. Due to these constraints,
    commonly used security protocols are not easily applicable. Nevertheless, an authentication
    and authorization solution is needed to ensure the security of these devices.
    Due to the limitations of the constrained nodes it is especially important to
    develop a light-weight security solution which is adjusted to the relevant security
    objectives of each participating party in this environment. Necessary security
    measures must be identified and applied where needed. This document gives an overview
    of the necessary terminology and introduces the actors in an architecture as guidance
    for the development of authentication and authorization solutions for constrained
    environments. The actors represent the relationships between the logical functional
    entities involved. We also present a problem description for authentication and
    authorization in constrained-node networks, i.e. networks where some devices have
    severe constraints on memory, processing, power and communication bandwidth.</p>"
