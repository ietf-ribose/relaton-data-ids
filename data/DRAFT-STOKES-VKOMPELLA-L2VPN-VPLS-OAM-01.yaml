abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document describes a methodology and a set of mechanisms
    for \n   Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) of a general VPN \n   (Virtual
    Private Network) service, that is applied here to a Virtual \n   Private LAN Service
    [RFC4761][RFC4762]. [L2VPN-CFM] describes the \n   capabilities of CFM [802.1ag]
    and VCCV [VCCV] for OAM operations \n   among the bridge module components in
    the VPLS. The OAM functions \n   described in this document builds the additional
    capabilities into \n   VPLS OAM to detect, verify and isolate connectivity faults
    among the \n   VPLS forwarder components. The methodology adopted extends LSP
    Ping \n   concepts described in [RFC4379] and VCCV capabilities described in \n
    \  [VCCV]. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
