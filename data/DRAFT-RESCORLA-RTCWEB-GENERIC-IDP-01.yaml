abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Security for RTCWEB communications requires that the communicating\n
    \  endpoints be able to authenticate each other.  While authentication\n   may
    be mediated by the calling service, there are settings in which\n   this is undesirable.
    \ This document describes a generic mechanism for\n   leveraging existing identity
    providers (IdPs) such as BrowserID or\n   OAuth to provide this authentication
    service.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
