- content: "<p>This document describes a set of recommendations to use when implementing
    ACE/OAuth 2.0 clients that are working in disadvantaged networks. Issues such
    as token revocation have a much higher priority in scenarios where Resource Servers
    are IoT devices, and network connectivity is limited and intermittent.</p>"
