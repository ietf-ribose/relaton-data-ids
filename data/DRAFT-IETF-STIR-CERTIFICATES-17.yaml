abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to prevent the impersonation of telephone numbers
    on the\n   Internet, some kind of credential system needs to exist that\n   cryptographically
    asserts authority over telephone numbers.  This\n   document describes the use
    of certificates in establishing authority\n   over telephone numbers, as a component
    of a broader architecture for\n   managing telephone numbers as identities in
    protocols like SIP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
