abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this paper we propose a new hierarchical method to enhance\n
    \  the current routing and forwarding paradigm for the Internet\n   called Tunneled
    Inter-Domain Routing (TIDR). We will present the\n   way in which TIDR permits
    to establish tunnels to the edge of\n   the network, and how they will be used
    to forward traffic to\n   stub networks. These tunnels will be explicitly signaled
    by\n   using a new transitive BGP attribute called LOCATOR. This new\n   routing
    and forwarding paradigm provides, among others, the\n   following benefits: global
    routing table reduction, inter-domain\n   routing infrastructure protection, improved
    multi-homing of edge\n   networks, numerous forwarding decisions for a particular
    address\n   prefix, it stops the AS number consumption, and it can be\n   smoothly
    deployed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
