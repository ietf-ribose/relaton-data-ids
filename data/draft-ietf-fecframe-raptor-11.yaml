abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction (FEC)
    Schemes for the Raptor and RaptorQ codes and their application to reliable delivery
    of media streams in the context of the FEC Framework. The Raptor and RaptorQ codes
    are systematic codes, where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set
    of source symbols and sent in one or more repair flows in addition to the source
    symbols that are sent to the receiver(s) within a source flow. The Raptor and
    RaptorQ codes offer close to optimal protection against arbitrary packet losses
    at a low computational complexity. Six FEC Schemes are defined: two for the protection
    of arbitrary packet flows, two that are optimized for small source blocks, and
    two for the protection of a single flow that already contains a sequence number.
    Repair data may be sent over arbitrary datagram transport (e.g., UDP) or using
    RTP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
