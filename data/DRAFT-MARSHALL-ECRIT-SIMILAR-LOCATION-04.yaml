abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a new way to provide returned location\n
    \  information in LoST responses that is either of a completed or\n   similar
    form to the original input civic location, based on whether\n   valid or invalid
    civic address elements are returned within the\n   findServiceResponse message.
    \ This document defines a new extension\n   to the findServiceResponse message
    within the LoST protocol [RFC5222]\n   that enables the LoST protocol to return
    a completed civic address\n   element set for a valid location response, and one
    or more suggested\n   sets of similar location information for invalid LoST responses.\n
    \  These two types of civic addresses are referred to as either\n   \"complete
    location\" or \"similar location\", and are included as\n   compilation of ca
    type xml elements within the existing LoST\n   findServiceResponse message structure.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
