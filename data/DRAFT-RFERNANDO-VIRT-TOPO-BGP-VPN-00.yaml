abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents techniques that build on MPLS/VPN control\n
    \  plane mechanisms to construct virtual service topologies in data\n   centers.
    These virtual service topologies interconnect network zones\n   and help to constrain
    the flow of traffic that go between zones so\n   that interesting services can
    be applied to them.\n\n   The techniques suggested are required to create a rich
    overlay\n   network that mimics topology and routing functions of physical\n   networks.
    Steps to create a virtual service topology and the ability\n   to constrain routing
    and traffic to flow in this topology are\n   outlined in this document.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
