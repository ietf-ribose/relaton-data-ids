abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version
    4 minor\n   version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS\n
    \  version 4 minor version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and\n   protocol
    extensions made subsequently.  The later minor version has\n   no dependencies
    on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and is considered a\n   separate protocol.\n\n
    \  This document obsoletes RFC 8881.  In addition to many corrections\n   and
    clarifications, it relies on NFSv4-wide documents to\n   substantially revise
    the treatment of protocol extension,\n   internationalization, and security, superseding
    the descriptions of\n   those aspects of the protocol appearing in RFCs 5661 and
    8881.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
