abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Various Traffic Engineering extensions for OSPF have been proposed
    in\n[KATZ, OSPFEXT] and others. However, these are basically applicable\nonly
    to intra-area Traffic Engineering since they do not support\ninter-area advertisements
    of the resource information. This draft\nproposes a new scheme for advertising
    the summarized resource\ninformation for Traffic Engineering outside the area.
    It also\nspecifies a new LSA to achieve this advertisement.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
