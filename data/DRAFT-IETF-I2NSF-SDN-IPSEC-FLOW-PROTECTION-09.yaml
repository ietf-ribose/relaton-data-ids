abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to provide IPsec-based flow protection\n
    \  (integrity and confidentiality) by means of an Interface to Network\n   Security
    Function (I2NSF) controller.  It considers two main well-\n   known scenarios
    in IPsec: (i) gateway-to-gateway and (ii) host-to-\n   host.  The service described
    in this document allows the\n   configuration and monitoring of IPsec Security
    Associations (SAs)\n   from a I2NSF Controller to one or several flow-based Network
    Security\n   Functions (NSFs) that rely on IPsec to protect data traffic.\n\n
    \  The document focuses on the I2NSF NSF-facing interface by providing\n   YANG
    data models for configuring the IPsec databases (SPD, SAD, PAD)\n   and IKEv2.
    \ This allows IPsec SA establishment with minimal\n   intervention by the network
    administrator.  It does not define any\n   new protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
