abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a set of functional requirements for
    network\n   solutions that allow the support of IP multicast within IP provider\n
    \  provided virtual private networks (PP VPNs).  It specifies\n   requirements
    both from the end user and service provider standpoints.\n   It is intended that
    potential solutions, that specify the support of\n   IP multicast within VPNs,
    use these requirements as a guideline.  It\n   is not the intent of this document
    to propose technical solutions,\n   nor to detail solution specific issues.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
