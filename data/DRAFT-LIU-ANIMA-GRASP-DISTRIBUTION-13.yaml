abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a solution for information distribution
    in\n   autonomic networks. Information distribution is categorized into two\n
    \  different modes: 1) instantaneous distribution; 2) publication for\n   retrieval.
    In the former case, the information is sent, propagates\n   and is disposed of
    after reception. In the latter case, information\n   needs to be stored in the
    network.\n\n   The capabilities to distribute information are basic and fundamental\n
    \  needs for an autonomous network (cf. ANI [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-\n   model]).
    This document describes typical use cases of information\n   distribution in ANI
    and requirements to ANI, such that rich\n   information distribution can be natively
    supported. The document\n   proposes extensions to the autonomic nodes and suggests
    an\n   implementation based on GRASP extensions as a protocol on the wire.\n\n\t
