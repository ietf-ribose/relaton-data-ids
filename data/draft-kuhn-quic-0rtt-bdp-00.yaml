abstract:
- content: "<p>0-RTT is designed to accelerate the throughput at the establishment
    of a connection. There are cases where 0-RTT alone does not improve the time-to-service.
    This memo discusses a solution where a fundamental characteristic of the path
    is learned during the 1-RTT phase and shared with the 0-RTT phase to accelerate
    the initial throughput during subsequent 0-RTT connections.</p>"
