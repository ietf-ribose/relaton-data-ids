abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes the principles of Traffic Engineering (TE)
    in the\n   Internet.  The document is intended to promote better understanding\n
    \  of the issues surrounding traffic engineering in IP networks, and to\n   provide
    a common basis for the development of traffic engineering\n   capabilities for
    the Internet.  The principles, architectures, and\n   methodologies for performance
    evaluation and performance optimization\n   of operational IP networks are discussed
    throughout this document.\n\n   This work was first published as RFC 3272 in May
    2002.  This document\n   obsoletes RFC 3272 by making a complete update to bring
    the text in\n   line with current best practices for Internet traffic engineering
    and\n   to include references to the latest relevant work in the IETF.\n\n\t </p>\n
