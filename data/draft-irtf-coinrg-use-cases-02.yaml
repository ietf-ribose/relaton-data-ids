abstract:
- content: "<p>Computing in the Network (COIN) comes with the prospect of deploying
    processing functionality on networking devices, such as switches and network interface
    cards. While such functionality can be beneficial in several contexts, it has
    to be carefully placed into the context of the general Internet communication.
    This document discusses some use cases to demonstrate how real applications can
    benefit from COIN and to showcase essential requirements that have to be fulfilled
    by COIN applications.</p>"
