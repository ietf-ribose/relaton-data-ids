abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to secure the routing protocols
    which use unicast to transport their signaling messages. Most of such routing
    protocols are TCP-based (e.g., BGP and LDP), and the TCP Authentication Option
    (TCP-AO) is primarily employed for securing the signaling messages of these routing
    protocols. There are also two exceptions: BFD which is over UDP or MPLS, and RSVP-TE
    which is over IP (but employs an integrated approach to protecting the signaling
    messages instead of using IPsec). The proposed mechanism secures pairwise TCP-based
    Routing Protocol (RP) associations, BFD associations and RSVP-TE associations
    using the IKEv2 Key Management Protocol (KMP) integrated with TCP-AO, BFD, and
    RSVP-TE respectively. Included are extensions to IKEv2 and its Security Associations
    to enable its key negotiation to support TCP-AO, BFD, and RSVP-TE.</p>"
