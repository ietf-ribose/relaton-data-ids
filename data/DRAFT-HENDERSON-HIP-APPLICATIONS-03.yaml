abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Host Identity Protocol and architecture (HIP) proposes to
    add a\ncryptographic name space for network stack names.  From an\napplication
    viewpoint, HIP-enabled systems support a new address\nfamily (e.g., AF_HOST),
    but it may be a long time until such HIP-\naware applications are widely deployed
    even if host systems are\nupgraded.  This informational document discusses implementation
    and\nAPI issues relating to using HIP in situations in which the system is\nHIP-aware
    but the applications are not.\n\t </p>\n      "
