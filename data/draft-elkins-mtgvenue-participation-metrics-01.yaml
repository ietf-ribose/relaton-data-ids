abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF meetings are held physically in various geographic regions of
    the world. One of the criteria for choosing a location is the amount of participation
    by the people in that region. Additionally, questions arise as to whether holding
    a physical meeting in a location increases the amount of participation by local
    attendees. Participation in the IETF process may occur in a number of different
    ways: email lists, writing drafts, physical or remote attendance at a meeting,
    chairing Working Groups and so on. This document defines the metrics and terms
    which may be used to measure participation both before and after an IETF meeting.</p>"
