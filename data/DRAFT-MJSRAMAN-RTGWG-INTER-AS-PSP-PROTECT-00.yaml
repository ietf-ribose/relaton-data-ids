abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this paper, we propose a framework to build protection /
    backup\n   paths for power shortest primary inter-AS TE-LSPs. The primary path\n
    \  is built within a framework to reduce the aggregate power consumption\n   of
    the Internet using a collaborative approach between Autonomous\n   Systems (AS).
    We identify the low-power paths among the AS and then\n   use Traffic Engineering
    (TE) techniques to route the packets along\n   the paths. Such low-power paths
    can be identified by using the\n   consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth (PWR)
    ratio as an additional\n   constraint in the Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF)
    algorithm.\n   For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power paths,
    the\n   Inter-AS Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans\n
    \  multiple AS can be used.\n\n   Once the primary paths have been built we use
    the same techniques to\n   build backup power shortest paths in a similar manner
    except by\n   excluding the nodes (ASes) and links (between these ASes) that are\n
    \  present in the primary path. This way the backup path does not\n   traverse
    any of the ASes or links between these ASes of the primary\n   path so constructed.\n\n
    \  Extensions to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can be used to\n   disseminate
    the PWR ratio metric among the AS thereby creating a\n   collaborative approach
    to reduce the power consumption. Since\n   calculating the low-power paths can
    be computationally intensive, a\n   graph-labeling heuristic is also proposed.
    This heuristic reduces the\n   computational complexity but may provide a sub-optimal
    low-power\n   path. The feasibility of our approaches is illustrated by applying\n
    \  our algorithm to a subset of the Internet. The techniques proposed in\n   this
    paper for the Inter-AS power reduction require minimal\n   modifications to the
    existing features of the Internet. The proposed\n   techniques can be extended
    to other levels of Internet hierarchy,\n   such as Intra-AS paths, through suitable
    modifications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
