abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EVPN IRB has been deployed following [RFC9135]'s early draft
    for a\n   long time.  This draft discusses how can these existing deployments\n
    \  smoothly evolved into an IP-aliasing\n   ([I-D.sajassi-bess-evpn-ip-aliasing])
    enhanced EVPN symmetric IRB\n   scenario, especially when two of an IP-VRF's BDs
    (whose IRB\n   interfaces are attached to the same IP-VRF) have been attched to
    a\n   common ES before that network evolution.  In such case, when these\n   two
    BDs are evolved into IP-aliasing enhanced EVPN symmetric IRB as\n   per [I-D.sajassi-bess-evpn-ip-aliasing]
    or distributed Bump-in-the-\n   wire as per [I-D.wang-bess-evpn-distributed-bump-in-the-wire],
    the IP\n   A-D per EVI routes of these two BDs may conflict with each other in\n
    \  the context of the IP-VRF instance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
