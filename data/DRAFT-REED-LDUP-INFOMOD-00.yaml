abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>[LDUP Model] describes the architectural approach to replication
    of\nLDAP directory contents.  This document describes the information\nmodel and
    schema elements which support LDAP Replication Services\nwhich conform to [LDUP
    Model].\n \nDirectory schema is extended to provide object classes, subentries,\nand
    attributes to describe areas of the namespace which are under\ncommon administrative
    authority, units of replication (ie, subtrees,\nor partitions of the namespace,
    which are replicated), servers which\nhold replicas of various types for the various
    partitions of the\nnamespace, which namespaces are held on given servers, and
    the\nprogress of various namespace management and replication operations.\nAmong
    other things, this knowledge of where directory content is\nlocated will provide
    the basis for dynamic generation of LDAP\nreferrals for clients who can follow
    them.\n \nThe controlling framework by which the relationships, types, and\nhealth
    of replicas of the directory content will be defined so that,\nas much as possible,
    directory content is itself used to monitor and\ncontrol the environment.\n \nSecurity
    information, including access control policy identifiers and\ninformation will
    be treated as directory content by the replication\nprotocols when specified by
    the LDAPEXT group.\n \nThe information model will describe required and optional
    house-\nkeeping duties for compliant systems to implement, such as garbage\ncollection
    of deleted objects, reconciliation of moved and renamed\nobjects, update sequencing
    and transaction bracketing of changes, etc.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
