abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of this document is to make the AES Key Wrap algorithm
    \nconveniently available to the Internet community.  The United States \nof America
    has adopted AES as the new encryption standard.  The AES \nKey Wrap algorithm
    will probably be adopted by the USA for \nencryption of AES keys.  The authors
    took most of the text in this \ndocument from the draft AES Key Wrap posted by
    NIST. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
