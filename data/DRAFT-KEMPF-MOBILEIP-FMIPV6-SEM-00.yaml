abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The FMIPv6 draft proposes a number of changes in the local link
    and \nrouting information exchange architecture for wireless networks that \nare
    not quite aligned with standard IETF protocols, including the \nbase MIPv6 protocol
    itself. This draft proposes modifications of \nFMIPv6 to tighten the semantics
    of anticipated care-of address \nconfiguration around the prehandover signaling
    as a logical \nextension of Router Discovery, and around the HI/HAck exchange
    as a \nlogical extension of routing information propagation. It also \nproposes
    some extensions to Router Discovery for reactive handover \nto piggyback signaling
    for quickly establishing a tunnel to the \nPrevious Access Router on top of standard
    RFC 2461 Router Discovery \nsignaling. \n\t </p>\n      "
