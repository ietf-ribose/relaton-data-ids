abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate\n
    \  System) TLV that enables the reporting by an Intermediate System of\n   sets
    of addresses of different types such that all of the addresses\n   in each set
    designate the same interface (port). For example, an\n   EUI-48 MAC (Extended
    Unique Identifier 48-bit, Media Access Control)\n   address, IPv4 address, and
    IPv6 address can be reported as all\n   corresponding to the same interface. Such
    information could be used,\n   for example, to synthesize responses to or by-pass
    the need for the\n   Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) or the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
    (ND)\n   protocol in some cases.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
