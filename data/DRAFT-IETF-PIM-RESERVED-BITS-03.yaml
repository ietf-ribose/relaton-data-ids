abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The PIM version 2 messages share a common message header format.
    \ The\n   common header definition contains eight reserved bits.  This document\n
    \  specifies how these bits may be used by individual message types, and\n   creates
    a registry containing the per message type usage.  This\n   document also extends
    the PIM type space by defining three new\n   message types.  For each of the new
    types, four of the previously\n   reserved bits are used to form an extended type
    range.\n\n   This document Updates RFC7761 and RFC3973 by defining the use of
    the\n   currently Reserved field in the PIM common header.  This document\n   further
    updates RFC7761 and RFC3973, along with RFC5015, RFC5059,\n   RFC6754 and RFC8364,
    by specifying the use of the currently Reserved\n   bits for each PIM message.\n\n
    \  This document obsoletes RFC6166.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
