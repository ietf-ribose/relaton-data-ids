abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document intents to provide a general and all-round multicast\n
    \  model, which tries to stand at a high level to take full advantages\n   of
    existed multicast protocol models to control the multicast\n   network, and guides
    the deployment of multicast service.  And also,\n   there will define several
    possible RPCs about how to interact between\n   multicast info model and multicast
    protocol models.  This multicast\n   information model is mainly used by the management
    tools run by the\n   network operators in order to manage, monitor and debug the
    network\n   resources used to deliver multicast service, as well as gathering\n
    \  some data from the network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
