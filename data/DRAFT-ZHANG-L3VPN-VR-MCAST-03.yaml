abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This document specifies the procedures required to be implemented
    for \n    IP multicast traffic to travel from one VPN site to another within a
    \n    VR-VPN (Virtual Router-based IP VPN).It details the solution about \n    the
    process in local customer sites, establishing of multicast \n    distribution
    trees in SP networks and forwarding of multicast data \n    packets. \n\n    This
    document is based on Requirements for Multicast in L3 Provider-\n    Provisioned
    VPNs [MREQT] and specification of Network based IP VPN \n    Architecture using
    Virtual Routers [VR-VPN] that have been \n    implemented and deployed. \n\n\t
