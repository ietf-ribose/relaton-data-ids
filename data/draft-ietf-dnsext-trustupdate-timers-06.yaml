abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a means for automated, authenticated, and authorized
    updating of DNSSEC "trust anchors". The method provides protection against N-1
    key compromises of N keys in the trust point key set. Based on the trust established
    by the presence of a current anchor, other anchors may be added at the same place
    in the hierarchy, and, ultimately, supplant the existing anchor(s). This mechanism
    will require changes to resolver management behavior (but not resolver resolution
    behavior), and the addition of a single flag bit to the DNSKEY record. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
