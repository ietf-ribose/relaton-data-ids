abstract:
- content: "<p>In recent years we have begun to see a convergence of Internet technologies
    with traditional media formats such as video and audio. It is therefore likely
    that movies and television with surround sound capabilities are soon to be dispersed
    around the Internet. AC-3 is standard multi-channel compression format for HDTV,
    DVD, and other video formats, but there is no uniform MIME type for these files</p>"
