abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Sliding window protocols use finite sequence numbers to determine\n
    \  segment placement and order. These sequence number spaces wrap\n   around and
    are reused during the operation of such protocols. This\n   document describes
    a way to extend the size of these sequence\n   numbers at the endpoints to avoid
    the impact of that wrap and reuse\n   without transmitting additional information
    in the packet header.\n   The resulting extended sequence numbers can be used
    at the endpoints\n   in encryption and authentication algorithms to ensure input
    bit\n   patterns do not repeat over the lifetime of a connection.\n\n\t </p>\n
