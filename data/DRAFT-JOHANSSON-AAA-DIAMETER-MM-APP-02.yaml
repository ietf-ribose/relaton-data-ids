abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a Diameter application that allows a Diameter\nserver
    to authenticate, authorize, and collect accounting information\nfor Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) services rendered to a client\nnode.  This application, combined
    with the base Diameter protocol and\nappropriate SIP extensions, allows SIP User
    Agents (UAs) to obtain\nservices from SIP servers that are connected to a Diameter\ninfrastructure.
    \ When combined with the Inter-Domain capability of\nthe base protocol, service
    may even be obtained from SIP servers that\nbelong to foreign domains, as would
    be encountered by roaming mobile\nnodes.\nNote that the specification defined
    here may be used independently of\nthe authentication technique used for authenticating
    a node's link\nlayer or network-layer access.  In particular, we do not require
    that\nthe client node was authenticated for access with the use of either\nthe
    Mobile IP [4] or NASREQ [3] Diameter application.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
