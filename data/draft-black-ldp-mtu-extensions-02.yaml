abstract:
- content: "<p>Proper functioning of RFC 1191 path MTU detection requires that IP
    routers have knowledge of the MTU for each link to which they are connected. As
    currently specified in [LDP], LDP does not have the ability to signal the MTU
    for an LSP to ingress LSRs. This document specifies extensions to the LDP label
    distribution protocol in support of LSP MTU signalling.</p>"
