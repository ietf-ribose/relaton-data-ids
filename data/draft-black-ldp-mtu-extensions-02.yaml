abstract:
  content: "<p>Proper functioning of RFC 1191 path MTU detection requires that IProuters
    have knowledge of the MTU for each link to which they areconnected. As currently
    specified in [LDP], LDP does not have theability to signal the MTU for an LSP
    to ingress LSRs.This document specifies extensions to the LDP label distributionprotocol
    in support of LSP MTU signalling.</p>"
