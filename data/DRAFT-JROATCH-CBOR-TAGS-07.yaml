abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is
    a data\n   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small\n
    \  code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the\n   need
    for version negotiation.\n\n   The present document makes use of this extensibility
    to define a\n   number of CBOR tags for typed arrays of numeric data, as well
    as two\n   additional tags for multi-dimensional and homogeneous arrays.  It is\n
    \  intended as the reference document for the IANA registration of the\n   CBOR
    tags defined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
