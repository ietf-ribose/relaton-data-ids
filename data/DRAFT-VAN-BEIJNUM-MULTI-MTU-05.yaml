abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the early days of the internet, many different link types
    with\n   many different maximum packet sizes were in use.  For point-to-point\n
    \  or point-to-multipoint links, there are still some other link types\n   (PPP,
    ATM, Packet over SONET), but multipoint subnets are now almost\n   exclusively
    implemented as Ethernets.  Even though the relevant\n   standards mandate a 1500
    byte maximum packet size for Ethernet, more\n   and more Ethernet equipment is
    capable of handling packets bigger\n   than 1500 bytes.  However, since this capability
    isn't standardized,\n   it is seldom used today, despite the potential performance
    benefits\n   of using larger packets.  This document specifies mechanisms to\n
    \  negotiate per-neighbor maximum packet sizes so that nodes on a\n   multipoint
    subnet may use the maximum mutually supported packet size\n   between them without
    being limited by nodes with smaller maximum\n   sizes on the same subnet.\n\n\t
