abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Media Delivery Index (MDI) measurement that can be used as
    a\n   diagnostic tool or a quality indicator for monitoring flows that are\n   sensitive
    to arrival time and packet loss is defined in [RFC4445].\n   This document extends
    the Media Delivery Index with a new component:\n   Effective Loss Factor (ELF),
    which takes loss distribution into\n   account when measuring packet loss.  ELF
    is also applicable when\n   certain Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes are
    used.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
