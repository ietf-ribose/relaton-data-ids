abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a mechanism for delegating authorization to a
    piece of software, and conveying that delegation to the software. This delegation
    can include access to a set of APIs as well as information passed directly to
    the software. This document is input into the GNAP working group and should be
    referred to as "XYZ" to differentiate it from other proposals.</p>
