abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes a modification to CNAME record to coexist
    withSOA and NS records at the zone apex. This proposal will improvealiasing in
    the DNS system. The users are often forced to manuallyadd duplicate A, AAAA and
    MX records by copying data from the targetzone to the aliased zone. This forces
    zone owner to keep track oftarget domain name since the mismatch in the data could
    causefailures. This administrative burden will be eliminated by allowingCNAME
    to coexist with NS and SOA resource records.</p>"
