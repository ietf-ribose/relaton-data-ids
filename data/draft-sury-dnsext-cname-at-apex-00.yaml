abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a modification to CNAME record to coexist with
    SOA and NS records at the zone apex. This proposal will improve aliasing in the
    DNS system. The users are often forced to manually add duplicate A, AAAA and MX
    records by copying data from the target zone to the aliased zone. This forces
    zone owner to keep track of target domain name since the mismatch in the data
    could cause failures. This administrative burden will be eliminated by allowing
    CNAME to coexist with NS and SOA resource records.</p>"
