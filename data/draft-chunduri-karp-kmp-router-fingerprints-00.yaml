abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the usage of Router Fingerprint Authentication
    (RFA) with public keys. This can be used as a peer authentication method with
    KARP Key Management Protocol (KMP). KARP KMP automates key negotiation for securing
    TCP-based pairwise Routing Protocols (RPs) like BGP, LDP. The advantage of RFA
    is, neither it requires out-of-band, mutually agreeable symmetric keys nor a full
    PKI based system (trust anchor or CA certificates) for mutual authentication of
    the peers with KARP KMP deployments. Usage of Router Fingerprints give a significant
    operational improvement from symmetric key based systems and yet provide a secure
    authentication technique.</p>"
