abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms allow for burst\n
    \  tolerance while enforcing short queues to minimise the time that\n   packets
    spend enqueued at a bottleneck.  This can cause noticeable\n   performance degradation
    for TCP connections traversing such a\n   bottleneck, especially if there are
    only a few flows or their\n   bandwidth-delay-product is large.  An Explicit Congestion\n
    \  Notification (ECN) signal indicates that an AQM mechanism is used at\n   the
    bottleneck, and therefore the bottleneck network queue is likely\n   to be short.
    \ This document therefore proposes an update to RFC3168,\n   which changes the
    TCP sender-side ECN reaction in congestion\n   avoidance to reduce the Congestion
    Window (cwnd) by a smaller amount\n   than the congestion control algorithm's
    reaction to inferred packet\n   loss.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
