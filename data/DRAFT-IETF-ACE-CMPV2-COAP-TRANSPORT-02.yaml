abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the use of Constrained Application
    Protocol\n   (CoAP) as a transport medium for the Certificate Management Protocol\n
    \  (CMP) as mentioned in the Lightweight CMP Profile\n   [Lightweight-CMP-Profile].
    \ CMP defines the interaction between\n   various PKI entities for the purpose
    of certificate creation and\n   management.  CoAP is an HTTP like client-server
    protocol used by\n   various constrained devices in the IoT space.\n\n\t </p>\n
