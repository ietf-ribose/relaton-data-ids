abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft documents a set of use cases and requirements for
    end-to-\n   end intent-based paths spanning multi-domain packet networks.  The\n
    \  document explicitly focuses on use cases that require high scale and\n   availability,
    which will likely benefit from distributed solutions.\n   It is intended that
    the requirements in this document serve as a\n   basis for future IETF work to
    develop distributed solutions for\n   inter-domain intent-based transport paths.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
