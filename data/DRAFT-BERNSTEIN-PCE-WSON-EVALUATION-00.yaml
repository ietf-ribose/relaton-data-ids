abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this note a number of PCE architectural and computational options
    \nare evaluated against a medium sized wavelength switched optical \nnetwork.
    The key performance measures of overall and backward \nblocking are reported under
    different dynamic traffic scenarios. The \ncorresponding reduction in connection
    blocking probabilities and \ncomputational advantages enabled by these architectural
    alternatives \nstrongly warrant their inclusion in continuing PCE WSON work.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
