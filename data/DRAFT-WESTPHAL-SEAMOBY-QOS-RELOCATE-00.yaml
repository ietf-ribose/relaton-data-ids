abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Seamless offering of Quality of Service (QoS) to a Mobile Node
    during\nhandovers is considered crucial for enabling a variety of application\nservices
    in the Mobile Internet.  In this document, we define the QoS\ncontexts and show
    how they could be transferred to enable seamless QoS\noperation during handovers.
    \ We introduce the notion of QoS Profile\nTypes and the associated QoS Profiles,
    which together constitute QoS\ncontexts, that facilitate QoS inter-operability
    among the pariticipating\naccess routers.  We also illustrate how these contexts
    can be used with\nfast handover signaling.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
