abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the LISA (Linked Slow-Start Algorithm) for
    Multipath TCP (MPTCP). Currently during slow-start, subflows behave like independent
    TCP flows making MPTCP unfair to cross-traffic and causing more congestion at
    the bottleneck. This also yields more losses among the MPTCP subflows. LISA couples
    the initial windows (IW) of MPTCP subflows during the initial slow-start phase
    to remove this adverse behavior.</p>"
