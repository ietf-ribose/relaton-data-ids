abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how push notification mechanisms can be used
    to wake up suspended Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UAs), in order
    to be able to receive and generate SIP requests. The document defines new SIP
    URI parameters, that can be used in a SIP REGISTER request to provide push notification
    information from the SIP User Agent (UA) to the SIP entity (realized as a SIP
    proxy in this document) that will send a push request to the push server in order
    to trigger a push notification towards the SIP UA.</p>"
