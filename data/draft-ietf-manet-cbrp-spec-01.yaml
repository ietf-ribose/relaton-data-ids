abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Cluster Based Routing Protocol (CBRP) is a routing protocol designedfor
    use in mobile ad hoc networks. The protocol divides the nodes ofthe ad hoc network
    into a number of overlapping or disjoint 2-hop-diameter clusters in a distributed
    manner. A cluster head is electedfor each cluster to maintain cluster membership
    information. Inter-cluster routes are discovered dynamically using the clustermembership
    information kept at each cluster head. By clusteringnodes into groups, the protocol
    efficiently minimizes the floodingtraffic during route discovery and speeds up
    this process as well.Furthermore, the protocol takes into consideration the existence
    ofuni-directional links and uses these links for both intra-cluster andinter-cluster
    routing.</p>"
