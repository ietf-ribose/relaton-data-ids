abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a set of new authentication methods to
    be\nused within Phase 1 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE). The proposed\nmethods
    assume an asymmetry between the authenticating entities. One\nentity, typically
    an Edge Device (e.g. firewall), authenticates using\nstandard public key techniques
    (in signature mode), while the other\nentity, typically a remote User, authenticates
    using challenge\nresponse techniques. These authentication methods are used to\nestablish,
    at the end of Phase 1, an IKE SA which is unidirectionally\nauthenticated. To
    make this IKE bi-directionally authenticated, this\nPhase 1 is immediately followed
    by an X-Auth Exchange [XAUTH]. The\nX-Auth Exchange is used to authenticate the
    remote User. The use of\nthese authentication methods is referred to as Hybrid
    Authentication\nmode.\nThis proposal is designed to provide a solution for environments\nwhere
    a legacy authentication system exists, yet a full public key\ninfrastructure is
    not deployed.\n\t </p>\n      "
