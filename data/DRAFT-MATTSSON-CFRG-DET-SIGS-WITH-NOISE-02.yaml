abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Deterministic elliptic-curve signatures such as deterministic
    ECDSA\n   and EdDSA have gained popularity over randomized ECDSA as their\n   security
    do not depend on a source of high-quality randomness.\n   Recent research has
    however found that implementations of these\n   signature algorithms may be vulnerable
    to certain side-channel and\n   fault injection attacks due to their determinism.
    \ One countermeasure\n   to such attacks is to re-add randomness to the otherwise\n
    \  deterministic calculation of the per-message secret number.  This\n   document
    updates RFC 6979 and RFC 8032 to recommend constructions\n   with additional randomness
    for deployments where side-channel attacks\n   and fault injection attacks are
    a concern.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
