abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP provides a SIP Events notification framework that is extensible
    throught the addition of event packages. This document defines a transaction event
    package for the SIP Events notification, along with a data format used in notifications
    for this package. The transaction package allows users to subscribe to a resource
    in an application server and receive notifications about the changes in state
    of transactions the application server initiates as part of a service. Additionally,
    we define a new SIP Associated-Transactions-State header field that allows a server
    to return a subscrible URI that provides transactions notification information.</p>"
