abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents motivation, a problem statement and operational
    requirements for a traffic distribution problem in today's IP/MPLS network when
    multiple links are configured between two routers. It defines a composite link
    as a group of parallel links that can be considered as a single traffic engineering
    link or as an IP link, and used for MPLS. The framework described in a companion
    document is used to organize the requirements.</p>"
