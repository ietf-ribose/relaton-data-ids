abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a foundation for the research work done as the
    Secure Multicast Group (SMuG)of the IRTF. The document begins by introducing a
    Reference Framework and problem areas, and proceeds to identify functional building
    blocks for a secure multicast solution. The identified building blocks, their
    definition and realization will be the subject of future work of SmuG.</p>"
