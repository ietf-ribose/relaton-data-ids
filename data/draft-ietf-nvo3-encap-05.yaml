abstract:
- content: "<p>As communicated by WG Chairs, the IETF NVO3 chairs and Routing Area
    director have chartered a design team to take forward the encapsulation discussion
    and see if there is potential to design a common encapsulation that addresses
    the various technical concerns. There are implications of different encapsulations
    in real environments consisting of both software and hardware implementations
    and spanning multiple data centers. For example, OAM functions such as path MTU
    discovery become challenging with multiple encapsulations along the data path.
    The design team recommend Geneve with few modifications as the common encapsulation,
    more details are described in section 7.</p>"
