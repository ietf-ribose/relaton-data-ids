abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Advancing a protocol to Draft Standard requires documentation
    of the interoperation and implementation of the protocol.  Historic reports have
    varied widely in form and level of content and there is little guidance available
    to new report preparers.  This document updates the existing processes and provides
    more detail on what is appropriate in an interoperability and implementation report.
    \ This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
    Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t </p>\n
