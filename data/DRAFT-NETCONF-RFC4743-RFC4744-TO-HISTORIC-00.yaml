abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document moves RFC4743 (Using NETCONF over the Simple
    Object\n   Access Protocol (SOAP)) and RFC4744 (Using the NETCONF Protocol over\n
    \  the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP)) to HISTORIC status to\n   reflect
    the fact that those two documents have shown very little (if\n   any) implementations
    and deployment.  Furthermore, no-one in the\n   NETCONF WG is interested or volunteering
    to work on them anymore.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
