abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an overview of the issues associated
    with the\n   deployment of service functions (such as firewalls, load balancers)\n
    \  in large-scale environments.  The term service function chaining is\n   used
    to describe the definition and instantiation of an ordered set\n   of instances
    of such service functions, and the subsequent \"steering\"\n   of traffic flows
    through those service functions.\n\n   The set of enabled service function chains
    reflect operator service\n   offerings and is designed in conjunction with application
    delivery\n   and service and network policy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
