abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ethernet can be a very promising technology for mobile Fronthaul
    and\n   Backhaul traffic transportation, even an integrated Fronthaul /\n   Backhaul
    (XHaul), although there are still some challenges.  This\n   memo tries to analyze
    some of the challenges and issues, such as L2\n   or L3 (MPLS/IP) forwarding,
    packet loss, etc., and to find out some\n   requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
