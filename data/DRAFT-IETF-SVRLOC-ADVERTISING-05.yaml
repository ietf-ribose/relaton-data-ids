abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a solution to the problem of finding\n
    \  information about that services are being offered at a particular\n   Internet
    domain, based on deployment experience with the Netfind\n   White Pages directory
    software.\n \n   This approach makes it possible to supply clients with more\n
    \  information than the DNS aliases that have been widely deployed in\n   this
    role - notably the port numbers being used by servers.  However,\n   it is not
    without problems, and we have tried to take account of\n   these.\n\n\t </p>\n
