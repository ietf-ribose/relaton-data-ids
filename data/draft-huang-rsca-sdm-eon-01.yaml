abstract:
- content: "<p>This documentary provides a routing, spectrum and core assignment method
    with the dividing frequency slots area for space division multiplexing elastic
    optical networks. This effective RSCA method to solve this problem better. The
    proposed method utilizes the Frequency Slots Area (FSA) concept and first-last
    fit policy of frequency slots assignment to have less spectrum fragments, lower
    crosstalk, smaller traffic blocking probability and higher spectrum resource utilization.</p>"
