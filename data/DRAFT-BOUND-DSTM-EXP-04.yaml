abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In an IPv6 dominant environment, some applications will still
    require\n   IPv4 addresses to interoperate.  Dual stack may be configured on\n
    \  these hosts, but this will imply the configuration of network\n   equipments
    (such as routers) to proceed IPv4 packets.  The Dual Stack\n   IPv6 Dominant Transition
    Mechanism (DSTM) is based on the use of\n   IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnels to carry IPv4
    traffic within an IPv6 network\n   and provides a method to allocate a temporary
    IPv4 address to Dual IP\n   Layer IPv6/IPv4 capable nodes.  DSTM is also a way
    to avoid the use\n   of Network Address Translation for early adopter IPv6 deployment
    to\n   communicate with IPv4 legacy nodes and applications.\n\t </p>\n      "
