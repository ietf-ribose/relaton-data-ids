abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism to indicate which traffic engineering
    protocols are enabled on a link in OSPF. It does so by introducing a new Traffic-Engineering
    Protocol sub-TLV for the Link TLV in the OSPFv2 TE Opaque LSA. This document also
    describes mechanisms to address backward compatibility issues for routers that
    have not yet been upgraded to software that understands this new sub- TLV.</p>"
