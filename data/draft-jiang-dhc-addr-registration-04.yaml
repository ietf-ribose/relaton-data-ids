abstract:
- content: "<p>In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, host self-generated addresses
    are notionally conflicted with the network managed address architecture. These
    addresses need to be registered in the networking management plate for the purposes
    of central address administration. This document introduces a generic address
    registration solution using DHCPv6, and defines one new ND option and one new
    DHCPv6 option in order to propagate the solicitations of registering self-generated
    addresses. The registration procedure reuses the existing IA_NA in the DHCPv6
    protocol.</p>"
