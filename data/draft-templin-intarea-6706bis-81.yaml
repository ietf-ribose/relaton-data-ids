abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the operation of IP over Overlay Multilink
    Network (OMNI) interfaces using the Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO)
    internetworking and mobility management service. AERO/OMNI use an IPv6 link-local
    address format that supports operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol
    and links ND to IP forwarding. Prefix delegation/registration services are employed
    for network admission and to manage the routing system. Multilink operation, mobility
    management, quality of service (QoS) signaling and route optimization are naturally
    supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates. Standard IP multicasting services
    are also supported. AERO is a widely-applicable mobile internetworking service
    especially well-suited to aviation services, intelligent transportation systems,
    mobile Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and many other applications.</p>"
