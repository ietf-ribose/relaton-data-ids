abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   PF_KEY is a generic key management API used for communication
    between\n   a trusted user level key management daemon and a key engine within\n
    \  the operating system.  With the extension of IKEv2 for mobility and\n   multihoming
    (MOBIKE) the existing capabilities of PF_KEY with regard\n   to the creation,
    maintenance and deletion of security associations\n   became insufficient.  This
    document defines an extension to update an\n   entity in the security association
    database.  Additionally, it is\n   necessary to reflect the newly offered integrity
    and encryption\n   algorithms with IKEv2 in PF_KEY.\n\t </p>\n      "
