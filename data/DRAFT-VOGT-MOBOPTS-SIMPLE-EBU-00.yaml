abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IPv6 defines a return-routability procedure for secure
    use of\nroute optimization between unacquainted nodes.  Unfortunately, this\nprocedure
    is known to have undesired impacts on handoff latency.\nThis document specifies
    extensions to Mobile IPv6 that eliminate the\nlatency of the return-routability
    procedure.  The extensions thus\nprovide a basis for more efficient reactive as
    well as proactive\nhandoff management.  They are optional and fully backward-compatible.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
