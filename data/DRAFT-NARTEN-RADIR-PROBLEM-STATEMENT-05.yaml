abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There has been much discussion over the last years about the overall\nscalability
    of the Internet routing system.  Some have argued that\nthe resources required
    to maintain routing tables in the core of the\nInternet are growing faster than
    available technology will be able to\nkeep up.  Others disagree with that assessment.
    \ This document\nattempts to describe the factors that are placing pressure on
    the\nrouting system and the growth trends behind those factors.\n\t </p>\n      "
