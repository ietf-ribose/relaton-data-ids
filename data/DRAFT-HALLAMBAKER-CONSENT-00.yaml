abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>               We propose a mechanism Proof of Consent that allows
    an \n               email recipient to provide verifiable proof of ‘opt-in’ \n
    \              consent to receive email. Proof of Consent may be used \n               to
    automatically whitelist email from mailing lists and \n               email forwarded
    from another email server. \n                \n               Proof of Consent
    is designed to require minimal state \n               maintenance by both the
    email sender and the recipient \n               and to be deployable with minimal
    impact on existing \n               email infrastructure. \n\t </p>\n      "
