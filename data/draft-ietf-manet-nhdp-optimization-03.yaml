abstract:
- content: <p>The link quality mechanism of the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol
    (NHDP) enables "ignoring" some 1-hop neighbors if the measured link quality from
    that 1-hop neighbor is below an acceptable threshold, while still retaining the
    corresponding link information as acquired from HELLO message exchange. This allows
    immediate reinstatement of the 1-hop neighbor if the link quality later improves
    sufficiently. NHDP also collects information about symmetric 2-hop neighbors.
    However it specifies that if a link from a symmetric 1-hop neighbor ceases being
    symmetric, including while "ignored" as described above, then corresponding symmetric
    2-hop neighbors are removed. This may lead to symmetric 2-hop neighborhood information
    being permanently removed (until further HELLO messages are received) if the link
    quality of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable threshold, even
    if only for a moment. This specification updates RFC6130 "Mobile Ad Hoc Network
    (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)", and RFC7181 "The Optimized Link
    State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)" to permit retaining, but ignoring,
    symmetric 2-hop information when the link quality from the corresponding 1-hop
    neighbor drops below the acceptable threshold. This allows immediate reinstatement
    of the symmetric 2-hop neighbor if the link quality later improves sufficiently,
    thus making the symmetric 2-hop neighborhood more "robust".</p>
