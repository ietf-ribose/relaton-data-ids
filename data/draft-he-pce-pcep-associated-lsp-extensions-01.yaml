abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) requirements document[RFC5654],
    describes that MPLS-TP MUST support associated bidirectional point- to-point LSPs.
    Path Computation Element (PCE), see [RFC4655], may be used for path computation
    of an associated bidirectional LSP. This document defines the Path Computation
    Element Protocol (PCEP)-based [RFC5440] extensions for associated bidirectional
    LSP.</p>"
