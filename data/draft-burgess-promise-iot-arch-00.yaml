abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes architectural recommendations for an Internet
    of Things scenario, based on tried and tested principles from infrastructure science.
    We describe a functional service architecture that may be applied in the manner
    of a platform, from the smallest scale to the largest scale, using vendor agnostic
    principles. The current draft is rooted in the principles of Promise Theory[Bergstra1]
    and voluntary cooperation.</p>"
