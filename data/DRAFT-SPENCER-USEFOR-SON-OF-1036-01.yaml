abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>By the early 1990s, it had become clear that RFC 1036, then the
    specification for the Interchange of USENET Messages, was badly in need of repair.
    This \"Internet-Draft-to-be\", though never formally published at that time, was
    widely circulated and became the de facto standard for implementors of News Servers
    and User Agents, rapidly acquiring the nickname \"Son of 1036\". Indeed, under
    that name, it could fairly be described as the best-known Internet Draft (n)ever
    published, and it formed the starting point for the recently adopted Proposed
    Standards for Netnews.\n\n It is being published now in order to provide the historical
    background out of which those standards have grown. Present-day implementors should
    be aware that it is NOT NOW APPROPRIATE for use in current implementations. This
    document defines a Historic Document for the Internet community.\n\t </p>\n      "
