abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The  Point-to-Point  Protocol  (PPP)  [1] provides a standard
    method for\ntransporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.\n
    \nThe PPP Compression Control Protocol [2] provides a method to  negotiate\nand
    utilize compression protocols over PPP encapsulated links.\n \nVersion  2  of
    the Microsoft Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol\n(MS-CHAP-2) [3] is
    a Microsoft-proprietary PPP authentication  protocol,\nproviding  the  functionality
    \ to  which  LAN-based users are accustomed\nwhile integrating the encryption
    and hashing algorithms used on  Windows\nnetworks.\n\nMicrosoft   Point   to  Point
    \ Encryption  (MPPE)  [4]  is  a  means  of\nrepresenting PPP packets in an encrypted
    form.  MPPE uses  the  RSA  RC4\n[5]  algorithm  to provide data confidentiality.
    \ The length of the ses-\nsion key to be used for initializing encryption tables
    \ can  be  negoti-\nated.   MPPE  currently  supports 40-bit and 128-bit session
    keys.  MPPE\nsession keys are changed frequently; the exact  frequency  depends
    \ upon\nthe  options  negotiated,  but  may be every packet.  MPPE is negotiated\nwithin
    option 18 [6] in the Compression Control Protocol.\n \nThis document describes
    the method used to derive the initial MPPE  ses-\nsion keys from MS-CHAP-2 credentials.
    \ The algorithm used to change ses-\nsion keys during a session is described in
    [4].\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
