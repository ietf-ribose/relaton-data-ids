abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines how to use the WebRTC Data Channel mechanism,
    together with the Data Channel Establishment Protocol (DCEP) in order to establish
    a data channel, referred to as CLUE Data Channel, for transporting CLUE protocol
    messages between two CLUE entities. The document defines the SCTP considerations
    specific to a CLUE Data Channel, the SDP offer/answer procedures for negotiating
    the establishment of, and the DCEP procedures for opening, a CLUE Data Channel.
    Details and procedures associated with the CLUE protocol are outside the scope
    of this document.</p>"
