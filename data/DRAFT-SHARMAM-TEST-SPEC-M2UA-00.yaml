abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents the test specifications for M2UA (MTP2
    User\nAdaptation) protocol (RFC 3331), which can be used to test M2UA\nimplementations
    for conformance to the protocol definition. The list of\ntest is exhaustive and
    covers almost all the categories of test.\nThis draft can also be used in conjunction
    with M2UA specification by\nimplementers of protocol as implementers guide, as
    the pictorial\nrepresentation of various scenarios help easy understanding of
    the\nprotocol. Next revision of the draft will cover the additions done to\nthe
    protocol revision and any subsequent RFC published by IETF.\n\t </p>\n      "
