abstract:
- content: "<p>In [I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition], the authors have
    provided a definition of the route leak problem, and also enumerated several types
    of route leaks. In this document, we first examine which of those route-leak types
    are detected and mitigated by the existing origin validation [RFC 6811] and BGPSEC
    path validation [I- D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol]. Where the current BGPSEC protocol
    doesn't offer a solution, this document suggests an enhancement that would extend
    the route-leak detection and mitigation capability of BGPSEC. The solution can
    be implemented in BGP without necessarily tying it to BGPSEC. Incorporating the
    solution in BGPSEC is one way of implementing it in a secure way. We do not claim
    to have provided a solution for all possible types of route leaks, but the solution
    covers several, especially considering some significant route-leak attacks or
    occurrences that have been observed in recent years. The document also includes
    a stopgap method for detection and mitigation of route leaks for the phase when
    BGPSEC (path validation) is not yet deployed but only origin validation is deployed.</p>"
