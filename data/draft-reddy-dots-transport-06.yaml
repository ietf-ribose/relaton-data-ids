abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism that a DOTS client can use to signal
    that a network is under a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack to an upstream
    DOTS server so that appropriate mitigation actions are undertaken (including,
    blackhole, drop, rate-limit, or add to watch list) on the suspect traffic. The
    document specifies both DOTS signal and data channels. Happy Eyeballs considerations
    for the DOTS signal channel are also elaborated.</p>"
