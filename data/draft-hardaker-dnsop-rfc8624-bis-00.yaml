abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various cryptographic algorithms in
    order to provide authentication of DNS data and proof of non- existence. To ensure
    interoperability between DNS resolvers and DNS authoritative servers, it is necessary
    to specify a set of algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidelines
    to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations support.
    This document defines the current algorithm implementation requirements and usage
    guidance for DNSSEC. This document obsoletes [RFC6944].</p>"
