abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a per-domain path computation technique for
    establishing inter-domain Traffic Engineering (TE) Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). In this document,
    a domain refers to a collection of network elements within a common sphere of
    address management or path computational responsibility such as Interior Gateway
    Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous Systems. Per-domain computation applies where
    the full path of an inter-domain TE LSP cannot be or is not determined at the
    ingress node of the TE LSP, and is not signaled across domain boundaries. This
    is most likely to arise owing to TE visibility limitations. The signaling message
    indicates the destination and nodes up to the next domain boundary. It may also
    indicate further domain boundaries or domain identifiers. The path through each
    domain, possibly including the choice of exit point from the domain, must be determined
    within the domain. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
