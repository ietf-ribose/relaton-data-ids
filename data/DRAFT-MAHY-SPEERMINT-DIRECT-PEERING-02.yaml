abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document describes a concrete example of a peering convention\n
    \  for domains and federations of domain which use SIP for\n   communications,
    especially in conjunction with E.164 addresses\n   (telephone numbers).  This
    convention makes use of direct SIP and\n   media communication between the operator
    of the initiating and\n   receiving administrative domains.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
