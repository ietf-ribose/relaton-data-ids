abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet
    applications to achieve Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable throughput (L4S).
    The insight on which L4S is based is that the root cause of queuing delay is in
    the congestion controllers of senders, not in the queue itself. The L4S architecture
    is intended to enable *all* Internet applications to transition away from congestion
    control algorithms that cause queuing delay, to a new class of congestion controls
    that utilize explicit congestion signaling provided by the network. This new class
    of congestion control can provide low latency for capacity-seeking flows, so applications
    can achieve both high bandwidth and low latency. The architecture primarily concerns
    incremental deployment. It defines mechanisms that allow both classes of congestion
    control to coexist in a shared network. These mechanisms aim to ensure that the
    latency and throughput performance using an L4S-compliant congestion controller
    is usually much better (and never worse) than the performance would have been
    using a 'Classic' congestion controller, and that competing flows continuing to
    use 'Classic' controllers are typically not impacted by the presence of L4S. These
    characteristics are important to encourage adoption of L4S congestion control
    algorithms and L4S compliant network elements. The L4S architecture consists of
    three components: network support to isolate L4S traffic from classic traffic
    and to provide appropriate congestion signaling to both types; protocol features
    that allow network elements to identify L4S traffic and allow for communication
    of congestion signaling; and host support for immediate congestion signaling with
    an appropriate congestion response that enables scalable performance.</p>"
