abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Framework for Operations, Administration and Maintenance
    (OAM)\n   within the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) describes how Maintenance\n
    \  Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs) may be situated within\n   network
    nodes at the incoming and outgoing interfaces.\n\n   This document describes a
    way of forming OAM messages so that they\n   can be targeted at MIPs on incoming
    or MIPs on outgoing interfaces,\n   forwarded correctly through the \"switch fabric\",
    and handled\n   efficiently in node implementations where there is no distinction\n
    \  between the incoming and outgoing MIP.\n\n   The material in this document
    is provided for discussion within the\n   MPLS-TP community in the expectation
    that this idea or some similar\n   mechanism will be subsumed into a more general
    MPLS-TP OAM document.\n\n   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering
    Task Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\n
    \  Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile
    within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and
    functionalities of a packet transport network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
