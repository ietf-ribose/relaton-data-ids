abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a concise binary encoding of components of
    the Asynchronous Management Model (AMM) and a binary protocol for the exchange
    of these items over a nertwork. The intent of this protocol is to provide an efficient
    exchange of management encoding that conserves computing resources for embedded
    devices and energy necessary for transmission of protocol data units. AMP is designed
    to reduce the number of transmitted bytes, operates without sessions or (concurrent)
    two-way links, and functions autnomously when there is no timely contact with
    a network operator.</p>"
