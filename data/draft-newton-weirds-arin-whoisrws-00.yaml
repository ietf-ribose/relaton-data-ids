abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the RESTful Web Service for Whois data as implemented
    and fielded by the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). ARIN calls this
    service Whois-RWS. The purpose of this document is to facilitate discussion and
    serve as input into a standards process in this area, currently being discussed
    on the WHOIS-based Extensible Internet Registration Data Service (WEIRDS) mailing
    list (https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/weirds). Please excuse this very rough
    initial draft. It is roughly based on information currently published on ARIN's
    website. However, future revisions of this document are planned, including discussions
    on lessons learned by ARIN from the deployment of Whois-RWS and thoughts on a
    future, unified standard.</p>"
