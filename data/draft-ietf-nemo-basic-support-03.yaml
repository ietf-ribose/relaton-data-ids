abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support protocol
    that enables Mobile Networks to attach to different points in the Internet. The
    protocol is an extension of Mobile IPv6 and allows session continuity for every
    node in the Mobile Network as the network moves. It also allows every node in
    the Mobile Network to be reachable while moving around. The Mobile Router, which
    connects the network to the Internet, runs the NEMO Basic Support protocol with
    its Home Agent. The protocol is designed so that network mobility is transparent
    to the nodes inside the Mobile Network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
