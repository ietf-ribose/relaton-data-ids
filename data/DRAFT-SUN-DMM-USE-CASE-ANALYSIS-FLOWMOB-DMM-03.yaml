abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) allows network traffic
    to\n   distribute among multiple mobility anchors which have mobility\n   functions
    to solve the existing problems in current centralized\n   mobility protocols.
    There are many DMM approaches extending\n   network-based mobility protocols (e.g.
    Proxy Mobile IPv6).\n\n   In Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), they allow a mobile node
    to\n   connect to PMIPv6 domain through different physical interfaces. In\n   this
    reason, flow mobility that enables movement between physical\n   interfaces of
    mobile node is proposed.\n\n   In this document, we present some use cases to
    support flow mobility\n   in DMM domain and analyze some problems. These use cases
    are based\n   on scenarios of flow mobility in PMIPv6. In these scenarios, a\n
    \  multi-interface mobile node connects to different distributed\n   mobility
    access points and move specific flows from one interface to\n   another. These
    use cases have common issues which will be analyzed\n   in detail.\n\n\t </p>\n
