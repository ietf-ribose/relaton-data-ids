abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Binary Application Record Encoding (BARE) is a data format
    used\n   to represent application records for storage or transmission between\n
    \  programs.  BARE messages are concise and have a well-defined schema,\n   and
    implementations may be simple and broadly compatible.  A schema\n   language is
    also provided to express message schemas out-of-band.\n\nComments\n\n   Comments
    are solicited and should be addressed to the mailing list at\n   ~sircmpwn/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht
    and/or the author(s).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
