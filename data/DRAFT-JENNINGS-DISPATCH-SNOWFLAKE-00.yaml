abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) (RFC5245) defines\n
    \  protocol machinery for two peers to discover each other and establish\n   connectivity
    in order to send and receive Media Streams.\n\n   This draft raises some issues
    inherent in the assumptions with ICE\n   and proposes a lightweight receiver driven
    protocol for asymmetric\n   connecitivity establishment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
