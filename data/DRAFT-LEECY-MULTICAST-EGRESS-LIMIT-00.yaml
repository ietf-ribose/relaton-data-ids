abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The amount of resources required by a source to send data to a\nmulticast
    group within a network is dependent on the service level\nthe source requested
    and the number of egress points for the group in\na network. Since the egress
    points in a multicast group can change\nduring a multicast session, a source node
    would not know how many or\nwhich egress points it would be sending to when it
    specifies the\nservice level it requires for multicast data.\n\nThis document
    describes methods to control the number of egress\npoints of a dynamic multicast
    group in a differentiated services (DS)\nnetwork. A source node specifies the
    bandwidth, type of service and a\nlimit on the number of egress points that it
    wants to send multicast\ndata to. If this limit on the number of egress points
    is reached, no\nfurther egress points will be grafted to the branch of the multicast\ntree
    rooted at this source node.\n\t </p>\n      "
