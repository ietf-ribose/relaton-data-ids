abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft provides the methodology for benchmarking the failover
    time \nof local protection (aka Fast Reroute). The failover to a backup tunnel
    \ncould happen at the headend of the primary tunnel or a midpoint and the \nbackup
    could offer link or node protection. It becomes vital to \nbenchmark the failover
    time for all the cases and combinations. The \nfailover time could also greatly
    differ based on the design and \nimplementation and by factors like the number
    of prefixes carried by the \ntunnel, the number of primary tunnels affected by
    the event that caused \nthe failover, number of primary tunnels the backup protects
    and type of \nfailure etc. All the required benchmarking criteria and benchmarking
    \ntopology required for measuring failover time of local protection is \ndescribed
    Conventions used in this document \n\t </p>\n      "
