abstract:
  content: "<p>Under certain conditions it is desirable for a BGP route reflector
    tobe able to modify the Route Target list of a VPN route that isdistributed by
    the route reflector, enabling the route reflector tocontrol how a route originated
    within one VRF is imported into otherVRFs. This technique works effectively as
    long as the VRF thatexports the route is not on the same PE as the VRF(s) that
    import theroute. However, due to the constraints of the BGP protocol, it doesnot
    work if the two are on the same PE.This document describes a modification to the
    BGP protocol allowingthis technique to work when the VRFs are on the same PE,
    allowing thetechnique to be used in a standard manner throughout an autonomoussystem.</p>"
