abstract:
  content: "<p>Virtual machines, or virtualized servers, basically allow onephysical
    server to support multiple hosts (20, 30, or hundreds of).As virtual machines
    are introduced to Data center, the number ofhosts within one data center can grow
    dramatically, which couldcreate tremendous impact to networks and hosts.This document
    describes reasons why it is still desirable to havevirtual machines in Data Center
    to be in one Layer 2 network andpotential problems this type of Layer 2 network
    will face. The goalis to justify why it is necessary for IETF to create a working
    groupto work on interoperable and scalable solutions for data center(s)with large
    number of virtual machines.</p>"
