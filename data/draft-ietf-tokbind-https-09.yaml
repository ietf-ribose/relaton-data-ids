abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a collection of mechanisms that allow HTTP
    servers to cryptographically bind security tokens (such as cookies and OAuth tokens)
    to TLS connections. We describe both first-party and federated scenarios. In a
    first- party scenario, an HTTP server is able to cryptographically bind the security
    tokens it issues to a client, and which the client subsequently returns to the
    server, to the TLS connection between the client and server. Such bound security
    tokens are protected from misuse since the server can generally detect if they
    are replayed inappropriately, e.g., over other TLS connections. Federated token
    bindings, on the other hand, allow servers to cryptographically bind security
    tokens to a TLS connection that the client has with a different server than the
    one issuing the token. This Internet-Draft is a companion document to The Token
    Binding Protocol.</p>"
