abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document we present several examples of non-deterministic\n
    \  routing behavior involving route redistribution into BGP.  In order\n   to
    eliminate such non-deterministic behavior, we propose an\n   enhancement to BGP
    route selection that would take into account the\n   administrative distance under
    certain conditions.  We also recommend\n   that the LOCAL_PREF value be reduced
    for the redistributed backup\n   route, and be calculated automatically based
    on the administrative\n   distance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
