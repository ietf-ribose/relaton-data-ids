abstract:
- content: <p>Jon Postel's famous statement in RFC 1122 of "Be liberal in what you
    accept, and conservative in what you send" - is a principle that has long guided
    the design of Internet protocols and implementations of those protocols. The posture
    this statement advocates might promote interoperability in the short term, but
    that short-term advantage is outweighed by negative consequences that affect the
    long-term maintenance of a protocol and its ecosystem.</p>
