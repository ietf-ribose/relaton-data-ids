abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture\n
    \  describes how Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets\n   through
    an IPv6 or MPLS network using the source routing paradigm.\n   SR enables any
    head-end node to select any path without relying on a\n   hop-by-hop signaling
    technique (e.g., LDP or RSVP-TE).\n\n   It depends only on \"segments\" that are
    advertised by Link- State\n   IGPs.  A Segment Routed Path can be derived from
    a variety of\n   mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit\n
    \  configuration, or a Path Computation Element (PCE).\n\n   Since SR can be applied
    to both MPLS and IPv6 forwarding plane, a PCE\n   should be able to compute SR-Path
    for both MPLS and IPv6 forwarding\n   plane.  This document describes the extensions
    required for SR\n   support for IPv6 data plane in Path Computation Element communication\n
    \  Protocol (PCEP).  The PCEP extension and mechanism to support SR-MPLS\n   is
    described in [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing].  This document\n   extends it to
    support SRv6 (SR over IPv6).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
