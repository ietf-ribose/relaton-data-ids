abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called
    lag,\n   latency, or bufferbloat, has been recognized as an unfortunate, but\n
    \  common symptom in today's networks.  Even after a decade of work on\n   standardizing
    technical solutions, it remains a common problem for\n   the end users.\n\n   Everyone
    \"knows\" that it is \"normal\" for a video conference to have\n   problems when
    somebody else at home is watching a 4K movie or\n   uploading photos from their
    phone.  However, there is no technical\n   reason for this to be the case.  In
    fact, various queue management\n   solutions (fq_codel, cake, PIE) have solved
    the problem for tens of\n   thousands of people.\n\n   Our networks remain unresponsive,
    not from a lack of technical\n   solutions, but rather a lack of awareness of
    the problem.  We believe\n   that creating a tool whose measurement matches people's
    every day\n   experience will create the necessary awareness, and result in a\n
    \  demand for products that solve the problem.\n\n   This document specifies the
    \"RPM Test\" for measuring responsiveness.\n   It uses common protocols and mechanisms
    to measure user experience\n   especially when the network is fully loaded (\"responsiveness
    under\n   working conditions\".)  The measurement is expressed as \"Round-trips\n
    \  Per Minute\" (RPM) and should be included with throughput (up and\n   down)
    and idle latency as critical indicators of network quality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
