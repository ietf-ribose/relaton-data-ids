abstract:
  content: "<p>The objective of this draft is to discuss methods for deciding that
    anIP network would be improved in some way by the addition of extracapacity, (provided
    by an underlying network). The draft concludesthat the only reasonable way of
    doing this is the result ofco-operation between routers, and that this co-operation
    leads to theneed for standardization of this process.</p>"
