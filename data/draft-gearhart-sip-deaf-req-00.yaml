  content: "\t <t>SIP is attracting more and more attention as a valuable tool toenable
    and support voice and multimedia communications over theInternet. However, a significant
    number of potential customersfor SIP-based services are for various reasons unable
    to, orchoose not to, use voice communication technologies. This documentoffers
    a proposed set of requirements and identifies some of thekey issues that need
    resolution to allow full accessibility forthis group to SIP-based Internet communications.
    This document isintended to continue the discussion begun in a previous draft
    (seeAcknowledgements) and to lay a foundation for design andimplementation discussions
    in future drafts.</p>"
