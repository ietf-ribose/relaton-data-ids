abstract:
- content: "<p>IGP Flex Algorithm proposes a solution that allows IGPs themselves
    to compute constraint based paths over the network, and it also specifies a way
    of using Segment Routing (SR) Prefix-SIDs and SRv6 locators to steer packets along
    the constraint-based paths. This document describes how to create Flex-algo plane
    with L2bundles scenario.</p>"
