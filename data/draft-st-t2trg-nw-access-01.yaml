abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for enabling and configuring network
    access for IoT devices that are first authenticated at a server. This server may
    be run by the manufacturer of the IoT device as an online cloud service. This
    specification is intended for off-the- shelf IoT devices that have just been purchased
    by the user. Many of these devices have only limited user interfaces that can
    be used for configuring network access credentials. The device configuration is
    also made more challenging by the fact that these devices may exist in large numbers.</p>"
