abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NETCONF provides mechanism to install configuration of network\n
    \  devices.  In many cases, it is required that the same configuration\n   repeats
    on many interfaces.  In the absence of protocol semantics for\n   performing operations
    with group-specific scope, this results in\n   either a significant amount of
    signaling traffic and configuration\n   template applying on a periodic basis
    or large packet size between a\n   given network management system and a network
    devices.  This document\n   defines optimizations to the NETCONF protocol operations
    for\n   performing operations with group-specific scope with the use of a\n   group
    identifier.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
