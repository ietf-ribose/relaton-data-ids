abstract:
- content: "<p>With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come
    the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different cryptographic
    algorithms. Since the trustworthiness of individual post-quantum algorithms is
    at question, a multi-key cryptographic operation will need to be performed in
    such a way that breaking it requires breaking each of the component algorithms
    individually. This requires defining new structures for holding composite signature
    data. This document defines the structures CompositeSignatureValue, and CompositeParams,
    which are sequences of the respective structure for each component algorithm.
    This document also defines processes for generating and verifying composite signatures.
    This document makes no assumptions about what the component algorithms are, provided
    that their algorithm identifiers and signature generation and verification processes
    are defined.</p>"
