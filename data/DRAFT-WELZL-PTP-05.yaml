abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Endpoint congestion avoidance and control mechanisms typically
    rely\non measured network performance parameters such as the round-trip-\ntime
    and packet loss seen by the receiver, without any explicit help\nfrom the network.
    Packet loss being the primary congestion indicator,\nthese approaches first need
    to exceed the available network capacity\nto obtain the information needed to
    react. Additionally, relying on\npacket loss leads to misinterpretation of transmission
    errors as a\nsign of congestion.\n\t </p>\n      "
