abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EAP-TTLS is an EAP method that provides secured authentication
    as \n   described in RFC 5281. This method makes generally use of two phases \n
    \  in order to complete authentication. The first one consists in the \n   authentication
    of the TTLS server to the client, established by a \n   TLS handshake between
    the client and the TTLS server. The handshake \n   may be either mutual or one-way.
    The authentication of the client to \n   the server may then be negotiated during
    phase two of EAP-TTLS, \n   thanks to widely-deployed authentication mechanisms
    such as CHAP, \n   PAP, MS-CHAP or MS-CHAP-V2. \n    \n   The purpose of EAP-BIO
    is to define how to use a biometric \n   authentication mechanism during phase
    two of EAP-TTLS. This \n   authentication mechanism ranges from physiological
    characteristics \n   such as fingerprint identification, to behavioral characteristics
    \n   such as voice or signature analysis. Hence, EAP-BIO combines the \n   security
    features of EAP-TTLS and biometric authentication.  \n\t </p>\n      "
