abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) specification is currently\n
    \  being revised.  There are a number of issues that have been\n   identified
    in the IANA registries related to the SDP protocol (These\n   are tracked in the
    issue tracker).  This document has the goal of\n   addressing these issues by
    making the necessary changes in the IANA\n   registries and registration procedures.\n\n
    \  The changes and updates listed in this draft are submitted in this\n   individual
    draft rather than the 4566bis draft because (i) the\n   4566bis draft has seen
    quite a number of changes recently, which\n   require a detailed review and further
    revisions would make the review\n   process difficult, and (ii) the changes and
    updates listed in this\n   draft are all IANA related matters.  If this draft
    gets published\n   separately, it will update RFC 4566 or the RFC resulting from
    the\n   4566bis draft.  An alternative option is to include the whole text in\n
    \  the 4566bis draft once the changes and updates are agreed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
