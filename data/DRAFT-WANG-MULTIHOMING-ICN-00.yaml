abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>                   This document presents a  POF-ICN based multihoming
    transmission\n                   framework.POF is an SDN forwarding plane technology
    proposed by\n                   Huawei,we use it to enable information-centric
    networking (ICN).\n                   The purpose of the framework is to provide
    an overall picture of\n                   the multihoming transmission system.we
    first describe the\n                   relationships among the various components
    of mobile networks and\n                   the newly added entities, such as Mobility
    management and Session\n                   management.Then we describe the Multihoming
    transmission  operation\n                   flow to  to outline what each components
    needs to accomplish and to\n                   how these components and mechanisms
    fit together.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
