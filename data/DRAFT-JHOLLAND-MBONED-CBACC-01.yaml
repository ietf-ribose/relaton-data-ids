abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies Circuit Breaker Assisted Congestion
    Control\n   (CBACC).  CBACC enables fast-trip Circuit Breakers by publishing rate\n
    \  metadata about multicast channels from senders to intermediate\n   network
    nodes or receivers.  The circuit breaker behavior is defined\n   as a supplement
    to receiver driven congestion control systems, to\n   preserve network health
    if receivers subscribe to a volume of traffic\n   that exceeds capacity policies
    or capability for a network or\n   receiver.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
