abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft proposes three ways to extend the existing ICP protocol
    in\n   order to support today's content-based Internet environment.  Since\n   the
    newly created PPSP protocol is especially designed for today's\n   network condition,
    we will take its advantages here.\n\n   The three proposals are: (1) Embedding
    PPSP in ICP; (2) PPSP and ICP\n   Co-existing in caches communication; (3) Using
    PPSP to replace ICP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
