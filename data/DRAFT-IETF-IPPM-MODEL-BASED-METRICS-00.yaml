abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to
    determine\n   if a long path can meet predefined end-to-end application performance\n
    \  targets.  This is done by subpath at a time testing -- by applying a\n   suite
    of single property tests to successive subpaths of a long path.\n   In many cases
    these single property tests are based on existing IPPM\n   metrics, with the addition
    of success and validity criteria.  The\n   subpath at a time tests are designed
    to facilitate IP providers\n   eliminating all known conditions that might prevent
    the full end-to-\n   end path from meeting the users target performance.\n\n   This
    approach makes it possible to to determine the IP performance\n   requirements
    needed to support the desired end-to-end TCP\n   performance.  The IP metrics
    are based on traffic patterns that mimic\n   TCP but are precomputed independently
    of the actual behavior of TCP\n   over the subpath under test.  This makes the
    measurements open loop,\n   eliminating nearly all of the difficulties encountered
    by traditional\n   bulk transport metrics, which rely on congestion control equilibrium\n
    \  behavior.\n\n   A natural consequence of this methodology is verifiable network\n
    \  measurement: measurements from any given vantage point are repeatable\n   from
    other vantage points.\n\n   Formatted: Fri Jun 21 18:23:29 PDT 2013\n\n\t </p>\n
