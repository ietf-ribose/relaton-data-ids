abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a widely used transport
    for\nreal-time media on IP networks.  The Datagram Congestion Control\nProtocol
    (DCCP) is a newly defined transport protocol that provides\ndesirable services
    for real-time applications.  This memo specifies a\nmapping of RTP onto DCCP,
    along with associated signalling, such that\nreal-time applications can make use
    of the services provided by DCCP.\n\t </p>\n      "
