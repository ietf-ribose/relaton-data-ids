abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a framework for supporting authorized, emergency-related
    communication within the context of IP telephony. We present a series of objectives
    that reflect a general view of how authorized emergency service, in line with
    the Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS), should be realized within today's
    IP architecture and service models. From these objectives, we present a corresponding
    set of protocols and capabilities, which provide a more specific set of recommendations
    regarding existing IETF protocols. Finally, we present two scenarios that act
    as guiding models for the objectives and functions listed in this document. These
    models, coupled with an example of an existing service in the Public Switched
    Telephone Network (PSTN), contribute to a constrained solution space. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
