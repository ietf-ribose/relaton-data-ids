abstract:
- content: "<p>Data Model driven network management can be used at various phases
    of service and network management life cycle such as service instantiation, service
    provision, optimization, monitoring, and diagnostic. Also, it can be designed
    to provide closed-loop control for the sake of agile service creation, delivery
    and maintenance. This document describes an architecture for data model driven
    network management with a sample applicability case: network virtualization environments.</p>"
