abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent work has raised interest in exploring network layer
    addressing\n   that is more flexible than fixed-length addressing as used in IPv4\n
    \  (32 bit) and IPv6 (128 bit).\n\n   The reasons for the interest include both
    support for multiple and\n   potentially novel address semantics, but also optimizations
    of\n   addressing for existing semantics such as unicast tailored not for\n   the
    global Internet but to better support private networks / limited\n   domains.\n\n
    \  This memo explores in the view of the author yet little explored\n   reasons
    for more flexible addresses namely the problems and\n   opportunities for Internetworking
    with Independent Network Address\n   Spaces (IINAS).\n\n   To better enable such
    internetworks, this memo proposes a framework\n   for a Functional Addressing
    model.  This model also intends to\n   support several other addressing goals
    including programmability and\n   multiple semantics.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
