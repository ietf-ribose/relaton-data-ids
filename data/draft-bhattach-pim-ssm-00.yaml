abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document provides an overview of the Source-Specific Multicast(SSM)
    service model which supports source-based multicast treesacross multiple domains
    in the Internet. SSM realizes components ofthe EXPRESS [HOLB99] multicast service
    model in which there is asingle source for every multicast channel, and channel
    membership isbased on the unique combination of multicast group address (G) aswell
    as the source's unicast address (S). End-hosts use version 3 ofthe IGMP protocol
    (IGMPv3) to register their interest in a particularsource-group (S,G) pair. The
    PIM-SM protocol is then used toconstruct the multicast forwarding tree rooted
    at the source S.This document is intended as a starting point for implementing
    anddeploying SSM services. It provides a brief architectural overview ofSSM described
    in more detail in [HOLBOO] and describes associateddeployment challenges. It summarizes
    changes to protocols andapplications both at end-hosts and routers, with pointers
    to moredetailed documents, wherever appropriate. Issues of interoperabilitywith
    the current multicast architecture are also discussed.</p>"
