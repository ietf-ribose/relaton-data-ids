abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A dual-end recursive PCE-based computation procedure (DRPC)
    is\n   proposed to compute shortest constrained inter-domain traffic\n   engineering
    label switched paths based on BRPC in Multi-protocol\n   Label Switching (MPLS)
    and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.  By\n   recursively performing shortest
    path algorithm and transferring the\n   segmental path computation result from
    both ends bi-directionally,\n   they meet at one of the Middle PCEs, generating
    a directional\n   shortest path graph into which the two shortest path trees are\n
    \  stitched together.  Therefore, the end-to-end constrained inter-\n   domain
    traffic engineering label switched path, even k shortest paths\n   can be gained
    from the directional shortest path graph directly.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
