abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the implementation of a group telephony\n
    \  feature commonly known as Bridged Line Appearance (BLA), Multiple\n   Line
    Appearance (MLA), or Shared Call/Line Appearance (SCA).  When\n   implemented
    using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), it is\n   referred to as Multiple
    Appearances.  This feature is commonly\n   offered in the IP Centrex services
    and IP-PBX offerings and is likely\n   to be implemented on SIP IP telephones
    and SIP feature servers used\n   in a business environment.  This specification
    defines a new SIP\n   dialog event package tag \"appearance\" and a method for
    a group of SIP\n   user agents to coordinate the identification of appearances
    between\n   them using SIP dialog package subscriptions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
