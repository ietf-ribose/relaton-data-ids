abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Consider a situation which will arise in many IPv6 transitionscenarios,
    where Network A, to which a host is attached, supports oneIP version, but the
    host and Network B support a different IPversion. Suppose that the host wishes
    to access a multicast groupwhich is rooted or sourced in Network B. This document
    specifies anapproach that combines stateful translation for signalling,encapsulation
    of multicast content moving between Network B and thehost, and native multicast
    routing in Network A to provide the hostwith its desired access.</p>"
