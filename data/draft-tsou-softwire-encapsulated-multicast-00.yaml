abstract:
- content: "<p>Consider a situation which will arise in many IPv6 transition scenarios,
    where Network A, to which a host is attached, supports one IP version, but the
    host and Network B support a different IP version. Suppose that the host wishes
    to access a multicast group which is rooted or sourced in Network B. This document
    specifies an approach that combines stateful translation for signalling, encapsulation
    of multicast content moving between Network B and the host, and native multicast
    routing in Network A to provide the host with its desired access.</p>"
