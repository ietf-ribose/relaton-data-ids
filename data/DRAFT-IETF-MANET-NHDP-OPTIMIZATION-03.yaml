abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The link quality mechanism of the MANET Neighborhood Discovery\n
    \  Protocol (NHDP) enables \"ignoring\" some 1-hop neighbors if the\n   measured
    link quality from that 1-hop neighbor is below an acceptable\n   threshold, while
    still retaining the corresponding link information\n   as acquired from HELLO
    message exchange.  This allows immediate\n   reinstatement of the 1-hop neighbor
    if the link quality later\n   improves sufficiently.\n\n   NHDP also collects
    information about symmetric 2-hop neighbors.\n   However it specifies that if
    a link from a symmetric 1-hop neighbor\n   ceases being symmetric, including while
    \"ignored\" as described above,\n   then corresponding symmetric 2-hop neighbors
    are removed.  This may\n   lead to symmetric 2-hop neighborhood information being
    permanently\n   removed (until further HELLO messages are received) if the link\n
    \  quality of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable\n   threshold,
    even if only for a moment.\n\n   This specification updates RFC6130 \"Mobile Ad
    Hoc Network (MANET)\n   Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)\", and RFC7181
    \"The Optimized\n   Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)\" to permit
    retaining,\n   but ignoring, symmetric 2-hop information when the link quality
    from\n   the corresponding 1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable\n   threshold.
    \ This allows immediate reinstatement of the symmetric\n   2-hop neighbor if the
    link quality later improves sufficiently, thus\n   making the symmetric 2-hop
    neighborhood more \"robust\".\n\n\t </p>\n      "
