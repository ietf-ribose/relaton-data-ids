abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF has developed solutions that promote a healthy IPv4
    and IPv6\n   co-existence.  The happy eyeballs algorithm for instance, provides\n
    \  recommendations to application developers to help prevent bad user\n   experience
    in situations where IPv6 connectivity is broken.  This\n   document describes
    a metric used to measure the effectiveness of the\n   happy eyeballs algorithm.
    \ The insights uncovered by analysing the\n   data from multiple locations is
    discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
