abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a summary of marking methods for performance measurements,
    and discusses the tradeoffs among them. These marking methods enable to measure
    various performance metrics such as packet loss and delay, and require a low overhead
    in the header of data packets, as low as one or two bits per packet, or in some
    cases even zero bits per packet. The target audience of this document is network
    protocol designers; this document is intended to help protocol designers choose
    the best marking method(s) based on the protocol's constraints and requirements.</p>"
