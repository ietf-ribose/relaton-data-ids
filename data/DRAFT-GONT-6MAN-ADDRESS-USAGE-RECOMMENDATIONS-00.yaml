abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 hosts typically configure and use a number of addresses
    of\n   different scope and stability properties.  Recent work has analyzed\n   the
    security and privacy implications of IPv6 addressing, and\n   improved the security
    and privacy properties of some of the\n   aforementioned address types.  However,
    advice is still missing\n   guidance regarding which address properties are desirable
    in\n   different scenarios, and how such addresses should be used when they\n
    \  are configured.  This document complements the aforementioned work by\n   providing
    advice regarding which address types to configure and how\n   to employ them in
    a number of popular scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
