abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies modifications required to Dual-Stack Lite
    (DS-\n   Lite) so that both IPv4 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4\n
    \  servers.\n\n   The DS-Lite solution is based on DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand\n
    \  element (B4) proxying Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and\n   then
    tunneling IGMP messages over IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire to DS-Lite\n   Address Family
    Transition Router element (AFTR).  IPv4 multicast data\n   received at AFTR is
    tunneled over IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire to B4 and\n   then delivered to the hosts.
    \ This solution integrates well with DS-\n   Lite unicast solution by using IPv4-in-IPv6
    softwire and works with\n   unicast IPv6 network connecting B4 with AFTR.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
