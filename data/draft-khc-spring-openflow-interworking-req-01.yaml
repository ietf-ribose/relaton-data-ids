abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft reviews the use cases and lists the requirements for interworking
    (IW) between OpenFlow (OF) and Segment routing (SR). Although the details and
    specifics of IW depend on both the architecture and framework, there are some
    common requirements. We specify those common requirements and show a simple architecture
    framework.</p>"
