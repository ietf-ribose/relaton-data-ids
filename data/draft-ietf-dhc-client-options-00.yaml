abstract:
  content: "\t <t>During the summer of 1999, a grand debate raged over the correctinterpretation
    of several DHCP client options as described in [RFC2132], as well as the need
    for one option whose proposingInternet-Draft expired.As a result of that debate,
    the authors gained some insights intothe intended (or unintended!) interpretation
    of certain optionsdefined in [RFC 2132,] particularly the Vendor Class Identifier(option
    60) and Vendor Encapsulated Options (option 43.)These insights are presented in
    this informational Internet-Draft,whose reason for being is to act as an aid to
    implementers of theDHC protocol, and to future editors of the underlying RFCs
    andselected, current Internet-Drafts. This memo is not beingproposed as a standards-track
    document, but rather as an aid toclarify existing and future RFCs.</p>"
