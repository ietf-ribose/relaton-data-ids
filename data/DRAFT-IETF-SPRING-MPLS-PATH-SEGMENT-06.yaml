abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Segment Routing (SR) path is identified by an SR segment
    list.\n   Only the complete segment list can identify the end-to-end SR path,\n
    \  and a sub-set of segments from the segment list cannot distinguish\n   one
    SR path from another as they may be partially congruent.  SR path\n   identification
    is a pre-requisite for various use-cases such as\n   Performance Measurement (PM),
    bidirectional paths correlation, and\n   end-to-end 1+1 path protection.\n\n   In
    SR for MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS), the segment identifiers are\n   stripped from
    the packet through label popping as the packet transits\n   the network.  This
    means that when a packet reaches the egress of the\n   SR path, it is not possible
    to determine on which SR path it\n   traversed the network.\n\n   This document
    defines a new type of segment that is referred to as\n   Path Segment, which is
    used to identify an SR path in an SR-MPLS\n   network.  When used, it is inserted
    by the ingress node of the SR\n   path and immediately follows the last segment
    identifier in the\n   segment list of the SR path.  The Path Segment is preserved
    until it\n   reaches the egress node for SR path identification and correlation.\n\n\t
