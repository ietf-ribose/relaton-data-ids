abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Since the Internet must continue to support escalating growth
    due to\n   increasing demand, it is clear that current routing architectures and\n
    \  operational practices must be updated.  This document proposes an\n   Internet
    Routing Overlay Network (IRON) architecture that supports\n   sustainable growth
    while requiring no changes to end systems and no\n   changes to the existing routing
    system.  In addition to routing\n   scaling, IRON further addresses other important
    issues including\n   mobility management, mobile networks, multihoming, traffic\n
    \  engineering, NAT traversal and security.  While business\n   considerations
    are an important determining factor for widespread\n   adoption, they are out
    of scope for this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
