abstract:
  content: <p>This memo aims to highlight specific "residual" threats in MobileIPv6
    protocol. We call these threats "residual" simply because theywere rightfully
    deemed not urgent during the design of Mobile IPv6protocol. However, these threats
    are somehow benefiting from newmechanisms and/or extensions built on top of Mobile
    IPv6 protocol toimprove their effects and likelihood. Hence, our main goal is
    tomotivate designers to re-assess their potential taking intoconsideration these
    new mechanisms.</p>
