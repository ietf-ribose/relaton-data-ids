abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a URI scheme, 'go:' to be used with the
    Common\nName Resolution Protocol.  Specifically it lays out the syntactic\ncomponents
    and how those components are used by URI Resolution to\nfind the available transports
    for a CNRP service.  Care should be\ntaken with several of the URI components
    because, while they may look\nlike components found in other URI schemes, they
    often do not act\nlike them.  The 'go' scheme has more in common with the location\nindependent
    'news' scheme than any other URI scheme.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
