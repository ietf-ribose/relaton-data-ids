abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>An Internet Emergency Preparedness (IEPREP) telephony service
    IP \nBridging topology using Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) should \nprovide
    Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS) using a) Session \nInitiation Protocol
    (SIP) Priority header value of 'emergency', b) \nSession Description Protocol
    (SDP) attribute experimental parameters to \ndesignate the call (session) as either
    a National Emergency call, \nInternational Emergency call, or both, c) MEGACO
    context descriptors of \npriorities 1-6 and emergency indication, and d) MPLS
    E-LSPs with a \ndedicated codepoint specifying application of ETS Per-Hop Behavior
    \n(PHB). IP Differentiated Services marking should use specified code \npoints
    allocated from the Experimental and Local Use pool (pool 2) to \ndesignate the
    traffic as either National Emergency or International \nEmergency for corresponding
    PHB use.  Signaling between the Signaling \nGateway (SG) and Media Gateway Controller
    (MGC) should apply the MTP3 \nSS7 protocol over the M2UA adaptation protocol for
    use of the Stream \nControl Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  Support is suggested
    for work in \nprogress on defining a SIP Resource Priority header and defining
    a SIP \ntelephone url extension for calling party category designation.\n\n\n\n\t
