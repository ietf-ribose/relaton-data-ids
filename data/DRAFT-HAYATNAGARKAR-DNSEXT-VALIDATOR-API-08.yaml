abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provide origin authentication\n
    \  and integrity of DNS data.  However, the current resolver Application\n   Programming
    Interface (API) does not specify how a validating stub\n   resolver should communicate
    results of DNSSEC processing back to the\n   application.  This document describes
    an API between applications and\n   a validating stub resolver that allows applications
    to control the\n   DNSSEC validation process and obtain results of DNSSEC processing.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
