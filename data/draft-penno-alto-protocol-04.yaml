abstract:
  content: "<p>Networking applications today already have access to a great amountof
    Inter-Provider network topology information. For example, viewsof the Internet
    routing table are easily available at looking glassservers and entirely practical
    to be downloaded by clients. What ismissing is knowledge of the underlying network
    topology from the ISPor Content Provider (henceforth referred as Provider) point
    of view.In other words, what an Provider prefers in terms of trafficoptimization
    -- and a way to distribute it.The ALTO Service provides information such as preferences
    of networkresources with the goal of modifying network resource consumptionpatterns
    while maintaining or improving application performance.This document describes
    a protocol implementing the ALTO Service.While such service would primarily be
    provided by the network (i.e.,the ISP), content providers and third parties could
    also operate thisservice. Applications that could use this service are those thathave
    a choice in connection endpoints. Examples of such applicationsare peer-to-peer
    (P2P) and content delivery networks.</p>"
