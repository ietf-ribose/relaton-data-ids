abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the Adaptive Mail Delivery Protocol (AMDP).
    \nIt aims to resolve the problems associated with current email systems \nthat
    rely on the mail delivery process defined by the Simple Mail \nTransfer Protocol
    (SMTP).  This is done by extending and designing a \nbackwards-compatible replacement
    for SMTP, as well as restructuring \nthe mail delivery process.  The process is
    built around an adaptive \nscheme that is able to addresses current and future
    demands for a \nsecure and reliable e-mail delivery systems. \n   \n\n\t </p>\n
