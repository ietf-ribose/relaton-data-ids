abstract:
- content: "<p>The PCEP protocol has objective functions to optimize path attributes
    like the residual bandwidth. While this is enough for some applications, it's
    not possible to return the computed values of such attributes to the PCC, or put
    bounds on them. This document describes extensions to the PCE Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) providing new path-related bandwidth metrics allowing a PCE to compute
    paths taking into account and returning to the PCC information about the remaining
    bandwidth along the computed paths.</p>"
