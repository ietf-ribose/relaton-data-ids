abstract:
  content: "<p>RFC 2468 [1] defines the need of a standardized format foridentifying
    ISP subscribers for dial-up roaming operations. Itintroduced the Network Access
    Identifier (NAI) to fulfill thisneed. The NAI is provided by the mobile node to
    the dialed ISPduring PPP authentication.The ability to resolve an NAI for second
    and third generationcellular mobile nodes allow traditional cellular service providersto
    evolve their home cellular networks to provide cellularservices, IP packet data
    services and so on with a singlesubscription using NAIs. Additionally, this allows
    cellularprovider to evolve their networks to be IP based.Second and third generation
    cellular mobile nodes must perform aregistration and authentication process with
    their wireless serviceprovider before the mobile node user may initiate other
    operations(See [1] for examples). These mobile nodes do not support theprogramming
    of an NAI nor does the cellular registration messagesupport the transfer of an
    NAI to the wireless access network. Forexample, North American cellular networks
    (e.g. AMPS, TDMA, CDMA)service mobiler nodes that register with a Mobile IdentificationNumber
    (MIN). The MIN is then associated with a cellularsubscriber. MIN is shown here
    only as an example, the same generalidea is applicable to other types of identifiers
    used in differentaccess network types. For the same reasons stated in [1], it
    wouldbe convenient if an option was available to provide the wirelesssubscriber
    identification in the form of an NAI during the wirelessregistration and authentication
    process. This draft proposes asolution to resolve NAIs from traditional mobile
    node identifiers.</p>"
