abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) working
    group is \ndefining a protocol by which control elements (CEs) can communicate
    with \nforwarding elements (FEs) and control the behaviors of FEs. It is well
    \nknown that ForCES based solutions have good scalability. Therefore, it \nmakes
    sense to adopt ForCES to better integrate existing physical \nrouters with ForCES
    routers. Plus, someone may want going forward to be \nable to use the developed
    hardware and software from existing routers as \na part of ForCES based solutions.
    \ \n\nThis draft presents a framework in which some possible migration \nsolutions
    are discussed in details and some security implications are \nconsidered.     \n\t
