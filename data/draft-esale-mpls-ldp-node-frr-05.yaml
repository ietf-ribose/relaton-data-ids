abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes procedures to support node protection for unicast
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) established by Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).
    In order to protect a node N, the Point of Local Repair (PLR) of N must discover
    the Merge Points (MPs) of node N such that traffic can be redirected to them in
    case of node N failure. Redirecting the traffic around the failed node N depends
    on existing point-to-point LSPs originated from the PLR to the MPs while bypassing
    the protected node N. The procedures described in this document are topology independent
    in a sense that they provide node protection in any topology so long as there
    is a alternate path in the network that avoids the protected node.</p>"
