abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Demand for Ultra high-Reliability and Low-latency Communication\n
    \  (URLLC) and Broadband Assured IP Services (BAS) will grow as new\n   service
    scenarios like 5G, IoT, AR/VR, Cloud are deployed.  As these\n   new service scenarios
    will typically rely on shared packet\n   infrastructure like Internet, methods
    to ensure URLLC and BAS\n   performance across the underlying network resources
    will be required.\n   This document outlines the motivation and key requirements
    for URLLC\n   or BAS connectivity across heterogeneous network domains.  It also\n
    \  outlines the corresponding models and architecture required for\n   providing
    orchestrated URLLC or BAS communication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
