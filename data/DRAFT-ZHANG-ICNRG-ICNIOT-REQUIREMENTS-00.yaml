abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of
    objects\n   to the Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in\n
    \  different domains, the current trend is to develop a common, \"thin\n   waist\"
    of protocols forming a horizontal unified, defragmented IoT\n   platform.  Such
    a platform will make objects accessible to\n   applications across organizations
    and domains.  Towards this goal,\n   quite a few proposals have been made to build
    a unified host-centric\n   IoT platform as an overlay on top of today's host-centric
    Internet.\n   However, there is a fundamental mismatch between the host-centric\n
    \  nature of todays Internet and the information-centric nature of the\n   IoT
    system.  To address this mismatch, we propose to build a common\n   set of protocols
    and services, which form an IoT platform, based on\n   the Information Centric
    Network (ICN) architecture, which we call\n   ICN-IoT.  ICN-IoT leverages the
    salient features of ICN, and thus\n   provides seamless mobility support, scalability,
    and efficient\n   content and service delivery.\n\n   This draft describes representative
    IoT requirements and ICN\n   challenges to realize a unified ICN-IoT framework.
    \ Towards this, we\n   first identify a list of important requirements which a
    unified IoT\n   architecture should have to support tens of billions of objects,
    then\n   we discuss how the current IP-IoT overlay fails to meet these\n   requirements,
    followed by discussion on suitability of ICN for IoT.\n\n   Though we see most
    of the IoT requirements can be met by ICN, we\n   discuss specific challenges
    ICN has to address to satisfy them.  Then\n   we provide discussion of popular
    IoT scenarios including the \"smart\"\n   home, campus, grid, transportation infrastructure,
    healthcare,\n   Education, and Entertainment for completeness, as specific scenarios\n
    \  requires appropriate design choices and architectural considerations\n   towards
    developing an ICN-IoT solution.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
