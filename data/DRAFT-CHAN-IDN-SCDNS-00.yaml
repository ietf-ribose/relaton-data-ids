abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Chinese can be written in 2 different scripts, traditional Chinese
    and\nsimplified Chinese, that cannot be distinguished by many people of\ncertain
    background/cultures/groups who use them interchangeably.  As a\nresult, users
    of Chinese Domain Names (CDN) have special needs that can\nonly be satisfied by
    adding a label to CDNs that distinguish a CDN with\ntraditional characters from
    a CDN with simplified characters.  This\nlabeling is an entire system that can
    be accomplished with SLDs or by\ncreating a new type of TLD called Language Script
    TLD (lsTLD).  This\ndraft describes the benefits that the system will provide
    and the\ntechniques involved in implementing it.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
