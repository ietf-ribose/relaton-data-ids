abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n
    \  protocol is implemented by devices called TRILL switches or RBridges\n   (Routing
    Bridges). TRILL includes a general mechanism, called RBridge\n   Channel, for
    the transmission of typed messages between RBridges in\n   the same campus and
    between RBridges and end stations on the same\n   link. This document specifies
    a method to send vendor specific\n   messages over the RBridge Channel facility.\n\n\n\n\t
