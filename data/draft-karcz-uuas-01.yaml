abstract:
- content: "<p>User-Agent is a HTTP request-header field. It contains information
    about the user agent originating the request, which is often used by servers to
    help identify the scope of reported interoperability problems, to work around
    or tailor responses to avoid particular user agent limitations, and for analytics
    regarding browser or operating system use. Over the years contents of this field
    got complicated and ambiguous. That was the reaction for sending altered version
    of websites to web browsers other than popular ones. During the development of
    the WWW, authors of the new web browsers used to construct User-Agent strings
    similar to Netscape's one. Nowadays contents of the User-Agent field are much
    longer than 15 years ago. This Memo proposes the Uniform User-Agent String as
    a way to simplify the User-Agent field contents, while maintaining the previous
    possibility of their use.</p>"
