abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       This document defines a specific Topology Plugin using
    a ramification\n       of the basic One Hop Lookups based DHT algorithm which
    is called ONE-\n       HOP-RELOAD. In the One Hop Lookups algorithm, each peer
    maintains a\n       full routing table containing information about every node
    on the\n       overlay in order to route RELOAD message in one hop. Compared with\n
    \      CHORD-RELOAD algorithm, ONE-HOP-RELOAD improves the routing\n       efficiency,
    and can maintain complete membership information with\n       reasonable bandwidth
    requirements. This algorithm is able to handle\n       frequent membership changes
    by superimposing a well-defined hierarchy\n       on the system that guarantees
    topology disturbance events\n       notification reach every peer in the overlay
    within a specified\n       amount of time. Currently some typical peer-to-peer
    storages systems\n       have stringent latency requirements, such as Amazon's
    Dynamo which is\n       built for latency sensitive applications uses One-Hop
    algorithm, so\n       that each node maintains enough routing information locally
    to route\n       a request to the appropriate node directly.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
