abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms instantiate
    shallow\n   buffers with burst tolerance to minimise the time that packets spend\n
    \  enqueued at a bottleneck.  However, shallow buffering can cause\n   noticeable
    performance degradation when TCP is used over a network\n   path with a large
    bandwidth-delay-product.  Traditional methods rely\n   on detecting network congestion
    through reported loss of transport\n   packets.  Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN) instead allows a\n   router to directly signal incipient congestion.  A
    sending endpoint\n   can distinguish when congestion is signalled via ECN, rather
    than by\n   packet loss.  An ECN signal indicates that an AQM mechanism has done\n
    \  its job, and therefore the bottleneck network queue is likely to be\n   shallow.
    \ This document therefore proposes an update to the TCP\n   sender-side ECN reaction
    in congestion avoidance to reduce the\n   Congestion Window (cwnd) by a smaller
    amount than the congestion\n   control algorithm's reaction to loss.  This document
    also recommends\n   this approach to be adopted by any other transport protocol
    that\n   implements a congestion control reduction to an ECN congestion\n   signal.\n\n\t
