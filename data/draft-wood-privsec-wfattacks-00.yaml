abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF is well on its way to protecting connection metadata with
    protocols such as DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS, and work-in- progress towards
    encrypting the TLS SNI. However, more work is needed to protect traffic metadata,
    especially in the context of web traffic. In this document, we survey Website
    Fingerprinting attacks, which are a class of attacks that use machine learning
    techniques to attack web privacy, and highlight metadata leaks used by said attacks.
    We also survey proposed mitigations for such leakage and discuss their applicability
    to IETF protocols such as TLS, QUIC, and HTTP. We endeavor to show that Website
    Fingerprinting attacks are a serious problem that affect all Internet users, and
    we pose open problems and directions for future research in this area.</p>"
