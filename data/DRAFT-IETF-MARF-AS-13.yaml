abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 5965 defines an extensible, machine-readable format intended
    for\n   mail operators to report feedback about received email to other\n   parties.
    \ This Applicability Statement describes common methods for\n   utilizing this
    format for reporting both abuse and authentication\n   failure events.  Mailbox
    Providers of any size, mail sending\n   entities, and end users can use these
    methods as a basis to create\n   procedures that best suit them.  Some related
    optional mechanisms are\n   also discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
