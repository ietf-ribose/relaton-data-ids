abstract:
  content: <p>This document describes the "Bump-In-the-Stack" (BIS) host basedprotocol
    translation mechanism that allows applications supportingonly one IP address family
    to communicate with peers that arereachable or supporting only the other address
    family. Furthermore,this technology avoids need for unnecessary double protocoltranslation
    in the case where destination is dual-stack enabled.This specification addresses
    scenarios where a host is provided dualstack or IPv6 only network connectivity.
    In the dual stack networkcase, single address family applications in the host
    will communicatedirectly with other hosts reachable with the different addressfamily.
    In the case of IPv6 only network or IPv6 only destination,IPv4-originated communications
    have to be be translated into IPv6.In the scenario of single address family access
    network, but dual-stack destination, network based translation is always avoided.Technically,
    the BIS-enabled host resolves both IPv4 and IPv6addresses of the destination and
    behaves according to receivedresponses.Acknowledgement of previous workThis document
    is an update to and directly derivative from KazuakiTSUCHIYA, Hidemitsu HIGUCHI,
    and Yoshifumi ATARASHI's [RFC2767],which similarly provides a dual stack host
    means to communicate withother IPv6 host using existing IPv4 appliations.The original
    documentwas a product of the NGTRANS working group.The changes in this document
    reflect three components1. Supporting IPv6 only network connections2. Extending
    ENR and address mapper to operate differently3. Adding an alternative way to implement
    the ENRStatus of this MemoThis Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance
