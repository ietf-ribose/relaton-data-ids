abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a generic and intent-driven data model for NSF
    security policy configuration used by I2NSF clients to negotiate their security
    requirements with various kinds of entities that each provide one or more NSFs.
    The Role Based Access Control (RBAC) reference model [INCITS359 RBAC] is used
    to represent which operations can be performed on what set of secured objects.</p>"
