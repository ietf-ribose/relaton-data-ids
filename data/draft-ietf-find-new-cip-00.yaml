abstract:
- content: "<p>The Common Indexing Protocol (CIP) is used to pass indexing information
    from server to server in order to facilitate query routing. Query routing is the
    process of redirecting and replicating queries through a distributed database
    system towards servers holding the desired results. This document describes the
    CIP framework, including it's architecture and the protocol specifics of exchanging
    indices.</p>"
