abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of IPSec ESP protocol in the Mobile IP packet redirection tunnels
    will protect the redirected packets against both passive and active attacks launched
    and aid these packets to traverse the firewalls surrounding both the home and
    the foreign subnets visited by the mobile nodes. This document proposes a scheme
    to negotiate the use of IPSec ESP on selected Mobile IP tunnels and a procedure
    to establish these tunnels with the aid of automatic key and security association
    management protocol such as ISAKMP.</p>"
