abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In order to compute and provide optimal paths, Path Computation
    \nElements (PCEs) require an accurate and timely Traffic Engineering \nDatabase
    (TED). Traditionally this TED has been obtained from a link \nstate routing protocol
    supporting traffic engineering extensions. \nThis document discusses possible
    alternatives and enhancements to the \nexisting approach to TED creation. This
    document gives architectural \nalternatives for these enhancements and their potential
    impacts on \nnetwork nodes, routing protocols, and PCEs.\n\t </p>\n      "
