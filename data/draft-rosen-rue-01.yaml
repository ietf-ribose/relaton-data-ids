abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies a minimum set of standards and requirements
    that must be supported by a Video Relay Service (VRS) Video Access Technology
    Reference Platform (VATRP)-compliant client and United States Telecommunications
    Relay Service providers required to be VATRP compliant. This Relay User Equipment
    specification only specifies a minimum set of requirements. It does not prohibit
    VRS providers or endpoint developers from developing or deploying additional capabilities,
    provided that doing so will not prevent compliance with the requirements specified
    here.</p>"
