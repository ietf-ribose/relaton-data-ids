abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS is a query / response protocol.  Failure to respond
    or to\n   respond correctly to queries causes both immediate operational\n   problems
    and long term problems with protocol development.\n\n   This document identifies
    a number of common classes of queries to\n   which some servers either fail to
    respond or else respond\n   incorrectly.  This document also suggests procedures
    for TLD and\n   other similar zone operators to apply to help reduce / eliminate
    the\n   problem.\n\n   The document does not look at the DNS data itself, just
    the structure\n   of the responses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
