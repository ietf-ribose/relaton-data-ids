abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is submitted to the SIMPLE WG as part of the ongoing
    \ndiscussion on the selection of the protocol for support of Session \nBased Instant
    Messaging.  It evaluates the suitability of the IMSX \nprotocol as a transport
    for Session Based IM.  IMSX defines a BEEP \nprofile for exchanging CPIM messages
    after SIP has performed its \nsession setup signaling. This document evaluates
    IMSX against the \nIMPP requirements and its ability to interoperate with other
    IM \nsystems based upon the CPIM profile.\n\t </p>\n      "
