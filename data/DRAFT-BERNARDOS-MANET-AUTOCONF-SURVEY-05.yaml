abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet Draft provides a detailed description of most of
    the\nexisting IP autoconfiguration solutions proposed so far.  The main\naim of
    this document is to serve as a general reference for the\nAUTOCONF solution space.
    \ We present most of the previously proposed\nIP AUTOCONF mechanisms in MANETs,
    showing their key characteristics.\nFurthermore, each solution is analysed based
    on a number of\nevaluation considerations.\n\t </p>\n      "
