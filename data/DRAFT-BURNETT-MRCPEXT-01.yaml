abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) is an application level
    \nprotocol to control media service resources like Speech \nSynthesizers, Recognizers,
    Signal Generators, Signal Detectors, Fax \nServers etc. over a network.  This
    document captures the extensions \nrequired to implement Voice Enrollment, Speaker
    Verification and \nHotword recognition as well as to augment the recognizer \nfunctionality
    using MRCP.  The extensions are largely orthogonal to \nexisting features of MRCP
    and to each other, with an eye towards \nbackwards compatibility with existing
    features and independence of \nthe extensions from each other to simplify integration.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
