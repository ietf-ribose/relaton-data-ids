abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an Asynchronous Management Protocol
    (AMP) in\n   conformance with the Asynchronous Management Architecture (AMA).
    \ The\n   AMP provides monitoring and configuration services between managing\n
    \  devices (Managers) and managed devices (Agents), some of which may\n   operate
    on the far side of high-delay or high-disruption links.  The\n   AMP reduces the
    number of transmitted bytes, operates without\n   sessions or (concurrent) two-way
    links, and functions autonomously\n   when there is no timely contact with a network
    operator.  The AMP\n   accomplishes this without requiring mobile code.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
