abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses mechanisms that a downstream Autonomous\n
    \  System (AS) can use, when it detects a potential Distributed Denial-\n   of-Service
    (DDoS) attack, to request an upstream AS to perform\n   inbound filtering in its
    ingress routers for traffic that the\n   downstream AS wishes to drop.  The upstream
    AS can then undertake\n   appropriate actions (including, blackhole, drop, rate-limit,
    or add\n   to watch list) on the suspect traffic to the downstream AS thus\n   reducing
    the effectiveness of the attack.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
