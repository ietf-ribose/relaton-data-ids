abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a method to transport Internet Key Exchange
    Protocol (IKE) and IPsec packets over a TCP connection for traversing network
    middleboxes that may block IKE negotiation over UDP. This method, referred to
    as \"TCP encapsulation\", involves sending both IKE packets for Security Association
    establishment and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packets over a TCP connection.
    This method is intended to be used as a fallback option when IKE cannot be negotiated
    over UDP.</p>"
