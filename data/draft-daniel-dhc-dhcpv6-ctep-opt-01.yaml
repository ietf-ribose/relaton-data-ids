abstract:
  content: "\t <t>For the newly deployed IPv6 networks to interoperate with vastly
    deployed IPv4 networks, various transition mechanisms had been proposed. One such
    mechanism is configured tunnels. This document provides a mechanism by which the
    DHCPv6 servers can provide information about the various configured tunnel end
    points to reach the IPv6 nodes which are separated by IPv4 networks.</p>"
