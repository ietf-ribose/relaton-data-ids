abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo proposes extensions to the Happy Eyeball's algorithm\n
    \  requirements defined in RFC6555 for use with the multiple\n   provisioning
    domain architecture.  The Happy Eyeballs in MIF would\n   make the selection process
    smoother by using connectivity tests over\n   pre-filtered interfaces according
    to defined policy.  This would\n   choose the best interface with an automatic
    fallback mechanism.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
