abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides extensions to Generalized Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks
    (WSONs). Such extensions are applicable in WSONs under a number of conditions
    including: (a) when optional processing, such as regeneration, must be configured
    to occur at specific nodes along a path, (b) where equipment must be configured
    to accept an optical signal with specific attributes, or (c) where equipment must
    be configured to output an optical signal with specific attributes. This document
    provides mechanisms to support distributed wavelength assignment with a choice
    of distributed wavelength assignment algorithms.</p>"
