abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This short NANO draft proposes scenarios for using Mobile Routers\n
    \  at fixed scenes.  The routers connect by their egress interfaces\n   and need
    to allow their Local Fixed Nodes to communicate directly.\n   What if the Mobile
    Network Prefixes are stored in special Router\n   Advertisements sent by each
    Mobile Router on their egress\n   interface.  What are the issues and can it work.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
