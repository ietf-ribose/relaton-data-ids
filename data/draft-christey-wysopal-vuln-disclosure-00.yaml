  content: "<p>New vulnerabilities in software and hardware products are discoveredand
    publicized on a daily basis. The disclosure of vulnerabilityinformation has been
    a divisive topic for years. During the processof disclosure, many vendors, security
    researchers, and other partiesfollow a variety of unwritten or informal guidelines
    for how theyinteract and share information. Some parties may be unaware of theseguidelines,
    or they may intentionally ignore them. This state ofaffairs can make it difficult
    to achieve a satisfactory outcome foreveryone who uses or is affected by vulnerability
    information.</p>"
