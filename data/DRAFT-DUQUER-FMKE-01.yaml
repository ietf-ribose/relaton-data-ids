abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a new group key management protocol
    called \n   FMKE (Flat Multicast Key Exchange), derived from the Group Domain
    of\n   Interpretation (GDOI) [RFC3547]. Like the GDOI, its objective is to \n
    \  Manage securely group Security Associations (SA), i.e. establish and\n   update
    SAs in Group members. These security associations protect one\n   or more key-encrypting
    keys, traffic-encrypting keys, or data shared\n   by group members. This protocol
    is based on a centralized management,\n   achieved by the GCKS (Group Controller
    and Key Server). It is \n   destined to be used by Data Security protocols such
    as the IPSEC ESP \n   protocol. The FMKE protocol is destined to provide an optimized
    \n   solution for very large groups with direct connections such as in \n   satellite
    systems, or wireless systems such as WIFI. It can be \n   considered as a GDOI
    use case adapted for satellite networks. \n\t </p>\n      "
