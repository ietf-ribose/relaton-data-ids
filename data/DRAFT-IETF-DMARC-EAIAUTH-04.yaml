abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SPF (RFC7208), DKIM (RFC6376), and DMARC (RFC7489) enable a
    domain\n   owner to publish e-mail authentication and policy information in the\n
    \  DNS.  In internationalized e-mail, domain names can occur both as\n   U-labels
    and A-labels.  This specification updates the SPF, DKIM, and\n   DMARC specifications
    to clarify which form of internationalized\n   domain names to use in those specifications.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
