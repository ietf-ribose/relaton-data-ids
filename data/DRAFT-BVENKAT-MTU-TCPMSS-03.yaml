abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Path MTU discovery as it exists now finds the least MTU of
    a given\n   path. Traceroute through IP option [3] provides a method for finding\n
    \  the MTU on each hop using an ICMP message as a reply from the target\n   host,
    with output link MTU in a portion of the message. The method\n   proposed in this
    document intends to find the outbound MTU on each\n   hop on an internet path,
    without using the ICMP message for\n   traceroute. This mechanism intends to acheive
    the same goal as the\n   traceroute through IP option, but through a different
    mechanism.\n\n   Discovery  of the MTU of each router on a internet path would
    serve\n   as a valuable network debugging tool. The way in which it is\n   proposed
    to be implemented, it has the advantage of being\n   automatically supported by
    all of the routers that support the TCP\n   layer. It has a couple of disadvantages
    that it generates quite a few\n   TCP packets and the amount of time it takes
    to run to discover each\n   MTU along the path is quite substantial.\n\n   This
    document specifies the MTU discovery mechanism with the\n   existing IP and TCP
    options and the ICMP message types that\n   exist on all routers that support
    TCP layer in the internet. This\n   method is suggested as an alternative to the
    Traceroute through\n   IP option [3]. The intention is not to obsolete RFC 1393.\n\n
    \  This document also suggests that by default a reply SYN packet\n   from a target
    host should include a MSS value that is derived from\n   the MTU of the connected
    network of the outbound interface.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
