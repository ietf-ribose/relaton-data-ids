abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document offers an approach to encrypt DNS queries and
    responses\n   between the stub resolver and the recursive server over UDP to\n
    \  protect user privacy.  The public key of the recursive server is\n   distributed
    to the stub resolver through the Certificate Authority\n   infrastructure, and
    the public key of the stub resolver is sent to\n   the recursive server together
    with the DNS query where the public key\n   is inserted to the additional section
    of the DNS query.  Then the\n   recursive server encrypts the DNS responses sent
    to the stub resolver\n   with the public key of that stub resolver, and similarly
    the DNS\n   query sent to the recursive server is encrypted by the stub resolver\n
    \  with the public key of that recursive server and thus the user\n   privacy
    is protected.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
