abstract:
- content: "<p>Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes which violate assumptions
    of BGP topology relationships; e.g. passing a route learned from one peer to another
    peer or to a transit provider, passing a route learned from one transit provider
    to another transit provider or to a peer. Today, approaches to leak prevention
    rely on marking routes by operator configuration, with no check that the configuration
    corresponds to that of the BGP neighbor, or enforcement that the two BGP speakers
    agree on the relationship. This document enhances BGP OPEN to establish agreement
    of the (peer, customer, provider, Route Server, Route Server client) relationship
    of two neighboring BGP speakers to enforce appropriate configuration on both sides.
    Propagated routes are then marked with an OTC attribute according to the agreed
    relationship, allowing both prevention and detection of route leaks.</p>"
