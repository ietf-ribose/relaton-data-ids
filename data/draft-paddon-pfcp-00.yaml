abstract:
- content: "<p>The Packet Filter Configuration Protocol (PFCP) is a client-server
    protocol which provides a mechanism for trusted clients to dynamically request
    updates to a packet filtering policy managed by a server. Typically, a server
    is either a packet filter or an entity which controls one or more packet filters.
    Since clients may specify permitted flows as and when they are required, packet
    filters configured via PFCP may operate an extremely restrictive default policy.</p>"
