abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Logically Succinct Basic Policy Rule Components (LSBPRC) provides\nmodel
    extensions to the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) and\nimplementable extensions
    to the Policy Core LDAP Schema (PCLS) in\nwhich the logic of conditions and actions
    can be succinctly expressed\nand explicitly interpreted. LSBPRC offers a direct
    and invariant\nconnection between the rule designer's intention and the rule\ninterpreter's
    evaluation of the rulebase.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
