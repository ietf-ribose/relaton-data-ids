abstract:
  content: "<p>Transport and application layer protocol provides end-to-endconnectivity
    for clients and servers, but conveys limited or even noinformation to a middlebox,
    such as Policy and Charging Control (PCC)system, between the client and server.
    However, PCC needs to authenticate theclient-server traffic so that it can perform
    the basic functionality, i.e.,charging the client. Due to lack of traffic authentication
    capability in transport andapplication layer protocol, state-of-the-art PCC adopts
    Deep PacketInspection (DPI) to understand client-server communication and decidewhether
    to charge a client. However, in this draft, we show that currenttransport layer
    protocol(TCP) and application layer(HTTP, TLS) protocol cannotmeet the need of
    traffic authentication, i.e., the user can modify the packetand by pass the ISP
    PCC to have free ride. Due to the existence of the aforementioned free-riding
    attacks, webelieve that Transport and application layer protocol needs to providetraffic
    authentication capability to a middlebox. In this draft, we describe free-riding
    attacks and present requirementsfor providing traffic authentication.</p>"
