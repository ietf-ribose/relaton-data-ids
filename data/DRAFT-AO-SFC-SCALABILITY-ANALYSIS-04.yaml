abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SFC is an ordered set of service function, should be scalable
    to meet\n   broad range of requirements.  The scalability of SFC can be\n   interpreted
    as ability of the SFC to accommodate one or more SFs\n   joining the SFC , or
    leaving the SFC without significant impact to\n   SFC performance.\n\n   This
    document presents four aspects on SFC scalability, and provide\n   analysis of
    the data plane and the control plane to implement the\n   scalable SFC.\n\n\t
