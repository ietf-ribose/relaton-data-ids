- content: "<p>[RFC9032] defines a method by which a potential [RFC9031] enrollment
    proxy can announce itself as a available for new Pledges to enroll on a network.
    The announcement includes a priority for enrollment. This document provides a
    mechanism by which a RPL DODAG root can disable enrollment announcements, or adjust
    the base priority for enrollment operation.</p>"
