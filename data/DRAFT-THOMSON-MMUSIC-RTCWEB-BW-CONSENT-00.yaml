  content: "\n\t <p>   An attribute is defined for Session Traversal Utilities for
    NAT\n   (STUN) that allows for declarations of bandwidth limits on the\n   negotiated
    flow.  The application of this attribute to reducing\n   denial of service attacks
    from internet telephony systems.  Other\n   applications include negotiation of
    bandwidth at packet relays.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
