abstract:
  content: "<p>This document presents NETCONF Call Home, which enables a NETCONF server
    to initiate a secure connection to the NETCONF client. NETCONF Call Home supports
    both the SSH and TLS transports, and does so in a way that preserves the SSH and
    TLS roles when compared to standard NETCONF over SSH or TLS connections.</p>"
