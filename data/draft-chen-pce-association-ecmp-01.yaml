abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.ietf-pce-association-group]introduces and explains a generic mechanism
    to create a grouping of LSPs. The grouping can then be used to define associations
    between a set of LSPs and/or a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters
    or behaviours) and is equally applicable to the active and passive modes of a
    stateful PCE [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] as well as a stateless PCE [RFC5440].
    This document specifies a PCEP extension to bind one or more LSPs into an ECMP
    Associated Group.</p>"
