abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It may not be possible for a network to determine the cause
    for an\n   attack, but instead just realize that some resources seem to be under\n
    \  attack.  To fill that gap, Distributed-Denial-of-Service Open Threat\n   Signaling
    (DOTS) allows a network to inform a DOTS server that it is\n   under a potential
    attack so that appropriate mitigation actions are\n   undertaken.\n\n   This document
    specifies mechanisms to configure nodes with DOTS\n   servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
