abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Mobile IP can provide IP mobility. The mobile node identified
    by \nits Home Address can have transparent home IP routing service \nregardless
    of attaching point.  However the need for the user \nmobility support has identified
    by wireless operators so as to \nprovide IP routing service, based on the user
    identifier not based on \nhome IP address.  This document specifies the user mobility
    support \nfor Mobile IPv6 through DNS, while providing semi-secure binding \nupdate
    mechanism for the route optimization between MN and CN.\n\t </p>\n      "
