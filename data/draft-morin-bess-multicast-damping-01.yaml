abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes procedures to damp multicast VPN routing state
    changes and control the effect of the churn due to the multicast dynamicity in
    customer site. The procedures described in this document are applicable to BGP-based
    multicast VPN and help avoid uncontrolled control plane load increase in the core
    routing infrastructure. New procedures are proposed inspired from BGP unicast
    route damping principles, but adapted to multicast.</p>"
