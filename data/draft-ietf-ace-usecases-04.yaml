abstract:
- content: "<p>Constrained devices are nodes with limited processing power, storage
    space and transmission capacities. These devices in many cases do not provide
    user interfaces and are often intended to interact without human intervention.
    This document comprises a collection of representative use cases for the application
    of authentication and authorization in constrained environments. These use cases
    aim at identifying authorization problems that arise during the lifecylce of a
    constrained device and are intended to provide a guideline for developing a comprehensive
    authentication and authorization solution for this class of scenarios. Where specific
    details are relevant, it is assumed that the devices use the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) as communication protocol, however most conclusions apply generally.</p>"
