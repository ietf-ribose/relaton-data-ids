abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A number of Internet application protocols have a need to providecontent
    negotiation for the resources with which they interact. WhileMIME media types
    [1] provide a standard method for handling onemajor axis of variation, resources
    also vary in ways which cannot beexpressed using currently available MIME headers.
    This paper assertsthat a cross-protocol negotiation framework is needed, both
    toleverage work already done for specific protocols and to allow forcontent negotiation
    when resources will pass through severalprotocols on their way from provider to
    recipient. To justify theneed, this paper puts forward several content negotiation
    scenariosand discusses how they affect the requirements for such a framework.</p>"
