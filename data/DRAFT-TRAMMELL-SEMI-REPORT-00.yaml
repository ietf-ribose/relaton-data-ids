abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) through its IP Stack
    Evolution\n   program, the Internet Society, and the Swiss Federal Institute of\n
    \  Technology (ETH) Zurich hosted the Stack Evolution in a Middlebox\n   Internet
    (SEMI) workshop in Zurich on 26-27 January 2015 to explore\n   the ability to
    evolve the transport layer in the presence of\n   middlebox- and interface-related
    ossification of the stack.  The goal\n   of the workshop was to produce architectural
    and engineering guidance\n   on future work to break the logjam, focusing on incrementally\n
    \  deployable approaches with clear incentives to deployment both on the\n   endpoints
    (in new transport layers and applications) as well as on\n   middleboxes (run
    by network operators).  This document summarizes the\n   contributions to the
    workshop, provides an overview of the discussion\n   at the workshop, as well
    as the outcomes and next steps identified by\n   the workshop.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
