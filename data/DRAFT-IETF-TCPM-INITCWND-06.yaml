abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an experiment to increase the permitted
    TCP\n   initial window (IW) from between 2 and 4 segments, as specified in\n   RFC
    3390, to 10 segments, with a fallback to the existing\n   recommendation when
    performance issues are detected. It discusses the\n   motivation behind the increase,
    the advantages and disadvantages of\n   the higher initial window, and presents
    results from several large\n   scale experiments showing that the higher initial
    window improves the\n   overall performance of many web services without resulting
    in a\n   congestion collapse. The document closes with a discussion of usage\n
    \  and deployment for further experimental purpose recommended by the\n   IETF
    TCP Maintenance and Minor Extensions (TCPM) working group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
