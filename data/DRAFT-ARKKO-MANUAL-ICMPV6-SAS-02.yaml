abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This informational document discusses the use of manually configured\nIPsec
    security associations to protect IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)\nmessages.  IPsec
    security associations are generally identified by\nthe triple (security parameters
    index, destination address,\nprotocol).  In the case of Neighbor Discovery, configuring
    these\nassociations requires some effort, however.  There are multiple known\ndestination
    addresses plus a number of addresses that depend on the\nphysical link addresses.
    \ This document describes the security\nimplications of protecting or not protecting
    the Neighbor Discovery\nmessages and lists the security associations that must
    be configured\nmanually.  The presented method is applicable only in small networks,\nbut
    some approaches for reducing the configuration effort are\ndiscussed.\n\t </p>\n
