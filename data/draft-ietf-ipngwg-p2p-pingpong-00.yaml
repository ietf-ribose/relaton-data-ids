abstract:
- content: "<p>In IPv6 point-to-point link operation, there is a significant possibility
    of aberrant behavior in that packets may ping-pong between the two ends of the
    link. The problem can lead to wasted bandwidth and can possibly be abused by malicious
    parties. This document provides an analysis and solution to the problem.</p>"
