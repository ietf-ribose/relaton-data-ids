abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Tunneling, Compressing and Multiplexing (TCM) is a method for\n
    \  improving the bandwidth utilization of network segments that carry\n   multiple
    small-packet flows in parallel sharing a common path.  The\n   method combines
    different protocols for header compression,\n   multiplexing, and tunneling over
    a network path for the purpose of\n   reducing the bandwidth consumption.  The
    amount of packets per second\n   can be reduced at the same time.\n\n   This document
    describes the TCM framework and the different options\n   which can be used for
    each of the three layers (header compression,\n   multiplexing and tunneling).\n\n\t
