abstract:
- content: "<p>When split-horizon DNS is deployed by an enterprise, certain enterprise
    domains are only resolvable by querying the network- provided DNS server. DNS
    clients which use DNS servers not provided by the network need to route those
    DNS domain queries to the network- provided DNS server. This document informs
    DNS clients of split- horizon DNS, their DNS domains, and is compatible with encrypted
    DNS.</p>"
