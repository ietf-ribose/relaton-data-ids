abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SIP event notification framework is specified in RFC 3265.
    \ The\n   framework restricts usage to notifications of events related to the\n
    \  SIP state.  However, there is growing interest in the community for\n   relaxing
    that constraint and using the SIP event notification\n   framework for reporting
    changes in state that is not directly related\n   to SIP.  For example, it has
    been suggested a usage of the framework\n   for reporting events related to a
    vehicle state, files stored in a\n   device, calendar events, and Sieve notifications.
    \ This memo\n   discusses the benefits of a mechanism for general event notifications\n
    \  using SIP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
