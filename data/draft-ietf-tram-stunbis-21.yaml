abstract:
- content: "<p>Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves
    as a tool for other protocols in dealing with NAT traversal. It can be used by
    an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to it by a NAT. It
    can also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints and as a keep-alive
    protocol to maintain NAT bindings. STUN works with many existing NATs and does
    not require any special behavior from them. STUN is not a NAT traversal solution
    by itself. Rather, it is a tool to be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution.
    This document obsoletes RFC 5389.</p>"
