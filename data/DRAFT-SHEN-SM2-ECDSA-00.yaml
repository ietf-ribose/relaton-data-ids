abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discribles an Digital Signature Algorithm based
    on\n   elliptic curves which is invented by Xiaoyun Wang et al.  This\n   digital
    signature algorithm is published by Chinese Commercial\n   Cryptography Administration
    Office for the use of electronic\n   authentication service system.\n\n   The
    document *** published by Chinese Commercial Cryptography\n   Administration Office
    includes four parts: general introdocution,\n   Digital Signature Algorithm, Key
    Exchange Protocol and Public Key\n   Encryption Algorithm.  This document only
    gives the general\n   introduction and digital signature algorithm.\n\n\t </p>\n
