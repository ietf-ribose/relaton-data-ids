abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Randomness is a crucial ingredient for Transport Layer Security
    (TLS)\n   and related security protocols.  Weak or predictable\n   \"cryptographically-strong\"
    pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs)\n   can be abused or exploited for malicious
    purposes.  An initial\n   entropy source that seeds a CSPRNG might be weak or
    broken as well,\n   which can also lead to critical and systemic security problems.
    \ This\n   document describes a way for security protocol implementations to\n
    \  augment their CSPRNGs using long-term private keys.  This improves\n   randomness
    from broken or otherwise subverted CSPRNGs.\n\n   This document is a product of
    the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG)\n   in the IRTF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
