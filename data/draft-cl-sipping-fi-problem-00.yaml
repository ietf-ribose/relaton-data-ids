    may be defined as a unit of functionality in a system, havinga self-contained
    role.However, the introduction and modification of features may result inundesired
    behaviors, and this effect is known as feature interaction-FI for short.This document
    provides a description of the FI problem in Internet, themain problems to be solved
    in the FI resolution, and compares somesolutions for FI identification and resolution
    explored that have beendiscussed in the literature.</p>"
