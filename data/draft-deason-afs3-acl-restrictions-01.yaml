abstract:
  content: "<p>The AFS-3 ACL 'a' bit gives users unfettered power to grant, orrevoke,
    privileges, with no provision for enforcing site policy.This memo provides several
    alternative mechanisms for creatingrestrictions on what powers the 'a' bit denotes.
    Three alternativemechanisms for restricting the power of the 'a' bit are proposed:
    amethod for overlaying the ACL with a site-controlled ACL; a methodfor masking
    the ACL with a site-controlled privilege mask; and afinely granular meta-acl mechanism
    for restricting to whom privilegesmay be delegated, and which privileges may be
    given to differentclasses of principals. This memo will serve as a basis for the
    ACLrestriction discussion with the AFS-3 protocol working group. Theintended goal
    of this discussion is to reach consensus onstandardization of one or more solutions,
    and then publish a BCPstatus memo.</p>"
