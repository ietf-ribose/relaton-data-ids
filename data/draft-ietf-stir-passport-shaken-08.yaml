abstract:
- content: <p>This document extends the Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT), which
    is a token object that conveys cryptographically signed information about the
    participants involved in communications. The extension is defined based on the
    "Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs (SHAKEN)" specification
    by the ATIS/SIP Forum IP-NNI Task Group. It provides both (1) a specific set of
    levels of confidence in the correctness of the originating identity of a call
    originated in a SIP-based telephone network as well as (2) an identifier that
    allows the Service Provider (SP) to uniquely identify the origin of the call within
    its network.</p>
