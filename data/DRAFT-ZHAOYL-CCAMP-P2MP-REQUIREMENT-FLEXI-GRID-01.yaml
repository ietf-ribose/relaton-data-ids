abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multicasting over WDM optical networks has enabled many popular\n
    \  Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) applications, such as video conference,\n   interactive
    distance learning, replicated database, distributed\n   computing, and so on.
    \ However, on the one hand, the low-rate\n   multicasting traffic demands cannot
    make full use of the capacity of\n   the entire wavelength, and on the other hand,
    new services such as\n   data center migration and cloud applications need higher
    transmission\n   rates and higher spectrum efficiency.  Flexi-grid network is
    an\n   effective solution to address the problem of transmission rate and\n   spectrum
    utilization.  It overcomes the fixed grid constraint of\n   Wavelength Swithched
    Optical Network (WSON) by using advanced\n   technologies such as coherent detection
    and Bandwidth Variable-\n   Wavelength Selective Switches (BV-WSS).  Therefore,
    it is essential\n   to exploit multicasting over flexi-grid networks.  This document\n
    \  covers the requirements for supporting P2MP over flexi-grid\n   infrastructure.
    \ Specifically, the scope of requirements listed in\n   this document covers the
    functionality that should be supported by\n   the control plane.\n\n\t </p>\n
