abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces an application programming interface
    (API)\n   to the web-based \"Network Looking Glass\" software.  Its purpose is
    to\n   provide application programmers uniform access to the Looking Glass\n   service
    and to analyze standardized response.\n\n   The API interface is supposed to provide
    the same level of\n   information as web-based interfaces, but in a computer-readable\n
    \  format.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
