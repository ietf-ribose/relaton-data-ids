abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An SR policy is a set of candidate SR paths consisting of one
    or more\n   segment lists with necessary path attributes.  For each SR path, it\n
    \  may also have its own path attributes, and Path Segment is one of\n   them.
    \ A Path Segment is defined to identify an SR path, which can be\n   used for
    performance measurement, path correlation, and end-2-end\n   path protection.
    \ Path Segment can be also used to correlate two\n   unidirctional SR paths into
    a bi-directional SR path which is\n   required in some scenarios, for example,
    mobile backhaul transport\n   network.\n\n   This document defines extensions
    to BGP to distribute SR policies\n   carriying Path segment and bi-directional
    path information.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
