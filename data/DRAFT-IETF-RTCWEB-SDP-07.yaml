abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-Time Communications in WEB-browsers (Rtcweb) working
    group\n   is charged to provide protocol support for direct interactive rich\n
    \  communication using audio, video and data between two peers' web\n   browsers.
    \ With in the Rtcweb framework, Session Description protocol\n   (SDP) is used
    for negotiating session capabilities between the peers.\n   Such a negotiation
    happens based on the SDP Offer/Answer exchange\n   mechanism.\n\n   This document
    provides an informational reference in describing the\n   role of SDP and the
    Offer/Answer exchange mechanism for the most\n   common Rtcweb use-cases.\n\n\t
