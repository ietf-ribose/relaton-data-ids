abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-levelprotocol
    for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia informationsystems. It is a generic,
    stateless, protocol which can be used formany tasks beyond its use for hypertext,
    such as name servers anddistributed object management systems, through extension
    of itsrequest methods, error codes and headers [RFC2324]. A feature ofHTTP is
    the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowingsystems to be built
    independently of the data being transferred.HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide
    Web global informationinitiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocolreferred
    to as \"HTTP/1.1\", and is an update to RFC2616.Editorial Note (To be removed
    by RFC Editor before publication)Distribution of this document is unlimited. Please
    send comments tothe Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) mailing list atietf-http-wg@w3.org
    [1], which may be joined by sending a messagewith subject \"subscribe\" to ietf-http-wg-request@w3.org
    [2].Discussions of the HTTP working group are archived at&lt;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/&gt;.
    XML versions,latest edits and the issues list for this document are available
    from&lt;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/rfc2616bis/&gt;.The purpose of this
    document is to revise [RFC2616], doing onlyminimal corrections. For now, it is
    not planned to advance thestandards level of HTTP, thus - if published - the specification
    willstill be a \"Proposed Standard\" (see [RFC2026]).The current plan is to incorporate
    known errata, and to update thespecification text according to the current IETF
    publicationguidelines. In particular:o Incorporate the corrections collected in
    the RFC2616 erratadocument (&lt;http://purl.org/NET/http-errata&gt;) (most of
    thesuggested fixes have been applied to draft 01 [3]).o Incorporate corrections
    for newly discovered and agreed-uponproblems, using the HTTP WG mailing list as
    forum and&lt;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/rfc2616bis/issues/&gt; asissues
    list.o Update references, and re-classify them into \"Normative\" and\"Informative\",
    based on the prior work done by Jim Gettys in&lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gettys-http-v11-spec-rev-00&gt;.This
    document is based on a variant of the original RFC2616specification formatted
    using Marshall T. Rose's \"xml2rfc\" tool (see&lt;http://xml.resource.org&gt;)
    and therefore deviates from the originaltext in word wrapping, page breaks, list
    formatting, referenceformatting, whitespace usage and appendix numbering. Otherwise,
    itis supposed to contain an accurate copy of the original specificationtext. See
    &lt;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/rfc2616bis-00-from-rfc2616.diff.html&gt;
    for a comparison between bothdocuments, as generated by \"rfcdiff\"(&lt;http://tools.ietf.org/tools/rfcdiff/&gt;).</p>"
