abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Password-Authenticated Key Agreement (PAKE) schemes are interactive\n
    \  protocols that allow the participants to authenticate each other and\n   derive
    shared cryptographic keys using a (weaker) shared password.\n   This document
    reviews different types of PAKE schemes and discusses\n   their requirements.
    \ It is a product of the Crypto Forum Research\n   Group (CFRG).\n\n\t </p>\n
