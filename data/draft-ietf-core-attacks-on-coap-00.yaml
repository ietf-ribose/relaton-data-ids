abstract:
- content: "<p>Being able to securely read information from sensors, to securely control
    actuators, and to not enable distributed denial-of-service attacks are essential
    in a world of connected and networking things interacting with the physical world.
    This document summarizes a number of known attacks on CoAP and show that just
    using CoAP with a security protocol like DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE is not enough for
    secure operation. Several of the discussed attacks can be mitigated with the solutions
    in draft-ietf-core-echo-request-tag.</p>"
