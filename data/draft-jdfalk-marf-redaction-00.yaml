abstract:
- content: "<p>Email messages often contain information which might be considered
    private or sensitive, per either regulation or social norms. When such a message
    becomes the subject of a report intended to be shared with other entities, the
    report generator may wish to redact or elide the sensitive portions of the message.
    This memo suggests one method for doing so effectively.</p>"
