abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for the global
    (or local) DNS names of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as appliances and
    sensors. By this scheme, the DNS name of an IoT device can be autoconfigured with
    the device's category and model in wired and wireless target networks (e.g., home,
    office, shopping mall, smart grid, and road network). This DNS name lets IoT users
    (e.g., home residents and customers) in the Internet (or local network) easily
    identify each device for monitoring and remote- controlling it in the target network.</p>"
