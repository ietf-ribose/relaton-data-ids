abstract:
  content: "<p>Current 6bone backbone routing guidelines prohibit traditionalmultihoming
    in IPv6, because current IPv4-style multihoming doesn'tscale. This stands in the
    way of successful adoption of IPv6. Thesolution outlined in this memo proposes
    aggregating the routinginformation for multihomed destinations inside service
    providernetworks based on geography to accomplish scalable multihoming in IPv6using
    current protocols and implementations. This solution does notrequire network operators
    to increase the density of interconnection;nor does it require significant cooperation
    or simultaneous adoption.</p>"
