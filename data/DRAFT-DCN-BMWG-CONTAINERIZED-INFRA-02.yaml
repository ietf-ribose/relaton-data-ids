abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes benchmarking considerations for the\n
    \  containerized infrastructure.  In the containerized infrastructure,\n   Virtualized
    Network Functions(VNFs) are deployed on operating-system-\n   level virtualization
    platform by abstracting the user namespace as\n   opposed to virtualization using
    a hypervisor.  Leveraging this, the\n   system configurations and networking scenarios
    for benchmarking will\n   be partially changed by the way in which the resource
    allocation and\n   network technologies specified for containerized VNFs.  In
    this draft\n   we compare the state of the art in a container networking\n   architecture
    with networking on VM-based virtualized systems, and\n   provide several test
    scenarios in the containerized infrastructure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
