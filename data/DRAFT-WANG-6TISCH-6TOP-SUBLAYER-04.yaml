abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the 6TiSCH Operation Sublayer (6top),
    which\n   offers mechanisms for distributed scheduling in 6TiSCH networks.  The\n
    \  6top sublayer is the next higher layer of the IEEE802.15.4e TSCH\n   medium
    access control layer.  The 6top Protocol (6P) defined in this\n   document allows
    neighbor nodes to add/delete TSCH cells to one\n   another.  To be able to match
    different application requirements, the\n   6top Scheduling Function (SF) decides
    when to add/delete cells.  The\n   SF is left out of scope, and will be specified
    in one or more\n   companion documents.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
