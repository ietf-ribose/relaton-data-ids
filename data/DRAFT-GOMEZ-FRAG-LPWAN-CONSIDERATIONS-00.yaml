abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SCHC adaptation layer provides header compression and\n
    \  fragmentation functionality between IPv6 and an underlying LPWAN\n   technology.
    \ SCHC fragmentation has been specifically designed for\n   the characteristics
    of LPWANs.  However, when CoAP is used at the\n   application layer, there exists
    an alternative approach for\n   fragmentation, which is using the CoAP Block option.
    \ This document\n   aims at illustrating the advantages and limitations of each
    approach\n   for transferring larger payloads.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
