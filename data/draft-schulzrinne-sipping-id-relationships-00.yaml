abstract:
- content: "<p>Evolution of communications technologies brought us various types of
    identifiers or addresses that identify persons such as SIP URIs, email addresses,
    and telephone numbers. Proper relationships among different type of identifiers
    can enable various services, which, otherwise, are difficult to realize. This
    memo provides guidelines for managing relationships between SIP URIs other personal
    identifiers.</p>"
