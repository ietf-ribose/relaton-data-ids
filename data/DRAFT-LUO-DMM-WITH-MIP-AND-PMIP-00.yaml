abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Based on the analysis of current centralized mobility management\n
    \  approaches, three main functions of current centralized mobility\n   anchor
    are identified, which are Mobility Routing (MR), Home Address\n   Allocation (HAA),
    and Location Management (LM), in this draft.\n\n   Based on the proposal of decoupling
    those functions, this draft\n   provides a concept of architecture for Distributed
    Mobility\n   Management (DMM) with some key approaches for DMM.  Those approaches\n
    \  are compatible with both current MIP and PMIP protocols.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
