abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a unified mode of operation for Virtual Circuit
    Connectivity Verification (VCCV), which provides a control channel that is associated
    with a pseudowire (PW). VCCV applies to all supported access circuit and transport
    types currently defined for PWs, as well as those being transported by the MPLS
    Transport Profile. This new mode is intended to augment those described in RFC5085.
    It describes new rules requiring this mode to be used as the default/mandatory
    mode of operation for VCCV. The older VCCV types will remain optional.</p>"
