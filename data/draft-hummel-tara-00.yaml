abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft outlines a new routing architecture which I like tocall
    TARA = Topology Aggregating Routing Architecture. Its primaryobjective is to eliminate
    the so-called scalability problem asproclaimed by RFC4984. By overcoming the true
    causes of this problem - which are indeed some holy routing paradigms - it may
    serve as the base for much better routing.</p>"
