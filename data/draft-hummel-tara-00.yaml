abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft outlines a new routing architecture which I like to call
    TARA = Topology Aggregating Routing Architecture. Its primary objective is to
    eliminate the so-called scalability problem as proclaimed by RFC4984. By overcoming
    the true causes of this problem - which are indeed some holy routing paradigms
    - it may serve as the base for much better routing.</p>"
