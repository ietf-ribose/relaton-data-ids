abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OAM (Operations, Administration and Maintenance - as per BCP161,\n
    \  (RFC6291) processes for data networks are often subject to the\n   problem
    of circular dependencies when relying on connectivity\n   provided by the network
    to be managed for the OAM purposes.\n\n   Provisioning while bringing up devices
    and networks tends to be more\n   difficult to automate than service provisioning
    later on, changes in\n   core network functions impacting reachability cannot
    be automated\n   because of ongoing connectivity requirements for the OAM equipment\n
    \  itself, and widely used OAM protocols are not secure enough to be\n   carried
    across the network without security concerns.\n\n   This document describes how
    to integrate OAM processes with an\n   autonomic control plane in order to provide
    stable and secure\n   connectivity for those OAM processes.  This connectivity
    is not\n   subject to aforementioned circular dependencies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
