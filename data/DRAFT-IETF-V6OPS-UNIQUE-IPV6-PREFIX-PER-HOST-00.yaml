abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In some IPv6 environments the need has arisen for hosts to
    be able to\n   utilise a unique IPv6 prefix even though the link or media may
    be\n   shared.  Typically hosts (subscribers) on a shared network, like Wi-\n
    \  Fi or Ethernet, will acquire unique IPv6 addresses from a common IPv6\n   prefix
    that is allocated or assigned for use on a specific link.\n   Benefits of a unique
    IPv6 prefix compared to a unique IPv6 address\n   from the service provider are
    going from enhanced subscriber\n   management to improved isolation between subscribers.\n\n
    \  In most deployments today IPv6 address assignment from a single IPv6\n   prefix
    on a shared network is done by either using IPv6 stateless\n   address auto-configuration
    (SLAAC) and/or stateful DHCPv6.  While\n   this is still viable and operates as
    designed there are some large\n   scale environments where this concept introduces
    significant\n   performance challenges and implications, specifically related
    to IPv6\n   router and neighbor discovery.  This document outlines an approach\n
    \  utilising existing IPv6 protocols to allow hosts to be assigned a\n   unique
    IPv6 prefix (instead of a unique IPv6 address from a shared\n   IPv6 prefix).\n\n\t
