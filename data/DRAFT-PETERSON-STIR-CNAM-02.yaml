abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends PASSporT, a token for conveying\n   cryptographically-signed
    information about the people involved in\n   personal communications, to include
    a human-readable display name\n   comparable to the \"Caller ID\" function common
    on the telephone\n   network.  The element defined for this purpose is extensible
    to\n   include related information about callers that helps people decide\n   whether
    to pick up the phone.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
