abstract:
- content: <p>The ISATAP tunnel MTU is currently recommended to be set to 1480 or
    less. This is to avoid IPv4 fragmentation within the tunnel, but requires the
    ISATAP tunnel ingress interface to drop any IPv6 packet larger than 1480 bytes
    and return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) message. Concerns for operational issues
    with both IPv4 and IPv6 Path MTU Discovery point to the possibility of MTU-related
    black holes when a packet is dropped due to an MTU restriction, so dropping packets
    is considered highly undesirable. Fortunately, the "Internet cell size" is 1500
    bytes, i.e., the minimum MTU configured by the vast majority of links in the Internet.
    This document therefore presents a method to boost the ISATAP MTU to 1500 bytes.</p>
