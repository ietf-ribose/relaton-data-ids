abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to
    deliver\n   fabric service for users within a data center network.  This model
    is\n   intended to be instantiated by management system.  It provides an\n   abstraction
    of services for a fabric network to be used by users.\n   However it is not a
    configuration model used directly onto network\n   infrastructures.  It should
    be used combining with such as fabric\n   topology data model defined in\n   [I-D.zhuang-i2rs-yang-dc-fabric-network-topology]
    with specific\n   fabric topology information to generate required configuration
    onto\n   the related network elements to deliver the service.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
