abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance\n
    \  (DMARC) is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating\n   organization
    can express domain-level policies and preferences for\n   message validation,
    disposition, and reporting, that a mail receiving\n   organization can use to
    improve mail handling.\n\n   Originators of Internet Mail need to be able to associate
    reliable\n   and authenticated domain identifiers with messages, communicate\n
    \  policies about messages that use those identifiers, and report about\n   mail
    using those identifiers.  These abilities have several benefits:\n   Receivers
    can provide feedback to domain owners about the use of\n   their domains, which
    can provide valuable insight about the\n   management of internal operations and
    the presence of external domain\n   name abuse.\n\n   DMARC does not produce or
    encourage elevated delivery privilege of\n   authenticated email.  DMARC is a
    mechanism for policy distribution\n   that enables increasingly strict handling
    of messages that fail\n   authentication checks, ranging from no action, through
    altered\n   delivery, up to message rejection.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
