abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Naming Delegation Architecture
    that makes\n   IPv6 Home Network globally reachable with Names or Fully Qualified\n
    \  Domain Names (FQDN).  In this architecture, the Customer Premise\n   Equipment
    (CPE) acts as the DNS Authoritative Server of the Home\n   Network also called
    the Delegated DNS Server.  The Naming Delegation\n   is configured between the
    Delegated DNS Server and the Delegating DNS\n   Server managed by the ISP.\n\n
    \  The use case considered in this document is an End User that\n   subscribes
    its ISP a specific Delegated Domain for its Home Network.\n   This document describes
    how the CPE automatically sets the Naming\n   Delegation between the Delegating
    and Delegated DNS Server.\n\n   The Naming Delegation is requested by the CPE.
    \ The CPE DHCP Client\n   and the ISP DHCP Server exchange DHCP Options to properly
    set the\n   Naming Delegation.  More specifically, the CPE DHCP Client (resp.
    the\n   ISP DHCP Server) configures the DNS(SEC) Zones of the Delegated DNS\n
    \  Server (resp. Delegating DNS Server).  For the Delegating DNS Server,\n   the
    necessary pieces of information required to set the Naming\n   Delegation are
    the IP address of the Delegated DNS Server, and if\n   DNSSEC is used, the Delegation
    of Signing Information.  For the\n   Delegated DNS Server, the necessary information
    is the Delegated\n   Domain associated to the Home Network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
