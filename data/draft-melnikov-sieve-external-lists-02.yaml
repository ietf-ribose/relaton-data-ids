abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Sieve scripting language can be used for implementing ofwhitelisting,
    blacklisting and personal distribution lists.Currently this requires that all
    members of such lists be hardcodedin the script itself. Whenever a member of such
    list is added ordeleted, the script needs to be updated and possibly uploaded
    to amail server.This document defines a Sieve extension for accessing externallystored
    mailing lists, i.e. list whose members are stored externallyto the script, for
    example in LDAP (RFC 4510), ACAP (RFC 2244) or arelational database.ToDoo Need
    a way to advertise supported URI schemas in ManageSieve andihave.</p>"
