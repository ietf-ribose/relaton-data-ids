abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how EAP-GSS provides forward secrecy
    by\n   encrypting each session in an ephemeral key generated in the initial\n
    \  state of the context establishment.  This Diffie-Hellman key is\n   shared
    by the initiator (EAP peer) and acceptor (EAP authenticator).\n\n   The goal is
    to stop a passive attacker with access to the traffic\n   between an ABFAB user
    and the service she uses (Relying Party), from\n   getting access to key material
    and information linkable to the user\n   or from being able to fingerprint the
    user.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
