abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Address Translators (NATs) are widely deployed to share\n
    \  scarce public IPv4 addresses among multiple end hosts.  They\n   overwrite
    IP addresses and ports in IP packets to do so.  QUIC is a\n   protocol on top
    of UDP that provides transport-like services.  QUIC\n   is better-behaved in the
    presence of NATs than older protocols, and\n   existing UDP NATs should operate
    without incident if unmodified.\n   QUIC offers additional features that may tempt
    NAT implementers as\n   potential optimizations.  However, in practice, leveraging
    these\n   features will lead to new connection failure modes and security\n   vulnerabilities.\n\n\t
