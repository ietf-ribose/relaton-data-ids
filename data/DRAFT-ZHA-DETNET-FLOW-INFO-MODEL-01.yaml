abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides end-to-end absolute\n
    \  delay and loss guarantee to serve real-time applications. DetNet\n   is focused
    on a general approach that use techniques such as 1)\n   data plane resources
    reservation for DetNet flows; 2) providing\n   fixed path for DetNet flows; 3)sequentializng,
    replicating, and\n   eliminating duplicate packets transmission [I-D.finn-detnet-\n
    \  architecture] to guarantee the worst case delay of DetNet flow\n   while allow
    sharing among best effort traffic. Data flow\n   information model is important
    to the DetNet work that it defines\n   information be used by flow establishment
    and control protocols.\n   This document describes and DetNet flow information
    model that\n   represents the flow identifier, traffic description information
    so\n   that can make resource reservation and provide differentiate\n   service.\n\n\t
