abstract:
- content: "<p>Capacity planning is the continuous art of forecasting traffic load
    and failures to evolve the network topology, its capacity, and its routing to
    meet a defined Service-Level Agreement (SLA). This document takes a holistic view
    of network capacity planning and identifies the role of traffic accounting in
    network operation and capacity planning, without creating any additional states
    in the SR fabric.</p>"
