abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains the information\n
    \  of Label Switched Path (LSP) and resource availability within a\n   domain,
    so multiple stateful PCEs are able to provide traffic\n   engineering inter-domain
    routing through cooperating with each other.\n   This document introduces the
    applicability of cooperative stateful\n   PCE for establishing inter-domain inter-vendor
    LSP which is initiated\n   by PCE.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
