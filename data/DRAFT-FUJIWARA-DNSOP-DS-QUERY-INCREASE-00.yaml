abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A significant increase of periodic DS queries is observed at
    top\n   level domain (TLD) DNS servers.  Currently, almost all of periodic DS\n
    \  queries come from DNSSEC validators and are queries for unsigned\n   delegations.
    \ The reason of the increase is low NCACHE TTL value and\n   DS nonexistence.
    \ This phenomena is DNSSEC protocol and DNS parameter\n   issue.  DS queries will
    increase as DNSSEC validators will increase.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
