abstract:
- content: "<p>This document makes recommendations regarding the use of unique origin
    autonomous system numbers (ASNs) per node for globally anycasted critical infrastructure
    services in order to provide routing system discriminators for a given anycasted
    prefix. Network management and monitoring techniques, or other operational mechanisms,
    may employ this new discriminator in whatever manner best accommodates their operating
    environment. This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.</p>"
