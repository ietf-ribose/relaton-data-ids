abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the RTP payload format for the Mixed\n
    \  Excitation Linear Prediction Enhanced (MELPe) speech coder algorithm\n   developed
    by Atlanta Signal Processing (ASPI), Texas Instruments\n   (TI), SignalCom (now
    Microsoft) and Thales Communications with noise\n   preprocessor contributions
    from AT&amp;T under contract with NSA/DOD as\n   international NATO Standard STANAG
    4591.  All three different speech\n   encoding rates and sample frames sizes are
    included.  Comfort noise\n   procedures and packet loss concealment are detailed.
    \ Also, within\n   the document there are included necessary details for the use
    of MELP\n   with SDP.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
