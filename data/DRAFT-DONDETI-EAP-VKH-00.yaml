abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a visited domain key hierarchy derived
    from\n   the extended master session key (EMSK) from EAP to facilitate visited\n
    \  domain key management for various purposes including fast handovers\n   and
    visited domain services.  The visited domain key hierarchy avoids\n   the latency
    associated with communicating with the home domain as in\n   case of a full EAP
    method run or even in a single round trip as with\n   the EAP efficient reauthentication
    scheme, and that is especially\n   desirable when the protocol is in the critical
    path of a handover.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
