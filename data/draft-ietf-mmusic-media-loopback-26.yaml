abstract:
- content: <p>The wide deployment of Voice over IP (VoIP), Text and Video over IP
    services has introduced new challenges in managing and maintaining real-time voice/text/video
    quality, reliability, and overall performance. In particular, media delivery is
    an area that needs attention. One method of meeting these challenges is monitoring
    the media delivery performance by looping media back to the transmitter. This
    is typically referred to as "active monitoring" of services. Media loopback is
    especially popular in ensuring the quality of transport to the edge of a given
    VoIP, Real-time Text or Video over IP service. Today in networks that deliver
    real-time media, short of running 'ping' and 'traceroute' to the edge, administrators
    are left without the necessary tools to actively monitor, manage, and diagnose
    quality issues with their service. The extension defined herein adds new SDP media
    types and attributes, which enable establishment of media sessions where the media
    is looped back to the transmitter. Such media sessions will serve as monitoring
    and troubleshooting tools by providing the means for measurement of more advanced
    VoIP, Real-time Text and Video over IP performance metrics.</p>
