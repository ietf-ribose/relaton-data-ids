abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an Asynchronous Management Protocol (AMP) in
    conformance with the Asynchronous Management Architecture (AMA). The AMP provides
    monitoring and configuration services between managing devices (Managers) and
    managed devices (Agents), some of which may operate on the far side of high-delay
    or high-disruption links. The AMP reduces the number of transmitted bytes, operates
    without sessions or (concurrent) two-way links, and functions autonomously when
    there is no timely contact with a network operator. The AMP accomplishes this
    without requiring mobile code.</p>"
