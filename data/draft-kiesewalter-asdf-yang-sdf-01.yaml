abstract:
- content: "<p>YANG and SDF are two languages for modelling the interaction with and
    the data interchanged with devices in the network. As their areas of application
    (network management, IoT, resp.) overlap, it is useful to be able to translate
    between the two. The present specification provides information about how models
    in one of the two languages can be translated into the other. This specification
    is not intended to be normative, but to help with creating translators.</p>"
