abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A major challenge with RFC 4474-style identity assertions has
    been\n   that SIP operates in highly mediated and interworked environments.\n
    \  SIP requests may pass through gateways, policy enforcement devices or\n   other
    entities that receive SIP requests and effectively act as user\n   agents, re-initiating
    a request.  In these circumstances,\n   intermediaries may recreate the fields
    protected by the RFC4474\n   signature, making end-to end integrity impossible.
    \ This document\n   describes a mechanism for two compliant endpoints to exchange\n
    \  authentication data even in the face of intermediaries which remove\n   all
    additional call signaling meta-data or which translate from SIP\n   into protocols
    incapable of understanding identity meta-data (e.g.,\n   where one side is the
    PSTN).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
