abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently BGP protocol can carry reachability information for\n
    \  multiple Address Families (AFI) and Subsequence Address Families\n   (SAFI)
    using the Multiprotocol Extension[RFC2858], but it is limited\n   to grouping
    of information based on the AFI/SAFI hierarchy.\n\n   This document describes
    a mechanism to group and exchange prefix\n   information based on properties other
    than just the AFI/\n   SAFI[RFC2858].  The mechanism is flexible and backwards
    compatible\n   with the current methods for exchanging prefixes and hence does
    not\n   require any changes to the the protocol formats.  It introduces a new\n
    \  capability that allows two BGP speakers negotiate during the BGP OPEN\n   phase
    in order to define what each AFI/SAFI means.\n\n   In other words, the concept
    of a 'context' is defined and each such\n   'context' can be mapped to an AFI/SAFI.
    \ The context to AFI/SAFI\n   mapping is only relevant to the BGP peers of the
    BGP session and\n   hence offers great flexibility in how 2 BGP speakers can choose
    to\n   group and exchange prefix information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
