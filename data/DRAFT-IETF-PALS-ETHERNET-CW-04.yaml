abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The pseudowire (PW) encapsulation of Ethernet, as defined in
    RFC4448,\n   specifies that the use of the control word (CW) is optional.  In
    the\n   absence of the CW an Ethernet pseudowire packet can be misidentified\n
    \  as an IP packet by a label switching router (LSR).  This in turn may\n   lead
    to the selection of the wrong equal-cost-multi-path (ECMP) path\n   for the packet,
    leading in turn to the misordering of packets.  This\n   problem has become more
    serious due to the deployment of equipment\n   with Ethernet MAC addresses that
    start with 0x4 or 0x6.  The use of\n   the Ethernet PW CW addresses this problem.
    \ This document recommends\n   the use of the Ethernet pseudowire control word
    in all but\n   exceptional circumstances.\n\n   This document updates RFC4448.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
