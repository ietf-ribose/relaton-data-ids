abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER request, as defined
    by\n   RFC3515, triggers an implicit SIP-Specific Event Notification\n   framework
    subscription.  Conflating the start of the subscription\n   with handling the
    REFER request makes negotiating SUBSCRIBE\n   extensions impossible, and complicates
    avoiding SIP dialog sharing.\n   This document defines extensions to REFER to
    remove the implicit\n   subscription and, if desired, replace it with an explicit
    one.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
