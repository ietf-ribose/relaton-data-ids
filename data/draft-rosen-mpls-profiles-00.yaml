abstract:
  content: "<p>The MPLS protocol specifications provide a large number of options,and
    it can be difficult to know exactly which protocol messages,objects, and procedures
    must be supported in order to provide someparticular application of MPLS, or in
    order to interoperate with someother implementation. This document specifies a
    number of MPLS'Profiles'. Each Profile is a subset of the full MPLS functionality,specified
    in enough detail to ensure that two implementations of agiven Profile will interoperate.
    This document also specifies whichProfiles may be used for which purposes. In
    the future, it is hopedthat specifications for the applications of MPLS will specify
    theProfiles that must be implemented in order to support theapplication.</p>"
