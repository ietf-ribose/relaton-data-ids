abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many kinds of mobile user equipments may want to join or create\nwireless
    local area network. Today connectivity is usually based on\nusing the IP address
    as the identifier for the device. However, such\nkinds of devices do not necessary
    have a static IP address. Some\nautoconfiguration procedures are developed for
    fixed networks, but\nthose procedures have requirements that Manet does not satisfy.
    For\nad hoc networks, some IPv6 address autoconfiguration solutions are\ndeveloped
    during recent years.\nIn this document, an autoconfiguration mechanism for mobile
    ad hoc \nnetwork nodes will be described. A hardware based addressing will be\npresented
    as one approach to create a temporary IPv6 address.\nFurthermore, a solution for
    minimizing Duplicate Address Detection\nprocedures while generating a globally
    unique IPv6 address will be\nexplained.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
