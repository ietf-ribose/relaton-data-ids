abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects
    to\n   Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different\n
    \  domains, the current trend is to develop a unified IoT platform so\n   that
    objects can be made accessible to applications across\n   organizations and domains.
    \ Towards this goal, quite a few proposals\n   have been made to build a unified
    IoT platform as an overlay on\n   today's Internet.  Such an overlay solution,
    however, is inadequate\n   to address the important challenges posed by a unified
    IoT system,\n   especially in terms of mobility, scalability, and communication\n
    \  reliability, due to the inherent inefficiencies of the current\n   Internet.
    \ To address this problem, we propose to build a unified IoT\n   platform based
    on the Information Centric Network (ICN) architecture,\n   which we call ICN-IoT.
    \ ICN-IoT leverages the salient features of\n   ICN, and thus provides seamless
    mobility support, scalability, and\n   efficient content and service delivery.\n\n
    \  In this proposal, we first present a few popular IoT scenarios in\n   smart
    homes, smart grid, smart transportation, and smart healthcare.\n   Then we identify
    a list of important requirements with the unified\n   IoT architecture that promises
    to support tens of billions of\n   objects.  After discussing the weaknesses of
    the current overlay-\n   based IoT solution, we propose an ICN-based solution,
    ICN-IoT, which\n   can sufficiently satisfy these requirements.  We present an
    example\n   ICN-IoT architecture and discuss how it supports efficient data\n
    \  discovery, data processing and data distribution.  Finally, we show\n   that
    ICN-IoT efficiently supports context- based scenarios, which are\n   very common
    for many IoT applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
