abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The default DNS transport uses UDP on port 53.  There are many\n
    \  motivations why users or operators may prefer to avoid sending DNS\n   traffic
    in this way.  A common solution is to use port 80 or 443;\n   with plain TCP,
    TLS-encrypted TCP, or full HTTP(S).  This memo\n   reviews the possible approaches
    and delivers some useful information\n   for developers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
