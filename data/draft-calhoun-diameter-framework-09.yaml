abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Current Internet Service Providers (ISPs) scale their networks byusing
    the RADIUS protocol, which provides user Authentication,Authorization and Accounting
    (AAA) of Dial-up PPP clients. The recentwork done in the Roaming Operations (ROAMOPS)
    Working Group was toinvestigate whether RADIUS could be used in a roaming network,
    andconcluded that RADIUS was ill-suited for inter-domain purposes.The IETF has
    formed a new NAS Requirements Working Group, and part oftheir charter is to document
    the next generation NAS' AAArequirements. Recently, the Mobile-IP Working Group
    also documentedtheir own AAA requirements that would help Mobile IP scale forInter-Domain
    mobility.The DIAMETER protocol is a follow-on to the RADIUS protocol. DIAMETERaddresses
    the known RADIUS deficiencies, and is intended for use withthe NASREQ and Mobile
    IP application space.</p>"
