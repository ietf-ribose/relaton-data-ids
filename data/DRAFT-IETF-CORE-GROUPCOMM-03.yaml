abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained devices.
    \ It is\n   anticipated that constrained devices will often naturally operate
    in\n   groups (e.g. in a building automation scenario all lights in a given\n
    \  room may need to be switched on/off as a group).  This document\n   defines
    how the CoAP protocol should be used in a group communication\n   context.  An
    approach for using CoAP on top of IP multicast is\n   detailed for both constrained
    and un-constrained networks.  Also,\n   various use causes and corresponding protocol
    flows are provided to\n   illustrate important concepts.  Finally, guidance is
    provided for\n   deployment in various network topologies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
