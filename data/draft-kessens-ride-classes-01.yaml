abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the attributes and classes that will be used
    in the internet Registry Information Database Exchange formats (RIDE). For now
    it is mostly limited to 'domain' and 'contact' classes since they were widely
    considered as most urgent. Encoding that will be used for the objects and ways
    to find and access objects are beyond the scope of this document. This will be
    addressed in the future in separate drafts.</p>"
