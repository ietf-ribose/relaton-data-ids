abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In support of Segment Routing (SR) for an MPLS data plane routing\n
    \  protocols advertise a variety of identifiers used to define the\n   segments
    which direct forwarding of packets.  In cases where the\n   information advertised
    by a given protocol instance is either\n   internally inconsistent or conflicts
    with advertisements from another\n   protocol instance a means of achieving consistent
    forwarding behavior\n   in the network is required.  This document defines the
    policies used\n   to resolve these occurrences.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
