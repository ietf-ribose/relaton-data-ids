abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This documents defines an extension to the E.164 Number Mapping\n
    \  (ENUM) algorithm by adding a mapping step which indicates where the\n   ENUM
    tree for a specific ENUM application is located.  A new DNS\n   record (IEBL,
    the Infrastructure ENUM Branch Location record) is\n   defined which provides
    an interim solution for the Infrastructure\n   ENUM tree location.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
