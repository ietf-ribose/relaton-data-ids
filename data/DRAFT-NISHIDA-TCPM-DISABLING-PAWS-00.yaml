abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   PAWS provides protection against old duplicated segments caused
    by\n   wrapped sequence or earlier incarnated connections.  One drawback of\n
    \  PAWS is that it requires to place timestamp option in all segments,\n   which
    consumes 10-12 bytes in the option space of TCP.  In addition,\n   since PAWS
    just checks if timestamps is older or not, the protection\n   logic is not very
    strong against malicious attacks or cannot work\n   properly in some situations.
    \ On the other hand, some other\n   technologies which can provide stronger protections
    than PAWS are\n   becoming available these days.  In this document, we propose
    to\n   utilize other protection mechanisms as replacements of PAWS when they\n
    \  are available.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
