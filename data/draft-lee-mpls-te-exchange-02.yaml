abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The current link state routing protocols flood link states to allrouters
    so that routers have the information required to compute theshortest paths to
    route packets on a hop by hop basis. However, forthe purpose of establishing MPLS
    paths, constraint path computationis only performed at certain nodes, for instance,
    at the node wherepath setup is triggered or at the head-end of a loosely routedsegment
    that crosses a network (or area) boundary. In addition, itnot possible to have
    all required constraints present in all nodes ina network, nor is it always feasible
    for nodes setting up paths tocompute the constraint paths themselves, a notable
    example is when apath traverses network or area boundary. These reasons motivate
    asolution using a 'subset' of routers (called route exchangers), tocollect constraint
    information and exchange it with other routeexchangers. Route exchangers store
    traffic engineering link statesand other types of constraint information and compute
    on demand, theexplicit routes required by routers establishing paths. Hence, linkstate
    information need only be distributed to the subset of nodesthat help compute constraint
    paths in the network.</p>"
