abstract:
- content: "<p>NB: This document was submitted in 2013 and then discontinued. It is
    now submitted to T2TRG for discussion on the replication of the Resource Directory.
    References and many operations would need updating. Architecture and functions
    should remain the same. In some M2M scenarios, it is convenient to offer non-centralized
    alternatives for discovery and rendezvous. This document defines a Distributed
    Resource Directory (DRD) for Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Distribution
    is achieved by means of a structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay. The DHT-based
    P2P overlay provides discovery, rendezvous and caching services for CoAP End-points
    as well as HTTP proxy service for Web clients.</p>"
