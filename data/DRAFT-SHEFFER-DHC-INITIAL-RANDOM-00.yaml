abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some network devices get little or no entropy from their underlying\n
    \  operating systems when they are first started.  As a result,\n   cryptographic
    applications started before there is sufficient entropy\n   in the operating system's
    pool can be initialized into a state that\n   can be exploited by an attacker.
    \ This document defines a DHCP\n   extension that can provide the operating system
    of a network device\n   with some initial randomness that can only be known by
    an attacker\n   who is on the same network segment as the device and its DHCP
    server.\n   The operating system can mix this random input into its random pool\n
    \  early in the boot procedure and thus have more entropy available when\n   cryptographic
    applications start.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
