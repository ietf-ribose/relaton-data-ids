abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet draft enhances cellular-IP mobility protocol with
    a\nContext Transfer mechanism aiming to further optimise the handoff \noperation
    in mobile networks. Within a cellular-IP domain, during the\nhandoff from one
    cellular-IP base station to another, cellular-IP\npackets could be  used to initiate
    and transfer authorised context\nfrom the previous cellular-IP base station via
    the cellular-IP\ngateway to the new cellular-IP base station. This draft presents
    how \nthe context transfer extension introduced could facilitate in\nreducing
    latency and packet loss by avoiding the signalling required \nbetween the mobile
    node and the new base station  in  re-establishing\nthe desired state information.\n\t
