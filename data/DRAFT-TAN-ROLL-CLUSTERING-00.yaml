abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks
    (RPL) is\n       one of the emerging routing standards for multi-hop Wireless
    Sensor\n       Networks (WSNs). RPL is based on the construction of a Destination-\n
    \      Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG), which offers a loop-free\n       topology
    to route data packets. But due to the tree topology, the\n       upper nodes in
    tree topology are easy to run out of energy. Moreover,\n       the hop count and
    ETX are the only route metrics for which standards\n       related to their usage
    in RPL are published. Due to the seriously\n       resource-constrained character,
    we take nodes' residual energy into\n       account. Here we present an RPL-based
    clustering scheme and detailed\n       description of Objective Function.\n\n\t
