abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent progress in ITU-T Recommendation G.709 standardization
    has\n   introduced new ODU containers (ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex) and\n   enhanced
    Optical Transport Networking (OTN) flexibility. Several\n   recent documents have
    proposed ways to modify GMPLS signaling\n   protocols to support these new OTN
    features.\n\n   It is important that a single solution is developed for use in
    GMPLS\n   signaling and routing protocols. This solution must support ODUk\n   multiplexing
    capabilities, address all of the new features, be\n   acceptable to all equipment
    vendors, and be extensible considering\n   continued OTN evolution.\n\n   This
    document describes the extensions to the Generalized Multi-\n   Protocol Label
    Switching (GMPLS) signaling to control the evolving\n   Optical Transport Networks
    (OTN) addressing ODUk multiplexing and new\n   features including ODU0, ODU4,
    ODU2e and ODUflex.\n\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
