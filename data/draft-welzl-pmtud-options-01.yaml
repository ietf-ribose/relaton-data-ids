abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes an experimental enhancement of Path MTUDiscovery
    that has the potential of reducing loss, speeding upconvergence, reducing load
    in routers which would otherwise need togenerate a large amount of ICMP messages,
    and alleviating certainadditional problems (interactions with tunnels, Black HoleDetection).
    The idea is to use an IP Option which queries routers fortheir MTU before starting
    a Path MTU Discovery process. The resultretrieved in this is used as an upper
    limit for Path MTU Discovery.To this end, it is fed back to the source either
    at the packetizationlayer (recommended) or at the IP layer.</p>"
