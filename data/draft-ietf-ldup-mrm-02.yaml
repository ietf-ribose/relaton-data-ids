abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of standards for LDAP replication is to allow interoperable
    replication among products from many different vendors. Defining the mechanism
    to move data among replicas is a necessary part of this work, but management of
    the replicated environment must also be standardized for replication to be truly
    interoperable. This document presents the replication management functions that
    must be performed. Whenever possible, these functions are defined in terms of
    existing LDAP functionality using existing LDAP operations and existing data definitions.
    In some cases, changes or additions to the existing model are required, and specifications
    for these changes are included in this document</p>"
