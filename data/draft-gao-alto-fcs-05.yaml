abstract:
- content: "<p>ALTO cost maps and endpoint cost services map a source-destination
    pair into a cost value. However, current filter specifications, which define the
    set of source-destination pairs in an ALTO query, have two limitations: 1) Only
    very limited address types are supported (IPv4 and IPv6), which is not sufficient
    to uniquely identify a flow in networks with fine-grained routing, such as the
    emerging Software Defined Networks. 2) The base ALTO protocol only defines filters
    enumerating all sources and all destinations, leading to redundant information
    in the response. To address these two issues, this document extends the base ALTO
    protocol with a more fine-grained filter type which allows ALTO clients to select
    only the concerned source-destination pairs, and a more expressive address space
    which allows ALTO clients to make queries beyond the limited IP addresses.</p>"
