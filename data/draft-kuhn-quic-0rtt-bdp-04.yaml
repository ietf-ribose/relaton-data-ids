abstract:
- content: "<p>The time-to-service duration depends on both peers exchange optimization.
    The peer initiating the connection may not be the one which send data first. Moreover,
    clients may be resource-limited, behind a low bandwidth or connected to a long-RTT
    network and may need to adapt dynamically to improve data reception. Currently,
    each side has its proprietary solution to measure and to store path characteristics.
    Having a standard way to share these parameters should improve the adaptation
    to a non standard path characteristics. QUIC v1 specification already reflects
    this approach. Having a symmetrical control of the optimization should reduce
    protocol ossification. This memo proposes the sharing of the characteristics of
    the path amongst the peer to reduce HTTP3 time-to-service for non default transport
    situation.</p>"
