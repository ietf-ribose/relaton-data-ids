abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) is one of the foreseen future\nforms
    of spamming that SIP open-wide networks may have to handle.\nSPIT also has more
    impact on users than email spam since it is more\nintrusive.  Email as a store-and-forward
    communication mechanism\nallows for several filtering mechanisms to be applied
    to the full\ncontent before being presented to the user.  Session Initiation\nProtocol
    (SIP) interaction is, in contrast, real-time communication\nand therefore does
    not provide much information prior to the\ntransmission of the content, making
    it both harder to filter and more\nannoying to users.  The responsibility for
    filtering, blocking calls,\nor taking any other preventive action can belong to
    different\nelements in the call flow and may depend on various factors.  This\ndocument
    discusses the requirements to define authorization policies\nthat should allow
    end users or other parties to setup anti-SPIT\npolicies for triggering these actions.
    \ These policies typically\nmatch a particular SIP communication pattern based
    on a number of\nattributes.  The range of attributes includes information provided,\nfor
    example, by the SIP protocol itself, by the SIP identity\nmechanism, by information
    carried within SAML assertions or by\nreputation systems of social networks.\n\t
