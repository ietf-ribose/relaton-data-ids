abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing is a source routing paradigm that explicitly\n
    \  indicates the forwarding path for packets at the ingress node. An\n   SR policy
    is a set of candidate SR paths consisting of one or more\n   segment lists with
    necessary path attributes. The headend of an SR\n   Policy may learn multiple
    candidate paths for an SR Policy.\n   Candidate paths may be learned via a number
    of different mechanisms,\n   e.g., CLI, NetConf, PCEP, or BGP.\n\n   The Path
    Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\n   functions in support of
    traffic engineering in Multi Protocol Label\n   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n\n   Currently, when a controller uses BGP to deploy an
    SR Policy, there\n   is no way to encode PCE delegation related options. The only
    way to\n   import a PCE delegation is through local configuration management,\n
    \  e.g., Netconf, CLI or gRPC.\n\n   This document defines extensions to BGP to
    distribute PCE\n   delegation information within an SR policy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
