abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to include trust into the ASTM Remote ID
    specification defined in ASTM F3411 under Broadcast Remote ID (RID). It defines
    a few message schemes (sent within the Authentication Message) that can be used
    to authenticate past messages sent by a unmanned aircraft (UA) and provide proof
    of UA trustworthiness even in the absence of Internet connectivity at the receiving
    node.</p>"
