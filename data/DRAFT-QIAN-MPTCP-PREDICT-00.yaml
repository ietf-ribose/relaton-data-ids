abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath TCP (MPTCP) adds the capability of using multiple
    paths to\n   a regular TCP session, which is quite suitable for integrated network\n
    \  scenarios where multiple paths almost always exist.  However, link\n   handover
    and link on-off switching happen frequently in network\n   systems that integrate
    different systems (especially the systems that\n   continually move), which defeats
    the quality of MPTCP connections.\n   Information about the link handover and
    on-off switching in above-\n   mentioned scenarios can be predicted in advance,
    but MPTCP is not\n   capable of utilizing the prediction information.  This document\n
    \  suggests MPTCP be extended with the capacity of obtaining and\n   utilizing
    the prediction information.  Furthermore, the document\n   describes one possible
    way to enhance MPTCP with prediction\n   information, which proposes a modified
    MPTCP scheduler utilizing link\n   on-off prediction information.\n\n\t </p>\n
