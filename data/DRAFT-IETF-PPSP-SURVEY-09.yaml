abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a survey of some of the most popular
    Peer-to-\n   Peer (P2P) streaming applications on the Internet.  The main\n   selection
    criteria have been popularity and availability of\n   information on operation
    details at writing time.  In doing this,\n   selected applications are not reviewed
    as a whole, but they are\n   reviewed with main focus on the signaling and control
    protocol used\n   to establish and maintain overlay connections among peers and
    to\n   advertise and download streaming content.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
