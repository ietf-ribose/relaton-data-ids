abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new URL scheme, 'eid'.  This scheme
    provides\n   a mechanism by which the local application can reference data that\n
    \  has been obtained by other, non-URL scheme means.  The scheme is\n   intended
    to provide a general escape mechanism to allow access to\n   information for applications
    that are too specialized to justify\n   their own schemas.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
