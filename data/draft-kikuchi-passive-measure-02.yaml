abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a passive measurement method for one-way end-to-
    end quality. This method reports both whether a flow of packets is in-sequence
    or not and error types on detecting out-of-sequence. The method consumes small
    resource therefore it can be adapted to many protocols that have sequence number
    field.</p>"
