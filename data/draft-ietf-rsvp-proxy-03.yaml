abstract:
  content: "\t <t>RSVP has been extended in several directions [POLICY], [RSVP-APPID],[DCLASS],
    [AGGRRSVP], [RSVPDIFF]. These extensions have broadened theapplicability of RSVP
    characterizing it as a signaling protocolusable both inside and outside the Integrated
    Services [INTSERV]model.With the addition of the 'Null Service Type' [NULLSERV],
    RSVP isalso being adopted by mission critical applications that require someform
    of prioritized service, but cannot quantify their resourcerequirements. In cases
    where RSVP cannot travel end-to-end, theseapplications may still benefit from
    reservations that are not trulyend-to-end, but that are 'proxied' by a network
    node on the data pathbetween the sender and the receiver(s). RSVP Receiver Proxy
    is an extension to the RSVP message processing(not to the protocol itself) in
    which an intermediate network nodeoriginates the Resv message on behalf of the
    receiver(s) identifiedby the Path message.</p>"
