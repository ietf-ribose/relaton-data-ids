abstract:
- content: '<p>Content splicing is a process that replaces the content of a main multimedia
    stream with other multimedia content and that delivers the substitutive multimedia
    content to the receivers for a period of time. The splicer is designed to handle
    RTP splicing and needs to know when to start and end the splicing. This memo defines
    two RTP/RTCP extensions to indicate the splicing-related information to the splicer:
    an RTP header extension that conveys the information "in band" and an RTP Control
    Protocol (RTCP) packet that conveys the information out of band.</p>'
