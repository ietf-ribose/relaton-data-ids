abstract:
- content: "<p>Well-known issues with multicast have prevented the deployment of multicast
    in 802.11 [dot11], [mc-props], [mc-prob-stmt], and other local-area wireless environments.
    This document offers guidance on known limitations and problems with wireless
    multicast. Also described are certain multicast enhancement features that have
    been specified by the IETF and by IEEE 802 for wireless media, as well as some
    operational choices that can be taken to improve the performace of the network.
    Finally, some recommendations are provided about the usage and combination of
    these features and operational choices.</p>"
