abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to deliver real-time\n
    \  content and, along with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), forms the\n   control
    channel between the sender and receiver.  However, RTP and\n   RTCP assume a single
    delivery path between the sender and receiver\n   and make decisions based on
    the measured characteristics of this\n   single path.  Increasingly, endpoints
    are becoming multi-homed, which\n   means that they are connected via multiple
    Internet paths.  Network\n   utilization can be improved when endpoints use multiple
    parallel\n   paths for communication.  The resulting increase in reliability and\n
    \  throughput can also enhance the user experience.  This document\n   extends
    the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) so that a single\n   session can take advantage
    of the availability of multiple paths\n   between two endpoints.\n\n\t </p>\n
