abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document optionally updates [RFC6378], \"MPLS Transport
    Profile\n   (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection\", to change non-revertive operation to
    be\n   aligned with the behavior defined in [RFC4427] and in an effort to\n   satisfy
    the ITU-T's protection switching requirements.  An operator\n   command, Manual
    Switch to Working (MS-W) is also included to revert\n   traffic to the working
    path in non-revertive operation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
