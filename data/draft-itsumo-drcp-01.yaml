abstract:
  content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a frameworkfor
    passing configuration information to hosts [DHC]. DHCP was,however, designed for
    hosts on a fixed LAN, not for nodes roamingamong commercial wireless networks.
    A Mobile IP [MIP] Foreign Agentgives some powerful plug and play capability for
    roaming hosts,especially when combined with some recent proposals [e.g., MIPA,MIPC,
    MIPD, MIPN, HAW, CEL, TIA]. Mobile IP functionality, howeveris not always needed
    and for some dynamic networks it may beundesirable to use Foreign Agents. This
    draft proposes a lightweightdynamic configuration protocol, called the Dynamic
    Registration andConfiguration Protocol (DRCP). DRCP borrows heavily from DHCP
    andcan switch to using DHCP protocol if only DHCP servers are present inthe network;
    but adds features critical to roaming users. Mostimportantly, DRCP allows rapid
    configuration by moving addressconsistency checking from the critical path. Other
    new featuresallow: a) clients to know when to get a new address independent ofthe
    layer-2 access technology, b) efficient use of scarce wirelessbandwidth, c) clients
    to be routers, d) dynamic addition or deletionof address pools to any DRCP node,
    and e) message exchange withoutbroadcast.</p>"
