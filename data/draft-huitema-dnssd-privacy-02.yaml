abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS-SD allows discovery of services published in DNS or MDNS. The publication
    normally discloses information about the device publishing the services. There
    are use cases where devices want to communicate without disclosing their identity,
    for example two mobile devices visiting the same hotspot. We propose to solve
    this problem by a two-stage approach. In the first stage, hosts discover Private
    Discovery Service Instances via DNS-SD using special formats to protect their
    privacy. These service instances correspond to Private Discovery Servers running
    on peers. In the second stage, hosts directly query these Private Discovery Servers
    via DNS-SD over TLS. A pairwise shared secret necessary to establish these connections
    is only known to hosts authorized by a pairing system.</p>"
