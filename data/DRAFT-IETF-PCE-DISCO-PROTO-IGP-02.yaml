abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are various circumstances in which it is highly desirable
    for a \nPath Computation Client (PCC) to be able to dynamically and \nautomatically
    discover a set of Path Computation Element(s) (PCE), \nalong with some of information
    that can be used for PCE selection. \nWhen the PCE is an LSR participating to
    the IGP, or even a server \nparticipating passively to the IGP, a simple and efficient
    way for \nPCE discovery consists of relying on IGP flooding. For that purpose
    \nthis document defines OSPF and ISIS extensions for the advertisement \nof PCE
    Discovery information within an IGP area or within the entire \nrouting domain.\n\t
