abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an approach to provide extended LAN and
    VLAN\nservices across IP routed networks.  This is done by adding a virtual\nbridge
    identifier to packets destined to the remote location and then\nencapsulating
    this new packet in IP.  This packet is then source \nrouted across the IP network
    to a Virtual Bridge Tunnel terminating\nrouter where the header is stripped off
    and the virtual bridge\nidentifier is used to forward the original packet out
    the \ncorresponding tunnel interface.\nWithin the IP network the packets are treated
    like any other IP packets\nand as such identical mechanisms such as security and
    quality of \nservice can be applied.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
