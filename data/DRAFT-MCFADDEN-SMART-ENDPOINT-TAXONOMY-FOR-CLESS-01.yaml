abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A separate document [I-D:draft-taddei-smart-cless-introduction]\n
    \  (CLESS) attempts to establish the capabilities and limitations of\n   endpoint-only
    security solutions and explore potential alternative\n   approaches. That document
    discusses endpoints in general terms. It\n   has been suggested that there are
    classes of endpoints that have\n   different characteristics. Those classes may
    have completely\n   different threat landscapes and the endpoints may have completely\n
    \  different security capabilities. In support of the work on CLESS,\n   this
    document provides a taxonomy of endpoints that is intended to\n   provide a foundation
    for further work on CLESS and research on\n   approaches to providing endpoint
    security alternatives in a diverse\n   group of settings.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
