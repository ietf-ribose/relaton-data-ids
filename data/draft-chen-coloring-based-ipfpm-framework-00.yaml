abstract:
- content: <p>By setting one unused bit of the IP header of packets to "color" the
    packets into different color blocks, it naturally gives a way to measure the real
    packet loss and delay without inserting any extra OAM packets. This is called
    coloring based IP performance measurement. This document specifies a framework
    and protocol for this "coloring" based IP performance measurement.</p>
