- content: "<p>This document describes the testing result of a network utilizing a
    Mapping of Address and Port using Translation (MAP-T) double translation solution;
    it provides an overview of user applications' behavior with a shared IPv4 address.
    The MAP-T software is from CERNET Center and the test environment is on the NIC.br
    network with real and virtualized machines.</p>"
