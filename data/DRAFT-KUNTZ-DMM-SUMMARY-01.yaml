abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As stated in the MEXT charter, the working group will \"work
    on\n   operational considerations on setting up Mobile IPv6 networks so that\n
    \  traffic is distributed in an optimal way\".  This topic, referred to\n   as
    Distributed Mobility Management (DMM), has motivated the\n   submission of multiple
    problem statement and solution drafts.  This\n   document aims at summarizing
    the current status of the DMM effort,\n   mainly focusing on Mobile IPv6-based
    solutions, in order to initiate\n   more discussions within the working group.\n\n\t
