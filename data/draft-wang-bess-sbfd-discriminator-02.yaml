abstract:
- content: "<p>Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD) is a simplified
    BFD mechanism. It eliminates most negotiation aspects and provides advantages
    such as fast configuration injection. S-BFD is especially useful in multi-homing
    PE scenarios and reduces resource overheads on the dual-homing PEs. Although S-BFD
    is simpler than BFD, a large number of manual configurations are required when
    there are a large number of PEs. This document provides the mechanism of distributing
    S-BFD discriminators with VPN service routes, which simplifies S-BFD deployment
    for VPN services.</p>"
