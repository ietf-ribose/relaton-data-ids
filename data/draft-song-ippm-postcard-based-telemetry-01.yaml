abstract:
- content: "<p>The Postcard-Based Telemetry (PBT) allows network OAM applications
    to collect telemetry data about any user packet. Unlike similar techniques such
    as in-situ OAM (IOAM), PBT does not require user packets to carry the telemetry
    data, but directly exports the telemetry data from the data collecting node to
    a collector through separated OAM packets called postcards. Two variations of
    PBT are described: one requires inserting an instruction header to user packets
    to guide the data collection and the other only marks the user packets or configure
    the flow filter to invoke the data collection. PBT provides an alternative to
    IOAM and address several implementation and deployment challenges of it.</p>"
