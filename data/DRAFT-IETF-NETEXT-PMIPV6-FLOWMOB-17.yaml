abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node to connect to the same
    Proxy\n   Mobile IPv6 domain through different interfaces.  This document\n   describes
    extensions to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol that are\n   required to support
    network based flow mobility over multiple\n   physical interfaces.\n\n   This
    document updates RFC 5213.  The extensions described in this\n   document consist
    of the operations performed by the local mobility\n   anchor and the mobile access
    gateway to manage the prefixes assigned\n   to the different interfaces of the
    mobile node, as well as how the\n   forwarding policies are handled by the network
    to ensure consistent\n   flow mobility management.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
