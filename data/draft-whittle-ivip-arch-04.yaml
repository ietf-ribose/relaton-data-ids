abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Ivip (Internet Vastly Improved Plumbing) is a Core-Edge Separationsolution
    to the routing scaling problem, for both IPv4 and IPv6. Itprovides portable address
    \"edge\" address space which is suitable formultihoming and inbound traffic engineering
    (TE) to end-user networksof all types and sizes - in a manner which imposes far
    less load onthe DFZ control plane than the only current method of achieving thesebenefits:
    separately advertised PI prefixes. Ivip includes twoextensions for ITR-to-ETR
    tunneling without encapsulation and thePath MTU Discovery problems which result
    from encapsulation - one forIPv4 and the other for IPv6. Both involve modifying
    the IP headerand require most DFZ routers to be upgraded. Ivip is a good basisfor
    the TTR (Translating Tunnel Router) approach to mobility, inwhich mobile hosts
    retain an SPI micronet of one or more IPv4addresses (or IPv6 /64s) no matter what
    addresses or access networkthey are using, including behind NAT and on SPI addresses.
    TTRmobility for both IPv4 and IPv6 involves generally optimal paths,works with
    unmodified correspondent hosts and supports allapplication protocols.</p>"
