abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo proposes a supplement to existing draft, RTP payload
    \nFormat for SVC Video. One new application, Multi-Screen is added. \nSVC is very
    suitable for Multi-Screen application, which has some \ndifferent characteristics
    from the existing applications in the \ncurrent draft. This proposal provides
    a paradigm and addresses \npotential issues and consideration.\n\t </p>\n      "
