abstract:
  content: "<p>Hosts and applications may benefit from the knowledge if an IPv6address
    is synthesized, which would mean a NAT64 is used to reach theIPv4 network or Internet.
    This document analyses a number ofproposed solutions for communicating whether
    the synthesis is takingplace, used address format, and the IPv6 prefix used by
    the NAT64 andDNS64. This enables both NAT64 avoidance and intentional utilizationby
    allowing local IPv6 address synthesis.</p>"
