abstract:
- content: <p>This document, part of the Lemonade Working Group, describes the Best
    Current Practice for streaming multimedia attachments received by a resource constrained
    and/or mobile device from a IMAP server. It allows such clients, which are limited
    in storage space and bandwidth, to play video and audio content which is attached
    to email messages. The document describes a profile for making use of the existing
    IMAP URLAUTH extension [2] and the "Netann" SIP Media Service as described in
    RFC 4240 [1].</p>
