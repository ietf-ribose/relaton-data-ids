abstract:
  content: "<p>ICANN is pushing the IDN TLD into the root server. Some IDN TLD hasthe
    variants. Currently, there are two proposals to implement theIDN TLD variants
    in the root servers:1, implement it with the DNAMErecord; 2, implement it with
    NS record. The IDN TLD variants may bereserved or activated. If the IDN TLD variants
    are activated, thesevariants will be allocated to the same TLD manager in order
    to avoidthe possible phishing problems. How to deal with the IDN TLD variantissue
    is a big challenge ahead of us. This document discusses theIDN TLD variants implementation
    issues related with DNAME and NSresource record way. This memo also gives a proposal
    about how toavoid the possible phishing problem after putting the IDN TLDvariants
    into the root.</p>"
