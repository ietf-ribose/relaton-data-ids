abstract:
- content: "<p>The OAuth 2.0 authorization flow for Single Page Applications (SPAs),
    often referred to as the assisted token flow, enables OAuth clients to request
    user authorization written in scripting languages, like JavaScript, with a simplified
    integration compared to the implicit grant type flow. Communication does not rely
    on redirection of the user agent, but instead leverages HTML's iframe element,
    child windows, and the postMessage interface. This communication is done using
    an additional endpoint, the assisted token endpoint, which this document defines.</p>"
