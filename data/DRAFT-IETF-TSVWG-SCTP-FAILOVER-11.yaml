abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SCTP supports multi-homing.  However, when the failover operation\n
    \  specified in RFC4960 is followed, there can be significant delay and\n   performance
    degradation in the data transfer path failover.  To\n   overcome this problem
    this document specifies a quick failover\n   algorithm (SCTP-PF) based on the
    introduction of a Potentially Failed\n   (PF) state in SCTP Path Management.\n\n
    \  The document also specifies a dormant state operation of SCTP.  This\n   dormant
    state operation is required to be followed by an SCTP-PF\n   implementation, but
    it may equally well be applied by a standard\n   RFC4960 SCTP implementation.\n\n
    \  Additionally, the document introduces an alternative switchback mode\n   called
    Permanent Failover that will be beneficial in some situations.\n   This mode of
    operation applies to both a standard RFC4960 SCTP\n   implementation as well as
    to a SCTP-PF implementation.\n\n   The procedures defined in the document require
    only minimal\n   modifications to the RFC4960 specification.  The procedures are\n
    \  sender-side only and do not impact the SCTP receiver.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
