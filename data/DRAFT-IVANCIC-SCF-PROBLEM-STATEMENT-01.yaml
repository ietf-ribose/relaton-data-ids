abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a problem statement for non-realtime\n
    \  communication between systems that are generally disconnected, which\n   require
    multiple network hops between source and destination, and\n   which may never
    be fully connected end-to-end at any given time.\n   This document describes a
    number of use cases that motivate having a\n   standard method to communicate
    between such systems, as multi-\n   organization and multi-vendor support and
    interoperability is highly\n   desirable.  These use cases include dismounted
    soldiers, sensorwebs,\n   medical devices, animal tracking, low-Earth-orbiting
    satellites and\n   data mule scenarios.  To avoid confusion in terminology when
    trying\n   to focus on the problem and requirements without bias towards\n   particular
    technical solutions, at this time, we refer to the\n   protocol instances that
    would support such communications as Store,\n   Carry, and Forwarding (SCF) agents,
    and refer to their activity as\n   SCF networking.  The concepts involved in SCF
    networking are not\n   entirely new and several facets of the problem have been
    solved in\n   multiple incompatible ways in existing or historic systems.  This\n
    \  document describes the core SCF problem and gives an assessment of\n   the
    ability to use existing technologies as solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
