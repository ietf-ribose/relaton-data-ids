abstract:
  content: <p>Current mobility solutions generally introduce an anchor point in thenetwork,
    e.g., HA in MIPv6, LMA in PMIPv6, GGSN in 3GPP. The anchorpoint is used to maintain
    the mapping between the stable IP address(e.g., Home address in MIPv6) and the
    current routable IP address(e.g., CoA in MIPv6). However, one of the trend in
    mobile networkevolution is to "flatten" mobility architecture by confining mobilitysupport
    in the access network, e.g. at the access routers level,keeping the rest of the
    network unaware of the mobility events andtheir support. This document discusses
    the deployment of current IPmobility mechanisms in such a flat architecture.</p>
