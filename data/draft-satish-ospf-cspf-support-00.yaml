abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The fundamental problem of Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF)computation
    which is typical of quality of service routing, is that theproblem is NP-hard.
    While standard approximation methods exist, theircomplexity may often be prohibitive
    in terms of scalability. Recentlypre-computation and caching techniques have been
    suggested [3] [4] toachieve better on-demand computation costs. The motivation
    for pre-computation and path caching is to reduce as much of the on-demandcomputational
    overhead as possible.To fully utilize Pre-computation and caching of QoS paths
    at a source,mechanisms should be available to verify the validity of either thefull
    or a partial subset of the pre-computed paths. The mechanismsshould preferably
    support verification of the consistency of eitherpartial or the full pre-computed
    path cache. In an IP control plane,CSPF is expected to work in conjunction with
    OSPF-TE [1] andRSVP-TE [2] protocols. To support CSPF algorithms that might want
    touse pre-computation and caching techniques rooted at a source or anidentified
    core in the network, we propose mechanisms to dynamicallysetup OSPF 'virtual links'
    and describe setting up of 'virtual areas'to enable OSPF based selective network
    monitoring and updation. Such anextension will help deploy flexible CSPF algorithms
    that might bedistributed, partially distributed or utilize pre-computation orcaching
    techniques.</p>"
