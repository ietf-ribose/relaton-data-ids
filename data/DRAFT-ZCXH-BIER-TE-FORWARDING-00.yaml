abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traffic Engineering for Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER-TE)\n
    \  shares part of architecture, definition and packet format with Bit\n   Index
    Explicit Replication (BIER) according to the introduction in\n   [I-D.eckert-bier-te-arch].
    \ But BIER-TE supports the traffic\n   engineering by explicit hop-by-hop forwarding
    and loose hop\n   forwarding of packets.\n\n   This document proposes a set of
    extensions to realize the BIER-TE\n   forwarding including the assignment of BitPositions
    to adjacencies\n   and the configuration of Bit Index Forwarding Table (BIFT).\n\n\t
