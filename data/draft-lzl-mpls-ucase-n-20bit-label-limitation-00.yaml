abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS label format and encoding method are specified in [RFC3032],
    the label value is represented using the 20-bit space and supports up to 1 million
    of instances. As exponential Internet growth continues there are specific network
    deployment scenarios where a clear need to represent more than one million entities
    is required. This document describes the MPLS deployment scenarios, use cases,
    and requirements, where the current 20-bit label will no longer be sufficient.</p>"
