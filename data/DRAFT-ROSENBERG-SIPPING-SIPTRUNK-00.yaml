abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The term \"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Trunk\" has become
    almost\ncommonplace amongst vendors and SIP providers.  Even though the\nnotion
    of a 'trunk' has a well defined meaning in circuit switched\nsystems, it has never
    been defined for SIP.  This document provides a\nformal definition for a SIP trunk,
    discusses its scope and\napplications, and establishes best practices for identification
    and\nsecurity of SIP trunks.\n\t </p>\n      "
