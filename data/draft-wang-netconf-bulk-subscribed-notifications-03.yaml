abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model and associated mechanism that
    allows subscriber applications to bulk subscribe to publishers' event streams
    based on bundle group information such as bundle size and bundle latency. This
    allows the publishers to report multiple notifications in a single bundling message.</p>"
