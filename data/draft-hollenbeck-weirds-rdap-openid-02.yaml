abstract:
- content: <p>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) provides "RESTful" web
    services to retrieve registration metadata from domain name and regional internet
    registries. RDAP allows a server to make access control decisions based on client
    identity, and as such it includes support for client identification features provided
    by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Identification methods that require
    clients to obtain and manage credentials from every RDAP server operator present
    management challenges for both clients and servers, whereas a federated authentication
    system would make it easier to operate and use RDAP without the need to maintain
    server-specific client credentials. This document describes a federated authentication
    system for RDAP based on OpenID Connect.</p>
