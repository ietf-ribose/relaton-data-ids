abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The merged ALTO protocol proposal proposes several mechanisms
    to\nincrease scalability of the protocol.  One of the proposed mechanisms\nis
    the distribution of ALTO information directly between the peers\nwithout any involvement
    of the server.  This memo discusses why the\nproposed mechanism is considered
    harmful and why the proposed\nsecurity framework is deployable.\n\t </p>\n      "
