abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the Class-Based Service Differentiation (CBSD)architecture
    and it proposes a set of Per-Hop-Behaviors that can be usedfor implementing it.
    According to CBSD, the network traffic is mapped toa set of classes. The differentiating
    factor between traffic classes isthe relative forwarding quality in a DS capable
    router. The Class PHBshave quite similar semantics with the Precedence PHBs, recently
    proposedby Baker et.al. in [PREC], but an attempt is made here to define them
    in amore general manner, decoupling them from specific implementationpossibilities.
    There is also a semantical overlap between the ExpeditedForwarding PHB of [DSFIELD]
    and the highest Class PHB. Consequently, theDiffserv working group may want to
    combine these three PHB proposals in asingle one, minimizing the number of DS
    Field bits used.</p>"
