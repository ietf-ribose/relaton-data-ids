abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Peer-to-peer (p2p) protocols, like all distributed protocols,
    are\ncomplex, and therefore harder to debug and study in the wild.  This\nis more
    true of existing p2p protocols, where changing the behaviour\nof the protocol
    --- however minor the change may be --- may result in\nunknown manifestations
    on the dynamics of the swarm using that\nprotocol.  In lieu of the unintended
    consequences of perturbing a\nlive swarm, researchers have resorted to simulation
    frameworks.\nHowever, simulation results obtained from one simulator are often\nhard
    to reproduce when using another simulation framework.  This\ndocument surveys
    existing simulator frameworks prevalent in\nsimulating p2p protocols today in
    order to quantify any assumptions\nand characteristics inherent in the simulator.
    \ This, we hope, will\naid future researchers in choosing the right simulation
    framework for\ntheir abstraction.\n\t </p>\n      "
