abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The increasing importance of messaging as a potential source of
    \nrevenue for mobile networks has led operators to build or procure \nmobile messaging
    solutions.  Some operators have built mobile \nmessaging solutions using IETF
    standards (IMAP, SMTP, MIME).  Another \nsolution has been developed by consensus
    in the 3GPP and OMA groups, \nbased on MIME, HTTP methods and WAP PUSH, which
    has been deployed by \nmany operators.  \nThis document presents a taxonomy of
    messaging architecture \ncomponents and models, providing a comparison of their
    feature sets.  \nIt also identifies the commonalities of these mobile messaging
    \nsolutions and abstracts from these a set of mobile messaging \nrequirements.
    \nThe information is provided to inform and encourage future discussion \nof and
    improvements to Internet messaging in order to increase their \napplicability
    to mobile messaging systems. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
