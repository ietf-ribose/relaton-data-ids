abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Stateful PCE (Path Computation Element) and its corresponding\n
    \  protocol extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do\n   stateful
    control of MPLS Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE\n   LSP).  One application
    that stateful PCE can realize is data traffic\n   reoptimization.  Data traffic
    traversed in a LSP can be switched to\n   another PCE-initiated LSP.  Moreover,
    data traffic can also be\n   balanced to multiple PCE-initiated LSPs using stateful
    PCE.\n\n   This document specifies the extensions to Path Computation Element\n
    \  Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to do switchover and\n   balancing
    of data traffic with PCE-initiated LSPs.  This document\n   also specifies the
    usage and handling of stateful PCEP (PCE\n   Communication Protocol) messages
    and the expected behavior of PCC as\n   the RSVP-TE headend.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
