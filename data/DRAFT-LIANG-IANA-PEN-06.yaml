abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Private Enterprise Numbers (PENs) are a technical protocol
    parameter\n   frequently assigned for use in the management of network connected\n
    \  equipment or software via SNMP-based network management systems,\n   LDAP,
    DIAMETER or GSS-API.  This document discusses what a Private\n   Enterprise Number
    (PEN) is, common uses of PENs, and registration\n   procedures for IANA Considerations.
    \ The registration procedures\n   include instructions and requirements for obtaining
    a new Private\n   Enterprise Number, modifying existing numbers, and the removal
    of\n   existing numbers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
