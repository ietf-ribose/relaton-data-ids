abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses solutions for inter-connection of BGP
    MPLS\n   IP/VPN [RFC4364] and Data Center (DC) overlay networks. Two\n   categories
    of inter-connections are discussed in this document. In\n   the first category,
    Data Center overlay virtual network is built with\n   BGP IP VPN technologies,
    the inter-connection of IP VPN in the Data\n   Center to BGP IP VPN in the WAN
    enables end-to-end IP VPN\n   connectivity. New Inter-AS solutions are required
    in certain\n   scenarios, in addition to the existing Inter-AS Options (A, B,
    C)\n   defined in [RFC4364]. In the second category, Data Centers overlay\n   network
    uses non IP VPN technologies, the inter-connection of any\n   overlay virtual
    network in the Data Center to BGP IP VPN in the WAN\n   provides end user connectivity
    through stitching of different overlay\n   technologies, the mapping of non IP
    VPN overlay to IP VPN need to be\n   performed at the border Gateway of the two
    networks. The role of\n   Software Defined Network (SDN) to assist the inter-connections
    is\n   discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
