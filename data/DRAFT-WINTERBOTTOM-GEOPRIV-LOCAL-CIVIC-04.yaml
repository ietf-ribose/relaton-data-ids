    mechanism for adding civic address elements to the Geopriv\ncivic address format
    is described.  A formal mechanism for handling\nunsupported extensions when translating
    between XML and DHCP civic\naddress forms is defined for entities that need to
    perform this\ntranslation.\n\t </p>\n      "
