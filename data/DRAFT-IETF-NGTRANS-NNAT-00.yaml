abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The initial deployment of IPv6 will require a tightly coupled
    use of\n   IPv4 addresses to support the interoperation of IPv6 and IPv4.  Nodes\n
    \  will be able to be deployed with IPv6 addresses, but will still need\n   to
    communicate with IPv4 nodes that do not have a dual IP layer\n   supporting both
    IPv4 and IPv6.  This specification defines a\n   mechanism called No Network Address
    Translation (NNAT), which will\n   assign an IPv6 node a temporary IPv4 address,
    which can be used to\n   communicate with a node that supports only IPv4.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
