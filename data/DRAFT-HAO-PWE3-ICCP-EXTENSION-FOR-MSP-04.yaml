abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies extensions to the Inter-Chassis Communication\n
    \  Protocol (ICCP) to support inter-chassis linear multiplex section\n   protection
    (MSP) as described in G.841 and automatic protection\n   switching as defined
    in ANSI T1.105.01.  This document considers an\n   application where a CE device
    or access network is attached to two\n   PEs through Synchronous Digital Hierarchy
    (SDH) circuits, and MSP or\n   APS is used to protect the attachment circuits.
    \ ICCP is used to\n   support configuration and state synchronization between
    two chassis.\n   CE device or access network attached to more than two PEs is
    out of\n   the scope of this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
