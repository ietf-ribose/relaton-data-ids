abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes minimal initiator version of the Internet
    Key\n   Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol.  IKEv2 is a component of IPsec\n
    \  used for performing mutual authentication and establishing and\n   maintaining
    Security Associations (SAs).  IKEv2 includes several\n   optional features, which
    are not needed in minimal implementations.\n   This document describes what is
    required from the minimal\n   implementation, and also describes various optimizations
    which can be\n   done.  The protocol described here is compliant with full IKEv2
    with\n   exception that this document describes mainly shared secret\n   authentication
    (IKEv2 requires support for certificate authentication\n   in addition to shared
    secret authentication).  This minimal initiator\n   implementation can only talk
    to the IKEv2 implementation which\n   supports also acting as responder, thus
    two minimal initiator\n   implementations cannot talk to each other.\n\n   This
    document does not update or modify RFC 7296, but provides more\n   compact description
    of the minimal version of the protocol.  If this\n   document and RFC 7296 conflicts
    then RFC 7296 is the authoritative\n   description.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
