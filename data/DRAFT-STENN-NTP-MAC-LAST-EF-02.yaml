abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NTPv4 is defined by RFC 5905 [RFC5905], and it and earlier
    versions\n   of the NTP Protocol have supported symmetric private key Message\n
    \  Authentication Code (MAC) authentication.  MACs were first described\n   in
    Appendix C of RFC 1305 [RFC1305] and are further described in RFC\n   5905 [RFC5905].
    \ As the number of Extension Fields grows there is an\n   increasing chance of
    a parsing ambiguity when deciding if the \"next\"\n   set of data is an Extension
    Field or a legacy MAC.  This proposal\n   defines two new Extension Fields which
    may be used to avoid this\n   ambiguity.  One, LAST-EF, is used to signify that
    it is the last\n   Extension Field in the packet.  If the LAST-EF is present,
    any\n   subsequent data MUST be considered to be a legacy MAC.  The other,\n   MAC-EF,
    allows one or more MACs to be encapsulated in an Extension\n   Field.  If all
    parties in an association support MAC-EF, the use of a\n   legacy MAC may be avoided.\n\n\t
