abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the conventions for digital signatures
    on\n   RFCs and Internet-Draft documents.  For Internet-Drafts, the\n   Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS) is used to create a detached\n   signature, which is stored
    in a separate companion file so that no\n   existing utilities are impacted by
    the addition of the digital\n   signature.  For RFCs, an embedded digital signature
    is included in\n   Portable Document Format (PDF) files types in addition to the\n
    \  detached signature in a separate companion file.\n\n   This document (once
    approved) obsoletes RFC 5485.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
