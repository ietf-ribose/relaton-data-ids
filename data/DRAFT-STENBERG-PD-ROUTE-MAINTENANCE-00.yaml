abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The maintenance of Prefix Delegation (PD) routing state is
    an issue\n   that people have discussed in the IETF DHC WG, and there have been\n
    \  drafts on the topic.  However, as the pros and cons of the different\n   routing
    state maintenance solutions have not been examined\n   thoroughly, this text attempts
    to shed some light on both the actual\n   problem and the various alternative
    solutions.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
