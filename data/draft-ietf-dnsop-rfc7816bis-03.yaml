abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes techniques called "QNAME minimisation" to improve
    DNS privacy, where the DNS resolver no longer always sends the full original QNAME
    to the upstream name server. This document obsoletes RFC 7816. This document is
    part of the IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) Working Group. The source of the document,
    as well as a list of open issues, is at &lt;https://framagit.org/bortzmeyer/rfc7816-bis&gt;
    NOTE FOR THE DNSOP WORKING GROUP: There is still much work to be done in this
    draft. Future versions of this draft will contain descriptions of different minimisation
    implementation choices that have been made since the RFC 7816 first came out,
    as well as deployment experience.</p>'
