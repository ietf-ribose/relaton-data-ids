abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines the application of a set of protocols for
    \nconfiguring a SIP user agent.  The SIP user agent must discover how \nand from
    where to retrieve its initial configuration and be notified \nof changes and updates
    which impact its configuration.  The \nobjective is to define a means for automatically
    configuring a user \nagent such that it can be functional without user or administrative
    \nintervention.  The framework for discovery, delivery, notification \nand updates
    of user agent configuration is defined here.  This \nframework is also intended
    to ease ongoing administration, \nconfiguration and upgrading of large scale deployments
    of SIP user \nagents.  The contents and format of the configuration data to be
    \ndefined is outside the scope of this document.\n\t </p>\n      "
