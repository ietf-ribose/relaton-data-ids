abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides test vectors to validate implementations
    of\n   the two mandatory authentication algorithms specified for the TCP\n   Authentication
    Option over both IPv4 and IPv6. This includes\n   validation of the key derivation
    function (KDF) based on a set of\n   test connection parameters as well as validation
    of the message\n   authentication code (MAC). Vectors are provided for both currently\n
    \  required pairs of KDF and MAC algorithms: one based on SHA-1 and the\n   other
    on AES-128. The vectors also validate both whole TCP segments\n   as well as segments
    whose options are excluded for middlebox\n   traversal.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
