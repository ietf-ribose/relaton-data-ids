abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The use of IPv6 addresses by large organizations doesn't fit
    the\n   commonly used PA/PI dichotomy.  Such organizations may hold a large\n
    \  address block which is deaggregated into subprefixes that are\n   advertised
    by subunits of the organization.  This document proposes a\n   set of best practices
    to allow this deaggregation to be controlled\n   through filtering so that on
    the one hand, the size of the IPv6\n   global routing table isn't unduly inflated,
    while on the other hand\n   organizations that seek to deaggregate a large IPv6
    address block\n   don't see their reachability limited by remote filters.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
