abstract:
- content: "<p>Shared mesh protection is a common protection and recovery mechanism
    in transport networks, where multiple paths can share the same set of network
    resources for protection purposes. In the context of MPLS-TP, it has been explicitly
    requested as a part of the overall solution (Req. 67, 68 and 69 in RFC5654 [RFC5654]).
    It's important to note that each MPLS-TP LSP may be associated with transport
    network resources. In event of network failure, it may require explicit activation
    on the protecting paths before switching user traffic over. In this memo, we define
    a lightweight signaling mechanism for protecting path activation in shared mesh
    protection-enabled MPLS-TP networks.</p>"
