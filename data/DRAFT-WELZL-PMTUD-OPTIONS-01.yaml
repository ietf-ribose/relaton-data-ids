abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an experimental enhancement of Path MTU\nDiscovery
    that has the potential of reducing loss, speeding up\nconvergence, reducing load
    in routers which would otherwise need to\ngenerate a large amount of ICMP messages,
    and alleviating certain\nadditional problems (interactions with tunnels, Black
    Hole\nDetection). The idea is to use an IP Option which queries routers for\ntheir
    MTU before starting a Path MTU Discovery process. The result\nretrieved in this
    is used as an upper limit for Path MTU Discovery.\nTo this end, it is fed back
    to the source either at the packetization\nlayer (recommended) or at the IP layer.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
