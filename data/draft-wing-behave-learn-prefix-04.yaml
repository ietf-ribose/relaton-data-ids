abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Some IPv6 applications obtain IPv4 address literals and want tocommunicate
    with those IPv4 hosts through an IPv6/IPv4 translator.The IPv6 application can
    send an IPv6 packet through the translatorif it knows the IPv6 prefix of the IPv6/IPv4
    translator. In manyIPv6/IPv4 translation deployments, that IPv6 prefix is not
    fixed;rather, the prefix is chosen by the network operator. Thisspecification
    provides three methods for a host to learn the IPv6prefix of its IPv6/IPv4 translator.
    Unicast, any-source multicast(ASM), and source-specific multicast (SSM) are supported.</p>"
