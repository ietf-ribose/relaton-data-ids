abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a fast reroute framework for protecting MPLS
    tunnels and the IP/MPLS services carried by them against egress router failures.
    The framework relies on local detection and local repair to be performed by the
    router upstream adjacent to a failure. The router can restore traffic in the order
    of tens of milliseconds, by rerouting it to a protector through a pre-established
    bypass tunnel. Therefore, the mechanism can be used to reduce traffic loss before
    global repair reacts to the failure and control plane protocols converge on the
    topology changes due to the failure.</p>"
