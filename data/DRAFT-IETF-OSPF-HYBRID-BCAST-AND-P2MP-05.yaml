abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism to model a broadcast network
    as a\n   hybrid of broadcast and point-to-multipoint networks for purposes of\n
    \  OSPF operation.  Neighbor discovery and maintenance as well as Link\n   State
    Advertisement (LSA) database synchronization are performed\n   using the broadcast
    model, but the network is represented using the\n   point-to-multipoint model
    in the router LSAs of the routers connected\n   to it.  This allows an accurate
    representation of the cost of\n   communication between different routers on the
    network, while\n   maintaining the network efficiency of broadcast operation.
    \ This\n   approach is relatively simple and requires minimal changes to OSPF.\n\n
    \  This document updates both OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC5340].\n\n\t </p>\n
