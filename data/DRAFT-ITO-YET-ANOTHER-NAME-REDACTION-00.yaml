abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes mechanisms to allow CT log submitters
    to\n   submit name redacted certificates.  While public Certificate\n   Transparency
    (CT) logs allow anyone to observe server certificates\n   and make confident to
    trust Certificate Authorities (CAs), there are\n   some problems scaling to mass
    devices.  This document presents some\n   use cases, and describes a use of name
    redacted certificates that\n   retains most of the security benefits that gained
    from using\n   Certificate Transparency.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
