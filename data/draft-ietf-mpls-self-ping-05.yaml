abstract:
- content: "<p>When certain RSVP-TE optimizations are implemented, ingress LSRs can
    receive RSVP RESV messages before forwarding state has been installed on all downstream
    nodes. According to the RSVP-TE specification, the ingress LSR can forward traffic
    through an LSP as soon as it receives a RESV message. However, if the ingress
    LSR forwards traffic through the LSP before forwarding state has been installed
    on all downstream nodes, traffic can be lost. This document describes LSP Self-ping.
    When an ingress LSR receives an RESV message, it can invoke LSP Self-ping procedures
    to ensure that forwarding state has been installed on all downstream nodes. LSP
    Self-ping is a new protocol. It is not an extension of LSP Ping. Although LSP
    Ping and LSP Self-ping are named similarly, each is designed for a unique purpose.
    Each protocol listens on its own UDP port and executes its own procedures. LSP
    Self-ping is an extremely light-weight mechanism. It does not consume control
    plane resources on transit or egress LSRs.</p>"
