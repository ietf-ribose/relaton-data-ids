abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Applications differ with respect to whether or not they need
    IP\n   session continuity and/or IP address reachability.  Networks\n   providing
    the same type of service to any mobile host and any\n   application running on
    the host yields inefficiencies.  This document\n   describes extensions to the
    DHCPv6 protocol to enable mobile hosts to\n   indicate the required mobility service
    type associated with a\n   requested IP address, and networks to indicate the
    type of mobility\n   service associated with the allocated IP address in return.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
