abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     Some system administrators are faced with a choice between\n
    \    deploying a new authentication infrastructure or sending\n     unencrypted
    passwords in the clear over the Internet.  Deploying a\n     new authentication
    infrastructure often involves modifying\n     operating system services or keeping
    parallel authentication\n     databases up to date and is thus unacceptable to
    many\n     administrators.\n \n     Solutions which encrypt the entire session
    are often crippled with\n     weak keys (due to government restrictions) which
    are unsuitable for\n     passwords.  In addition, such solutions often reduce
    performance of\n     the entire session to an unacceptable level.  This specification\n
    \    defines a SASL [SASL] mechanism which is compatible with existing\n     password-based
    authentication databases and does not require a\n     security layer for the remainder
    of the session.\n \n     [NOTE: Public discussion of this mechanism may take place
    on the\n     ietf-sasl@imc.org mailing list with a subscription address of\n     ietf-sasl-request@imc.org.
    \ Private comments may be sent to the\n     author].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
