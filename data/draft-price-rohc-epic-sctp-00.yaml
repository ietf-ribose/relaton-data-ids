abstract:
- content: "<p>The Efficient Protocol Independent Compression [EPIC] scheme is a general
    mechanism for providing additional profiles for use within the [ROHC8] framework.
    The EPIC inputset is a list of fields from the protocol stack to be compressed,
    and for each field a choice of encoding techniques together with the probabilities
    that they will be used. The output of EPIC is a set of optimally efficient compressed
    header formats for the chosen protocol stack, and an automatic mechanism for translating
    between compressed and uncompressed packet formats.</p>"
