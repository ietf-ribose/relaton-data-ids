abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two optional extensions to the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP): the Repeat option and the Request-Tag option. Each of these options
    when integrity protected, such as with DTLS or OSCOAP, protects against certain
    attacks on CoAP message exchanges. The Repeat option enables a CoAP server to
    verify the freshness of a request by requiring the CoAP client to make another
    request and include a server-provided challenge. The Request-Tag option allows
    the CoAP server to match message fragments belonging to the same request message,
    fragmented using the CoAP Block-Wise Transfer mechanism. This document also specifies
    additional processing requirements on Block1 and Block2 options.</p>"
