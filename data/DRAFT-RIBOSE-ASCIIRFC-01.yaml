abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the AsciiDoc syntax extension called
    AsciiRFC\n   designed for authoring IETF Internet-Drafts and RFCs.\n\n   AsciiDoc
    is a human readable document markup language which affords\n   more granular control
    over markup than comparable schemes such as\n   Markdown.\n\n   The AsciiRFC syntax
    is designed to allow the author to entirely focus\n   on text, providing the full
    power of the resulting XML RFC through\n   the AsciiDoc language, while abstracting
    away the need to manually\n   edit XML, including references.\n\n   This document
    itself was written and generated into XML RFC v2\n   (RFC7749) and XML RFC v3
    (RFC7991) directly through asciidoctor-rfc,\n   an AsciiRFC generator.\n\n\t </p>\n
