abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Legislators writing laws that would limit or prohibit the sending
    of\nunsolicited bulk email (UBE) or unsolicited commercial email (UCE) have\nbegun
    to include rules that require mail servers to include particular\nwording in the
    SMTP banner. To date, this wording has had two distinct\npurposes: to warn senders
    that they may not send UBE or UCE to that SMTP\nhost, and to state the physical
    location of the host so that the sender may\nknow which laws apply.\n \nThis document
    is meant to help clarify how such legislation might be\nworded, and to help increase
    interoperability of various laws. It is not\nmeant to be a standard of any kind,
    but is meant only for its informational\nvalue.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
