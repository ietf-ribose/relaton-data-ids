abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   New services such as network function virtualization (NFV),
    service\n   chaining, and application-centric traffic steering bring new\n   opportunities
    for network providers and service providers. This\n   internet draft defines a
    new Layer 5 packet header format called\n   Service Forwarding Label (SFL) and
    procedures which can be used as a\n   universal label to differentiate various
    services and forward\n   packets based on different service requirements.\n\n\n\t
