abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Certificate (CERT) parameter is a container for digital\n
    \  certificates.  It is used for carrying these certificates in Host\n   Identity
    Protocol (HIP) control packets.  This document specifies the\n   certificate parameter
    and the error signaling in case of a failed\n   verification.  Additionally, this
    document specifies the\n   representations of Host Identity Tags in X.509 version
    3 (v3) and\n   Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI) certificates.\n\n   The
    concrete use cases of certificates, including how certificates\n   are obtained,
    requested, and which actions are taken upon successful\n   or failed verification,
    are specific to the scenario in which the\n   certificates are used.  Hence, the
    definition of these scenario-\n   specific aspects is left to the documents that
    use the CERT\n   parameter.\n\n   This document extends RFC7401 and obsoletes
    RFC6253.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
