  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses considerations for assigning a new\n
    \  recommended DiffServ Code Point (DSCP).  It considers the common\n   remarking
    behaviours that the Diffserv field might be subjected to\n   along an Internet
    path.  It also notes some implications of using a\n   specific DSCP.\n\n   This
    individual draft aims to seek comments and contributions from\n   the TSVWG working
    group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
