abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Quantum Internet has the potential to improve Internet
    protocol\n   and application functionality by incorporating quantum information\n
    \  technology into the infrastructure of the overall Internet.  In this\n   document,
    we provide an overview of some applications expected to be\n   used on the Quantum
    Internet, and then categorize them using the\n   standard telecommunications classification
    of control plane versus\n   data plane functionality.  Other classification schemes
    are also\n   possible and discussed briefly.  We then provide detailed use cases\n
    \  for selected applications.  The intent of this document is to provide\n   a
    common understanding and framework of applications and use cases\n   for the Quantum
    Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
