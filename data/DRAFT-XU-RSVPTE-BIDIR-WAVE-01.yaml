abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>For bidirectional lightpaths provisioning, in the case of optical
    nodes\nthat do not support wavelength conversion, it would be necessary to use\nthe
    same wavelength along the route on each direction. In certain \noptical network
    scenarios, the use of the same wavelength on both \ndirections would be advantageous.
    \ For instance, some ROADMs may \nadd/drop the same wavelength simultaneously.
    In other cases, the users'\noptical end nodes are equipped with fixed-wavelength
    transponders. \n\nThis document describes extensions to RSVP-TE signaling for
    \nbidirectional wavelength lightpaths that require the same wavelength on\nboth
    directions. By using an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object defined in [RFC4420],\nthe extensions
    enable the new type lightpaths to support the low cost \nconfiguration at users'
    optical end nodes.\n\t </p>\n      "
