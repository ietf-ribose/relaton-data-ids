abstract:
- content: "<p>Group communication over the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    can be secured by means of Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments
    (OSCORE). At deployment time, devices may not know the exact OSCORE groups to
    join, the respective Group Manager, or other information required to perform the
    joining process. This document describes how CoAP endpoints can use the CoRE Resource
    Directory to discover OSCORE groups and acquire information to join them through
    their respective Group Manager. This approach is consistent with, but not limited
    to, the joining of OSCORE groups based on the ACE framework for Authentication
    and Authorization.</p>"
