abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step,
    file\ntransfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a\nremote
    host.\n \nThis document describes a new TFTP option. This new option will allow\nthe
    multiple client to receive the same file concurrently through the\nuse of Multicast
    packets. The TFTP Option Extension mechanism is\ndescribed in [2].\n \nOften when
    similar computers are booting remotely they will each\ndownload the same image
    file. By adding multicast into the TFTP option\nset, two or more computers can
    download a file concurrently, thus\nincreasing network efficiency.\n \nThis document
    assumes that the reader is familiar with the terminology\nand notation of both
    [1] and [2].\n\t </p>\n      "
