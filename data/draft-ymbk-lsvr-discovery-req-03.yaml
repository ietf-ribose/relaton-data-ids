abstract:
- content: "<p>For wide scale routing protocols to build their topology and reachability
    databases they need to discover the encapsulation data on a link, link IP layer
    3 attributes, attributes for IP layer 3 and above protocols on that link, and
    link liveness. We refer to this as neighbor discovery. BGP-LS and its enhancements
    provide an API to present much of these data to BGP protocols, but do not directly
    collect these data. This document explores the needs and criteria for the data
    needed.</p>"
