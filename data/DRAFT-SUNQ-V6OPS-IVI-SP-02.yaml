abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>With the approaching exhaustion of IPv4 address space, large-scale\nSPs
    are now faced with the only real option to deploy IPv6 in a\ntimely manner. In
    order to achieve smooth transition to IPv6,\nmigration tools should be introduced
    for different deployment models.\nAmong different IPv6 transition mechanisms,
    dIVI is a prefix-specific\nand stateless address mapping method which can directly
    translate\nIPv4 packet to IPv6 packet. This document describes the challenges\nand
    requirements for large SP to deploy IPv6 in operational network,\nthe experimental
    results of dIVI in our laboratory and the\nconsiderations for dIVI deployment
    in large SP operational network.\n\t </p>\n      "
