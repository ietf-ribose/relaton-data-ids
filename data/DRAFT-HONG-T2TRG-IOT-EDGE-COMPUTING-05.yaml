abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many IoT applications have requirements that cannot be met
    by the\n   traditional Cloud (aka cloud computing).  These include time\n   sensitivity,
    data volume, uplink cost, operation in the face of\n   intermittent services,
    privacy and security.  As a result, the IoT is\n   driving the Internet toward
    Edge computing.  This document outlines\n   the requirements of the emerging IoT
    Edge and its challenges.  It\n   presents a general model, and major components
    of the IoT Edge, with\n   the goal to provide a common base for future discussions
    in T2TRG and\n   other IRTF and IETF groups.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
