abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo discusses applicability for energy management features
    tovarious types of devices and buildings. It describes the variety ofapplications
    that can use the EMAN energy framework and associatedMIB modules. P otential examples
    are building networks, home energygateway, etc. Finally, the document will also
    discuss relationshipsof the framework to other architectures and frameworks (such
    assmartgrid). The applicability statement will explain therelationship between
    the work in this WG and the other existingstandards such as those from the IEC,
    ANSI, DMTF, and others.</p>"
