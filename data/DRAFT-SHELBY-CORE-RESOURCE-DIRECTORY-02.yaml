abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In many M2M scenarios, direct discovery of resources is not
    practical\n   due to sleeping nodes, disperse networks, or networks where multicast\n
    \  traffic is inefficient.  These problems can be solved by employing an\n   entity
    called a Resource Directory (RD), which hosts descriptions of\n   resources held
    on other servers, allowing lookups to be performed for\n   those resources.  This
    document specifies the web interfaces that a\n   Resource Directory supports in
    order for web servers to discover the\n   RD and to registrer, maintain, lookup
    and remove resources\n   descriptions.  Furthermore, new link attributes useful
    in conjunction\n   with an RD are defined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
