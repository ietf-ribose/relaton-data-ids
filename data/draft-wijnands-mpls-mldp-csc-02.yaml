abstract:
  content: <p>The control protocol used for constructing Point-to-Multipoint andMultipoint-to-Multipoint
    Label Switched Paths ("MP LSPs") contains afield that identifies the address of
    a "root node". Intermediatenodes are expected to be able to look up that address
    in theirrouting tables. However, if the route to the root node is a BGProute,
    and the intermediate nodes are part of a BGP-free core, thisis not possible. This
    document specifies procedures which enable aMP LSP to be constructed through a
    BGP-free core. In theseprocedures, the root node address is temporarily replaced
    by anaddress which is known to the intermediate nodes.</p>
