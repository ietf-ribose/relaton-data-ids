abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include\n
    \  capabilities to request partial responses.  In fact, according to the\n   user
    authorization, the server can only return full responses.\n   Partial responses
    capability, especially in the case of search\n   queries, could bring benefits
    to both clients and servers.  This\n   document describes a RDAP query extension
    that allows clients to\n   specify their preference for obtaining a partial response.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
