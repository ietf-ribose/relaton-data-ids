abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document outlines work to be done and documents to be
    produced\n   by the Operational Security Capabilities (OPSEC) Working Group.  The\n
    \  goal of the working group is to codify knowledge gained through\n   operational
    experience about feature sets that are needed to securely\n   deploy and operate
    managed network elements providing transit\n   services at the data link and IP
    layers.  The intent is to provide\n   clear, concise documentation of capabilities
    necessary for operating\n   networks securely, to assist network operators in
    communicating their\n   requirements to vendors, and to provide vendors with input
    that is\n   useful for building more secure devices.  The working group will\n
    \  produce a list of capabilities appropriate for large Internet Service\n   Provider
    (ISP) and Enterprise Networks.  This work is intended to\n   refine [RFC3871].\n\t
