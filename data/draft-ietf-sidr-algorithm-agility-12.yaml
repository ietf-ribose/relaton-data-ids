abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the process that Certification Authorities
    (CAs) and Relying Parties (RPs) participating in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI) will need to follow to transition to a new (and probably cryptographically
    stronger) algorithm set. The process is expected to be completed over a timescale
    of several years. Consequently, no emergency transition is specified. The transition
    procedure defined in this document supports only a top-down migration (parent
    migrates before children).</p>"
