abstract:
- content: "<p>Password policy as described in this document is a set of rules that
    controls how passwords are used and administered in Lightweight Directory Access
    Protocol (LDAP) based directories. In order to improve the security of LDAP directories
    and make it difficult for password cracking programs to break into directories,
    it is desirable to enforce a set of rules on password usage. These rules are made
    to ensure that users change their passwords periodically, passwords meet construction
    requirements, the re-use of old password is restricted, and to deter password
    guessing attacks.</p>"
