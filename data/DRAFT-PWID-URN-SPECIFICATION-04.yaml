abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Persistent\n
    \  Web IDentifiers to web material in web archives using the 'pwid'\n   namespace
    identifier.\n\n   The main purpose of the standard is to support specification
    of\n   references that are not covered by other reference techniques: to\n   support
    references to material in web archives with restricted\n   access.  Furthermore,
    it supports persistent technology agnostic\n   references to web archives in general,
    in a form that can work as an\n   algorithmic basis for finding web archive resources
    in general.  An\n   additional important benefit is that it can be used in specifying
    web\n   collections, which then can form a persistent computational basis for\n
    \  the extract of the archived collection parts.  Since the parts can be\n   specified
    generally, this further allow collections to be specified\n   with elements from
    one or more web archives.\n\n   The PWID is designed for researchers and therefore
    it is designed as\n   general, global, sustainable, humanly readable, technology
    agnostic,\n   persistent and precise web references for web materials in web\n
    \  archives.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
