abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This I-D is to analyze the gaps in the ongoing work of the QoS
    \n   application in the DIME WG, discuss the extension of the scope of QoS \n
    \  application to a generic resource control application for a variety \n   of
    network technologies and use cases, and investigate potential \n   mechanisms
    to support additional resource control scenarios.  The \n   current Diameter Quality
    of Service Application (draft-tschofenig-\n   dime-diameter-qos-01.txt) is limited
    to an environment where network \n   elements triggered by certain mechanisms
    (e.g. path-coupled QoS \n   signaling such as RSVP or NSIS initiated by end-hosts)
    can request \n   QoS authorization of network resources. It does not address \n
    \  environments where end-hosts and/or network elements is unable to \n   issue
    a resource request initiatively. In such environments, a \n   different mode of
    operations is needed to allow an authorizing entity \n   to not just authorize
    QoS resources upon the receipt of the request \n   from network elements but also
    directly authorize resources and \n   dictate routers/switches to enforce the
    decisions without the request \n   from network elements. The new mode of operations
    also lends itself \n   to address resource control in general. It can control
    resources for \n   the purpose beyond QoS support, such as NAPT, media latching,
    and \n   packet filtering.\n\t </p>\n      "
