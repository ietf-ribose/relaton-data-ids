abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications
    over\n   wireless links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the\n   characteristics
    of the link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make\n   routing decisions.  In mobile
    or other environments where these\n   characteristics change frequently, manual
    configurations or the\n   inference of state through routing or transport protocols
    does not\n   allow the router to make the best decisions.  A bidirectional, event-\n
    \  driven communication channel between the router and the modem is\n   necessary.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
