abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained devices and networks.
    It is anticipated that constrained devices will often naturally operate in groups
    (e.g. in a building automation scenario all lights in a given room may need to
    be switched on/off as a group). This document provides guidance for how the CoAP
    protocol should be used in a group communication context. An approach for using
    CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed for both constrained and un-constrained
    networks. Also, various use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided
    to illustrate important concepts. Finally, guidance is provided for deployment
    in various network topologies.</p>"
