abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses an enhancement of automated bootstrapping of
    a remote secure key infrastructure (BRSKI) to operate in domains featuring no
    or only timely limited connectivity to backend services offering enrollment functionality,
    specifically a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). In the context of deploying new
    devices the design of BRSKI allows for online (synchronous object exchange) and
    offline interactions (asynchronous object exchange) with a manufacturer's authorization
    service. For this it utilizes a self- contained voucher to transport the domain
    credentials as a signed object to establish an initial trust between the pledge
    and the deployment domain. The currently supported enrollment protocol for request
    and distribution of deployment domain specific device certificates provides only
    limited support for asynchronous PKI interactions. This memo motivates the enhancement
    of supporting self-contained objects for certificate management by using an abstract
    notation. This allows off-site operation of PKI services outside the deployment
    domain of the pledge. This addresses specifically scenarios, in which the final
    authorization of certification request of a pledge cannot be made in the deployment
    domain and is therefore delegated to a operator backend. The goal is to enable
    the usage of existing and potentially new PKI protocols supporting self-containment
    for certificate management.</p>"
