abstract:
- content: "<p>In many circumstances public LoST servers or a distributed network
    of forest guides linking public LoST servers is not available. In such environments
    the general ECRIT calling models breakdown. However, location servers operating
    in these areas are often privy to the necessary information to reach emergency
    and other services. This document describes a solution where by the routing information
    may be obtained from a location server using a simple extension to the HELD protocol.</p>"
