abstract:
- content: "<p>It is generally known that the binding acquisition for symmetric NATs
    with STUN (Simple Traversal of UDP through NATs) protocol will not yield a usable
    address for traversing symmetric NAT. The use of symmetric RTP allows you to accompolish
    symmetric NAT traversal only in situations where the other end is open to the
    Internet, or has a full-cone or a restricted-cone NAT. This document proposes
    an analytical method for symmetric NATs to obtain more detailed characteristics
    of the symmetric NAT using STUN, and describes how we can establish a peer-to-peer
    UDP connection even in situations where NATs (including symmetric NATs) are present
    at both ends.</p>"
