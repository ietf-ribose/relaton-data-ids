abstract:
  content: "<p>It is generally known that the binding acquisition for symmetric NATswith
    STUN (Simple Traversal of UDP through NATs) protocol will notyield a usable address
    for traversing symmetric NAT. The use ofsymmetric RTP allows you to accompolish
    symmetric NAT traversal onlyin situations where the other end is open to the Internet,
    or has afull-cone or a restricted-cone NAT. This document proposes ananalytical
    method for symmetric NATs to obtain more detailedcharacteristics of the symmetric
    NAT using STUN, and describes how wecan establish a peer-to-peer UDP connection
    even in situations whereNATs (including symmetric NATs) are present at both ends.</p>"
