abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To support IP multicasting in PMIPv6 domain, MULTIMOB WG has
    issued\n   several proposals including the base solution, dedicated schemes and\n
    \  direct routing which requires all communications to go through the\n   local
    mobility anchor(LMA), the dedicated server and the native\n   multicasting infrastructure,
    respectively.  As this can be\n   suboptimal, this document describes multicast
    routes optimazition\n   mechanisms for multicast sender.  Multicast sender attached
    to the\n   same or different mobile access gateways(MAG) with multicast listener\n
    \  sends multicast data via the tunnel between the gateways without any\n   dedicated
    devices or dependence of the native multicasting\n   infrastructure.  The MAG
    and the LMA are the mobility entities\n   defined in the PMIPv6 protocol and act
    as PIM-SM routers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
