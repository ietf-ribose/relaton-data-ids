abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft describes a protocol to be used for signaling QoSreservations
    in the Internet. It is compatible with the framework andrequirements for such
    signaling protocols developed within NSIS; inconjunction with the NSIS Transport
    solution, it providesfunctionality comparable to RSVP: it is independent of the
    details ofQoS specification, and adds support for a greater variety ofreservation
    models, but is simplified by the elimination of supportfor multicast flows.</p>"
