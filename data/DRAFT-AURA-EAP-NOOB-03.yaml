abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for\n
    \  multiple authentication methods.  This document defines the EAP-NOOB\n   authentication
    method for nimble out-of-band (OOB) authentication and\n   key derivation.  This
    EAP method is intended for bootstrapping all\n   kinds of Internet-of-Things (IoT)
    devices that have a minimal user\n   interface and no pre-configured authentication
    credentials.  The\n   method makes use of a user-assisted one-directional OOB
    channel\n   between the peer device and authentication server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
