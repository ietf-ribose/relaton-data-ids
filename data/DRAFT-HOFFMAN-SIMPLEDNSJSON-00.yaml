abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a JSON-based format for simple DNS
    queries\n   and responses.  In this case, \"simple\" means \"only useful for getting\n
    \  A and AAAA records\".  This document also defines the application/\n   simpledns+json
    media type.  The primary use case of this format is\n   programs that do not want
    to take on the programmatic overhead needed\n   to use messages in the application/dns-udpwireformat
    media type.\n\n   [ This paragraph is to be removed when this document is published
    as\n   an RFC ] Comments on this draft can be sent to the DNS over HTTP\n   mailing
    list at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/dnsoverhttp .\n\n\t </p>\n      "
