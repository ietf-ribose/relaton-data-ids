abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the implementation, named LLCPS, of
    the TLS\n   protocol over the NFC (Near Field Communication) LLCP (Logical Link\n
    \  Control Protocol) layer. The NFC peer to peer (P2P) protocol may be\n   used
    by any application that needs communication between two devices\n   at very small
    distances (a few centimeters). LLCPS enforces a strong\n   security in NFC P2P
    exchanges, and may be deployed for many\n   services, in the Internet Of Things
    (IoT) ecosystem, such as\n   payments, access control or ticketing operations.
    Applications\n   secured by LLCPS are identified by the service name\n   \"urn:nfc:sn:tls:x\"
    where x is the application name.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
