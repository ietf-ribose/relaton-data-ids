abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies methods for Real-Time Text (RTT) media
    handling\n   in multi-party calls.  The main solution is to carry Real-Time text\n
    \  by the RTP protocol in a time-sampled mode according to RFC 4103.\n   The main
    solution for centralized multi-party handling of real-time\n   text is achieved
    through a media control unit coordinating multiple\n   RTP text streams into one
    RTP session.\n\n   Identification for the streams are provided through the RTCP\n
    \  messages.  This mechanism enables the receiving application to\n   present
    the received real-time text medium in different ways\n   according to user preferences.
    \ Some presentation related features\n   are also described explaining suitable
    variations of transmission and\n   presentation of text.\n\n   Call control features
    are described for the SIP environment.  A\n   number of alternative methods for
    providing the multi-party\n   negotiation, transmission and presentation are discussed
    and a\n   recommendation for the main one is provided.  Two alternative methods\n
    \  using a single RTP stream and source identification inline in the\n   text
    stream are also described, one of them being provided as a lower\n   functionality
    fallback method for endpoints with no multi-party\n   awareness for RTT.\n\n   Brief
    information is also provided for multi-party RTT in the WebRTC\n   environment.\n\n
    \  EDITOR NOTE: A number of alternatives are specified for discussion.\n   A decision
    is needed which alternatives are preferred and then how\n   the preferred alternatives
    shall be emphasized.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
