abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows the establishment
    of \nreal-time Internet fax communications.  Real-time facsimile \ncommunications
    over IP may follow 2 modes of operation: T.38 fax \nrelay as defined by the ITU-T
    T.38 recommendation or fax pass-\nthrough.  \nThis document clarifies the options
    available to Internet telephony \ngateway vendors to handle real-time fax calls
    using SIP.  While our \nprimary focus is to address the more reliable real-time
    T.38 Group 3 \nfax mode, we briefly cover the fax pass-through mode to enable
    \nfallback operations and super G3 fax communications using SIP.  We \nalso give
    examples of SIP call flows for real-time Internet fax \ngateways or SIP proxy
    redirect servers.  Elements in these call \nflows include SIP User Agents, SIP
    Proxy Servers, and Gateways to \nthe PSTN (Public Switch Telephone Network). \nThis
    document introduces best current practices for SIP T.38 fax and \nSIP fax pass-through
    sessions.  A session starts with audio \ncapabilities, and, upon fax tone detection,
    T.38 fax capabilities \nare negotiated; upon successful negotiation, the session
    continues \nwith fax capabilities and the media termination hosts exchange T.38
    \nInternet fax packets.  The T.38 fax call scenarios include various \naspects
    of the call sequence: the detection of fax transmission, the \nusage of the T.38
    session description attributes, the optional \nfallback into fax pass-through
    mode and the session termination. The \nfax pass-through call scenarios involve
    some specific SDP media \nattributes to enable proper fax transmission. \nFax
    transmission can be detected by the receiving side, the emitting \nside or both
    (in the latter case, a 'glare' effect may appear).  \nThis document only covers
    the case when the fax transmission is \ndetected by the receiving side: it is
    the most common practice and \nthe other cases do not represent any particular
    challenges and are \ntherefore left for future discussions).  Call flow diagrams
    and \nmessage details are shown.  A list of IANA defined SDP attribute \nnames
    for T.38 is summarized in section 7. \n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
