abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The decision to develop a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)\nTransport
    Profile (MPLS-TP) in cooperation between the IETF and the\nITU-T is documented
    in RFC 5317 as the report of the Joint Working\nTeam on MPLS-TP. As part of this
    development process, the\nInternational Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication\nStandardisation
    Sector (ITU-T) will develop a number of\nRecommendations. Those Recomendations
    will allow MPLS-TP to be\nintegrated with current transport equipment and networks,
    including,\nin agreement with the IETF, the definition of any ITU-T-specific\nfunctionality
    within the MPLS-TP architecture via the Change Process\nfor Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)\nProtocols and Procedures.\n\nThis
    document sets out the IETF's expectations of how the IETF,\nthrough individual
    participation and through consensus decisions,\nwill contribute to in the development,
    review, and approval of those\nRecommendations.\n\nThis document does not modify
    any existing ITU-T or IETF procedures,\nbut shows how those procedures can be
    used to facilitate cooperation\nfor the MPLS-TP project.\n\t </p>\n      "
