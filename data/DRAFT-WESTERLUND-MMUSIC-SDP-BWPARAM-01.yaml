abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The existing Session Description Protocol (SDP) bandwidth modifiers\nand
    their values include the bandwidth needed also for the transport\nand IP layers.
    When using SDP in protocols like SAP, SIP and RTSP and\nthe involved hosts reside
    in networks running different IP versions,\nthe interpretation of what type of
    lower layers that is included is\nnot clear. This documents defines a bandwidth
    modifier that does not\ninclude transport overhead, instead additional packet
    rate attributes\nare defined. The transport independent bitrate value together
    with\nthe packet rate can then be used to calculate the real bitrate over\nthe
    actually used transport.\n\t </p>\n      "
