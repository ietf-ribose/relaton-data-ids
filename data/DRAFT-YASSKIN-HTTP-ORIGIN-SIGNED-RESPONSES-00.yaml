abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document explores how a server can send particular responses\n
    \  that are authoritative for an origin, when the server itself is not\n   authoritative
    for that origin.  For now, it focuses on the\n   constraints covering any such
    mechanism.\n\nNote to Readers\n\n   Discussion of this draft takes place on the
    HTTP working group\n   mailing list (ietf-http-wg@w3.org), which is archived at\n
    \  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/.\n\n   The source code and
    issues list for this draft can be found in\n   https://github.com/WICG/webpackage.\n\n\t
