abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines an optional Bundle Protocol block called theSuperseding
    Bundle Extension Block (SBEB) for use with the BundleProtocol in the context of
    the Delay-Tolerant NetworkingArchitecture. Applications use this block to call
    for the removal ofpreviously sent bundles that are rendered obsolete by more recentbundles.
    Upon receiving a bundle with an SBEB, a node will searchits bundle store (and
    outbound queues) for bundles that are obsoletedby other related bundles according
    to their source and destinationEID, and the SBEB cookie (if present), and may
    delete some or all ofthem. Discarding obsolete bundles helps conserve storage
    space andprevents expending resources in further forwarding bundles that areno
    longer relevant. The bundle protocol already uses expirationtimes to remove bundles
    that are no longer useful to applications.The SBEB is a way for applications to
    mark bundles that a node maydelete prior to their expiration times.</p>"
