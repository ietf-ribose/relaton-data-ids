abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The base Mobile IP allows a host to transparently send datagrams
    to\nmobile nodes as it would to any other nodes. Datagrams addressed to\nthe mobile
    are always routed via the Home Agent in the home network.\nHowever, as the mobile
    node moves away from its home network, it may\nno longer be topologically close
    to its home agent. Route\noptimization [MIP-OPTIM] has been proposed to allow
    a host to send\npackets to the mobile as a mobile node (MN) moves, without having
    to\nroute the packets via the home agent each time.  The mobile provides\nits
    current address to a host (or correspondent node, CN) that it is\ncommunicating
    with as it moves. The host updates the cache of the\nmobile location with this
    new address and tunnels datagrams\n(addressed to the mobile) to the current address
    of the mobile.\nHowever not all correspondent nodes are capable of tunneling IP\ndatagrams
    as required by the route optimization mechanisms described\nin [MIP-OPTIM]. More
    importantly, disclosing the current location (or\nCOA) of the mobile node to correspondent
    nodes is not always\ndesirable, nor is the overhead of encapsulating datagram
    to the MN\nideal.\n\t </p>\n      "
