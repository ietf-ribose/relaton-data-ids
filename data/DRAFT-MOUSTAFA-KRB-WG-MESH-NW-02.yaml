abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents the problem of authentication and\n
    \  authorization in wireless mesh networks constituted by several users\n   communicating
    with application servers and communicating with each\n   other in a single or
    multi-hop fashion.  Each user in this\n   environment can also play the role of
    an application provider.\n\n   Imagine a large music event where the provided
    network infrastructure\n   is enhanced with network storage equipment to allow
    visitors to\n   access content relating to the bands playing at the events, such
    as\n   recorded video of previous performances, supplementary audio and\n   video
    material relevant to the bands playing, etc.  Certain content\n   is, however,
    not necessarily available to everyone under the same\n   conditions.  Instead
    access control is applied before the full range\n   of audio, and video material
    can be accessed.  Other content, such as\n   previews, might be offered for free.
    \ How can such authentication,\n   and authorization infrastructure be made available
    with minimal\n   configuration complexity for a temporary event like a music festival?\n\n
    \  This document lists the requirements for a potentially needed\n   Kerberos
    extension and presents a solution proposal based on the\n   attempt to use a Kerberos
    extension for mutual authentication in\n   wireless mesh networks.\n\n\t </p>\n
