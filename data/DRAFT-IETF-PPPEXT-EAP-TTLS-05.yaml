abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>EAP-TTLS is an EAP protocol that extends EAP-TLS. In EAP-TLS,
    a TLS \n   handshake is used to mutually authenticate a client and server. EAP-\n
    \  TTLS extends this authentication negotiation by using the secure \n   connection
    established by the TLS handshake to exchange additional \n   information between
    client and server. In EAP-TTLS, the TLS \n   handshake may be mutual; or it may
    be one-way, in which only the \n   server is authenticated to the client. The
    secure connection \n   established by the handshake may then be used to allow
    the server to \n   authenticate the client using existing, widely-deployed \n
    \  authentication infrastructures such as RADIUS. The authentication of\n   the
    client may itself be EAP, or it may be another authentication \n   protocol such
    as PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP or MS-CHAP-V2.\n\t </p>\n      "
