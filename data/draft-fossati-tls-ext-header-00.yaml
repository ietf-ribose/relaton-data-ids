abstract:
- content: '<p>This document proposes a mechanism to extend the record header in TLS
    and DTLS. To that aim, the (D)TLS header is modified as follows: the length field
    is trimmed to 15 bits, and the length''s top bit is given the "record header extension
    indicator" semantics, allowing a sender to signal that one or more record header
    extensions have been added to this record. We define the generic format of a record
    header extension and the general rules associated with its handling. Any details
    regarding syntax, semantics and negotiation of a specific record header extension,
    are left to future documents.</p>'
