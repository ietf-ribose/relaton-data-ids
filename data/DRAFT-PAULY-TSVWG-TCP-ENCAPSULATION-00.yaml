abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network protocols other than TCP, such as UDP, are often blocked
    or\n   suboptimally handled by network middleboxes.  One strategy that\n   applications
    can use to continue to send non-TCP traffic on such\n   networks is to encapsulate
    datagrams or messages within in a TCP\n   stream.  However, encapsulating datagrams
    within TCP streams can lead\n   to performance degradation.  This document provides
    guidelines for\n   how to use TCP for encapsulation, a summary of performance
    concerns,\n   and some suggested mitigations for these concerns.\n\n\t </p>\n
