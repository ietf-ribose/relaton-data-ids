abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NMDA architectural framework eliminates the need to duplicate
    data\n   structures to provide separate configuration and operational state\n
    \  sections and uses different datastores and new protocol operations to\n   distinct
    configuration from operation state.  However when non-NMDA\n   clients communicate
    with NMDA aware server, it is not clear whether\n   the NMDA aware server can
    use existing operation to return the same\n   results with &lt;rpc-reply&gt; as
    non-NMDA-aware server does.\n\n   This document identifies some of the major challenges,
    and provides\n   solutions that are able to mitigate those challenges and smooth
    the\n   migration towards NMDA deployment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
