abstract:
- content: "<p>IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide connectivity between sites
    across an IP/MPLS backbone. These VPNs can be operated using BGP/MPLS, and a single
    Provider Edge (PE) node may provide access to multiple customer sites belonging
    to different VPNs. The VPNs may support a number of customer services, including
    RSVP and Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) traffic.
    This document describes how to support RSVP-TE between customer sites when a single
    PE supports multiple VPNs and labels are not used to identify VPNs between PEs.</p>"
