abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes \"Zone-ID Free\" functions that make
    end\n   users free from using zone identifiers (Zone-ID) for IPv6 link-\n   local
    addresses.\n\n   When users deal with IPv6 link-local addresses, it is thought
    that\n   it is mandatory thing to specify accompanied Zone-IDs. For end\n   users,
    however, it is troublesome and nuisance thing to do it.\n   Because it is very
    hard for normal end users to find appropriate\n   Zone-IDs for this purpose.\n\n
    \  From another viewpoint, the usage of IPv6 link-local addresses\n   accompanied
    with Zone-IDs is quite different from the traditional\n   usage of global addresses.
    Therefore many problems related with\n   Zone-ID are caused and new specifications
    are required to fix these\n   problems.\n\n   This document explores and describes
    how \"Zone-ID Free\" functions\n   work and how end users are released from using
    Zone-IDs when they\n   deal with IPv6 link-local addresses.\n\n   The \"Zone-ID
    Free\" functions are upper compatible with the current\n   usages of dealing with
    IPv6 link-local addresses and harmless to\n   the existing communications.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
