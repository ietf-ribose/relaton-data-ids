abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 5905 [RFC5905], section 7.3, \"Packet Header Variables\",
    defines\n   the value of the REFID, the system peer for the responding host.  In\n
    \  the past, for IPv4 associations the IPv4 address is used, and for\n   IPv6
    associations the first four octets of the MD5 hash of the IPv6\n   are used.  There
    are two recognized shortcomings to this approach,\n   and this proposal addresses
    them.  One is that knowledge of the\n   system peer is \"abusable\" information
    and should not be generally\n   available.  The second is that the four octet
    hash of the IPv6\n   address looks very much like an IPv4 address, and this is
    confusing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
