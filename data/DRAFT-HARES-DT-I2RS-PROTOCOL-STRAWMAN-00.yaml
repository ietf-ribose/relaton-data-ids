abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a strawman proposal for the I2RS protocol\n
    \  covering the ephemeral data store and data flow requirements not\n   covered
    by i2rs publication/subscription service or traceability.  It\n   also proposes
    additions to YANG for the ephemeral data store and for\n   additional data flow
    requirements.  It proposes additions to the\n   NETCONF and RESTCONF for these
    additions.  Future versions of this\n   document will propose changes to support
    the I2RS protocol security\n   requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
