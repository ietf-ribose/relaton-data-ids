abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile Ad Hoc Networks need an auto-configuration protocol being
    able\nto satisfy their self-deployment requirements while remaining\nflexible
    enough to accommodate special features for different\ndevices.\n\nThe Extensible
    Manet Auto-configuration Protocol (EMAP) tries to\nfullfil these requirements
    both for IPv4 and IPv6 mobile ad hoc\nnetworks.  It provides auto-configuration
    mechanisms for isolated as\nwell as hybrid MANETs, and is envisioned to be integrated
    within\nunicast routing protocols (like DYMO [1] or OLSRv2 [2]).\n\nEMAP allows
    nodes to create a (highly likely) unique IP address which\ncan be used locally
    inside the MANET.  In a similar way, nodes can\nauto-configure globally routable
    IP addresses when one (or more)\ngateways to the Internet are present in the network.
    \ The general\nframework provided by the protocol may be used as a service discovery\nprotocol
    for MANETs.  As an example, this document also specifies an\noptional feature
    which consists on the discovery of DNS servers\nreachable from the MANET.  However,
    the approach is extensible to\nother services like SIP proxies, authentication
    entities, etc.\nTherefore, EMAP has been designed taking into consideration the\npossibility
    of extending it later on with new features, uses, and\noptimizations.\n\t </p>\n
