abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains the GNU Name System (GNS) technical specification.
    GNS is a decentralized and censorship-resistant name system that provides a privacy-enhancing
    alternative to the Domain Name System (DNS). This document defines the normative
    wire format of resource records, resolution processes, cryptographic routines
    and security considerations for use by implementers. This specification was developed
    outside the IETF and does not have IETF consensus. It is published here to inform
    readers about the function of GNS, guide future GNS implementations, and ensure
    interoperability among implementations including with the pre- existing GNUnet
    implementation.</p>"
