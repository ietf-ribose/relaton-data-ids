abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Building on already available security formats and message
    transports\n   (like PGP/MIME for email), and with the intention to stay\n   interoperable
    to systems widespreadly deployed, pretty Easy privacy\n   (pEp) describes protocols
    to automatize operations (key management,\n   key discovery, private key handling
    including peer-to-peer\n   synchronization of private keys and other user data
    across devices)\n   that have been seen to be barriers to deployment of end-to-end
    secure\n   interpersonal messaging. pEp also relies on \"Trustwords\" (as a word\n
    \  mapping of of fingerprints) to verify communication peers and\n   proposes
    a trust rating system to denote secure types of\n   communications and signal
    the privacy level available on a per-user\n   and per-message level.  In this
    document, the general design choices\n   and principles of pEp are outlined.\n\n\t
