abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification clarifies the Diameter realm based request routing.
    We focus on the case where a Network Access Identifier in the User-Name AVP is
    used to populate the Destination-Realm AVP and the Network Access Identifier contains
    more than one realm. This particular case is possible when the Network Access
    Identifier decoration is used to force a routing of request messages through a
    predefined list of realms. However, this functionality is not unambiguously specified
    in the Diameter Base Protocol specification.</p>"
