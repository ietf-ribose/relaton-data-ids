abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft describes a hierarchical addressing scheme for
    IPv6, intentionally very much simplified to allow for ultralow latency source
    routing experimentation using simple forwarding nodes. Research groups evaluate
    achievable latency reduction for special applications such as radio access networks,
    industrial net- works or other networks requiring very low latency.</p>"
