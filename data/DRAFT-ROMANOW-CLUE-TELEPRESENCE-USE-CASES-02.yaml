abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Telepresence conferencing systems seek to create the sense
    of really\n   being present.  A number of techniques for handling audio and video\n
    \  streams are used to create this experience.  When these techniques\n   are
    not similar, interoperability between different systems is\n   difficult at best,
    and often not possible.  Conveying information\n   about the relationships between
    multiple streams of media would allow\n   senders and receivers to make choices
    to allow telepresence systems\n   to interwork.  This memo describes the most
    typical and important use\n   cases for sending multiple streams in a telepresence
    conference.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
