abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a new content format encoding that can be used to
    combine several different media types into a single CoAP message- body. The proposed
    encoding provides a cheap framing facility aimed at minimizing the overhead bits
    as much as possible. Its main use case is for applications whose purpose is as
    simple as just pulling together a number of known content formats, with the caveat
    that their juxtaposition must not raise any semantic ambiguity on the receiving
    side (i.e. strictly ordered, with no optional parts).</p>"
