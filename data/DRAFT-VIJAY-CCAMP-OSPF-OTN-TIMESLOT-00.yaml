abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the extensions needed to OSPF for\n
    \  advertising the constraints that exists in some OTN switches while\n   switching
    timeslots between ports. This advertisement would be\n   needed for computing
    path of LSP through these switches taking into\n   account the above mentioned
    constraint.\n\n   This document proposes extensions to existing OSPF for advertising\n
    \  the timeslots available on each OTN port in a new sub-tlv and the\n   connectivity
    matrix representing the capability of the device to\n   cross connect these timeslots
    in another new sub-tlv\n\n\t </p>\n      "
