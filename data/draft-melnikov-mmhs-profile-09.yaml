abstract:
  content: "<p>A Military Message Handling System (MMHS) processes formal messages
    ensuring release, distribution, security, and timely delivery across national
    and international strategic and tactical networks. The MMHS Elements of Service
    have been defined as a set of extensions to the ITU-T X.400 (1992) international
    standards and are specified in STANAG 4406 Edition 2 or ACP 123. This document
    specifies how a messaging service that meets these service definitions can be
    provided using the SMTP family of protocols. It defines a profile that can be
    used by those wishing to ensure that these services are provided.</p>"
