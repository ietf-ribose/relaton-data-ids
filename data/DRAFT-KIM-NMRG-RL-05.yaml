abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents intelligent network management based
    on\n   Artificial Intelligent (AI) such as reinforcement-learning\n   approaches.
    \ In a heterogeneous network, intelligent management with\n   Artificial Intelligent
    should usually provide real-time connectivity,\n   the type of network management
    with the quality of real-time data,\n   and transmission services generated by
    an application service.  With\n   that reason intelligent management system is
    needed to support real-\n   time connection and protection through efficient management
    of\n   interfering network traffic for high-quality network data\n   transmission
    in the both cloud and IoE network systems.\n   Reinforcement-learning is one of
    the machine learning algorithms that\n   can intelligently and autonomously provide
    to management systems over\n   a communication network.  Reinforcement-learning
    has developed and\n   expanded with deep learning technique based on model-driven
    or data-\n   driven technical approaches so that these trendy techniques have
    been\n   widely to intelligently attempt an adaptive networking models with\n
    \  effective strategies in environmental disturbances over variety of\n   networking
    areas.  For Network AI with the intelligent and effective\n   strategies, intent-based
    network (IBN) can be also considered to\n   continuously and automatically evaluate
    network status under required\n   policy for dynamic network optimization.  The
    key element for the\n   intent-based network is that it provides a verification
    of whether\n   the represented network intent is implementable or currently\n
    \  implemented in the network.  Additionally, this approach need to\n   provide
    to take action in real time if the desired network state and\n   actual state
    are inconsistent.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
