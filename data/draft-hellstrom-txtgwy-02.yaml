abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IP networks can support real-time text communication. SIP-basedreal-
    time text is called Text-over-IP or ToIP. PSTN networkssupport real-time text
    using textphones (or TTYs). When real-timetext is supported by different networks,
    gateways are needed toprovide interoperability. Real-time text capable gateways
    may alsosupport real-time voice.This specification describes procedures for interworking
    between ToIPand PSTN textphones using a real-time text capable gateway (RTTgateway).
    It also describes ways to route calls to RTT gateways forseveral call scenarios.Procedures
    that support the phased introduction of RTT gateways andprocedures that support
    the invocation of text channels at any timeduring the call are included. Interworking
    of PSTN textphones thatdo not support simultaneity of voice and text with IP User
    Agentsthat support simultaneous voice and text is also described.</p>"
