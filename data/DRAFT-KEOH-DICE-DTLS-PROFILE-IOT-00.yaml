abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document collects various implementation challenges of
    DTLS on\n   embedded systems, and proposes a profile of DTLS for CoAP-based\n
    \  Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Specially, this document\n   investigate
    the application features and functionality of DTLS\n   protocol, the fragmentation
    issue of DTLS Handshake protocol, and the\n   complexity of the DTLS Handshake
    state machine. A RESTful DTLS\n   Handshake which relies on CoAP Block-wise Transfer
    is proposed to\n   address the fragmentation issue. The next step is to define
    a DTLS\n   profile for embedded systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
