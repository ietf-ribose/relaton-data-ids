abstract:
- content: "<p>Cyber-physical systems and the Industrial Internet of Things are characterized
    by diverse sets of requirements which can hardly be satisfied using standard networking
    technology. One example are latency-critical computations which become increasingly
    complex and are consequently outsourced to more powerful cloud platforms for feasibility
    reasons. The intrinsic physical propagation delay to these remote sites can already
    be too high for given requirements. The challenge is to develop techniques that
    bring together these requirements. Utilizing available computational capabilities
    within the network for COIN can be a solution to this challenge. This document
    discusses selected industrial use cases to demonstrate how COIN can be applied
    to the industrial domain and to point out essential requirements of industrial
    applications.</p>"
