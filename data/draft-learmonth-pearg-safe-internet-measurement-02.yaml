- content: "<p>Researchers from industry and academia will often use Internet measurements
    as a part of their work. While these measurements can give insight into the functioning
    and usage of the Internet, they can come at the cost of user privacy. This document
    describes guidelines for ensuring that such measurements can be carried out safely.
