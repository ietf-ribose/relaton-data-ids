abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the zone identifier of an IPv6 scoped address,
    defined as &lt;zone_id&gt; in the IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture (RFC 4007),
    can be represented in a literal IPv6 address and in a Uniform Resource Identifier
    that includes such a literal address. It updates the URI Generic Syntax specification
    (RFC 3986) accordingly, and obsoletes RFC 6874.</p>"
