abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends PASSporT, which is specified in RFC 8225
    to\n   convey cryptographically-signed information about the people involved\n
    \  in personal communications, to include an indication that a call has\n   been
    diverted from its original destination to a new one.  This\n   information can
    greatly improve the decisions made by verification\n   services in call forwarding
    scenarios.  Also specified here is an\n   encapsulation mechanism for nesting
    a PASSporT within another\n   PASSporT that assists relying parties in some diversion
    scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
