    \  Standards\"), which contained a snapshot of the Standards Track\n   documents
    as of May 2008, and moves RFC 5000 to Historic.  This\n   document also retires
    the subseries identifier STD 1, which has\n   previously been associated with
    publications of the \"Internet\n   Official Protocol Standrds\".\n\n\t </p>\n
