abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a method to set up a Layer 2 tunnel over
    \nEthernet-based networks. For this purpose, the ports of an Ethernet \nswitch
    are configured to forward VLAN tag-labeled frames incoming \nfrom a certain port
    to another unambiguous port by using only the \nVLAN tag information. The Ethernet
    switches form the transport plane \nand are a part of Label Switching Routers
    (LSRs). In the control \nplane the VLAN tags are distribute using Label Distribution
    Protocol \n(LDP) and Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-\nTE).
    To enable LDP and RSVP-TE to fulfil that function, this document \nproposes extensions
    in these protocols. The introduced method \nsimplifies the control and management
    of wide area Ethernet networks \nand limits the distribution of broadcast/multicast
    frames. \n \n\t </p>\n      "
