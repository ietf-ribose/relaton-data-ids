abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a unified framework of mobility management in terms
    of abstracted logical functions. It is shown that mip, pmip, and several of their
    extensions can be expressed in terms of different configurations of these logical
    functions. Such a unified framework provides a convenient view on gap analysis
    of existing protocols, and also on the needed re-configurations of the logical
    functions as well as the needed extensions towards distributed mobility management.</p>"
