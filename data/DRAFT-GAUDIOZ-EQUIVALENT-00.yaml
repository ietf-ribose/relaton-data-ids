abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes EDS (Equivalent Differentiated Services),
    a\nnew building-block for a simple, robust, free and scalable end-to-end\nservice
    differentiation in IP networks.  The EDS scheme aims at\nproviding a spectrum
    of 'different but equivalent' network services\nthat offer a trade-off between
    delay and loss rate to the end-to-end\nflows.  The EDS scheme can be deployed
    incrementally in the Internet.\n\t </p>\n      "
