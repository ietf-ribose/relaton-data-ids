abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a new Hop-by-Hop IPv6 option that is
    used to\n   record the minimum Path MTU from a source to a destination host.\n
    \  This collects a minimum recorded MTU along the path to the\n   destination.
    \ The value can then be communicated back to the source\n   host by an ICMPv6
    Packet Too Big message.\n\n   This Hop-by-Hop option is intended to be used in
    environments like\n   Data Centers and on paths between Data Centers, to allow
    them to\n   better take advantage of paths able to support a large Path MTU.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
