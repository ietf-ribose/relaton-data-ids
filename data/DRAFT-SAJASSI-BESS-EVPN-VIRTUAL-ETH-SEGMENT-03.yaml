abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EVPN and PBB-EVPN introduce a family of solutions for multipoint\n
    \  Ethernet services over MPLS/IP network with many advanced\n   capabilities
    among which their multi-homing capabilities. These\n   solutions define two types
    of multi-homing for an Ethernet Segment\n   (ES): 1) Single-Active and 2) All-Active,
    where an Ethernet Segment\n   is defined as a set of links between the multi-homed
    device/network\n   and the set of PE devices that they are connected to.\n\n   Some
    Service Providers want to extend the concept of the physical\n   links in an ES
    to Ethernet Virtual Circuits (EVCs) where many of such\n   EVCs can be aggregated
    on a single physical External Network-to-\n   Network Interface (ENNI). An ES
    that consists of a set of EVCs\n   instead of physical links is referred to as
    a virtual ES (vES). This\n   draft describes the requirements and the extensions
    needed to support\n   vES in EVPN and PBB-EVPN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
