abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Demultiplexing and decoding an MPEG2 Transport Stream (MPEG2-TS)\nrequires
    the knowledge of specific information about the transport\nstream, which we refer
    to as the MPEG2-TS Preamble.  While this\ninformation is spread over different
    locations throughout the\ntransport stream and can be eventually assembled after
    some time a\nreceiver started receiving the MPEG2-TS, the time it takes to\nretrieve
    all this information (especially in multicast environments)\nmay be long.  Instead,
    having this information readily available as a\nPreamble and sending the Preamble
    to a receiver that will shortly\nstart receiving the transport stream will virtually
    eliminate the\nwaiting time and let the receiver start processing/decoding the\nMPEG2-TS
    sooner.  In this document, we give an overview of the\nMPEG2-TS and the delay
    components in video systems, and motivate the\nneed for constructing and using
    the MPEG2-TS Preamble for rapidly\nacquiring the source stream in RTP multicast
    sessions.  We also\ndefine and register the RTP payload format for the MPEG2-TS
    Preamble.\n\t </p>\n      "
