abstract:
- content: "<p>Network integrated applications want simple ways to access YANG objects
    and subtrees which might be distributed across network. Performance requirements
    may dictate that it is unaffordable for a subset of these applications to go through
    existing centralized management brokers. For such applications, development complexity
    must be minimized. Specific aspects of complexity developers want to ignore include:
    o whether authoritative information is actually sourced from remote datastores
    (as well as how to get to those datastores), o whether such information has been
    locally cached or not, o whether there are zero, one, or more controllers asserting
    ownership of information, and o whether there are interactions with other applications
    concurrently running elsewhere The solution requirements described in this document
    detail what is needed to support application access to authoritative network YANG
    objects from controllers (star) or peering network devices (mesh) in such a way
    to meet these goals.</p>"
