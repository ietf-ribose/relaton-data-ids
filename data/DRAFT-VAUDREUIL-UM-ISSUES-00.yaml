abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discussed issues and requirements for a profile
    of the \nIMAP 4, message submission, and notification protocols for use by \ntelephone
    user interfaces delivering the traditional voice mail user \nexperience.  Experience
    with IMAP 4 and voice mail systems has shown \nquite a few limitations that may
    be addressed by protocol extensions and \nstandardized conventions between clients
    and servers.\n\t </p>\n      "
