abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes suggested practices for combined use
    of the\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and\n
    \  Presence Protocol (XMPP).  Such practices aim to provide a single\n   fully
    featured real-time communication service by using complementary\n   subsets of
    features from each of the protocols.  Typically such\n   subsets would include
    telephony capabilities from SIP and instant\n   messaging and presence capabilities
    from XMPP.  This specification\n   does not define any new protocols or syntax
    for either SIP or XMPP.\n   However, implementing the practices outlined in this
    document may\n   require modifying or at least reconfiguring existing client and\n
    \  server-side software.  Also, it is not the purpose of this document\n   to
    make recommendations as to whether or not such combined use should\n   be preferred
    to the mechanisms provided natively by each protocol\n   (for example, SIP's SIMPLE
    or XMPP's Jingle).  It merely aims to\n   provide guidance to those who are interested
    in such a combined use.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
