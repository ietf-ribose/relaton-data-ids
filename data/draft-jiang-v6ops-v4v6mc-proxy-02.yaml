abstract:
- content: "<p>During the long co-existing period of IPv6 and IPv4, the interoperation
    between IPv6 network and IPv4 network is essential. Multicast services across
    IPv6 and IPv4 networks are also needed. Besides the packet-based multicast translation
    mechanism, this document describes a multicast proxy solution. The solution is
    a multicast deployment for transition scenario. It does not propose any new protocol
    or protocol modification/extension for multicast. The multicast proxy is deployed
    at the border of IPv6/IPv4 networks. It is mainly based on content cache. Without
    packet-based translation, it acquires the content data from IPvX network, caches
    the data, and multicasts the data in IPvY network. It acts as a multicast leaf
    in the IPvX network where the data source locates while acting as a multicast
    source in IPvY network where the multicast client locates.</p>"
