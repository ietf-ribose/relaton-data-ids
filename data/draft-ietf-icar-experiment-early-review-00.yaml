abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo captures current working group rough consensus on procedures
    for improved cross-area early review in the IETF. It is a product of the ICAR
    working group. This memo describes an experiment to improve early cross-area review
    in the IETF. Early cross-area review aims to improve quality of IETF work by identifying
    problems early in document development. Improved quality may, in turn, mean that
    documents can be processed faster in the IESG.</p>"
