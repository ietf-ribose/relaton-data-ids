abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is initiated
    by a DHCP\n   client.  A DHCP server can force DHCP client to send DHCPRENEW by\n
    \  sending a DHCPFORCERENEW message.  There may be multiple DHCP network\n   devices
    connected in between a DHCP client and a server, each one\n   reserving resources
    for the DHCP client.  There are no DHCP messages\n   that a relay can initiate
    in order to control the client binding.\n\n   A DHCP client may not always send
    a DHCPRELEASE message when it no\n   longer needs the IP address.  This document
    specifies a way to\n   request release message to be initiated by an intermediate
    DHCP\n   network device, e.g.  DHCP relay, on behalf of DHCP client.  This\n   helps
    relinquish network resources sooner than the lease expiration\n   time.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
