abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a standard algorithm to back-off link-state IGP
    SPF computations. Having one standardized algorithm improves interoperability
    by reducing the probability and/or duration of transient forwarding loops during
    the IGP convergence in the area/level when the network reacts to multiple consecutive
    events.</p>"
