abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Different routing protocols employ different mechanisms for
    securing\n   protocol packets on the wire.  While most already have some method\n
    \  for accomplishing cryptographic message authentication, in many cases\n   the
    existing methods are dated, vulnerable to attack, and employ\n   cryptographic
    algorithms that have been deprecated.  The \"Keying and\n   Authentication for
    Routing Protocols\" (KARP) effort aims to overhaul\n   and improve these mechanisms.\n\n
    \  This document does not contain protocol specifications.  Instead, it\n   defines
    the areas where protocol specification work is needed and a\n   set of requirements
    for KARP design teams to follow.  RFC 6518,\n   \"Keying and Authentication for
    Routing Protocols (KARP) Design\n   Guidelines\" is a companion to this document;
    KARP design teams will\n   use them together to review and overhaul routing protocols.
    \ These\n   two documents reflect the input of both the IETF Security Area and\n
    \  IETF Routing Area in order to form a mutually agreeable work plan.\n\n   This
    document has three main parts.  The first part provides an\n   overview of the
    KARP effort.  The second part lists the threats from\n   RFC 4593 (Generic Threats
    To Routing Protocols) that are in scope for\n   attacks against routing protocol
    transport systems.  This includes\n   any mechanisms built into the routing protocols
    themselves, to\n   authenticate packets.  The third part enumerates the requirements\n
    \  that routing protocol specifications must meet when addressing those\n   threats
    for RFC 6518's \"Work Phase 1\", the update to a routing\n   protocol's existing
    transport security.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
