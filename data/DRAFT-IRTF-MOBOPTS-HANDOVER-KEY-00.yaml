abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multiple IPv6 handover optimization protocols (for example, Fast
    Mobile \nIPv6 and Context Transfer Protocol) require an Access Router to verify
    \nthat signaling received to perform an IP handover operation originated \nfrom
    a Mobile Node having authorization to claim a particular address \non the Access
    Router's wireless subnet. In this document, a method for \nsecuring such signaling
    is defined. The method utilizes a secret key \nsent from the Access Router to
    the Mobile Node prior to handover, \nencrypted with an RSA public key that the
    Mobile Node used to generate \nits Cryptographically Generated Address. The ability
    of the Mobile Node \nto decrypt the secret key verifies its possession of the
    private key \ncorresponding to the public key used to generate the address. This
    \nallows the Mobile Node to use the secret key to sign and authorize \nsignaling
    causing changes affecting traffic to and from that address. \nThe use of symmetric
    cryptography avoids the time consuming public key \noperation associated with
    using the RSA key directly during \nperformance-sensitive IP subnet handover.\n\t
