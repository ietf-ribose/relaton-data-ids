abstract:
  content: "<p>As time synchronization protocols are becoming increasingly common
    and widely deployed, concern about their exposure to various security threats
    is increasing. This document defines a set of requirements for security solutions
    for time synchronization protocols, focusing on the IEEE 1588 and NTP. This document
    also discusses the security impacts of time synchronization protocol practices,
    the time synchronization performance implications of external security practices,
    the dependencies between other security services and time synchronization.</p>"
