abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Future networks that support advanced services, such as those
    enabled\n   by 5G mobile networks, envision a set of overlay networks each with\n
    \  different performance and scaling properties.  These overlays are\n   known
    as network slices and are realized over a common underlay\n   network.  In the
    context of IETF technologies, they are known as IETF\n   network slices.\n\n   In
    order to support IETF network slicing, as well as to offer\n   enhanced VPN services
    in general, it is necessary to define a\n   mechanism by which specific resources
    (links and/or nodes) of an\n   underlay network can be used by a specific network
    slice, VPN, or set\n   of VPNs.  This document sets out such a mechanism for use
    in Segment\n   Routing networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
