abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft presents a Feedback Control extension to DifferentiatedServices.
    Differentiated Services have been designed for scalabilitythrough handling aggregates
    of traffic instead of individual flows asin the Integrated Services. However,
    it has been observed that the DSmechanism in some situations can hardly achieve
    the desired quality ofservice and may result in unfair conditions. To remedy theseproblems,
    this draft describes a general feedback control paradigmthat enables a network
    provider to impose a control mechanism upontheir DS domain. As an instance of
    the general framework, a feedbackcontrol mechanism is proposed. Our simulation
    analysis demonstratesthat the overall feedback controlled DS can offer a better
    resourceutilisation and a fair resource sharing. Such control mechanism canalso
    help enforce the desired service assurances. This document isintended to stimulate
    discussion in this direction. Further work isrequired to carefully define a set
    of primitive requirements thatenables interoperability. The pdf and ps version
    of this document are available at:http://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~keith/ietf-id/draft-chow-diffserv-fbctrl-00.pdf,.ps
    and recommended for the figures it contains.</p>"
