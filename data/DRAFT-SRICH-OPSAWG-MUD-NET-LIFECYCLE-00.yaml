abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes the lifecycle of MUD as seen from the\n
    \  perspective of a network operator.  It is informational and\n   intended to
    help provide perspective around the operation of a\n   network which connects
    MUD-supporting devices and uses MUD-\n   supporting network infrastructure.  All
    phases of network\n   operation that involves or affects MUD will be described.\n
    \  Considerations specific to device manufacturers will be described\n   elsewhere.
    \ Considerations relevant to network equipment\n   manufacturers and networking
    software authors will be described\n   where appropriate where MUD behavior is
    affected.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
