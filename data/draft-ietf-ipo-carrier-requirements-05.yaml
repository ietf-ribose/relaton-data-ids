abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft describes the major carrier's optical service requirements
    for the Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON) from both an end-user's
    as well as an operator's perspectives. Its focus is on the description of the
    service building blocks and service-related control plane functional requirements.
    The management functions for the optical services and their underlying networks
    are beyond the scope of this document.</p>"
