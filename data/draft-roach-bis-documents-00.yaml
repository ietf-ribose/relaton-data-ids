abstract:
- content: <p>This document discusses mechanisms the IETF has historically used for
    updating RFCs subsequent to their publication, and outlines an updated procedure
    for publishing newer versions (colloquially known as "bis versions") that is appropriate
    in certain circumstances. This procedure is expected to be easier for both authors
    and consumers of RFCs.</p>
