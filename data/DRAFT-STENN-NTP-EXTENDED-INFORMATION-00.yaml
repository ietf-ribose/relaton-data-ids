abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The network packet format used by NTP has changed very little
    between\n   NTPv1, defined by RFC 958 [RFC0958] in 1985, and NTPv4, defined by\n
    \  RFC 5905 [RFC5905].  The core network packet used by NTP has no spare\n   bits
    available for reporting additinal state information and no\n   larger data areas
    available for larger amounts of information.  This\n   proposal offers a new extension
    field that would contains this\n   additional information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
