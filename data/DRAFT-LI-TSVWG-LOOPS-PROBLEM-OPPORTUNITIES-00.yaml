abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Various overlay tunnels are used in networks including WAN,\n
    \  enterprise campus and others.  End to end paths are partitioned into\n   multiple
    segments using overlay tunnels to achieve better path\n   selection, lower latency
    and so on.  Traditional end-to-end transport\n   layers respond to packet loss
    slowly especially in long-haul\n   networks: They either wait for some signal
    from the receiver to\n   indicate a loss and then retransmit from the sender or
    rely on\n   sender's timeout which is often quite long.\n\n   LOOPS (Localized
    Optimization of Path Segments) attempts to provide\n   non end-to-end local based
    in-network recovery to achieve better data\n   delivery by making packet loss
    recovery faster.  In an overlay\n   network scenario, LOOPS can be performed over
    the existing, or\n   purposely created, overlay tunnel based path segments.\n\n
    \  This document illustrates the slow packet loss recovery problems\n   LOOPS
    tries to solve in some use cases and analyzes the impacts when\n   local in-network
    recovery is employed as a LOOPS mechanism.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
