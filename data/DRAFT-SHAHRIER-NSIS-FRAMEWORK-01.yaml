abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet Draft describes the end-to-end signaling architecture
    and \nframework model for transmitting packets through a series of \nheterogeneous
    networks. The Next-Steps-In-Signaling (NSIS) Working \nGroup is already working
    on defining a set of requirements for the QoS \nsignaling protocol [1]. This document
    is the follow on to the \nrequirements draft, and the precursor to any solutions
    document. It \noutlines a   framework for transporting end-to-end QoS parameters,
    \ninitiated and maintained by the 'Originator' of the service. \n \nThis draft
    elaborates on the requirements draft.  It defines more \nprecisely the scope of
    NSIS for end-to-end packet flows, in terms of  \nQoS Signaling, where the resource
    reservations for the service are  \ninitiated by the “Originator” end point and
    whether this service is bi-\ndirectional or unidirectional (i.e., receive-only
    or send-only). The \ndraft is fully backward compatible; it requires no changes
    to the \nexisting QoS signaling protocols or procedures. It applysapplies \ngeneric
    messages to transport  the information needed to establish the \ndesired QoS  for
    traffic flows in either one or both directions. This \ndocument can be used as
    the guideline for a prospective solution to the \nQoS signaling problem.\n\t </p>\n
