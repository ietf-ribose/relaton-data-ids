abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector and Dynamic Local Repair
    \n(AODV-DLR) routing protocol is intended for use by mobile nodes in\nan ad hoc
    network.  It offers quick adaptation to dynamic link \nconditions, low processing
    and memory overhead, low network \nutilization, and determines unicast routes
    to destinations within \nthe ad hoc network.  It adopts dynamic local repair in
    which a route \nrepair message is used to not only attempt to discovery a route
    to \ndestination, but also try to set up a route to downstream node (next\nhop
    or next two hop). It uses destination sequence numbers to ensure \nloop freedom
    at all times (even in the face of anomalous delivery of\nrouting control messages),
    avoiding problems (such as \"counting to \ninfinity\") associated with classical
    distance vector protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
