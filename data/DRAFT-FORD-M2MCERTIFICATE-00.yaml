abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The X.509 public key certificate format is overly verbose for\n
    \  Internet-of-Things (IoT) constrained environments, where nodes with\n   limited
    memory and networks with limited bandwidth are not uncommon.\n   The Machine-to-Machine
    (M2M) certificate format is a pruned down and\n   encoding-optimized replacement
    for X.509, which reuses much of the\n   X.509 semantics but reduces certificate
    sizes by typically 40%.  We\n   are proposing that IETF recognize the M2M format
    as an optional\n   replacement for X.509 in Internet applications including, but
    not\n   limited to, TLS and DTLS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
