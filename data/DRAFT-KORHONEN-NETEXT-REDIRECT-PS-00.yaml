abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses a Proxy Mobile IPv6 mobility session\nredirection
    functionality at the Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocol\nlevel.  The redirection
    functionality would allow a Local Mobility\nAnchor to redirect the Mobile Access
    Gateway during the Proxy Binding\nUpdate and Acknowledgement exchange to an alternative
    Local Mobility\nAnchor.  The benefit of redirection at the protocol level is that
    it\nremoves the dependence on having such functionality provided by the\nAuthentication,
    Authorization and, Accounting elements or the Domain\nName System in a Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 Domain.  Furthermore, doing the\nredirection at the base protocol level reduces
    the amount of\nsignaling, unnecessary costly setup of mobility sessions and\nunnecessary
    costly interactions with backend systems.\n\t </p>\n      "
