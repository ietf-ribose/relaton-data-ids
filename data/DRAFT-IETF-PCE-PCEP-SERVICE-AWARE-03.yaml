abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks like financial information network (stock/\n
    \  commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications,\n   Latency
    (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet Loss is\n   becoming a key requirement
    for path computation along with other\n   constraints and metrics.  Latency, Latency-Variation
    and Packet Loss\n   is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between\n
    \  customers and service providers.\n\n   [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS]
    describes mechanisms with\n   which network performance information is distributed
    via OSPF and\n   ISIS respectively.  The Path Computation Element Communication\n
    \  Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements\n   (PCEs)
    to perform path computations in response to Path Computation\n   Clients (PCCs)
    requests.  This document describes the extension to\n   PCEP to carry Latency,
    Latency-Variation and Packet Loss as\n   constraints for end to end path computation.\n\n\t
