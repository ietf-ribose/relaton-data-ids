abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SAM is a generic and simple mechanism for packets having addresses
    in\na family IPvX to traverse routing domains where this address family\nis not
    directly routed.\nSAM topological scenarios are those of Mesh Softwire, i.e. with
    point\nto multipoint tunnels between border nodes of interior routing\ndomains.
    \ In the mesh-softwire context, SAM differs from RFC 5565 in\nthat SAM uses no
    protocol between border nodes of the domain, and in\nthat customer border nodes
    don't need to maintain states for all\nother border nodes.  (RFC 5565 is based
    on an Exterior Border-Gateway\nProtocol e-BGP between border nodes, with dynamic
    routing tables to\nbe maintained in all of them).  SAM's address mappings are
    stateless,\nbased on only a few domain parameters.  SAM is thus suitable to small\nto
    medium enterprises, and small to medium ISPs, that cannot afford\ne-BGP in all
    their border nodes.  All combinations of IPv4 and IPv6,\nglobal or private, are
    supported.  Also, to mitigate consequences of\nthe IPv4 address shortage, SAM
    supports port-extended IPv4 addresses\n(A+P).\n\t </p>\n      "
