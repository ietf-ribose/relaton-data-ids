abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a simple process that allows authors
    of\n   Internet-Drafts to record the status of known implementations by\n   including
    an Implementation Status section.  This will allow\n   reviewers and working groups
    to assign due consideration to documents\n   that have the benefit of running
    code, by considering the running\n   code as evidence of valuable experimentation
    and feedback that has\n   made the implemented protocols more mature.\n\n   The
    process in this document is offered as an experiment.  Authors of\n   Internet-Drafts
    are encouraged to consider using the process for\n   their documents, and working
    groups are invited to think about\n   applying the process to all of their protocol
    specifications.  The\n   authors of this document intend to collate experiences
    with this\n   experiment and to report them to the community.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
