abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo presents a set of extensions for supporting explicit
    rate\ncongestion control using RSVP. It should be perceived as an extension\nto
    the RSVP functional specifications [RFC2205]\n   \nThese extensions include the
    standard format of the ER_SPEC object,\nand a description of RSVP's handling of
    the ER_SPEC object.\n   \nThis document does not advocate a particular distributed
    explicit\nrate congestion control algorithm.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
