abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Various proposals have been made for updating the IKE protocol.\nOne
    thing which is missing from the dicussion is an evaluation of the\nscope of IKE,
    identifying which problems it should solve.  Once this\nscoping is done, it becomes
    easier to specify the requirements for\nthe protocol, as well as the protocol
    itself.  Sections of this\ndocument discuss various scenarios that are considered
    important for\nIKE; this list needs to be refined by the WG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
