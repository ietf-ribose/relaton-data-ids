abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of this document is to describe the potential benefits when
    applications use a transport that enables Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).
    The document outlines the principal gains in terms of increased throughput, reduced
    delay and other benefits when ECN is used over a network path that includes equipment
    that supports ECN-marking. It also discusses challenges for successful deployment
    of ECN. It does not propose new algorithms to use ECN, nor does it describe the
    details of implementation of ECN in endpoint devices (Internet hosts), routers
    or other network devices.</p>"
