abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework for using existing, modified and
    potential new networking technologies as components to provide an Enhanced Virtual
    Private Networks (VPN+) service. The purpose is to support the needs of new applications,
    particularly applications that are associated with 5G services by utilizing an
    approach that is based on existing VPN technologies and adds features that specific
    services require over and above traditional VPNs. Typically, VPN+ will be used
    to form the underpinning of network slicing, but could also be of use in its own
    right. It is not envisaged that large numbers of VPN+ instances will be deployed
    in a network and, in particular, it is not intended that all VPNs supported by
    a network will use VPN+ techniques.</p>"
