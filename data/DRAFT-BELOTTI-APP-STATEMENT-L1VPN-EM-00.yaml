abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an applicability statement on the use
    of\n   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and\n   mechanisms
    to satisfy the requirements of the Layer 1 Virtual\n   Private Network (L1VPN)
    Enhanced Mode.\n\n   L1VPNs provide customer services and connectivity at layer
    1 over\n   layer 1 networks. The operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic\n
    \  Mode and the Enhanced Mode, where the Enhanced Mode of operation may\n   also
    include exchange of routing information between the layer 1\n   network and the
    customer domain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
