abstract:
- content: "<p>This informational document combines virtual layer3 routing and geospatial
    hierarchical grid forming a Geolocation mobility edge network. When vehicles with
    AI cameras detect objects of interest on the road, they use their GPS to calculate
    their high-resolution grid-tile position. They then use this tile to calculate
    the high-resolution tile of the detection. A low-resolution tile which contains
    the detection tile identifies a network-addressable shard. The shard tile ID is
    used as basis for IPv6 endpoint identifier (EID). Geospatial EIDs are the queue
    destination and channel source of shard Geolocation processes, consolidating detections
    form all vehicles in that area. Geolocation processes based on EID queues and
    channels are therefore portable via the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP).</p>"
