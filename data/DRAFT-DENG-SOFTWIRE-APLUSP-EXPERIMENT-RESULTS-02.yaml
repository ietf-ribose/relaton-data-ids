abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  This memo describes an implementation of A+P in a provider's
    IPv6-\n  only network. It provides details of the implementation, network\n  elements,
    configurations and test results as well. Besides\n  traditional port range A+P,
    a scattered port sets flavor of A+P is\n  also implemented to verify feasibility
    of offering non-continuous\n  port sets with A+P approach.\n\n  The test results
    consist of the application compatibility test, UPnP\n  1.0 extensions and UPnP
    1.0 friendly port allocation for A+P, port\n  usage and BitTorrent behaviors with
    A+P.\n\n  This memo focuses on the IPv6 flavor of A+P.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
