abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of
    path \n   computation in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label
    \n   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. \n\n   One key application
    of the PCE-based architecture is the computation\n   of inter-domain Traffic Engineering
    Label Switched Path (TE-LSP)  \n   paths(i.e. inter-area, inter-AS, inter-provider,
    etc.). In this case, \n   cooperation between PCEs is desirable due to the partial
    topology \n   visibility available to each separate PCE. Per-domain path \n   computation
    is another method that can be used to determine paths for \n   inter-domain TE-LSPs
    when PCE cooperation is not applied in the \n   network. \n\n   In practice, some
    Service Providers may choose not to implement PCEs \n   within their network that
    can cooperate with PCEs that are outside \n   their network. In this case, a scenario
    may exist where an LSP spans \n   multiple autonomous systems (ASes), some of
    which have PCEs capable \n   of cooperation with external PCEs and some of which
    do not. For \n   example, some ASes may be PCE-enabled, while others consist of
    just \n   normal LSRs.  \n\n   Another scenario arises if a PCE fails or becomes
    unreachable. This \n   gives rise to the same lack of inter-PCE cooperation.  \n\n
    \  Both cases are named Hybrid PCE Networks in this document. This \n   document
    describes the specific issues introduced for end-to-end path \n   computation
    in Hybrid PCE Networks and defines extensions to the PCE \n   Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) to perform inter-domain LSP computation \n   in Hybrid PCE Networks. \n\n\t
