abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies mechanisms for backward compatibility
    of\n   Ethernet VPN (EVPN) and Provider Backbone Bridge Ethernet VPN (PBB-\n   EVPN)
    solutions with Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) and Provider\n   Backbone Bridge
    VPLS (PBB-VPLS) solutions. It also provides\n   mechanisms for seamless integration
    of these two technologies in the\n   same MPLS/IP network on a per-VPN-instance
    basis. Implementation of\n   this document enables service providers to introduce
    EVPN/PBB-EVPN\n   PEs in their brown-field deployments of VPLS/PBB-VPLS networks.
    This\n   document specifies control-plane and forwarding behavior needed for\n
    \  auto-discovery of a VPN instance, multicast and unicast operation, as\n   well
    as MAC-mobility operation in order to enable seamless\n   integration between
    EVPN and VPLS PEs as well as between PBB-VPLS and\n   PBB-EVPN PEs.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
