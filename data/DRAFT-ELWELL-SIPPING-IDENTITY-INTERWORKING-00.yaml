abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document examines means of identifying or naming users of
    \ntelephony services within an enterprise. Numeric names (numbers) are \nused
    in traditional Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs) \nusing QSIG as the
    network signalling protocol. They are also used for \nexternal communication,
    e.g., with a public Integrated Services \nDigital Network (ISDN). Names need not
    be numeric in Internet \nProtocol (IP) networks employing signalling protocols
    such as the \nSession Initiation Protocol (SIP). This document therefore looks
    at \nnaming schemes that are appropriate within enterprise IP networks, in \nparticular
    enterprise IP networks employing SIP as the signalling \nprotocol. It also investigates
    naming schemes that are appropriate in \na mixed QSIG/SIP enterprise network and
    the treatment of names at an \ninterworking point. It details the use of names
    not only for \nselecting a user to participate in a call, but also as a means
    of \nidentifying a user in a call to other users in that call. ENUM and \nprivate
    ENUM-like services are also examined. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
