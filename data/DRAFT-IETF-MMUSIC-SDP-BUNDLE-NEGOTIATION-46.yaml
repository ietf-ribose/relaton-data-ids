abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a new Session Description Protocol
    (SDP)\n   Grouping Framework extension, 'BUNDLE'.  The extension can be used\n
    \  with the SDP Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a\n   single
    transport (5-tuple) for sending and receiving media described\n   by multiple
    SDP media descriptions (\"m=\" sections).  Such transport\n   is referred to as
    a BUNDLE transport, and the media is referred to as\n   bundled media.  The \"m=\"
    sections that use the BUNDLE transport form\n   a BUNDLE group.\n\n   To assist
    endpoints in negotiating the use of bundle this\n   specification defines a new
    SDP attribute, 'bundle-only', which can\n   be used to request that specific media
    is only used if bundled.  The\n   specification also updates RFC 3264, to allow
    assigning a zero port\n   value to a \"m=\" section without meaning that the media
    described by\n   the \"m=\" section is disabled or rejected.\n\n   When Real-time
    Transport Protocol (RTP)-based media is used, there\n   are multiple ways to correlate
    bundled RTP packets with the\n   appropriate \"m=\" section.  This specification
    defines a new RTP\n   Control Protocol (RTCP) source description (SDES) item and
    a new RTP\n   header extension that provides an additional way to do this\n   correlation
    by using them to carry a value that associates the RTP/\n   RTCP packets with
    a specific \"m=\" section.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
