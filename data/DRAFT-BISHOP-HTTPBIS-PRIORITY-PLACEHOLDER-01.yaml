abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC7540 defines HTTP/2, including a method for communicating\n
    \  priorities.  Some implementations have begun using closed streams as\n   placeholders
    when constructing their priority tree, but this has\n   unbounded state commitments
    and interacts poorly with HTTP/QUIC.\n   This document proposes an extension to
    the HTTP/2 priority scheme for\n   both protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
