abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes those features of a service which processessigned
    doucments which must be present in order for that service toconstitute a 'technical
    non-repudiation' service. A technicalnon-repudiation service must permit an independent
    verifier todetermine whether a given signature was applied to a given data objectby
    the private key associated with a given valid certificate, at a timelater than
    the signature. The features of a technical non-repudiationservice are expected
    to be necessary for a full non-repudiation service,although they may not be sufficient.This
    document is intended to clarify the definition of the'non-repudiation' service
    in RFC 2459. It should thus serve as a guideto when the nonRepudiation bit of
    the keyUsage extension should be usedand to when a Certificate Authority is required
    to archive CRL's.</p>"
