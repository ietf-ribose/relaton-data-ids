- content: "<p>This document defines a special form of RTP redundant packatization
    format for multimedia broadcast and multicast services to combat service interruptions
    caused by losses of large numbers of consecutive media frames. Along with the
    payload format, this document also defines the procedures the RTP sender and receiver
    will need to use to conceal the large frames losses.</p>"
