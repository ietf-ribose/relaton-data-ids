abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines a method by which a device or application
    maysignal information relating to current threat handling to otherdevices/applications
    that may reside locally or in the cloud. Theinitial focus is ddos mitigation;
    however, the method may be extendedto communicate any threat type. This will allow
    for a vendor orprovider agnostic approach to threat mitigation utilising multiplelayers
    of protection as the operator sees fit.The dissemination of threat information
    will occur utilising JSON RPCAPI over HTTPS communications between devices/applications
    and will beaugmented by IPFIX and UDP for signaling telemetry informationrelating
    to attacks and protected object data.An open standards based approach to communication
    between on-premiseDDoS mitigation devices and cloud based DDoS protection servicesallows
    for enterprises to have a wider range of options to bettersecure their environments
    without the limitations of vendor lock-in.</p>"
