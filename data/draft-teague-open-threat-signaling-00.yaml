abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a method by which a device or application may
    signal information relating to current threat handling to other devices/applications
    that may reside locally or in the cloud. The initial focus is ddos mitigation;
    however, the method may be extended to communicate any threat type. This will
    allow for a vendor or provider agnostic approach to threat mitigation utilising
    multiple layers of protection as the operator sees fit. The dissemination of threat
    information will occur utilising JSON RPC API over HTTPS communications between
    devices/applications and will be augmented by IPFIX and UDP for signaling telemetry
    information relating to attacks and protected object data. An open standards based
    approach to communication between on-premise DDoS mitigation devices and cloud
    based DDoS protection services allows for enterprises to have a wider range of
    options to better secure their environments without the limitations of vendor
    lock-in.</p>"
