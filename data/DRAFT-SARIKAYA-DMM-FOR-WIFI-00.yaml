abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As networks are moving towards flat architectures, a distributed\n
    \  approach is needed to mobility management.  This document defines a\n   distributed
    mobility management protocol.  Protocol is based on\n   mobility aware virtualized
    routing system with software-defined\n   network support.  Routing is in Layer
    2 in the access network and in\n   Layer 3 in the core network.  Smart phones
    access the network over\n   IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) interface and can move in home,
    hotspot and\n   enterprise buildings.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
