abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an experimental method to extend the
    option\n   space for connection parameters within the initial TCP SYN segment
    at\n   the start of a TCP connection.  In this method the TCP client sends\n   two
    alternative SYNs: one intended for legacy servers and one\n   intended for upgraded
    servers.  Once it establishes which type of\n   server has responded, it continues
    the connection appropriate to that\n   server type and aborts the other.  The
    SYN intended for upgraded\n   servers includes additional options at the end of
    the payload.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
