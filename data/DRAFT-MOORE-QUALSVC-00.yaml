abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes the use of RSVP [RFC2205] with applications\n
    \  that do not have resource requirements that may not be readily\n   quantifiable
    (qualitative applications). We introduce the\n   \\146qualitative\\106 service-type.
    This service-type can be used in\n   conjunction with RSVP signaling to manage
    the allocation of network\n   resources to traffic originating from qualitative
    applications. This\n   mode of RSVP usage is particularly applicable to networks
    that\n   combine differentiated service (diff-serv) QoS mechanisms with RSVP\n
    \  signaling [intdiff].\n\t </p>\n      "
