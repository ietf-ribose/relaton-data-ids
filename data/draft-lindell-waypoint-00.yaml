abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the Waypoint path oriented deliverymechanism.
    Waypoint attempts to rationalize the packetinterception problem that has been
    addressed by differentmechanisms such as router alert or RSVP protocol number
    46intercept. It borrows concepts from prior mechanisms,including the hop by hop
    security model of RSVP. Waypointstrives to be complete, eliminating the need to
    reimplementcommon functionality in the higher layers of the signalingprotocol
    stack.</p>"
