abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol
    is\n   designed to allow entities with knowledge about the network\n   infrastructure
    to export such information to applications that need\n   to choose one or more
    endpoints to connect to among large sets of\n   logically equivalent ones.  This
    document provides a collection of\n   messages that may be used to test the functionality
    and\n   interoperability of an ALTO client and an ALTO server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
