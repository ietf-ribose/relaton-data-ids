abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes BGMP, a protocol for inter-domain multicast\nrouting.
    BGMP builds shared trees for active multicast groups, and\nallows receiver domains
    to build source-specific, inter-domain,\ndistribution branches where needed. Building
    upon concepts from CBT and\nPIM-SM, BGMP requires that each multicast group be
    associated with a\nsingle root (in BGMP it is referred to as the root domain).
    \ BGMP\nassumes that at any point in time, different ranges of the class D space\nare
    associated (e.g., with MASC [MASC]) with different domains.  Each of\nthese domains
    then becomes the root of the shared domain-trees for all\ngroups in its range.
    \ Multicast participants will generally receive\nbetter multicast service if the
    session initiator's address allocator\nselects addresses from its own domain's
    part of the space, thereby\n\n\t </p>\n      "
