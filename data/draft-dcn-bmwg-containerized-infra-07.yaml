abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes considerations for benchmarking network performance
    in containerized infrastructures. In the containerized infrastructure, Virtualized
    Network Functions(VNFs) are deployed on an operating-system-level virtualization
    platform by abstracting the user namespace as opposed to virtualization using
    a hypervisor. Leveraging this, the system configurations and networking scenarios
    for benchmarking will be partially changed by the way in which the resource allocation
    and network technologies are specified for containerized VNFs. In this draft,
    we compare the state of the art in a container networking architecture with networking
    on VM-based virtualized systems and provide several test scenarios for benchmarking
    network performance in containerized infrastructures.</p>"
