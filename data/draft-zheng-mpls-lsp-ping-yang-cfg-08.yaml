abstract:
  content: "<p>When an LSP fails to deliver user traffic, the failure cannot always
    be detected by the MPLS control plane. RFC 8029 defines a mechanism that would
    enable users to detect such failure and to isolate faults. YANG, defined in RFC
    6020, is a data model definition language that was introduced to define the contents
    of a conceptual data stores that allows networked devices to be managed using
    NETCONF, as specified in RFC 6241. This document defines a YANG data model that
    can be used to configure and manage LSP-Ping.</p>"
