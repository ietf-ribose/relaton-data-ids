abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines an initial application of classical IP and
    ARP in\n   an IEEE 802.14 Community Access Television (CATV) Residential Access\n
    \  Network environment.  IEEE 802.14 services provide two independent\n   link
    layer service interfaces which are available to support IP\n   residential access
    networking services: traditional Ethernet bridging\n   (via IEEE 802.1D layer
    services) and residential ATM networking\n   services.\n \n   In this memo, the
    term Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS) is defined to\n   apply to Classical IP over
    ATM LIS's operating over IEEE 802.14\n   services as well as traditional IP over
    Ethernet operating over IEEE\n   802.14 services.\n \n   The recommendations in
    this draft rely on existing IETF standards for\n   the family of Classical IP
    and ARP over ATM (IPOA) services and for\n   IP and ARP over Broadcast Ethernet
    networks.  The tree-based\n   hierarchic nature of the IEEE 802.14 MAC subnetwork
    permits\n   convenient extensions to Classical IPOA model for broadcast and\n
    \  multicast in the downstream direction of the CATV plant.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
