abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Load balancing is a key factor for both IPv4 to IPv6 transitionmechnisms,
    e.g.NAT-PT or Tunnel broker, and Multihoming to improvetheir scalability and Robustness.
    In fact, that is a method, bywhich IP packet can be distributed across a pool
    of servers, insteadof directing to a single server.Load balancing has been widely
    usedby NAT, Web service and FTP service. However, current load balancingsoftware
    and implementations have problems such as poor scalability,inability to balance
    session flow, long latency time and topologicalconstraint on server pool.This
    document describes a method using pseudo-anycast and pseudo-mobility based on
    Mobile IPv6 to implement load balancing in sessionlevel in IPv6 network, by which
    those problems above can be solved.Futhermore, this method only need little modification
    to Mobile IPv6in the servers' and agent's side; as for the general users, it neednot
    any modification.</p>"
