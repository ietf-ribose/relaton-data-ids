abstract:
- content: "<p>When using the telnet protocol to talk to a remote device, as one would
    with RFC 2217, it would be useful to be able to determine if the remote server
    is active or not. In contrast with the ''Are You There'' sub-option, the return
    message is not mixed into the data stream presented to the user or client program,
    it is simply passed between the telnet client/server pair.</p>"
