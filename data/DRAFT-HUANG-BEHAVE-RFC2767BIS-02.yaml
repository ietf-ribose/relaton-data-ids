abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the \"Bump-In-the-Stack\" (BIS) host based\nprotocol
    translation mechanism that allows applications supporting\nonly one IP address
    family to communicate with peers that are\nreachable or supporting only the other
    address family.  Furthermore,\nthis technology avoids need for unnecessary double
    protocol\ntranslation in the case where destination is dual-stack enabled.\n\nThis
    specification addresses scenarios where a host is provided dual\nstack or IPv6
    only network connectivity.  In the dual stack network\ncase, single address family
    applications in the host will communicate\ndirectly with other hosts reachable
    with the different address\nfamily.  In the case of IPv6 only network or IPv6
    only destination,\nIPv4-originated communications have to be be translated into
    IPv6.\nIn the scenario of single address family access network, but dual-\nstack
    destination, network based translation is always avoided.\nTechnically, the BIS-enabled
    host resolves both IPv4 and IPv6\naddresses of the destination and behaves according
    to received\nresponses.\n\nAcknowledgement of previous work\n\nThis document is
    an update to and directly derivative from Kazuaki\nTSUCHIYA, Hidemitsu HIGUCHI,
    and Yoshifumi ATARASHI's [RFC2767],\nwhich similarly provides a dual stack host
    means to communicate with\nother IPv6 host using existing IPv4 appliations.The
    original document\nwas a product of the NGTRANS working group.\n\nThe changes
    in this document reflect three components\n\n\n1.  Supporting IPv6 only network
    connections\n\n\n2.  Extending ENR and address mapper to operate differently\n\n\n3.
    \ Adding an alternative way to implement the ENRStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft
