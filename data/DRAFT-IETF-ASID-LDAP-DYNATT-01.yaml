abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines dynamic attributes and the fashion in
    which they\n   are being set and used on entries in the directory.  This document\n
    \  builds heavily on the dynamic extensions to LDAP infrastructure as\n   defined
    in [1].\n \n   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [2] supports\n
    \  lightweight access to static directory services, allowing relatively\n   fast
    search and update access.  Static directory services store\n   information about
    people that persists in its accuracy and value over\n   a long period of time.\n\n
    \  The dynamic extension to LDAP as defined in [1] added the concept of\n   dynamic
    entries that only persist in the directory, when they are\n   periodically refreshed.
    \ This document takes this approach one step\n   farther and defines how dynamic
    attributes can be used, on either\n   static or dynamic entries, to handle up-to-date
    and dynamic\n   information about an entry in the directory.  An example use will
    be a\n   client or a person that has a static entry in the directory and\n   sometimes
    goes online, which is reflected in the 'online' attribute\n   for the entry.  To
    specify whether this person is online or offline -\n   an attribute that changes
    frequently, a client application will have\n   to modify this attribute relatively
    frequently.  The current location\n   of a person is another attribute that may
    change frequently.\n \n   Dynamic attributes must be periodically refreshed.  Otherwise,
    they\n   will disappear from the directory over time.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
