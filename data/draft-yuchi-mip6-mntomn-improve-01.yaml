abstract:
- content: <p>Any node communicating with a mobile node in Mobile IPv6 is referred
    to as a "correspondent node" of the mobile node, and may itself be either a stationary
    node or a mobile node. Communication between mobile nodes has additional complexity.
    This document specifies a solution to improve communication procedure between
    mobile nodes.</p>
