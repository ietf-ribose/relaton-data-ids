abstract:
- content: "<p>The first step of Transaction SIGnature (TSIG) (RFC 2845) is to generate
    a shared secret and exchange it manually between a DNS server and a host. This
    document, CGA-TSIG, proposes a possible way to automate the now manual process
    for the authentication of a node with a DNS server during the DNS Update process
    by using the same parameters as are used in generating a secure address in IPv6
    networks, i.e., Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) (RFC 3972). CGA-TSIG
    facilitates this authentication process and reduces the time needed for DNS Updates.
    The current signature generation process and verification mechanism in TSIG are
    thus replaced with CGA. This algorithm is added, as an extension, to TSIG to eliminate
    the human intervention needed for generation and exchange of keys between a DNS
    server and a host when SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) (RFC 3971) is used.</p>"
