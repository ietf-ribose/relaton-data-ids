abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Despite the variety of ways to realize mobility support in IP,
    there\n   is a common set of threats that each IP mobility protocol must\n   address.
    \ Awareness of these threats is paramount for protocol\n   engineers so that they
    can build appropriate security mechanisms into\n   their protocols.  This document
    defines a threat model that can serve\n   as a guidance for protocol engineers.\n\t
