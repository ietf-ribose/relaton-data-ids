abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Decoupling functions from the industrial hardware enables diverse,\n
    \  migratable, cross-industry replicable applications to be deployed\n   with
    flexibility at the edge and on the cloud.  Users should be free\n   to adjust
    their business policies in industrial IoT and with low\n   cost.  Therefore efficient
    and dynamic orchestration of the\n   applications is critical.  This document
    describes several use cases\n   that demonstrate the applicability of Service
    Function Chaining in\n   industrial edge computing to organize the applications
    and provides\n   extra requirements to support this applicability.\n\n\t </p>\n
