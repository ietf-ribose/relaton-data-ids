abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     This memo describes an  extension of RADIUS authentication
    protocol\n     (RFC2138)   and RADIUS accounting    protocol (RFC2139) to  provide\n
    \    authentication service about multicast receivers and senders to the\n     ingress
    and egress routers, and to  keep track of the receiving and\n     sending  clients
    for multicast data   feed service management.  New\n     services and  attributes
    are added  to the RADIUS definitions while\n     the   authentication transaction
    \ mechanisms   are preserved.   The\n     authentication server  authenticates
    the multicast  receiver/sender\n     by using the  CHAP-based  mechanism.  The
    account  server  logs the\n     start and stop points of multicast route  usage.
    \ This extension is\n     intended  to  be used in  conjunction  with the  IGMP
    extension for\n     multicast receiver and sender authentication.\n\n\t </p>\n
