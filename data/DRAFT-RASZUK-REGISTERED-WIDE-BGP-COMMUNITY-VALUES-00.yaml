abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Communicating various routing policies via route tagging plays
    an\nimportant role in external BGP peering relations.  The most common\ntool used
    today to attach various information about routes is\nrealized with the use of
    BGP communities.  Such information is\nimportant for the peering AS to perform
    some mutually agreed actions\nwithout the need to maintain a separate offline
    database for each\npair of prefix and an associated with it requested set of action\nentries.\n\nThis
    document proposes to establish a new IANA maintained registry of\nmost commonly
    used Wide BGP Communities by network operators.  Such\npublic registry will allow
    for easy refernece and clear\ninterpretation of the actions associated with received
    community\nvalues.\n\t </p>\n      "
