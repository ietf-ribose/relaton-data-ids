abstract:
- content: "<p>SFC is an ordered set of service function, should be scalable to meet
    broad range of requirements. The scalability of SFC can be interpreted as ability
    of the SFC to accommodate one or more SFs joining the SFC , or leaving the SFC
    without significant impact to SFC performance. This document presents four aspects
    on SFC scalability, and provide analysis of the data plane and the control plane
    to implement the scalable SFC.</p>"
