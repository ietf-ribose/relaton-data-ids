abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides background information regarding large-scale
    Kerberos deployments in the industrial sector, with the aim of identifying issues
    in the current Kerberos cross-realm authentication model as defined in RFC 4120.
    This document describes some examples of actual large-scale industrial systems,
    and lists requirements and restrictions regarding authentication operations in
    such environments. It also identifies a number of requirements derived from the
    industrial automation field. Although they are found in the field of industrial
    automation, these requirements are general enough and are applicable to the problem
    of Kerberos cross-realm operations. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
