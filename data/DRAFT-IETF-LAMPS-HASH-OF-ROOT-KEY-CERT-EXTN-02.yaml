abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Hash Of Root Key certificate extension.\n
    \  This certificate extension is carried in the self-signed certificate\n   for
    a trust anchor, which is often called a Root Certification\n   Authority (CA)
    certificate.  This certificate extension unambiguously\n   identifies the next
    public key that will be used by the trust anchor\n   at some point in the future.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
