abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) enables\n
    \  DHCPv6 servers to configure network parameters.  To secure DHCPv6,\n   the
    authentication and encryption mechanisms are proposed to protect\n   the DHCPv6
    privacy information.  However, how to deploy the secure\n   DHCPv6 mechanisms
    for DHCPv6 is not specified.  This draft analysis\n   the DHCPv6 threat model
    and various key management schemes for DHCPv6\n   deployment, and recommend the
    opportunistic security for DHCPv6\n   deployment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
