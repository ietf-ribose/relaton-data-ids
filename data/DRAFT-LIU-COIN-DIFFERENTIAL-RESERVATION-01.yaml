abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Computing in the network may require the embedded computing\n
    \  capability in the network device, such as gateway, switch, etc, and\n   there
    might be so much distributed computing task in the network.\n   Some new applications
    like AR/VR, motion control put forward higher\n   demand of network than before,
    and AI is also considered to be used\n   in the app and network.  In order to
    satisfy the demands, it needs to\n   guarantee both the bandwidth resource and
    the computing resource\n   which is linked by the network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
