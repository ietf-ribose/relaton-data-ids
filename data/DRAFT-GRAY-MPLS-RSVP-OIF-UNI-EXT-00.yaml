abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft defines a signaling mechanism based on RSVP-TE ([2])
    to\nsupport an Optical User Network Interface (UNI).  This effort is in\npart
    driven by work in the OIF as well as the recent draft on\nsignaling requirements
    for the optical UNI ([3]), and is consistent\nwith recent work on Generalized
    MPLS (see [4], [5], [6], and [7]). \nThe main function of this draft is to identify
    the relevant mechanisms\nin RSVP-TE (including further extensions) to satisfy
    functional\nrequirements for an Optical UNI.  This draft reflects ongoing work
    at\nthe Optical Interworking Forum (OIF), however, not all of the\nconcepts/requirements
    have been approved by the OIF.\n\t </p>\n      "
