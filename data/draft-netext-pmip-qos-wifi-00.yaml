abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a model for enabling end to end QoS in systems
    where there is a 802.11 based wireless system coupled with a PMIPv6 mobility domain
    consisting a local mobility anchor and mobility access gateway. This enables QoS
    policing and labeling of packets in a consistent manner on the 802.11 link between
    the MN and the AP as well as the link between the MAG and the LMA. To enable this,
    the document specifies mapping between QoS parameters on the 802.11 link and the
    QoS Mobility options in the PMIPv6 domain.</p>"
