abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Normally off devices (RFC7228) would need to expend considerable\n
    \  energy resources to be reachable at all times.  Instead, MAC layer\n   mechanisms
    are often employed that allow the last hop router of the\n   device to \"wake\"
    the device via radio when needed.  Activating these\n   devices even for a short
    time still does expend energy and thus\n   should be available to authorized correspondents
    only.\n   Traditionally, this has been achieved by heavy firewalling, allowing\n
    \  only authorized hosts to reach the device at all.  This may be too\n   inflexible
    for an Internet of Things.\n\n   The present report describes how to use a combination
    of currently\n   standardized (or in progress) technologies to securely effect
    this\n   authorization.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
