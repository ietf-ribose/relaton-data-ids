abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As one works on internationalization issues for DNS, email, and
    other\nprotocols, it becomes clear that the various encodings and\ntransformations
    required, while not intrinsically difficult, can be\nan impediment to rapid conversion
    of applications to international\nform and to rapid prototyping of new applications.
    \ This document\nproposes a new, lightweight, protocol that can be used to make
    such\nconversions, rather than incorporating the needed tables and\nalgorithms
    into each application.\n\t </p>\n      "
