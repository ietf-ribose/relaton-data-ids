abstract:
- content: <p>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks.
    The state of a resource on a CoAP server can change over time. This document specifies
    a simple protocol extension for CoAP that enables CoAP clients to "observe" resources,
    i.e., to retrieve a representation of a resource and keep this representation
    updated by the server over a period of time. The protocol follows a best- effort
    approach for sending new representations to clients and provides eventual consistency
    between the state observed by each client and the actual resource state at the
    server.</p>
