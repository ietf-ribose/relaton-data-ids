abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Intermediate Flow Selection Process is the process of selecting
    a\n   subset of Flows from all observed Flows.  The Intermediate Flow\n   Selection
    Process may be located at an IPFIX Exporter, Collector, or\n   within an IPFIX
    Mediator.  It reduces the effort of post-processing\n   Flow data and transferring
    Flow Records.  This document describes\n   motivations for using the Intermediate
    Flow Selection process and\n   presents Intermediate Flow Selection techniques.
    \ It provides an\n   information model for configuring Intermediate Flow Selection
    Process\n   techniques and discusses what information about an Intermediate Flow\n
    \  Selection Process should be exported.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
