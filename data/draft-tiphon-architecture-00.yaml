abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The contents of this Internet Draft is a reprint of the body of
    thearchitecture document (DTS 02003 v0.10.8) of the TIPHON project.This document
    describes a functional architecture for the purposesof defining a voice over IP
    architecture that can interwork with theexisting Switched Circuit Networks (SCN).The
    full document is publicly available and can be found athttp://docbox.etsi.org/Tech-Org/TIPHON/Document/tiphon/07-drafts/wg2/DTS02003/
    the current version is 0.10.8. Later versionswill appear in the same directory.
    This full document describesprotocol independent information flows and state diagrams
    on all thereference points.The next step in the TIPHON process will be the mapping
    of thereference points as defined in this document to existing standards.Since
    TIPHON does not intend to duplicate work so the project wouldappreciate assistance
    from IETF experts in the mapping of itsinformation flows to the appropriate IETF
    protocols. Candidateprotocols for the implementation of this architecture are
    SIP,MEGACOp and possibly others.</p>"
