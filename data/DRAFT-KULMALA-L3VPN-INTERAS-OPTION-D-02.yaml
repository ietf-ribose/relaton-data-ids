abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an additional option to the 'Multi-AS
    \nBackbones' section of [RFC4364]. This option combines per VPN VRFs at \nthe
    Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) as described in 'Option A' \nwith the redistribution
    of labeled VPN-IPv4 routes as described in \n'Option B'. In addition, this option
    allows for a data plane consisting \nof two methods of traffic forwarding between
    attached ASBR pairs.  \n\nIn this Multi-AS option, the ASBR installs VPN-IPv4
    routes into VRFs in \nthe same manner as described in [RFC4364] e.g. VPN-IPv4
    routes are \nconverted back to IPv4 routes and imported into VRFs via Route Target
    \n(RT) based filtering policies. Once installed in a VRF, selected IPv4 \nroutes
    are converted to VPN-IPv4 routes by the addition of Route \nDistinguisher (RD)
    values, along with one or more associated RTs as \nconfigured per VRF at the ASBR.
    \ \n\nDependant on service provider preference, traffic forwarding between \nattached
    ASBRs is either via per VRF attachment circuits or a 'global' \n(non-VRF attachment
    circuit associated) IP interface. In both traffic \nforwarding cases, packets
    may be MPLS-labeled or non-labeled. \n\nIf attached ASBR pairs belonging to separate
    Autonomous Systems (AS) \nmake use of this Multi-AS option, then VRF based route
    filtering \npolicies via RTs is achieved directly between ASBR pairs, independent
    \nof PE based RT filtering within an AS. \n\t </p>\n      "
