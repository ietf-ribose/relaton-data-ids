abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Various tunnel based methods have been developed to realize
    BANdwidth\n   Aggregation for interNet Access (BANANA). At the egress point of\n
    \  bonding tunnels, packets that have been delivered through different\n   tunnels
    are reordered in a bonding reordering buffer. Along each\n   tunnel, network devices
    may set aside buffers, which are referred as\n   tunnel buffers, to cache packets
    as well. This document exposes that\n   a time boundary, which is referred as
    \"Discard Timer\", imposed on\n   tunnel buffers could improve the throughput
    and reliability of the\n   bonding tunnels.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
