abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) based architecture can be used
    for \n   computing Traffic Engineered Label Switched Paths (TE LSP) that \n   traverse
    multiple Autonomous Systems (AS) in MultiProtocol Label \n   Switching (MPLS)
    and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. This may \n   require communication between
    PCEs in each AS, based upon on the PCE \n   communication Protocol (PCEP). When
    ASes belong to distinct service \n   providers, a per-service negotiation and
    activation procedure may be \n   required before starting PCE based path computation.
    For the sake of \n   illustration, the IPSphere Forum (IPSF) is currently specifying
    an \n   architecture so as to automate the negotiation and activation of such
    \n   an inter-provider TE LSP service. The result of such negotiation is a \n
    \  per-service contract identifier that needs to be carried in PCEP, so \n   that
    PCEs can apply inter-provider path computation policies. For \n   that purpose,
    this draft defines an extension to the PCEP protocol so \n   as to carry a contract
    ID in request messages.\n\t </p>\n      "
