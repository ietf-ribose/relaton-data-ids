abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks like financial information network (stock/ commodity
    trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications, Latency (delay), Latency-Variation
    (jitter) and Packet Loss is becoming a key requirement for path computation along
    with other constraints and metrics. Latency, Latency-Variation and Packet Loss
    is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and service
    providers. [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS] describes mechanisms with which
    network performance information is distributed via OSPF and ISIS respectively.
    The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms
    for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response
    to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. This document describes the extension
    to PCEP to carry Latency, Latency-Variation and Packet Loss as constraints for
    end to end path computation.</p>"
