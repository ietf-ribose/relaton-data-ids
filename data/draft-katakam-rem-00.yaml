abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC document envisages the need and necessity in utilizing or
    extending the compute resource technologies in such as networking(NW), remote
    computing(RC),cloud computing(CC),distributed computing(DC), Machine Learning(ML)
    and other related fields of AI to the biological field of electron microscopy(EC)
    for use in rapid and timely identification or diagnosis of virological/bacterial
    elements in clinical samples in the current world scenario, within the given time
    frame irrespective of the place of origin and with having geographical presence.
    Electron microscopy (EM) is a pioneering methodology used in identification and
    diagnosing of viral and microbiological elements. It is able to identify in morphological
    form the tiniest of the viruses in minimum amount of time by clinical scientists.</p>"
