abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Almost all VoIP endpoints, especially SIP and RTCWEB ones,
    make use\n   of RTP to tranport media frames in real-time and communicate with\n
    \  each other.  Since RTP uses UDP, the presence of network elements\n   that
    filter UDP packets and/or only allow some protocols like SMTP or\n   HTTP to pass
    through would make such a communication very hard to\n   accomplish, if not impossible.\n\n
    \  This draft describes a way to implement an HTTP Fallback for RTP\n   media
    streams, that is, a way to effectively encapsulate RTP packets\n   in HTTP messages
    in order to traverse proxies and firewalls.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
