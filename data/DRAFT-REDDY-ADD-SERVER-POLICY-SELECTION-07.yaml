abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document defines a mechanism that is meant to communicate
    DNS\n   resolver information to DNS clients for use as a criteria for server\n
    \  selection decisions.  Such an information that is cryptographically\n   signed
    to attest its authenticity is used for the selection of DNS\n   resolvers.  Typically,
    evaluating the resolver information and the\n   signatory, DNS clients with minimal
    or no human intervention can\n   select the DNS servers for resolving domain names.\n\n
    \  This assertion is useful for encrypted DNS (e.g., DNS-over-TLS, DNS-\n   over-HTTPS,
    or DNS-over-QUIC) servers that are either public\n   resolvers or discovered in
    a local network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
