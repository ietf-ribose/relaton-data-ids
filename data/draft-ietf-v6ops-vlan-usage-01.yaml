abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet VLANs are quite commonly used in enterprise networks for the
    purposes of traffic segregation. This document describes how such VLANs can be
    readily used to deploy IPv6 networking in an enterprise, which focuses on the
    scenario of early deployment prior to availability of IPv6-capable switch-router
    equipment. In this method, IPv6 may be routed in parallel with the existing IPv4
    in the enterprise and delivered at Layer 2 via VLAN technology. The IPv6 connectivity
    to the enterprise may or may not enter the site via the same physical link. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
