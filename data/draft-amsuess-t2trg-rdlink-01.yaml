abstract:
- content: "<p>Thing to thing communication in Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE)
    relies on URIs to link to servers. Next to hierarchical configuration and short-lived
    IP addresses, this document introduces a naming scheme for devices based on cryptographic
    identifiers. A special purpose domain is reserved for expressing those identifiers,
    and mechanisms for constrained devices to announce their names and to look them
    up are described.</p>"
