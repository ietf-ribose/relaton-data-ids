abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS relies upon caching to scale; however, the cache lookup\n
    \  generally requires an exact match.  This document specifies the use\n   of
    NSEC/NSEC3 resource records to generate negative answers within a\n   range.  This
    increases resilience to DoS attacks, increases\n   performance / decreases latency,
    decreases resource utilization on\n   both authoritative and recursive servers,
    and also increases privacy.\n\n   This document updates RFC4035 by allowing resolvers
    to generate\n   negative answers based upon NSEC/NSEC3 records.\n\n   [ Ed note:
    Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background\n   information, answers
    to frequently asked questions, general musings,\n   etc.  They will be removed
    before publication.This document is being\n   collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-ietf-\n
    \  dnsop-nsec-aggressiveuse.  The most recent version of the document,\n   open
    issues, etc should all be available here.  The authors\n   (gratefully) accept
    pull requests.\n\n   Known / open issues [To be moved to Github issue tracker]:\n\n\t
