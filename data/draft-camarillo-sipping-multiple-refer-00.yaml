abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extensions to the SIP REFER method so that this
    method can be used to refer to multiple resources. These extensions include the
    use of pointers to URI-lists in the Refer-To header field, the use of bodies to
    describe the requests to be sent by the server, and the use of a new event package
    to report the state of several transactions.</p>"
