abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft presents ISO7816 interface for TLS1.3 stack running
    in\n   secure element. It presents supported cipher suites and key exchange\n
    \  modes, and describes embedded software architecture. TLS 1.3 is the\n   de
    facto security stack for emerging Internet of Things (IoT)\n   devices. Some of
    them are constraint nodes, with limited computing\n   resources. Furthermore cheap
    System on Chip (SoC) components usually\n   provide tamper resistant features,
    so private or pre shared keys are\n   exposed to hacking. According to the technology
    state of art, some\n   ISO7816 secure elements are able to process TLS 1.3, but
    with a\n   limited set of cipher suites. There are two benefits for TLS-SE;\n
    \  first fully tamper resistant processing of TLS protocol, which\n   increases
    the security level insurance; second embedded software\n   component ready for
    use, which relieves the software of the burden\n   of cryptographic libraries
    and associated attacks. TLS-SE devices\n   may also embed standalone applications,
    which are accessed via\n   internet node, using a routing procedure based on SNI
    extension.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
