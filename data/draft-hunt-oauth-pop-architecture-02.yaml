abstract:
- content: <p>The OAuth 2.0 bearer token specification, as defined in RFC 6750, allows
    any party in possession of a bearer token (a "bearer") to get access to the associated
    resources (without demonstrating possession of a cryptographic key). To prevent
    misuse, bearer tokens must to be protected from disclosure in transit and at rest.
    Some scenarios demand additional security protection whereby a client needs to
    demonstrate possession of cryptographic keying material when accessing a protected
    resource. This document motivates the development of the OAuth 2.0 proof-of-possession
    security mechanism.</p>
