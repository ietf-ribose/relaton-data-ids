abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification proposes proxy operations for IPv6 Neighbor\n
    \  Discovery on behalf of devices located on broadcast-inefficient\n   wireless
    networks.  A broadcast-efficient backbone running classical\n   IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery federates multiple wireless links to form a\n   large MultiLink Subnet,
    but the broadcast domain does not need to\n   extend to the wireless links for
    the purpose of ND operation.\n   Backbone Routers placed at the wireless edge
    of the backbone proxy\n   the ND operation and route packets from/to registered
    nodes, and\n   wireless nodes register or are proxy-registered to the Backbone\n
    \  Router to setup proxy services in a fashion that is essentially\n   similar
    to a classical Layer-2 association.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
