abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This defines the information model for the Security Automation
    and\n   Continuous Monitoring (SACM) standards.  The working group faces a\n   set
    of complex issues when trying to define an information model that\n   complicates
    this effort:\n\n   o  There are many standards in the SACM space which are not\n
    \     interoperable\n\n   o  There exists an extremely large and diverse set of
    data types\n      which are desirable to exchange\n\n   o  Many data types depend
    on the operating systems from which they\n      are collected; making a universal
    typing harder\n\n   o  A goal of SACM is to cover a diverse set of system types\n\n
    \  These complex needs create a information model which is difficult to\n   unify
    within the environment.  Instead, this information model design\n   is focused
    on minimum needed functionality with the desire to include\n   a type system design
    into the information model allowing for easy\n   expandability.  It is envisioned
    that this information model will\n   serve the following purposes:\n\n   o  Enough
    well specified elements in order to exchange key data\n      fields between systems\n\n
    \  o  Sufficient typing system to expand key fields over time and use of\n      a
    registry to standardize common expansions\n\n   o  Meta information such that
    compplete information exchange using\n      various other formats understood by
    all parties can be used as\n      needed to exchange complete records on demand\n\n
    \  o  Sufficient action verbs defined to allow orchestration between\n      various
    systems to allow unified control of federated components\n\n\t </p>\n      "
