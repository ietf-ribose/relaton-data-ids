abstract:
  content: "<p>As the number of Mobile IP users grow so will the signaling overheadon
    the core IP network in support of mobility management. In cellularnetworks registration
    and paging techniques are used to minimize thesignaling overhead and optimize
    the mobility management performance.Currently, Mobile IP supports registration
    but not paging. We believethat Mobile IP support for paging is important to improve
    thescalability of Mobile IP networks. Recently, a number of micro-mobility protocols
    [8] have been proposed that have built-in pagingfunctions. These micro-mobility
    protocols are independent of the baseMobile IP protocol and interwork with Mobile
    IP [2] through mobilegateways. We take a different approach and propose a minimal
    set ofpaging extensions to the base Mobile IP called P-MIP. P-MIP isdesigned to
    reduce signaling load in the core Internet and powerconsumption of mobile nodes.
    In this draft, P-MIP, which assumes theuse of foreign agents, is described and
    the construction of pagingareas, movement detection, registration, paging and
    data handling arepresented.</p>"
