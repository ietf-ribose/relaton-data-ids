abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of providing wireline access to the 5G Core (5GC), deployed
    wireline networks carry user data between 5G residential gateways and the 5G Access
    Gateway Function (AGF). The encapsulation used needs to meet a variety of requirements
    including being able to multiplex the traffic of multiple PDU sessions within
    a VLAN delineated access circuit, to permit legacy equipment in the data path
    to snoop certain packet fields, to carry 5G QoS information associated with the
    data, and to be efficiently encoded. This memo specifies an encapsulation that
    meets these requirements.</p>"
