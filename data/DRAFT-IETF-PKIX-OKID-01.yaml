abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In general, certificates need not be communicated with communication
    or\nstorage media that are integrity-secure or authentic. This is because\ncertificates
    are digitally signed and users are expected to validate the\nsignatures using
    configured trust anchors. However, distribution of\ntrust anchor certificates,
    self-signed end-entity certificates, or bare\n(unsigned) public keys requires
    a mechanism for establishing the\nauthenticity of the certificate or public key.\n\t
