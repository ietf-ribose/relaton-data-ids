abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the requirement for in-advance asynchronous\n
    \  service state notifications from a SIP[1] entity to its USER .The \n   notifications
    MAY be about the state of the entity or the state of\n   the session. It also
    explains certain mechanisms for implementing \n   the same. This document is divided
    into three parts . \n   1)An Event Specification. \n   2)Use cases for event specification
    and mechanisms to extend this\n     specification.\n   3)Limitations and Future
    work.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
