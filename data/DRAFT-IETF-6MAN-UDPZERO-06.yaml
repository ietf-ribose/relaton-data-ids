abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document examines the role of the UDP transport checksum
    when\n   used with IPv6, as defined in RFC2460. It presents a summary of the\n
    \  trade-offs for evaluating the safety of updating RFC 2460 to permit\n   an
    IPv6 UDP endpoint to use a zero value in the checksum field as an\n   indication
    that no checksum is present.  This method is compared with\n   some other possibilities.
    \ The document also describes the issues and\n   design principles that need to
    be considered when UDP is used with\n   IPv6 to support tunnel encapsulations.
    \ It concludes that UDP with a\n   zero checksum in IPv6 can safely be used for
    this purpose, provided\n   that this usage is governed by a set of constraints.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
