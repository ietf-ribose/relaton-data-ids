abstract:
- content: "<p>Transporting data to their users through operators' networks is a fundamental
    service that can benefit both providers and consumers. Due to the dramatically
    increased popularity and desire of differentiated services and their constraints,
    it is essential for operators to provide the traffic steering service under limited
    network resources and maximize their benefits at the same time. This document
    lists some typical use cases for traffic steering services. This document does
    not attempt to enumerate all kinds of scenarios, but rather it describes several
    key features of these scenarios from which solutions may be constructed.</p>"
