abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) enables DHCPv6
    servers to configure network parameters. However, due to the unsecured nature,
    various critical identifiers used in DHCPv6 are vulnerable to several types of
    attacks, particularly pervasive monitoring. This document provides a mechanism
    to secure DHCPv6 messages, which achieves the client/server authentication and
    encryption based on sender's certificates.</p>"
