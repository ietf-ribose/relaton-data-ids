abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides environment security requirements for
    the SFC\n   architecture.  Environment security requirements are independent of\n
    \  the protocols used for SFC - such as NSH for example.  As a result,\n   the
    requirements provided in this document are intended to provide\n   good security
    practices so SFC can be securely deployed and operated.\n   These security requirements
    are designated as environment security\n   requirements as opposed to the protocol
    security requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
