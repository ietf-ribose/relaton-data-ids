abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In MANET, nodes wishing to communicate with nodes in the wired\n
    \  Internet, the global Internet connectivity is required and this\n   functionality
    can be achieved with the help of the Internet gateway\n   (IGW). For the support
    of reliability and flexibility, multiple IGWs\n   can be provisioned for a MANET.
    In this case, load-balancing becomes\n   one of the important issues since the
    network performance such as \n   the network throughput can be improved if the
    load of the IGW is\n   well-balanced. In this draft, we categorize the load-balancing\n
    \  mechanisms for the IPv6-based MANET with multiple IGWs and define\n   a new
    load-balancing metric computed from the hop distance and\n   the number of routing
    table entries.\n\t </p>\n      "
