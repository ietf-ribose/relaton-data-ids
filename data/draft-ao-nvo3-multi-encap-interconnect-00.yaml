abstract:
- content: "<p>For an virtualized overlay network, there are many encapsulations that
    may be used. Different customer have their own preference. So if some of these
    different encapsulation can be interconnected together, the virtualized overlay
    network would be more compatible and have loose strict on access. This document
    is going to provide an architecture of different overlay encapsulation interconnection
    and an tranformer gateway for these end station connected to the virtual network.</p>"
