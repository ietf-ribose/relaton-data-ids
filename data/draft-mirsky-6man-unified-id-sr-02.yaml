abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing architecture leverages the paradigm of source routing.
    It can be realized in a network data plane by prepending the packet with a list
    of instructions, a.k.a. segments. A segment can be encoded as a Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) label, IPv4 address or IPv6 address. Segment Routing can
    be applied in MPLS data plane by encoding segments in MPLS label stack. It also
    can be applied to IPv6 data plane by encoding list of segment identifiers in IPv6
    Segment Routing Extension Header (SRH). This document extends the use of the SRH
    to segment identifiers encoded as MPLS label and IPv4 address.</p>"
