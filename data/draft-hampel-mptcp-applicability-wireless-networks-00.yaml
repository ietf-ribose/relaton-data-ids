abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyses the applicability of Multipath TCP to wireless
    access networks with overlapping coverage area, and it discusses potential protocol
    extensions that aim to improve operation in such environments. The analysis attempts
    to identify use cases, benefits as well as technical and functional obstacles
    encountered in the current version of the protocol. Based on this analysis, recommendations
    are made on feature-, signaling- and policy extensions that promise to enhance
    Multipath-TCP's value, versatility and market acceptance in wireless access networks.</p>"
