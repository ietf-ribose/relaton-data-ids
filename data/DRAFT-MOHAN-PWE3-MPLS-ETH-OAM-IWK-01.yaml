abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the mapping of defect states between\nEthernet
    Attachment Circuits (ACs) and associated Ethernet\nPseudowires (PWs) connected
    in accordance to the PWE3 architecture\n[RFC3985] to realize an end-to-end emulated
    Ethernet service. This\ndocument augments the mapping of defect states between
    a PW and\nassociated AC of the end-to-end emulated service in [PW-OAM-MSG-\nMAP].
    In [PW-OAM-MSG-MAP], Ethernet OAM was not covered due to lack\nof Ethernet OAM
    maturity. However, since then, [Y.1731] and[802.1ag] have been completed, and
    this document specifies the\nmapping of defect states between Ethernet ACs and
    corresponding\nEthernet PWs.\n\n\nConventions used in this document\n\nThe key
    words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are
    to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n\t </p>\n      "
