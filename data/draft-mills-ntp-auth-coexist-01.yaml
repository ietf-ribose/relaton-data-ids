abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The purpose of this document is to extend the NTP/SNTP authenticationscheme
    to support additional features, including Public KeyInfrastructure (PKI) cryptography,
    in order to certify the identityof the sender and verify the integrity of the
    data included in anNTP message, as well as provide support for other facilities
    suchas a timestamp and non-repudiation service. This document describes a new
    extension field to support new servicesfor securely binding sender credentials
    to the NTP message stream.One or more of these fields can be included in the NTP
    header tosupport designated security services or other services should theybecome
    necessary. The presence of these fields does not affect theoperation of the NTP
    timekeeping model and protocol in any other way. Additional fields may provide
    means to securely bind arbitrary clientdata to be signed along with the other
    information in the message.The ability to sign arbitrary client data provides
    an important non-repudiation feature that allows this data to be cryptographically
    boundto an NTP timestamp, together with sender credentials and signature.</p>"
