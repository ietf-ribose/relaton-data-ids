abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In [RFC6770], the Inter-Affiliates CDN Interconnection use
    case is\n   described.  In this scenario, a large CDN Provider may have several\n
    \  autonomous or semi-autonomous subsidiaries that each operates on\n   their
    own CDN.  The CDN Provider needs to make these down-stream CDNs\n   interoperate
    to provide a consistent service to its customers on the\n   whole collective footprint.\n\n
    \  This document illustrates in details the CDNi experiment that has\n   been
    carried out by China Telecom, and the lessons and experiences to\n   CDNi standardization
    work.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
