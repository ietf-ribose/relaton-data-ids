abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes an architecture where peers in an peer-to-peer
    overlay use special IP addresses to identify other peers. Twoof the advantages
    of this approach are that (a) most existingapplications can run in an overlay
    without needing any changes and(b) peer mobility and NAT traversal are handled
    in a way that istransparent to most applications.</p>"
