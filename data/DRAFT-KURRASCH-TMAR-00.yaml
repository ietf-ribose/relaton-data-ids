abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Tele-Media Address Resolution (TMAR) is a scheme for use with
    internet\ntelephony.  The scheme introduces a URL format and protocol that is\nsimple
    and flexible yet powerful enough to meet most any\ntelecommunication need.  The
    URL takes the form of\ntmar://caller:password@host:port/path, where path may be
    written as a\ndirectory tree or in E.164 notation.  The protocol allows for such\nfeatures
    as customized call routing, call load balancing, and\nfirewalls to be implemented
    within an internet telephony network.\nThis internet-draft contains the requirements,
    examples, and\nrecommendations for the implementation of this scheme.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
