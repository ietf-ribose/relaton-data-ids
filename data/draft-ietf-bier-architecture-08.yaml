abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast
    data packets. It provides optimal forwarding of multicast packets through a "multicast
    domain". However, it does not require a protocol for explicitly building multicast
    distribution trees, nor does it require intermediate nodes to maintain any per-flow
    state. This architecture is known as "Bit Index Explicit Replication" (BIER).
    When a multicast data packet enters the domain, the ingress router determines
    the set of egress routers to which the packet needs to be sent. The ingress router
    then encapsulates the packet in a BIER header. The BIER header contains a bit
    string in which each bit represents exactly one egress router in the domain; to
    forward the packet to a given set of egress routers, the bits corresponding to
    those routers are set in the BIER header. The procedures for forwarding a packet
    based on its BIER header are specified in this document. Elimination of the per-flow
    state and the explicit tree-building protocols results in a considerable simplification.</p>
