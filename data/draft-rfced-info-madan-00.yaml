abstract:
- content: "<p>The BOOTP [1] or the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [2]
    provide a framework for booting a host over a network from a remote server. This
    document defines a new option which a BOOTP/DHCP client may include in its BOOTP
    request or DHCPDISCOVER message. In their replies, the recipient servers may include
    this option along with the location/path information to a file ('boot.info') in
    the option field. The client may use the contents of this file to select the desired
    OS with which to boot along with the location/path of the appropriate boot image
    file.</p>"
