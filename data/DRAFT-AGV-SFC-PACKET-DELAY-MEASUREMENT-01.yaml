abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes performance measurement(PM) packet
    delay\n   measurement for Service Function Chains (SFCs) to assess the\n   operational
    status and behavior of a SF, a subset of SFs, a whole SFC\n   as a function of
    the actual deterministic SF/SFC. Packet loss\n   mechanism described in this document
    is based on [SFC-PM-arch].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
