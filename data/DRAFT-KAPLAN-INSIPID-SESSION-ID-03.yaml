abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This RFC, which contains the text of an individual Internet
    Draft\n   that was submitted originally to the DISPATCH Working Group, is\n   being
    published now as an Informational document to provide a\n   reference for later
    RFCs.  The mechanism defined in this document\n   has been widely deployed, and
    is being followed in a backward-\n   compatible fashion for a new Standards Track
    RFC in the INSIPID\n   Working Group.  The original Abstract follows.\n\n   There
    is a need for having a globally unique session identifier for\n   the same SIP
    session, which can be consistently maintained across\n   Proxies, B2BUAs and other
    SIP middle-boxes, for the purpose of\n   Troubleshooting.  This draft proposes
    a new SIP header to carry such\n   a value: Session-ID.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
