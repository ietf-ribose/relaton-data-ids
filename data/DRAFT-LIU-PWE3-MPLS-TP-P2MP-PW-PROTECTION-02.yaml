abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The requirements of MPLS-TP in RFC 5654 include a requirement(R63)\n
    \  that requires MPLS-TP MUST be possible to provide protection for\n   MPLS-TP
    data plane without any IP forwarding capability and control\n   plane.If applying
    1:1 protection for the p2mp traffic in rfc6718 , it\n   must have a return path
    to coordinate the switch state to select the\n   same path to receive and send
    the traffic packet.As there exists the\n   above problem statement,This document
    describes a kind of protection\n   solution to recovery and protect the p2mp traffic
    under the failure\n   condition.\n\n\n   This document is a product of a joint
    Internet Task Force(IETF) /\n   International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications\n
    \  Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile
    within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and
    functionalities of a packet transport network as\n   defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\t
