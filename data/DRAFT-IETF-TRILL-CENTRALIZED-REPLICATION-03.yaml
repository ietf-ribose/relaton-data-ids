abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In TRILL active-active access scenario, RPF check failure issue
    may\n   occur when pseudo-nickname mechanism in [TRILLPN] is used. This\n   draft
    describes a solution to resolve the RPF check failure issue\n   through centralized
    replication. The solution has all ingress RBs\n   send BUM(Broadcast, Unknown
    unicast, Mutlicast) traffic to a\n   centralized node via unicast TRILL encapsulation.
    When the\n   centralized node receives the BUM traffic, it decapsulates the\n
    \  traffic and forwards the BUM traffic to all destination RBs using a\n   distribution
    tree established via the TRILL base protocol. To avoid\n   RPF check failure on
    a RBridge sitting between the ingress RBridge\n   and the centralized replication
    node, some change of RPF calculation\n   algorithm is required. RPF calculation
    on each RBridge should use\n   the centralized node as ingress RB instead of the
    real ingress\n   RBridge of RBv to perform the calculation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
