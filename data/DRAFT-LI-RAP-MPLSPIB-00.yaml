abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a set of policy rule classes (PRC) for
    \nconfiguring MPLS traffic engineering policy at network elements. \nInstances
    of these classes reside in a virtual information store \ncalled the MPLS-TE Policy
    Information Base (PIB). The COPS \nprotocol [3] with extensions for provisioning
    [4] is used to \ntransmit this policy information to network elements. The PRCs
    \ndefined in this document are intended for use by the COPS-PR MPLS \nclient type.
    These PRCs are in addition to any other PIBs that may \nbe defined for the MPLS
    client type, as well as the PRCs defined \nin the Framework PIB [5]. \n\t </p>\n
