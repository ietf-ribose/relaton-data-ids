abstract:
- content: "<p>The current version of the IDNA specifications anticipated that each
    new version of Unicode would be reviewed to verify that no changes had been introduced
    that required adjustments to the set of rules and, in particular, whether new
    exceptions or backward compatibility adjustments were needed. That review was
    conducted for Unicode 7.0.0 and identified a problematic new code point. This
    specification updates RFC 5982 to disallow that code point and provides information
    about the reasons why that exclusion is appropriate. It also applies an editorial
    clarification that was the subject of an earlier erratum.</p>"
