abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents the test specification for M2UA (MTP2 User
    \nAdaptation) prototcol (ver 03), which can be used to test M2UA \nimplementations
    for conformance to the protocol definition. The list \nof test is exhaustive and
    covers almost all the categories of test.\nThis draft can also be used in conjunction
    with M2UA specification by\nimplementor of protocol as implementors guide, as
    the pictorial \nrepresentation of various scenarios help easy understanding of
    the \nprotocol.\n\nNext revision of the draft will cover the additions done to
    the\nprotocol revision M2UA-04 and any subsequent RFC published by IETF.\n\n\t
