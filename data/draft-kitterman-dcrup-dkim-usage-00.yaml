abstract:
- content: "<p>The cryptographic algorithm and key size requirements included when
    DKIM was designed in the last decade are functionally obsolete and in need of
    immediate revision. This document updates DKIM requirements to those minimaly
    suitable for operation with currently specified algorithms. This document updates
    RFC 6376.</p>"
