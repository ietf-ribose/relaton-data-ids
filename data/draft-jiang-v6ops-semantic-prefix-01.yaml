abstract:
- content: "<p>Some Internet Service Providers and enterprises desire to be aware
    of more information about each packet, so that packets can be treated differently
    and efficiently. Packet-level differentiating can also enable flow-level and user-level
    differentiating. IPv6, with a large address space, allows semantics to be embedded
    into addresses. Routers can easily apply relevant operations accordingly. This
    document describes a framework that embeds semantics into IPv6 prefixes, so that
    network devices can treat packets based on these explicit semantics. This document
    also analyzes on the technical gaps for embedding complex semantics. This informational
    document only discusses usage of semantics in a Semantic Prefix Domain. It does
    NOT intent or suggest to standardize any common global semantics.</p>"
