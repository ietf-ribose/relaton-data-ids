abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a method for dynamically discovering
    resolvers\n   that support encrypted transports, and introduces the concept of\n
    \  designating a resolver to be used for a subset of client queries\n   based
    on domain.  This method is intended to work both for locally-\n   hosted resolvers
    and resolvers accessible over the broader Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
