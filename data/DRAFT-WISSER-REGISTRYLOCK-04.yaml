abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This extensions defines an additional protective layer for
    changes to\n   domain [RFC5731], host [RFC5732] and contact [RFC5733] objects\n
    \  managed through EPP.\n\n   EPP allows changes to objects only by the sponsoring
    client.  EPP\n   objects are usually managed by the sponsoring client on behalf
    of the\n   sponsoring clients customers.  All of these interactions are ususally\n
    \  fully automated.\n\n   In case of a system breach, there is no protection in
    EPP to changes\n   to any object by the intruder.\n\n   This extension defines
    a protective layer that aims to break\n   automated changes and work flows by
    requiring manual intervention.\n\n   The actual form of manual intervention is
    out-of-scope for this\n   document.  By whom and how changes can be made is up
    to the registry\n   and registrars to decide.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
