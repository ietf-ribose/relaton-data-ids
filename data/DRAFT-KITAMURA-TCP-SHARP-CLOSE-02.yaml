abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an idea \"Sharp Close\" that eliminates
    or\n   minimizes TIME-WAIT state of TCP connections.\n\n   In the current TCP
    specification ([RFC0793]), there are some\n   inappropriate or not up-to-date
    functions. Here we focus and\n   discuss on TCP TIME-WAIT state function.\n\n
    \  TIME-WAIT is the last state of TCP connections of Active Close side\n   nodes.
    After TCP connections are effectively closed, state of them\n   move to TIME-WAIT
    state. After TIME-WAIT state is finished,\n   resources of connections are released.
    This means that even if\n   connections are effectively finished, resources of
    connections are\n   NOT released.  The TIME-WAIT state prevents from releasing
    them.\n\n   From the viewpoints of current high-speed and high-multiplicity\n
    \  communication styles, it is thought that TIME-WAIT state is one of\n   evil
    functions.\n\n   In order to provide efficient communications that match current\n
    \  styles, an idea \"Sharp Close\" that eliminates or minimizes TIME-\n   WAIT
    state of TCP connections is proposed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
