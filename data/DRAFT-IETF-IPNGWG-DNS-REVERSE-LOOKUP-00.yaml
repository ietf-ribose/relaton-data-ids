abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     This document proposes a new mechanism to represent inverse
    address\n     mapping in the Domain Name System (DNS) for IP version 6 (IPv6).\n
    \    Documented in here are the changes needed for securing the binding\n     and
    delegation of address ranges, to facilitate queries for the\n     binding of address
    to host name. This document also defines a\n     mechanism for dumb resolvers
    to query directly for the binding.\n \n     The changes include a new resource
    record to delegate the address\n     space in segments based on arbitrary bit
    boundaries. This proposal\n     provides a mechanism that is self checking and
    can be traversed\n     from both top and bottom. Additional processing requirements
    on\n     IPv6 aware resolvers and servers are defined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
