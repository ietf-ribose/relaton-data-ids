abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the minimal mechanisms required to
    support\n   secure enrollment of a pledge, a device being added to an IPv6 over\n
    \  the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e (6TiSCH) network.  It assumes that\n   the
    pledge has been provisioned with a credential that is relevant to\n   the deployment
    - the \"one-touch\" scenario.  The goal of this\n   configuration is to set link-layer
    keys, and to establish a secure\n   end-to-end session between each pledge and
    the join registrar who may\n   use that to further configure the pledge.  Additional
    security\n   behaviors and mechanisms may be added on top of this minimal\n   framework.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
