abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents an overview of source address dependent\n
    \  routing from the host perspective.  Multihomed hosts and hosts with\n   multiple
    interfaces are considered.  Different architectures are\n   introduced and with
    their help, why source address selection and next\n   hop resolution in view of
    source address dependent routing is needed\n   is explained.  The document concludes
    with a discussion on the\n   standardization work that is needed.\n\n\t </p>\n
