abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which\n
    \  depends on some addressing and routing.  This Autonomic Management\n   and
    Control Plane should ideally be self-managing, and as independent\n   as possible
    of configuration.  This document defines such a plane and\n   calls it the \"Autonomic
    Control Plane\", with the primary use as a\n   control plane for autonomic functions.
    \ It also serves as a \"virtual\n   out-of-band channel\" for Operations Administration
    and Management\n   (OAM) communications over a network that provides automatically\n
    \  configured hop-by-hop authenticated and encrypted communications via\n   automatically
    configured IPv6 even when the network is not\n   configured, or misconfigured.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
