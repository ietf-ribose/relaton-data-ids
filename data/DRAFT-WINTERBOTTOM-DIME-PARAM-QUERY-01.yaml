abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In an emergency services environment a Location Information Server\n(LIS)
    receives requests from end hosts, SIP proxies or Public Safety\nAnswering Points
    (PSAPs).  When receiving these requests a LIS has to\nperform a location determination
    procedure that depends on the\nspecific network deployment.  In any case, an interation
    with other\nnetwork elements is needed, particularly with AAA servers, that store\ninformation
    about the current attachment of the end host.\n\nThis document descirbes a Diameter
    application, called Diameter\nParameter Query, which allows a Location Information
    Server to\ninteract with a Diameter server to obtain information needed for the\nlocation
    determination procedure.  The style of the described\nDiameter application offers
    flexibility for different deployments.\n\t </p>\n      "
