abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an IP/TCP mechanism
    where\n   network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to\n   indicate
    congestion to the end-points.  An ECN-capable receiver will\n   feedback this
    information to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in\n   such a way that only
    one feedback signal can be transmitted per\n   Round-Trip Time (RTT).  Recently,
    new TCP mechanisms like ConEx or\n   DCTCP need more accurate ECN feedback information
    in the case where\n   more than one marking is received in one RTT.  This documents\n
    \  specifies requirement for different ECN feedback scheme in the TCP\n   header
    to provide more than one feedback signal per RTT.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
