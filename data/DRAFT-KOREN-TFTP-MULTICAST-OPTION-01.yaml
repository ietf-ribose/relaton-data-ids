abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step,\nfile
    transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file\nonto a remote host.\nThis
    document describes the TFTP multicast option. This option\nallows multiple clients
    to receive the same file concurrently\nthrough the use of Multicast packets. The
    TFTP Option Extension\nmechanism is described in [2].\nOften when similar computers
    are booting remotely they will each\ndownload the same image file. By adding multicast
    into the TFTP\noption set, two or more computers can download a file\nconcurrently,
    thus increasing network efficiency.\nThis document assumes that the reader is
    familiar with the\nterminology and notation of both [1] and [2].\n\n\n\t </p>\n
