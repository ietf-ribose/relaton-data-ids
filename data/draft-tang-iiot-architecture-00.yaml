abstract:
- content: "<p>As the foundation of the current new round of industrial revolution,
    the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) based on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
    [smart-factory] has become the focus of research in various countries. In the
    entire development stage of IIoT, one of the key issues is the standardization
    of the IIoT architecture. With the development of intelligent manufacturing technology,
    the number of the IIoT devices will increase sharply, and a large amount of data
    will be generated in the industrial manufacturing process. However, traditional
    industrial networks cannot meet the IIoT requirements for high data rates, low
    latency, massive connections, interconnection and interoperability. The current
    IIoT architectures also have various limitations: mobility, security, scalability,
    and communication reliability. These limitations hinder the development and implementation
    of IIoT. As a network layer protocol, IPv6 can solve the problem of IPv4 address
    exhaustion. As a high-speed, low- latency wireless communication technology, 5G
    has great potential in promoting IIoT. In order to solve the above problems, this
    draft proposes an IIoT architecture based on IPv6 and 5G. It can provide high-speed,
    low-latency communication services, provide massive connectivity, mobility, scalability,
    security and other features for industrial device. And the architecture can provide
    generalized, refined, and flexible network services for devices outside the factory.
    And an information model is defined to standardize the representation of information
    in IIoT. Finally, the draft discusses security challenges and recommendations
    in IIoT.</p>"
