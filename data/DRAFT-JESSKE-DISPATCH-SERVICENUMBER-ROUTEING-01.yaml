abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The combination of \"rn\" and \"npdi\" parameters which are
    normally used\n   for number portability (NP) can also solve numbering and routing\n
    \  problems.  Database dips to obtain routing numbers are not only\n   needed
    for NP, but also for the routing of service numbers and short\n   code numbers
    in the PSTN and also in SIP networks.  This document\n   defines the use of the
    tel URI parameters defined for NP (\"rn\" and\n   \"npdi\") to route service numbers
    and short code numbers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
