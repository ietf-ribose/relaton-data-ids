abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes an RTP Payload format for the High Quality
    (HQ)\n   profile of SMPTE Standard ST 2042-1 known as VC-2.  This document\n   describes
    the transport of HQ Profile VC-2 in RTP packets and has\n   applications for low-complexity,
    high-bandwidth streaming of both\n   lossless and lossy compressed video.\n\n
    \  The HQ profile of VC-2 is intended for low latency video compression\n   (with
    latency potentially on the order of lines of video) at high\n   data rates (with
    compression ratios on the order of 2:1 or 4:1).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
