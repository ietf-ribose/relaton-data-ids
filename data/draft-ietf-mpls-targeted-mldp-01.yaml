abstract:
- content: <p>Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be used to set up Point-to-Multipoint
    (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths. The existing
    specification for this functionality assumes that a pair of LDP neighbors are
    directly connected. However, the LDP base specification allows for the case where
    a pair of LDP neighbors are not directly connected; the LDP session between such
    a pair of neighbors is known as a "Targeted LDP" session. This document provides
    the specification for using the LDP P2MP/MP2MP extensions over a Targeted LDP
    session.</p>
