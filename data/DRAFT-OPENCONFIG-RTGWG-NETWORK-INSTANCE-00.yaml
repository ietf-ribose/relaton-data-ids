abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a YANG data model for configuring and
    managing\n   forwarding instances on a network device - focused primarily on\n
    \  deployments in service provider networks.  The model is vendor-\n   neutral
    and based on operational requirements expressed by operators.\n   A 'network instance'
    is defined to be a discrete forwarding table on\n   a network element, which contains
    Layer 3 and/or Layer 2 forwarding\n   entries.  Each network instance may instantiate
    its own sets of\n   protocols which control installation of forwarding entries
    into one\n   or more tables (which may be Layer 2 FIBs, or Layer 3 RIBs).\n\n\t
