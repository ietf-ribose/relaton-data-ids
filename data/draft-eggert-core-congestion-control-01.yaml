abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a simple, low-overhead,
    UDP-based protocol for use with resource-constrained IPnetworks and nodes. CoAP
    defines a simple technique to individuallyretransmit lost messages, but has no
    other congestion controlmechanisms.This document motivates the need for additional
    congestion controlmechanisms, and defines some simple strawman proposals. The
    goal isto encourage experimentation with these and other proposals, in orderto
    determine which mechanisms are feasible to implement on resource-constrained nodes
    and are effective in real deployments.</p>"
