abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Link-state protocols like IS-IS and OSPF have been designed
    to\n   distribute state information - state of the local adjacencies, state\n
    \  of the local prefix reachability, etc.  Each state can have\n   additional
    attributes associated with it, but all the attributes are\n   only meaningful
    while the state exists.\n\n   This document extends link-state IGPs to distribute
    event\n   notifications.  An event notification has a very limited lifetime.\n
    \  It is rapidly propagated across the network and leaves no state after\n   its
    lifetime.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
