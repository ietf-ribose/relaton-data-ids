abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a simplified algorithm for performing\n
    \  computational comparisons.  The design goal is to achieve an approach\n   that
    uses the smallest amount of logic.  Necessary secondary goals\n   include an approach
    that is language agnostic, fast, extensible, and\n   more predictable than other
    similar algorithms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
