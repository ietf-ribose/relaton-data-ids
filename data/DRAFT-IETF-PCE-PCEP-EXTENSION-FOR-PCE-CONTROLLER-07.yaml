abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-\n
    \  Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  It can compute optimal paths for\n   traffic
    across a network and can also update the paths to reflect\n   changes in the network
    or traffic demands.\n\n   PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched
    Paths\n   (LSPs), which are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path\n
    \  Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).  But SDN has a\n   broader
    applicability than signaled MPLS and GMPLS traffic-engineered\n   (TE) networks,
    and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range\n   of use cases.  PCEP
    has been proposed as a control protocol for use\n   in these environments to allow
    the PCE to be fully enabled as a\n   central controller.\n\n   A PCE-based central
    controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of\n   a distributed control plane
    by blending it with elements of SDN and\n   without necessarily completely replacing
    it.  Thus, the LSP can be\n   calculated/setup/initiated and the label forwarding
    entries can also\n   be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network\n
    \  devices along the path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies\n   as
    much as possible.\n\n   This document specifies the procedures and PCEP extensions
    for using\n   the PCE as the central controller.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
