abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Differentiated services architecture is widely deployed in\n
    \  traditional networks.  There exist well defined recommendations for\n   the
    use of appropriate differentiated service classes for different\n   types of traffic
    (eg. audio, video) in these networks.  Per-Hop\n   Behaviors are typically defined
    based on this recommendations.  With\n   emerging Low-power and Lossy Networks
    (LLNs), traffic originated in a\n   LLN, such as metering, command and control,
    may transit over a\n   converged campus IP network, or even a Wide Area Network,
    and will\n   share resources with traditional classes of traffic such as voice,\n
    \  video and data.  It is important to have defined differentiated\n   services
    recommendations for LLN traffic to co-exist with traditional\n   class of traffic.\n\n\t
