abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SDP is used in many signalling protocols at call control level
    (such\n   as SAP, SIP, BICC), bearer control level (such as RTSP, IPBCP) and\n
    \  gateway control level (such as H.248/MEGACO, MGCP). Scope of this RFC\n   is
    related to gateway control specific SDP usage. Gateway control\n   protocols do
    usually NOT define and introduce any new SDP parameters,\n   however, gateway
    control protocols need specific SDP parameter values\n   in addition to SDP usage
    at call or bearer control level. Such SDP\n   codepoints are collected by this
    RFC with the purpose of registration\n   with IANA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
