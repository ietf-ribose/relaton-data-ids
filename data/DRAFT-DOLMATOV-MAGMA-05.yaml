abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In addition to a new cipher with block length of n=128 bits
    (referred\n   to as \"Kyznyechik\" and described in RFC 7801) Russian Federal\n
    \  standard GOST R 34.12-2015 includes an updated version of the block\n   cipher
    with block length of n=64 bits and key length k=256 bits,\n   which is also referred
    to as \"Magma\".  The algorithm is an updated\n   version of an older block cipher
    with block length of n=64 bits\n   described in GOST 28147-89 (RFC 5830).  This
    document is intended to\n   be a source of information about the updated version
    of the 64-bit\n   cipher.  It may facilitate the use of the block cipher in Internet\n
    \  applications by providing information for developers and users of\n   GOST
    64-bit cipher with the revised version of the cipher for\n   encryption and decryption.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
