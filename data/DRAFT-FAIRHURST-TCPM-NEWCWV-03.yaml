abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document addresses issues that arise when TCP is used
    to support\n   variable-rate traffic that exhibits periods where the transmission\n
    \  rate is limited by the application rather than the congestion window.\n   It
    updates TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart quickly following\n   either an idle
    or application-limited interval.  The method is\n   expected to benefit variable-rate
    TCP applications, while also\n   providing an appropriate response if congestion
    is experienced.\n\n   It also evaluates TCP Congestion Window Validation, CWV,
    an IETF\n   experimental specification defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that\n
    \  CWV sought to address important issues, but failed to deliver a\n   widely
    used solution.  This document therefore recommends that the\n   IETF should consider
    moving RFC 2861 from Experimental to Historic\n   status, and that this is replaced
    by the current specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
