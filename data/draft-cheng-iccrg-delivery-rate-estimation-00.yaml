abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a generic algorithm for a transport protocol
    sender to estimate the current delivery rate of its data. At a high level, the
    algorithm estimates the rate at which the network delivered the most recent flight
    of outbound data packets for a single flow. In addition, it tracks whether the
    rate sample was application-limited, meaning the transmission rate was limited
    by the application rather than the congestion control algorithm. This algorithm
    can be implemented in any transport protocol that supports packet-delivery acknowledgment
    (thus far, open source implementations are available for TCP [RFC793] and QUIC
    [draft-ietf-quic-transport-00]).</p>"
