abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This specification provides a way to request timely completion forInternet
    mail delivery, for services such as facsimile and voicemessaging. Traditional
    Internet mail uses a _postal_ mail model,with normal delivery having an indeterminate
    gap between deliveryinto a mailbox and processing by the recipient. Timely completionadds
    a timelines service feature and extends delivery processingall the way to the
    recipient. This specification provides adeterministic service quality response,
    while preserving most ofthe traditional roles and responsibilities of the agents
    involvedin email transfers.</p>"
