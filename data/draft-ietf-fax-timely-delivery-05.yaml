abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification provides a way to request timely completion for
    Internet mail delivery, for services such as facsimile and voice messaging. Traditional
    Internet mail uses a _postal_ mail model, with normal delivery having an indeterminate
    gap between delivery into a mailbox and processing by the recipient. Timely completion
    adds a timelines service feature and extends delivery processing all the way to
    the recipient. This specification provides a deterministic service quality response,
    while preserving most of the traditional roles and responsibilities of the agents
    involved in email transfers.</p>"
