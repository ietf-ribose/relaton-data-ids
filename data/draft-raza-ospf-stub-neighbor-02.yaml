abstract:
- content: "<p>Open Shortest Path First stub neighbor is an enhancement to the protocol
    to support large scale of neighbors in some topologies with improved convergence
    behavior. It introduces limited changes protocol behavior to implement a scalable
    solution for hub and spoke topologies by limiting the functionality changes to
    the hub. The concepts are also applicable to a host running in a virtual machine
    environment.</p>"
