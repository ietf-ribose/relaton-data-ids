abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   \"Traffic Localization\" is proposed to release the pressure
    of\n   backbone mobile networks brought by increasing multimedia\n   applications.
    \ A universal storage protocol is needed to serve the\n   purpose on the edge
    storage nodes.  As the three candidates, HTTP,\n   NFS and iSCSI are compared
    concerning their implementation and\n   performance on embeded clients and servers
    in this paper.  Their\n   differences are discussed based on the experiment, and
    our suggestion\n   for universal storage protocols on edge storage nodes are put\n
    \  forward.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
