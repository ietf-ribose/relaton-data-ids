abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>An essential Operations, Administration and Maintenance requirement\nof
    the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the ability to monitor\nperformance metrics
    for packet loss and one-way and two-way delay for\nMPLS-TP pseudowires, Label
    Switched Paths, and Sections.  This\ndocument specifies protocol mechanisms to
    facilitate the efficient\nand accurate measurement of these performance metrics.\n\t
