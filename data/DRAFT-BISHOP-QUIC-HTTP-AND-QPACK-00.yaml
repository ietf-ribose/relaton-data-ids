abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HTTP/2 [RFC7540] uses HPACK [RFC7541] for header compression.\n
    \  However, HPACK relies on the in-order message-based semantics of the\n   HTTP/2
    framing layer in order to function.  Messages can only be\n   successfully decoded
    if processed by the receiver in the same order\n   as generated by the sender.
    \ This draft refines HPACK to loosen the\n   ordering requirements for use over
    QUIC\n   [I-D.hamilton-quic-transport-protocol] and describes changes to\n   [I-D.shade-quic-http2-mapping]
    to leverage the new compression.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
