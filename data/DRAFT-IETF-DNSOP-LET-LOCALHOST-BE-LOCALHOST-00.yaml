abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC6761 with the goal of ensuring that\n
    \  \"localhost\" can be safely relied upon as a name for the local host's\n   loopback
    interface.  To that end, stub resolvers are required to\n   resolve localhost
    names to loopback addresses.  Recursive DNS servers\n   are required to return
    \"NXDOMAIN\" when queried for localhost names,\n   making non-conformant stub
    resolvers more likely to fail and produce\n   problem reports that result in updates.\n\n
    \  Together, these requirements would allow applications and\n   specifications
    to join regular users in drawing the common-sense\n   conclusions that \"localhost\"
    means \"localhost\", and doesn't resolve\n   to somewhere else on the network.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
