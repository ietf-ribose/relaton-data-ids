abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In order to support more flexible replication methods, it isdesirable
    to specify some manner in which an LDAP client mayretrieve a set of changes that
    have been applied to an LDAP server'sdatabase. The client, which may be another
    LDAP server, may thenchoose to update its own replicated copy of the data. This
    documentspecifies an object class that may be used to represent changesapplied
    to an LDAP server. It also specifies a method fordiscovering the location of the
    container object that holds thesechange records, so that clients and servers have
    a common rendezvouspoint for this information.</p>"
