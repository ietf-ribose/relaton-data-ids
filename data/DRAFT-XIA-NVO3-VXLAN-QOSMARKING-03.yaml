abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Overlay networks such as The Virtual eXtensible Local Area
    Network\n   enable multiple tenants to operate in a data center.  Each tenant\n
    \  needs to be assigned a priority group to prioritize their traffic\n   using
    tenant based quality of service marking.  Also, cloud carriers\n   wish to use
    quality of service to differentiate different\n   applications, i.e. legacy, traffic
    based marking.  For these\n   purposes, Quality of Service bits are assigned in
    the Virtual\n   eXtensible Local Area Network outer Ethernet header.  How these
    bits\n   are assigned and are processed in the network are explained in\n   detail.
    \ Also the document presents a quality of service framework\n   for overlay networks
    such as Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
