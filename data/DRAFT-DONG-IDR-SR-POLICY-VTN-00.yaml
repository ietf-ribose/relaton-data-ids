abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) Policy is a set of candidate paths, each\n
    \  consisting of one or more segment lists and the associated\n   information.
    \ The header of a packet steered in an SR Policy is\n   augmented with an ordered
    list of segments associated with that SR\n   Policy.  In scenarios where multiple
    Virtual Transport Networks\n   (VTNs) exist in the network, the VTN in which the
    SR policy is\n   instantiated may also need to be specified, so that the header
    of\n   packet can also be augmented with the information associated with the\n
    \  VTN.  An SR Policy candidate path can be distributed using BGP SR\n   Policy.
    \ This document defines extensions to BGP SR policy to specify\n   the VTN associated
    with the SR policy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
