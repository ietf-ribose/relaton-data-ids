abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes IPMR, a scalable variable adaptive multi- rate
    speech and audio codec designed for use in IP based networks. This codec is suitable
    for real time communications such as telephony, voice&amp;video conferencing.Four
    different sampling frequencies are supported for encoding the audio input signal.
    Adaptation to network characteristics is provided through control of bitrate,
    packet rate, packet loss resilience and use of discontinuous transmission (DTX).
    IP-MR support different profiles for input signal content which should be specified
    during codec initialization. It can be in Speech, Audio or Auto-detection mode.
    In Auto-detection mode codec recognizes type of input content automatically and
    switch to appropriate Speech or Audio mode automatically.</p>"
