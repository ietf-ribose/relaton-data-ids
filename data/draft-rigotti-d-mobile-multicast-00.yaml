abstract:
- content: "<p>The increasing deployment of both, IP multicast and mobility, rises
    the problem of delivering IPv6 multicast traffic to mobile nodes. This document
    proposes an approach to the problem, named Decentralized Mobile Multicast, that
    combines tunnelling and dynamic subscription to the multicast groups. The proposed
    solution aims to reduce handover time, and to diminish the overhead produced by
    multicast subscriptions. As a consequence of the decentralized selection of multicast
    routers, a single point of failure is eliminated.</p>"
