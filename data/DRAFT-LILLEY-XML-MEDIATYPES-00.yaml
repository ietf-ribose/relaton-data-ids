abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification standardizes three media types -- application/xml,\n
    \  application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd --\n   for
    use in exchanging network entities that are related to the\n   Extensible Markup
    Language (XML) while defining text/xml and text/\n   xml-external-parsed-entity
    as aliases for the respective application/\n   types.  This specification also
    standardizes a convention (using the\n   suffix '+xml') for naming media types
    outside of these five types\n   when those media types represent XML MIME entities.
    \ XML MIME\n   entities are currently exchanged via the HyperText Transfer Protocol\n
    \  on the World Wide Web, are an integral part of the WebDAV protocol\n   for
    remote web authoring, and are expected to have utility in many\n   domains.\n\n
    \  Major differences from [RFC3023] are alignment of charset handling\n   for
    text/xml and text/xml-external-parsed-entity with application/\n   xml, the addition
    of XPointer and XML Base as fragment identifiers\n   and base URIs, respectively,
    mention of the XPointer Registry, and\n   updating of many references.\n\n\t </p>\n
