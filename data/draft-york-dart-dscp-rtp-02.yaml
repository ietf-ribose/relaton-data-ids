abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the interaction between Differentiated Services
    (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real-time network
    communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol
    (RTP). DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments
    to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs).
    As a result, use of different DSCPs within a single traffic stream may cause transport
    protocol interactions (e.g., reordering). In addition, DSCP markings may be changed
    or removed between the traffic source and destination. This document covers the
    implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including
    RTCWEB.</p>"
