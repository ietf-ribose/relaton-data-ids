abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The PWE3 charter permits three PSN types, namely \"IP (both versions),\n
    \  L2TP, or MPLS\".  The majority of drafts submitted to the working\n   group
    have focused on MPLS PSNs, and lesser attention has been given\n   to L2TPv3.
    \ Only the TDMoIP drafts have explicitly specified UDP/IP\n   as PSN, and only
    they stipulate the use of UDP port numbers as PW\n   labels.  This draft discusses
    PWs based on UDP/IP, concentrating on\n   three issues, namely 1) the advisability
    of using UDP port numbers as\n   PW labels, 2) which UDP port number to use, and
    3) what label\n   distribution protocol should be employed.\n\t </p>\n      "
