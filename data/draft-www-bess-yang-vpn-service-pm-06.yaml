abstract:
- content: "<p>The data model defined in RFC8345 introduces vertical layering relationships
    between networks that can be augmented to cover network/service topologies. This
    document defines a YANG model for both Network Performance Monitoring and VPN
    Service Performance Monitoring that can be used to monitor and manage network
    performance on the topology at higher layer or the service topology between VPN
    sites. This model is designed as an augmentation to the network topology YANG
    data model defined in RFC8345.</p>"
