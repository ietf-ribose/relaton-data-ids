abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies VPLS extensions to support the new
    VLAN aware\n   bundling service interface type. The new service interface type\n
    \  provides advantages in reducing the provisioning overhead, as well as\n   pseudowire
    scalability in environments where a large number of VLANs\n   need to be extended
    over an MPLS/IP network while maintaining traffic\n   segregation among those
    VLANs.\n\n   The VLAN aware bundling service interface can handle the high scale\n
    \  requirements of today's Data Centers by bundling different VLANs over\n   a
    single WAN VPLS instance used to interconnect sites. Furthermore,\n   this document
    specifies an extension to the LDP MAC Withdrawal\n   mechanisms to allow per-VLAN
    MAC flushing for the new service\n   interface type.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
