abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the rapid development of the Internet, huge amounts of data
    are\n   being generated.  To satisfy user demands, service providers deploy\n
    \  services near the edge networks.  In order to achieve better\n   performances,
    computing functions and user traffic need to be\n   scheduled properly.  However,
    it is challenging to efficiently\n   schedule resources among the distributed
    edge servers due to the lack\n   of underlying information, e.g., network topology,
    traffic\n   distribution, link delay/bandwidth, utilization/capability of\n   computing
    servers.  In this document, we employ the ALTO protocol to\n   help deliver functions
    and schedule traffic within the edge computing\n   platform.  The protocol will
    provide information of multiple\n   resources for the distributed edge computing
    platform.  The usage of\n   ALTO will improve the efficiency of function delivery
    in edge\n   computing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
