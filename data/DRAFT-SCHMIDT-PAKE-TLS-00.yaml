abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to integrate Password-Authenticated
    Key\n   Agreement (PAKE) schemes into TLS.  These schemes enable two parties\n
    \  who share a potentially weak password to derive a common\n   cryptographic
    key, allowing them to establish a secure channel.  The\n   current document defines
    a generic way to integrate PAKE schemes into\n   TLS.  In addition, it demonstrates
    how to use the well-known Password\n   Authenticated Connection Establishment
    (PACE) scheme in TLS as an\n   example for the generic construction.\n\n\t </p>\n
