abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] is designed
    to\n    support remote storage and access of common application option,\n    configuration
    and preference information.  Its main benefits are in\n    providing a way for
    users to gain access to personal information\n    from any computer at a location
    supporting an internet connection,\n    by keeping this information stored centrally
    on a server.\n    Additionally, it allows 'kiosk' style use of computers so that
    users\n    do not need to store data locally on a shared or public workstation\n
    \   or network computer. This specification defines a standard dataset\n    class
    for personal dictionaries that would allow users to keep one\n    or more 'user
    dictionaries' stored on an ACAP server for access by\n    any ACAP-aware application
    that requires such information, for\n    example any application that uses a spell
    checker.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
