abstract:
- content: '<p>This document proposes the addition of two new values to the "SameSite"
    cookie attribute defined in RFC6265bis [I-D.ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis]: "FirstPartyLax"
    and "FirstPartyStrict". These values are conceptually similar to the existing
    "Lax" and "Strict" values, but base the delivery checks on the First-Party Sets
    [first-party-set] of a request''s initiator and target, rather than on their respective
    registrable domains. This widens the scope of a given cookie''s applicability,
    enabling entities that have sharded themselves across multiple registrable domains
    to maintain HTTP state without exposing themselves to the risks of "SameSite=None".</p>'
