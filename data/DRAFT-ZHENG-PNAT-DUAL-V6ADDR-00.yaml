abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a derived PNAT mechanism that hosts do
    not\nneed IPv4 addresses, neither public, private nor faked IPv4 address.\nPNAT
    solution was first proposed by Huang &amp; Deng in [PNAT], which\nprovides application-level
    transparency for hosts in IPv4 and IPv6\nhybrid environments via host-based IPv4/IPv6
    translation technique. \n\nThis specification addresses one of the PNAT scenarios
    where a host\nis provided IPv6 only network connectivity. Two IPv6 addresses will\nbe
    assigned to a PNAT host. One is native IPv6 address, and the other\nis a PNAT
    IPv6 address. In this case, IPv4- originated communications\nstill need to be
    translated into IPv6. However, the host does not\nneed to be assigned an IPv4
    address. Instead, a PNAT IPv6 address\nwill take the place of the originally required
    IPv4 address.Two\nformats of PNAT IPv6 address,4rd (IPv4 Rapid Deployment) address
    and\n4rm (IPv4 Rapid Migration) address, are defined.\n\nThe advantage of the
    derived PNAT mechanism is that such IPv6 PNAT\nhost supports both IPv4 and IPv6
    applications, with SIMPLICITY,\nSCALABILITY and without worrying about any IPv4
    address allocating\nissue.\n\t </p>\n      "
