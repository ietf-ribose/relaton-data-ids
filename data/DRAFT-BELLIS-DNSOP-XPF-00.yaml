abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is becoming more commonplace to install front end proxy
    devices in\n   front of DNS servers to provide (for example) load balancing or
    to\n   perform transport layer conversions.\n\n   This document defines an option
    within the EDNS(0) Extension\n   Mechanism for DNS that allows a DNS server to
    receive the original\n   client source IP address when supplied by trusted proxies.\n\n\t
