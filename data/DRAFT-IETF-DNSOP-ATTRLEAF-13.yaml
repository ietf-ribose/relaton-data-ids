abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Formally, any DNS resource record may occur under any domain
    name.\n   However some services have defined an operational convention, which\n
    \  applies to DNS leaf nodes that are under a DNS branch having one or\n   more
    reserved node names, each beginning with an _underscore.  The\n   underscored
    naming construct defines a semantic scope for DNS record\n   types that are associated
    with the parent domain, above the\n   underscored branch.  This specification
    explores the nature of this\n   DNS usage and defines the \"DNS Global Underscore
    Scoped Entry\n   Registry\" with IANA.  The purpose of the Underscore registry
    is to\n   avoid collisions resulting from the use of the same underscore-based\n
    \  name, for different services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
