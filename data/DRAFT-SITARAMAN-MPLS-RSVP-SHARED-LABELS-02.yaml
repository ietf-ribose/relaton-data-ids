abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the scale of MPLS RSVP-TE networks has grown, so the number
    of\n   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) supported by individual network elements\n
    \  has increased.  Various implementation recommendations have been\n   proposed
    to manage the resulting increase in control plane state.\n\n   However, those
    changes have had no effect on the number of labels\n   that a transit Label Switching
    Router (LSR) has to support in the\n   forwarding plane.  That number is governed
    by the number of LSPs\n   transiting or terminated at the LSR and is directly
    related to the\n   total LSP state in the control plane.\n\n   This document defines
    a mechanism to prevent the maximum size of the\n   label space limit on an LSR
    from being a constraint to control plane\n   scaling on that node.  That is, it
    allows many more LSPs to be\n   supported than there are forwarding plane labels
    available.\n\n   This work introduces the notion of pre-installed 'pop labels'
    that\n   are applied per Traffic Engineering link and that can be shared by\n
    \  MPLS RSVP-TE LSPs that traverse these links.  This approach\n   significantly
    reduces the forwarding plane state required to support\n   a large number of LSPs.
    \ This couples the feature benefits of the\n   RSVP-TE control plane with the
    simplicity of the Segment Routing MPLS\n   forwarding plane.\n\n   This document
    also introduces the ability to mix different types of\n   label operations along
    the path of an LSP, thereby allowing the\n   ingress router or an external controller
    to influence how to\n   optimally place a LSP in the network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
