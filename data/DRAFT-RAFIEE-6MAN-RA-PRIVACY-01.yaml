abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Privacy is an important issue for many governments [eurolaw]
    and\n   users where its importance becomes more evident every day. Nodes\n   might
    change their IP addresses frequently in order to avoid being\n   tracked by attackers
    and which also results in the prevention of\n   information being leaked from
    their nodes. In IPv6 networks there is\n   currently one solution for maintaining
    privacy for nodes when IPv6\n   StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) (RFC
    4662) is used.\n   Unfortunately this solution, i.e., Privacy Extension (RFC 4941),
    has\n   some problems, such as not generating a new Interface ID (IID) after\n
    \  changing the router prefix. The RFC also gives no explanation as to\n   how
    to use CGA in its randomizing solution. The purpose of this\n   document is to
    address these issues and to update the current RFC.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
