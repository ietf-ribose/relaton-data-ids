abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A pseudowire (PW) is used in Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)\nsolutions
    to form any-to-any connections and provide service\ndemuliplexing among Provider
    Edge routers (PEs), and is normally\ntransported over one single network path.
    Flow-aware PW enable a PW\nto take advantage of Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) and/or
    Link\nAggregation Groups (LAG) in a packet switched network (PSN). PW\npackets
    with a flow label can be transported over multi-paths. This\nmethod can apply
    to the PWs in a VPLS service.\n\nThis document describes how VPLS solutions utilize
    a PW with a flow\nlabel, and defines protocol extension for the provisioning of
    such\nPWs.\n\t </p>\n      "
