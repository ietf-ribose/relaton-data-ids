abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the problems that enterprises face
    today\n   when connecting their branch offices to dynamic workloads in third\n
    \  party data centers (a.k.a. Cloud DCs).\n\n   It examines some of the approaches
    interconnecting cloud DCs with\n   enterprises' on-premises DCs &amp; branch offices.
    This document also\n   describes some of the (network) problems that many enterprises
    face\n   when they have workloads &amp; applications &amp; data split among hybrid\n
    \  data centers, especially for those enterprises with multiple sites\n   that
    are already interconnected by VPNs (e.g., MPLS L2VPN/L3VPN).\n\n   Current operational
    problems are examined to determine whether there\n   is a need to improve existing
    protocols or whether a new protocol is\n   necessary to solve them.\n\n\t </p>\n
