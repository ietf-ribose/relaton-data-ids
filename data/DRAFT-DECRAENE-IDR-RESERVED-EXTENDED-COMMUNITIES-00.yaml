abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document assigns two BGP extended community types, one\n
    \  transitive and one non-transitive.  It also defines two IANA\n   registries
    in order to allow the allocation of reserved transitive\n   and non-transitive
    extended communities.  These are similar to the\n   existing reserved (formerly
    Well-known) BGP communities defined in\n   RFC 1997 but provides an easier control
    of inter-AS community\n   advertissement as a community could be chosen as transitive
    or non-\n   transitive across ASes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
