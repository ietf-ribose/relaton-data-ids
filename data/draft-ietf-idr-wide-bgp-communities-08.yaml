abstract:
- content: "<p>Route tagging plays an important role in external BGP relations, communicating
    various routing policies between peers. It is also a very common best practice
    for operators to propagate various additional route information between internal
    peers. The most common tool used today to attach various information about routes
    is through the use of BGP communities. This document defines a new encoding which
    will enhance and simplify what can be accomplished today with the use of BGP communities.
    The most important addition this specification makes over currently defined BGP
    communities is the ability to specify and advertise an operator's parameters for
    execution It also provides an extensible platform for any future community encoding
    requirements.</p>"
