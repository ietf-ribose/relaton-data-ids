abstract:
  content: "<p>A range of Management Information Base (MIB) modules has beendeveloped
    to help model and manage the various aspects ofMultiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    networks. These MIB modules aredefined in separate documents that focus on the
    specific areas ofresponsibility of the modules that they describe.The MPLS Transport
    Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of MPLSfunctionality specific to the construction
    of packet-switchedtransport networks.This document describes the MIB-based management
    architecture forMPLS-TP and indicates the interrelationships between the differentMIB
    modules used for MPLS-TP network management.This document is a product of a joint
    Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunication Union
    TelecommunicationStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS TransportProfile
    within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support thecapabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network asdefined by the ITU-T.This Informational Internet-Draft
    is aimed at achieving IETFConsensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject
    to an IETFLast Call.[RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as
    an RFC andinsert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the publishedRFC
    has IETF Consensus.]Farrel &amp; King, et al.[page 1]draft-farrel-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-01.txtSeptember
