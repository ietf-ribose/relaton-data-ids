abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS queries sometimes experience problems with end to end\n
    \  connectivity at times and places where HTTPS flows freely.\n\n   HTTPS provides
    the most practical mechanism for reliable end to end\n   communication.  Its use
    of TLS provides integrity and confidentiality\n   guarantees and its use of HTTP
    allows it to interoperate with\n   proxies, firewalls, and authentication systems
    where required for\n   transit.\n\n   This document describes how to run DNS service
    over HTTP using\n   https:// URIs.\n\n   [ This paragraph is to be removed when
    this document is published as\n   an RFC ] Comments on this draft can be sent
    to the DNS over HTTP\n   mailing list at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/dnsoverhttp
    .\n\n\t </p>\n      "
