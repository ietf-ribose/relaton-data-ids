abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an application profile of the ACE framework
    for\n   Authentication and Authorization, to request and provision keying\n   material
    in group communication scenarios that are based on CoAP and\n   secured with Group
    Object Security for Constrained RESTful\n   Environments (OSCORE).  This application
    profile delegates the\n   authentication and authorization of Clients that join
    an OSCORE group\n   through a Resource Server acting as Group Manager for that
    group.\n   This application profile leverages protocol-specific transport\n   profiles
    of ACE to achieve communication security, server\n   authentication and proof-of-possession
    for a key owned by the Client\n   and bound to an OAuth 2.0 Access Token.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
