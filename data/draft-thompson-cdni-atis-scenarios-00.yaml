abstract:
  content: <p>The ATIS IPTV Interoperability Forum (IIF) is a leading developer ofrequirements,
    standards, and specifications for Internet ProtocolTelevision, or IPTV. IIF has
    specified an architecture for ContentOn Demand applications which was published
    as the [ATIS-0800042] IPTVContent on Demand (CoD) Service specification. ATIS
    IIF is nowworking on revision 2 of this document. Revision 2 of ATIS CoDspecification
    includes an additional work item called "InternetSourced Content" which includes
    "off net delivery". Both InternetSourced Content and off net delivery will address
    scenarios thatinclude delivery of content from a Content Service Provider throughmultiple
    CDNs operated by different organizations to a user agent.This document provides
    information on [ATIS-0800042], and theInternet Sourced Content and off net Delivery
    use cases that arerelevant to CDNI.The ATIS IIF architecture group focuses on
    developing architecturesand prefers to reference existing protocols where ever
    possible. If,and as, the IETF CDNI effort progresses, the ATIS IIF architecturegroup
    will be evaluating the protocols defined by the CDNI workinggroup for inclusion
    in the CDN interconnect scenarios defined as partof the Internet Sourced Content
    and off net Delivery use cases.A goal of the present document is to illustrate
    the Internet SourcedContent and off net Delivery use cases defined in revision
    2 of theATIS CoD architecture that are relevant to the IETF CDNI work. It ishoped
    that these use cases can also be used to guide requirements forthe development
    of IETF CDNI protocols.</p>
