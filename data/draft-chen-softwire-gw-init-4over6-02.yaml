abstract:
- content: "<p>Gateway-Initiated 4over6 is a variant of Lightweight 4over6. A Lightweight
    B4 in Lightweight 4over6 mechanism is a router which acts as a tunnel initiator
    for the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel. This mechanism mainly focuses on the scenario in
    which an IPv4 address and related configuration information is configured to the
    device behind Lightweight B4. Gateway-Initiated 4over6 uses the full IPv4 address
    rather than a shared address. This enables an unmodified end server or host that
    is behind a Lightweight B4 to get access to the IPv4 Internet through an IPv6
    network.</p>"
