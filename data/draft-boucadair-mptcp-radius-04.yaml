abstract:
- content: "<p>Because of the lack of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) support at the server
    side, some service providers now consider a network-assisted model that relies
    upon the activation of a dedicated function called MPTCP Conversion Point (MCP).
    Network-assisted MPTCP deployment models are designed to facilitate the adoption
    of MPTCP for the establishment of multi-path communications without making any
    assumption about the support of MPTCP by the communicating peers. MCPs located
    in the network are responsible for establishing multi-path communications on behalf
    of endpoints, thereby taking advantage of MPTCP capabilities to achieve different
    goals that include (but are not limited to) optimization of resource usage (e.g.,
    bandwidth aggregation), of resiliency (e.g., primary/backup communication paths),
    and traffic offload management. This document specifies a new Remote Authentication
    Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) attributes that carry the IP addresses that will
    be returned to authorized users to reach one or multiple MCPs.</p>"
