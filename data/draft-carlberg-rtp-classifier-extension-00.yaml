abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a new RTP header extension. The purpose ofthe
    extension is to provide an additional information that furtherdistinguishes the
    RTP datagram (and its payload) from other datagramscontaining the same type of
    payload. Specifically, a classifierfield is defined in the extension header that
    contains value such as'emergency'. RTP compliant implementations that do not recognize
    theclassifier extension header must continue to process the packet andnot take
    no adverse action. Criteria for inserting the values in theclassifier header,
    and any QoS treatment of the packet based on thosevalues, is outside the scope
    of this specification.</p>"
