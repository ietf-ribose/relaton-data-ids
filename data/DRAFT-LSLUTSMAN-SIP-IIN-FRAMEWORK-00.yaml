abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a framework for an Internet Intelligent
    \nNetwork (IIN) architecture which accommodates a service logic \nexecution environment
    on a session initiation protocol (SIP) proxy, \nbut at the same time is able to
    support the traditional PSTN IN-based \narchitecture which uses a service control
    point (SCP) as a service \nexecution environment.  A large number of services,
    including \ntraditional advanced 800 and other legacy services, as well as IN
    \nspecific services (Internet Call Waiting (ICW) for ex ample) must be \nmade
    available for the Internet. Implementation of such services \nrequires a software
    support architecture that which addresses the \nfollowing issues: 1)where and
    how to create the service logic; 2)what \nkind of software instrumentation should
    be used to write the service \nlogic (e.g., CPL scripts, Parlay Group API's, or
    JAIN SIP API); and \n3)where to run and how to trigger the service logic.  Traditional
    \nPSTN architectures address these issues under the umbrella of IN. The \ntraditional
    IN approach is subject to the parameters of the PSTN architectural and traditional
    legacy services constraints.  Though it would be preferable to avoid being locked
    into these constraints, it is not possible to bypass them completely (this is
    especially true in instances when PSTN and IN networks are inter-working).  Hence
    the draft proposes to support both a) 'IP-network-based IN' (e.g., use of script-based-methods
    such as CPL or CGI), and b) integration of traditional IN-based service logic
    (e.g., SCP-based) and SIP \ncall control protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
