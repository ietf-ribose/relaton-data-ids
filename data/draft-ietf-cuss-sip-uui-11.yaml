abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a class of applications which benefit from using SIP to exchange
    User to User Information (UUI) data during session establishment. This information,
    known as call control UUI data, is a small piece of data inserted by an application
    initiating the session, and utilized by an application accepting the session.
    The rules which apply for a specific application are defined by a UUI package.
    This UUI data is opaque to SIP and its function is unrelated to any basic SIP
    function. This document defines a new SIP header field, User-to-User, to transport
    UUI data, along with an extension mechanism.</p>"
