    of\n   cryptographic certificates.  Well-defined architectural objectives\n   will
    be important guides to the detailed design work needed to\n   support the deployment
    of a Global Trust Anchor for the RPKI.  This\n   document identifies some of the
    questions that need to be addressed\n   in the architectural guidelines for key
