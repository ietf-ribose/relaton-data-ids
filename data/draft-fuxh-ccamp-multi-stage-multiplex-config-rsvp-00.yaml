abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Multi stages multiplexing configuration requirement is defined in[MULTI-STAGES-MULTIPLEXING-CONFIG-REQ]
    document. Multi stagesmultiplexing configuration framework is diefined in [MULTI-STAGES-MULTIPLEXING-CONFIG-FRW]
    document. They describe some scenarios forthe interworking between regions with
    1.25G TS and 2.5G TS and themulti-domain OTN applications based on the tunnel
    design. Multistages multiplexing is desirable to facilitate the introduction ofnew
    ODU0 and ODUflex signals to an existing network without having toupgrade every
    node in the network. So ODU0/ODUflex can be mappedinto ODU1/ODU2/ODU3 transit
    across the 2.5G TS region. Multi stagesmultiplexing/demultiplexing are also used
    to support the multi-domainOTN applications based on the tunnel design. This document
    describesthe RSVP-TE extension for multi stages multiplexing configuration inG.709
