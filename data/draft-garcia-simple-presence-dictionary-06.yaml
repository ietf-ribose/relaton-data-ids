abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a text-based protocol for
    initiating and managing communication sessions. The protocol is extended by the
    SIP-events notification framework to provide subscriptions and notifications of
    SIP events. One example of such event notification mechanism is presence, which
    is expressed in XML documents called presence documents. SIP can be compressed
    by using Signaling Compression (SigComp), which is enhanced by using the SIP/
    Session Description Protocol (SDP) dictionary to achieve better compression rates.
    However, the SIP/SDP dictionary is not able to increase the compression factor
    of (typically lengthy) presence documents. This memo defines the presence-specific
    static dictionary that SigComp can use in order to compress presence documents
    to achieve higher efficiency. The dictionary is compression-algorithm independent.
