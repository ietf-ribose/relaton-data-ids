abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A number of IETF protocols make use of Abstract Syntax Notation
    One(ASN.1), which is a very complex language for describing abstracttypes and
    values, in addition to several sets of encoding rules forthose types and values.
    Some of these uses of ASN.1, particularlythe Kerberos protocol [RFC1510] pose
    implementation problems. Thisdocument analyzes some of the likely problems associated
    with the useof ASN.1 in IETF protocols, and some possible reasons for theseproblems.</p>"
