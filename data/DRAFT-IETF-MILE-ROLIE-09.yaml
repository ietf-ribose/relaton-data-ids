abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a resource-oriented approach for security\n
    \  automation information publication, discovery, and sharing.  Using\n   this
    approach, producers may publish, share, and exchange\n   representations of software
    descriptors, security incidents, attack\n   indicators, software vulnerabilities,
    configuration checklists, and\n   other security automation information as web-addressable
    resources.\n   Furthermore, consumers and other stakeholders may access and search\n
    \  this security information as needed, establishing a rapid and on-\n   demand
    information exchange network for restricted internal use or\n   public access
    repositories.  This specification extends the Atom\n   Publishing Protocol and
    Atom Syndication Format to transport and\n   share security automation resource
    representations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
