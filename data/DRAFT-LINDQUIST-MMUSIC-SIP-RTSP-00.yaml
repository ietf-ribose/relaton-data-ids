abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is widely used for establishing\nmultimedia
    sessions, whereas the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)\nis a protocol for use
    in streaming media systems.  RTSP has a dual\nrole: it establishes a media session
    for the delivery of streaming\nmedia as well as controls the streaming session
    once it has been set\nup.  Since RTSP is also used for session establishment,
    there exists\nan overlap between the functionality provided by SIP and RTSP.  In\nthis
    document, we analyze a model in which SIP and the SDP offer/\nanswer model are
    used to set up a streaming session with an RTSP\ncontrol channel and one or more
    media delivery streams.  Such a model\nis beneficial since it allows the reuse
    of current architecture and\nfunctionality (e.g., authentication, charging, and
    QoS) established\naround SIP also for RTSP-based streaming.\n\t </p>\n      "
