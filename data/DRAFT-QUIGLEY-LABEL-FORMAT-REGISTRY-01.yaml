abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the past Mandatory Access Control(MAC) systems have used very\nrigid
    policies which were hardcoded into the particular protocol and\nplatform.  As
    MAC systems are more widely deployed additional\nflexibility in mechanism and
    policy is required.  Where traditional\ntrusted systems implemented Multi-Level
    Security and integrity\nmodels, modern systems have expanded to include technologies
    such as\ntype enforcement.  Due to the wide range of policies and mechanisms\nit
    has proven through past efforts to be virtually impossible to\naccomodate all
    parties in one security label format and model.\n\nTo accomodate multiple MAC
    mechanisms and label formats this document\nproposes a registry of label format
    specifications.  This registry\ncontains several identifiers to accomodate both
    integer and string\npreferences and associates those identifiers with an extensive\ndocument
    outlining the exact syntax and use of the particular label\nformat.\n\t </p>\n
