abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo discusses and proposes a framework for the development
    of IPperformance benchmarking methodologies in the case of systems under test(SUT)
    running IETF routing protocols. The intent of this document is tofacilitate the
    use of existing metrics developed by the BMWG and otherworking groups. This will
    be accomplished by specifying routerconfiguration and state parameters and characterizing
    their effect on IPpacket forwarding in terms of these existing metrics. The terms
    definedin this memo will be used in addition to terms defined in RFCs 1242,2285,
    and 2544 and 2761. This memo is a product of the BenchmarkingMethodology Working
    Group (BMWG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF).</p>"
