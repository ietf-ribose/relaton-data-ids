abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) defines a mechanism
    and \nprotocol for controlling backup, recovery, and other transfers of \ndata
    between primary and secondary storage.  \nThe NDMP architecture separates the
    network attached Data Management \nApplication (DMA), Data Servers and Tape Servers
    participating in \narchival or recovery operations. NDMP also provides low-level
    control \nof tape devices and SCSI media changers.  \nThe XDR and TCP/IP protocols
    are foundations for NDMP.  \nThe key goals of NDMP include interoperability, contemporary
    \nfunctionality, and extensibility. \nThe XDR and TCP/IP protocols are foundations
