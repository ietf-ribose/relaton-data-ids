abstract:
- content: "<p>The CBOR Signing And Encrypted Message (COSE) structure syntax uses
    the COSE Key structure for placing keys in a message. This document extends the
    way that keys can be identified and transported by providing attributes that refer
    to or contain X.509 certificates. Contributing to this document The source for
    this draft is being maintained in GitHub. Suggested changes should be submitted
    as pull requests at &lt;https://github.com/ cose-wg/X509&gt;. Instructions are
    on that page as well. Editorial changes can be managed in GitHub, but any substantial
    issues need to be discussed on the COSE mailing list.</p>"
