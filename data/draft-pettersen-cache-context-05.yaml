abstract:
  content: <p>A common problem for sensitive web services is informing the client,in
    a reliable fashion, when a password protected resource is nolonger valid because
    the user is logged out of the service. This is,in particular, considered a potential
    security problem by somesensitive services, such as online banking, when the user
    navigatesthe client's history list, which is supposed to display the resourceas
    it was when it was loaded, not as it is at some later point intime.This document
    presents a method for collecting such sensitiveresources into a group, called
    a "Cache Context", which permits theserver to invalidate all the resources belonging
    in the group eitherby direct action, or according to some expiration policy. Thecontext
    can be configured to invalidate not just the resources, butalso specific cookies,
    HTTP authentication credentials and HTTP overTLS session information.</p>
