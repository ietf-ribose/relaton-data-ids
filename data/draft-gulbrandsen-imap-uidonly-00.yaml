abstract:
- content: "<p>Opening a large mailbox in IMAP can take mailbox; 30 seconds is realistic
    if the mailbox contains ten million messages. Most of that time is needed to number
    the messages consecutively. This extension provides a way to avoid having to number
    the messages consecutively.</p>"
