abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a standardized framework for implementing the
    massive data migration between traditional databases and big-data platforms on
    the cloud via Internet, especially for an instance of Hadoop data architecture.
    The main goal of the framework is to provide more concise and friendly interfaces
    for users more easily and quickly migrate the massive data from a relational database
    to a distributed platform for a variety of requirements, in order to make full
    use of distributed storage resource and distributed computing capability to solve
    the bottleneck problems of both storage and computing performance in traditional
    enterprise-level applications. This document covers the fundamental architecture,
    data elements specification, operations, and interface related to massive data
    migration.</p>"
