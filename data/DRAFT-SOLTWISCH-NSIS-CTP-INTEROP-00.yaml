abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents a framework for interoperation between
    the\nContext Transfer Protocol (CTP) and the Next Steps in Signaling\n(NSIS) protocols.
    The main goals we are trying to achieve are: to\nprovide a seamless handover,
    to establish QoS and other states\nrequired by NSIS, to have this process appropriately
    secured, and to\ntradeoff between security, complexity and performance.\n\t </p>\n
