abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery) normally discloses information
    about\n   both the devices offering services and the devices requesting\n   services.
    \ This information includes host names, network parameters,\n   and possibly a
    further description of the corresponding service\n   instance.  Especially when
    mobile devices engage in DNS Service\n   Discovery over Multicast DNS at a public
    hotspot, a serious privacy\n   problem arises.\n\n   We propose to solve this
    problem by a two-stage approach.  In the\n   first stage, hosts discover Private
    Discovery Service Instances via\n   DNS-SD using special formats to protect their
    privacy.  These service\n   instances correspond to Private Discovery Servers
    running on peers.\n   In the second stage, hosts directly query these Private
    Discovery\n   Servers via DNS-SD over TLS.  A pairwise shared secret necessary
    to\n   establish these connections is only known to hosts authorized by a\n   pairing
    system.\n\n   Revisions of this draft are currently considered in the DNSSD working\n
    \  group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
