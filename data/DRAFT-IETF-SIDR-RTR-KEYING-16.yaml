abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>BGPsec-speaking routers are provisioned with private keys in order
    to\n   sign BGPsec announcements.  The corresponding public keys are\n   published
    in the global Resource Public Key Infrastructure, enabling\n   verification of
    BGPsec messages.  This document describes two methods\n   of generating the public-private
    key-pairs: router-driven and\n   operator-driven.\n\t </p>\n      "
