abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operation of IPv6 over tunnel virtual\n
    \  Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) links using Asymmetric Extended\n   Route
    Optimization (AERO).  Nodes attached to AERO links can exchange\n   packets via
    trusted intermediate routers that provide forwarding\n   services to reach off-link
    destinations and redirection services for\n   route optimization.  AERO provides
    an IPv6 link-local address format\n   known as the AERO address that supports
    operation of the IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol and links IPv6 ND to
    IPv6 routing.\n   Admission control and provisioning are supported by the Dynamic
    Host\n   Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), and node mobility is\n   naturally
    supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
