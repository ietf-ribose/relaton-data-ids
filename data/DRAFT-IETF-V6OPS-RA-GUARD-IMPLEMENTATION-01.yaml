abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) mechanism is
    commonly\n   employed to mitigate attack vectors based on forged ICMPv6 Router\n
    \  Advertisement messages.  Many existing IPv6 deployments rely on RA-\n   Guard
    as the first line of defense against the aforementioned attack\n   vectors.  However,
    some implementations of RA-Guard have been found\n   to be prone to circumvention
    by employing IPv6 Extension Headers.\n   This document describes the evasion techniques
    that affect the\n   aforementioned implementations, and provides advice on the\n
    \  implementation of RA-Guard, such that the RA-Guard evasion vectors\n   are
    eliminated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
