abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new FADVISE operation for NFSv4.2 to support
    the posix_fadvise function. FADVISE will communicate expected application behavior
    to the server, allowing servers to optimize future I/O requests for a file. The
    posix_fadvise function is supported in Linux and many other operating systems
    and is starting be widely used by applications. In addition, the FADVISE operation
    can communicate other application directions such as the use of direct I/O.</p>"
