abstract:
- content: "<p>A common design pattern in Internet of Things (IoT) deployments is
    the use of a constrained device that collects data via sensor or controls actuators
    for use in home automation, industrial control systems, smart cities and other
    IoT deployments. This document defines a Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram
    TLS (DTLS) 1.2 profile that offers communications security for this data exchange
    thereby preventing eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery. The lack of
    communication security is a common vulnerability in Internet of Things products
    that can easily be solved by using these well-researched and widely deployed Internet
    security protocols.</p>"
