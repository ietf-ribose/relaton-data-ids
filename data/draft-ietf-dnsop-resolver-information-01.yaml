abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes methods for DNS resolvers to self-publish information
    about themselves, such as whether they perform DNSSEC validation or are available
    over transports other than what is defined in RFC 1035. The information is returned
    as a JSON object. The names in this object are defined in an IANA registry that
    allows for light-weight registration. Applications and operating systems can use
    the methods defined here to get the information from resolvers in order to make
    choices about how to send future queries to those resolvers. There is a GitHub
    repo for this draft where pull requests can be issued: https://github.com/DNSOP/draft-ietf-dnsop-resolver-
    information However, starting issues on the WG mailing list is preferred.</p>"
