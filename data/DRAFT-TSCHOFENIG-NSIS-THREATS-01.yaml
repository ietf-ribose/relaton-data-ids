abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As the work in the NSIS working has begun to describe requirements
    \nand the framework people started thinking about possible security \nimplication.
    This document should provide a starting point for the \ndiscussion at the NSIS
    working group mailing list regarding the \nsecurity issues that have to be addressed
    by a protocol or within \nthe framework. This document does not describe vulnerabilities
    of a \nparticular protocol or threats of published NSIS framework \nproposals.
    This memo is furthermore meant to create awareness for \nsecurity issues within
    the NSIS group. Security requirements related \nto the threat scenarios are described
    in [1].  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
