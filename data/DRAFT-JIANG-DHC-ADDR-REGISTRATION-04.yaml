abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, host self-generated\n
    \  addresses are notionally conflicted with the network managed address\n   architecture.
    These addresses need to be registered in the networking\n   management plate for
    the purposes of central address administration.\n   This document introduces a
    generic address registration solution\n   using DHCPv6, and defines one new ND
    option and one new DHCPv6 option\n   in order to propagate the solicitations of
    registering self-generated\n   addresses. The registration procedure reuses the
    existing IA_NA in\n   the DHCPv6 protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
