abstract:
  content: "<p>This paper was necessitated by an overwhelming desire. An attempt toend
    the disparity in the dissemination of information which is absentof the logical
    and thoroughness in rendering an explanation of the IPAddressing Scheme. To render
    a more pointed fact, I needed to pass aCISCO Certification Examination. However,
    this can never beaccomplished, if the information that is needed and used in thepreparation
    thereof, lacks continuity and propagates errors pertainingto foundational information.
    That is,as a direct result of thisundertaking, I corrected the underlining errors,
    derived a possiblealternative approach to the IPv4 Addressing Scheme, and expanded
    itsClass system ( that is no longer in use ). In other words, I wasindeed successful
    in the elimination of the problems associated withIP Address Flooding inherent
    in IPv4 and the complexities of IPv6.In short, small business and single family
    dwellings can now have theoption of having their own private IP Addressing Scheme,
    without thedisparity resulting from the steep learning curve presented in IPv6.While
    the Internet Community at large, will not suffer a shortage ofthe availability
    IP Addresses for assigned distribution. Especiallysince, while the number available
    IP Addresses do not exceed theamount reported to be provided, if IPv6 is implemented.
    It doesindeed, provide enough IP Addresses to cover their continued issuancefor
    at least another 100 years or so. Which is dependent upon theadoption of an adequate
    scheme for its allocation and distribution.</p>"
