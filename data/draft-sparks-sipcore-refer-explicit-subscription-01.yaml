abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP REFER request, as defined by RFC3515, triggers an implicit
    SIP-Specific Event Notification framework subscription. Conflating the start of
    the subscription with handling the REFER request makes negotiating SUBSCRIBE extensions
    impossible, and complicates avoiding SIP dialog sharing. This document defines
    an extension to REFER to remove the implicit subscription and replace it with
    an explicit one.</p>"
