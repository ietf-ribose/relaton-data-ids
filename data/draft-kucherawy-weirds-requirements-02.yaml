abstract:
- content: "<p>This document enumerates a base set of requirements that should be
    included in any system that provides registration information for Internet network
    entities, i.e., network assignments. Some of these, in turn, will define requirements
    for registrars; this, however, is an issue outside of the scope of this document.
    It is hoped that this work will influnce the development of requirements and specifications
    for domain name registries at some point in the future.</p>"
