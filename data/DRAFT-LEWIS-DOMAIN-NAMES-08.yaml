abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document researches the origin of the term Domain Name
    in the\n   Request for Comments document series, documenting that the term did\n
    \  not originate in the documents defining the Domain Name System.  The\n   document
    describes how the term came to be used, how the DNS\n   followed, and surveys
    the diverse ways Domain Names have been\n   interpreted within various protocols
    over time.  The purpose of this\n   is to give a solid foundation for work on
    Domain Names across all\n   protocols making use of Domain Names.\n\n\t </p>\n
