abstract:
  content: "<p>A method is described by which a Device is able to provide location-related
    measurement data to a LIS within a request for locationinformation. Location-related
    measurement information areobservations concerning properties related to the position
    of aDevice, which could be data about network attachment or about thephysical
    environment. When a LIS generates location information fora Device, information
    from the Device can improve the accuracy of thelocation estimate. A basic set
    of location-related measurements aredefined, including common modes of network
    attachment as well asassisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.</p>"
