abstract:
- content: "<p>A method is described by which a Device is able to provide location-
    related measurement data to a LIS within a request for location information. Location-related
    measurement information are observations concerning properties related to the
    position of a Device, which could be data about network attachment or about the
    physical environment. When a LIS generates location information for a Device,
    information from the Device can improve the accuracy of the location estimate.
    A basic set of location-related measurements are defined, including common modes
    of network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
    parameters.</p>"
