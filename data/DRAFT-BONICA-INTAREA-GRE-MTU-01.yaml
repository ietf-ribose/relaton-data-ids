abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo documents a GRE fragmentation strategy that has been\n
    \  implemented by many vendors and deployed in many networks.  It was\n   written
    so that a) implementors will be aware of best common practice\n   and b) those
    who rely on GRE will understand how implementations\n   work.  The scope of this
    memo is limited to point-to-point GRE\n   tunnels.  All other tunnel types are
    beyond the scope of this memo.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
