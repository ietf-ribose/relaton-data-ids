abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to join a multicast group where communications
    are based on CoAP and secured with Object Security of CoAP (OSCOAP). The proposed
    method delegates the authentication and authorization of client nodes that join
    a multicast group through a Group Manager server. This approach builds on the
    ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization, and leverages protocol-specific
    profiles of ACE to achieve communication security, proof-of- possession and server
    authentication.</p>"
