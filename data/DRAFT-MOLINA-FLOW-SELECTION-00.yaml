abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Flow selection is the process of selecting only a limited number
    of \n\nflows out of all the flows observable/observed at an IPFIX device. \n\nThe
    selection can be done in the metering process, by selectively \n\naccounting only
    some of the incoming packets, in the flow recording \n\nprocess, by keeping only
    some of the created flow records, or in the \n\nexporting process, by exporting
    only some of the flow records of the \n\nflow recording process. This document
    describes the scenarios where \n\nflow selection can be applied, discusses what
    information about the \n\nflow selection process is beneficial to export and provides
    an \n\ninformation model for it. \n\t </p>\n      "
