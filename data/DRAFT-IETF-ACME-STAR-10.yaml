abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Public-key certificates need to be revoked when they are compromised,\n
    \  that is, when the associated private key is exposed to an\n   unauthorized
    entity.  However the revocation process is often\n   unreliable.  An alternative
    to revocation is issuing a sequence of\n   certificates, each with a short validity
    period, and terminating this\n   sequence upon compromise.  This memo proposes
    an ACME extension to\n   enable the issuance of short-term and automatically renewed
    (STAR)\n   X.509 certificates.\n\n   [RFC Editor: please remove before publication]\n\n
    \  While the draft is being developed, the editor's version can be found\n   at
    https://github.com/yaronf/I-D/tree/master/STAR.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
