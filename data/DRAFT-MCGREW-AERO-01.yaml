abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes Authenticated Encryption with Replay\n
    \  prOtection (AERO), a cryptographic technique that provides all of the\n   essential
    security services needed for communication security.  AERO\n   offers several
    advantages over other methods: it has more compact\n   messages, provides stronger
    misuse resistance, avoids the need to\n   manage implicit state, and is simpler
    to use.  This document defines\n   a particular AERO algorithm as well as a registry
    for such\n   algorithms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
