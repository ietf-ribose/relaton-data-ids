abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memorandum describes how RTP carrying MPEG-4 payloads interactswith
    the MPEG-4 Access Unit layer through the MPEG (DeliveryMultimedia Integration
    Framework) DMIF. DMIF is used to passinformation essential for the packing and
    unpacking of MPEG-4 streamsinto RTP as well as for adjusting the MPEG-4 AL-PDU
    lengths to bewithin the path MTU. DMIF interprets the RTCP reports by comparing
    its statistics to therequested MPEG-4 media based QoS. If the statistics fail
    to meet therequested QoS then action is taken to either continue with the impairedperforamce,
    upgrade the network service class, scale down the stream ordelete the stream.
    This specification is a product of the Audio/Video Transport workinggroup within
    the Internet Engineering Task Force. Comments aresolicited and should be addressed
    to the working group's mailing listat rem-conf@es.net and/or the authors.</p>"
