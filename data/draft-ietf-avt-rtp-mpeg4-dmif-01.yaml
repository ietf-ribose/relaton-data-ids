abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum describes how RTP carrying MPEG-4 payloads interacts
    with the MPEG-4 Access Unit layer through the MPEG (Delivery Multimedia Integration
    Framework) DMIF. DMIF is used to pass information essential for the packing and
    unpacking of MPEG-4 streams into RTP as well as for adjusting the MPEG-4 AL-PDU
    lengths to be within the path MTU. DMIF interprets the RTCP reports by comparing
    its statistics to the requested MPEG-4 media based QoS. If the statistics fail
    to meet the requested QoS then action is taken to either continue with the impaired
    perforamce, upgrade the network service class, scale down the stream or delete
    the stream. This specification is a product of the Audio/Video Transport working
    group within the Internet Engineering Task Force. Comments are solicited and should
    be addressed to the working group's mailing list at rem-conf@es.net and/or the
    authors.</p>"
