abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, there is an ongoing activity in the IETF to define a standard,
    XML-based protocol to manage the configuration of networks and networking equipments.
    Defining initial requirements are underway and one important requirement among
    them is co-existence with the CLI. This document suggests a possible mechanism
    for this requirement. It identifies some characteristics of CLI commands, and
    provides the syntax of XML template which models such characteristics of CLI commands.
    X-CLI is an API to manipulate XML templates in an easy and robust way.</p>"
