abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Currently, there is an ongoing activity in the IETF to define astandard,
    XML-based protocol to manage the configuration of networksand networking equipments.
    Defining initial requirements are underwayand one important requirement among
    them is co-existence with theCLI. This document suggests a possible mechanism
    for thisrequirement. It identifies some characteristics of CLI commands, andprovides
    the syntax of XML template which models such characteristicsof CLI commands. X-CLI
    is an API to manipulate XML templates in aneasy and robust way.</p>"
