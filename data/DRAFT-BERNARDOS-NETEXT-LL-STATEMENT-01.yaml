abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) as [RFC5213].\nPMIPv6
    enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam\nacross gateways
    without changing the IP address.  PMIPv6 also\nprovides limited multi-homing support
    to multi-mode mobile devices.\n\nProxy mobility is based on the assumption that
    changes in host IP\nstacks are undesirable.  Link layer implementations can hide
    the\nactually used physical interfaces from the IP stack.  These\ntechniques can
    be used to achieve inter-access technology handovers\nor flow mobility, i.e.,
    the movement of selected flows from one\naccess technology to another.  It is
    assumed that an IP layer\ninterface can simultaneously and/or sequentially attach
    to multiple\nMAGs (possibly over multiple media).  This document provides an\ninformational
    applicability statement that analyzes the issues\ninvolved with this approach
    (i.e. hiding access technology changes\nfrom host IP layer) and characterizes
    the contexts in which such use\nis or is not appropriate to achieve inter-access
    handovers or flow\nmobility.\n\t </p>\n      "
