abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a 6top Scheduling Function called \"Scheduling\n
    \  Function One\" (SF1) to reserve, label and schedule the end-to-end\n   resources
    hop-by-hop through the Resource ReserVation Protocol -\n   Traffic Engineering
    (RSVP-TE).  SF1 uses the 6P signaling messages\n   with a global TrackID to add
    or delete the cells in L2-bundles of\n   isolated traffic flows.\n\n\t </p>\n
