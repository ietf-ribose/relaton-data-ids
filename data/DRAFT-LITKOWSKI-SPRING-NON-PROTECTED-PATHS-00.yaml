abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.
    \ A node\n   can steer a packet on a specific path by prepending the packet with\n
    \  an SR header.  In the framework of traffic-engineering use cases, a\n   customer
    may request its service provider to implement some non\n   protected paths.  This
    means that in case of a failure within the\n   network, fast-reroute (or similar)
    techniques should not be activated\n   for those paths.  This document analyzes
    the different options to\n   implement a non protected path with Segment Routing
    and in a future\n   release will provide a recommandation on the best option.\n\n\n\t
