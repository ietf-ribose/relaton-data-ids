abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the issues and gives examples of typical proxy
    systems in AAA applications. The purpose of this effort is to set the reference
    space evaluating and improving AAA protocols, such as the Diameter protocol, currently
    being reviewed in this WG. This interim version begins to address solutions to
    some of the issues raised earlier. This document will evolve into an explanation
    of the issues we are concerned with and the recommended solutions.</p>"
