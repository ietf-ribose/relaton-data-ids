abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the application of security staining
    on an\n   IPv6 datagrams and the minimum requirements for IPv6 nodes staining\n
    \  flows, IPv6 nodes forwarding stained packets and interpreting stains\n   on
    flows.\n\n   The usage of the packet staining destination option enables proactive\n
    \  delivery of security intelligence to IPv6 nodes such as firewalls and\n   intrusion
    prevention systems, and end-points such servers,\n   workstations, mobile and
    smart devices and an infinite array of as-\n   yet-to-be-invented sensors and
    controllers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
