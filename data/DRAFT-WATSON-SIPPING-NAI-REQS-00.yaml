abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There is no requirement for identities identities asserted by
    a UA in \na SIP message to be anything other than the userâ€™s desired alias. An
    \nauthenticated identity of a user can be obtained using SIP \nauthentication,
    however it is unlikely that the necessary Public Key \nInfrastructure to facilitate
    this for UAs will be available soon. \nA Network Asserted Identity is an identity
    obtained by a SIP network \nintermediary as a result of an authentication process.
    This draft \ndescribes short term requirements for the exchange of Network \nAsserted
    Identities within networks of securely interconnected \ntrusted nodes and to User
    Agents securely connected to such networks. \nGeneral requirements for transport
    of Network Asserted Identities on \nthe Internet are out of scope of this draft.\n\t
