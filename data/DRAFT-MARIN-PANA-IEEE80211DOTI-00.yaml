abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)
    is a\nlink-layer agnostic transport for Extensible Authentication Protocol\n(EAP)
    to enable network access authentication between clients and\naccess networks.\n\nPANA
    framework defines two types of security associations which can\nbe bootstrapped
    as a consequence of PANA execution: IP layer security\nis established with IPsec
    by using IKE and link-layer security with\nWPA/IEEE 802.11i in PSK mode.\n\nThis
    document is focused on how PANA can bootstrap link layer\nsecurity through IEEE
    802.11i and exposes issues which can be raised\nas a consequence of this interaction.\n\n\n\t
