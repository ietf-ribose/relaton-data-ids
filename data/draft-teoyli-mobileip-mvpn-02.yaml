abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies enhancements to Mobile IP that allow IP mobility
    support across routing realms. The protocol allows a mobile node to have the same
    home network connectivity, regardless of its current routing realm network point
    of attachment. It is designed to work in the presence of address collisions and
    network address translations. Private networks connected to the public Internet
    can extend IP mobility support to cover the public Internet and other private
    networks. Movement from a private home network to the public foreign network,
    from a private home network to another private foreign network or from the public
    home network to a private foreign network are possible under the MPN framework.</p>"
