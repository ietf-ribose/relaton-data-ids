abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document, part of the Lemonade Working Group, describes the
    Best\nCurrent Practice for streaming multimedia attachments received by a\nresource
    constrained and/or mobile device from a IMAP server.  It\nallows such clients,
    which are limited in storage space and\nbandwidth, to play video and audio content
    which is attached to email\nmessages.  The document describes a profile for making
    use of the\nexisting IMAP URLAUTH extension [2] and the \"Netann\" SIP Media\nService
    as described in RFC 4240 [1].\n\t </p>\n      "
