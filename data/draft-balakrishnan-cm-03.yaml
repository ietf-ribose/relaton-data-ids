abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the Congestion Manager (CM), an end-systemmodule
    that (i) enables an ensemble of multiple concurrent flowsfrom a sender destined
    to the same receiver and sharing the samecongestion properties to perform proper
    congestion avoidance andcontrol, and (ii) allows applications to easily adapt
    to networkcongestion. This CM framework integrates congestion managementacross
    all applications and transport protocols. The CM maintainscongestion parameters
    (available aggregate and per-flow bandwidth,per-receiver round-trip times, etc.)
    and exports an API thatenables applications to learn about network characteristics,
    passinformation to the CM, share congestion information with eachother, and schedule
    data transmissions. This document focuses onapplications and transport protocols
    with their own independentper-byte or per-packet sequence number information,
    and does notrequire modifications to the receiver protocol stack. Thereceiving
    application must provide feedback to the sendingapplication about received packets
    and losses, and the latter usesthe CM API to update CM state. This document does
    not addressnetworks with reservations or service discrimination.</p>"
