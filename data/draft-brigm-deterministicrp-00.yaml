abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies the Deterministic Rendezvous Point (D-RP)mechanism
    for Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Sparse Mode (SM)networks. It intends
    to provide a simple and robust RP service.The mechanism is deterministic since
    it elects the highest prioritycandidate to be the D-RP from those available for
    each IP address family.If a D-RP fails, the election process begins again using
    the remaining C-RPsfor the IP address family. If no candidates are availabe, the
    network willtransition to PIM Dense Mode (DM) routing for that IP address family.
    In the future if C-RPs emerge for the address family, the network willelect a
    new D-RP and return to operations with PIM SM routing.</p>"
