abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the requirements and implementation
    of a\n   group telephony feature commonly known as Bridged Line Appearance\n   (BLA)
    or Multiple Line Appearance (MLA), or Shared Call/Line\n   Appearance (SCA).  When
    implemented using the Session Initiation\n   Protocol (SIP), it is referred to
    as shared appearances of an Address\n   of Record (AOR) since SIP does not have
    the concept of lines.  This\n   feature is commonly offered in IP Centrex services
    and IP-PBX\n   offerings and is likely to be implemented on SIP IP telephones
    and\n   SIP feature servers used in a business environment.  This feature\n   allows
    several user agents (UAs) to share a common AOR, learn about\n   calls placed
    and received by other UAs in the group, and pick up or\n   join calls within the
    group.  This document discusses use cases,\n   lists requirements and defines
    extensions to implement this feature.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
