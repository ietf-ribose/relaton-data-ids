abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP is being standardised as an application level REST-based protocol.
    A single CoAP message is typically encapsulated and transmitted using UDP. This
    draft examines the requirements and possible solutions for conveying CoAP packets
    to end points over alternative transports to UDP. UDP remains the optimal solution
    for CoAP use in IP-based constrained environments and nodes. However the need
    for M2M communication using non-IP networks, improved transport level end-to-end
    reliability and security, NAT and firewall traversal issues, and mechanisms possibly
    incurring a lower overhead to CoAP/ HTTP translation gateways provide compelling
    motivation for understanding how CoAP can operate in various other environments.</p>"
