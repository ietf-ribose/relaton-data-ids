abstract:
- content: "<p>Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) permits Domain Owners
    to coordinate with Mail User Agents (MUAs) to display brand- specific Indicators
    next to properly authenticated messages. There are two aspects of BIMI coordination:
    a scalable mechanism for Domain Owners to publish their desired indicators, and
    a mechanism for Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) to verify the authenticity of the
    indicator. This document specifies how Domain Owners communicate their desired
    indicators through the BIMI assertion record in DNS and how that record is to
    be handled by MTAs and MUAs. The domain verification mechanism and extensions
    for other mail protocols (IMAP, etc.) are specified in separate documents. MUAs
    and mail-receiving organizations are free to define their own policies for indicator
    display that makes use or not of BIMI data as they see fit.</p>"
