abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an improved HTTP caching method which
    can be\n   applied in addition to the standard caching behavior described in\n
    \  [Part6].  It defines the associated header field that controls this\n   improved
    caching mechanism and a modified caching operation which is\n   slightly different
    to one in [Part6].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
