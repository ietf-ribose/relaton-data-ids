abstract:
- content: "<p>It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to be
    able to associate tags with prefixes and links. Previously, OSPFv2 and OSPFv3
    were relegated to a single tag for AS External and Not-So- Stubby-Area (NSSA)
    prefixes. With the flexible encodings provided by OSPFv2 Prefix/Link Attribute
    Advertisement and OSPFv3 Extended LSAs, multiple administrative tags may advertised
    for all types of prefixes and links. These administrative tags can be used for
    many applications including route redistribution policy, selective prefix prioritization,
    selective IP Fast-ReRoute (IPFRR) prefix protection, and many others. The ISIS
    protocol supports a similar mechanism that is described in RFC 5130.</p>"
