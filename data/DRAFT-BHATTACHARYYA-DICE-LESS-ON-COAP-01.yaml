abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Secure yet lightweight protocol for communication over the
    Internet\n   for constrained node networks (CNN) is a pertinent problem.\n   Constrained
    Application Layer Protocol (CoAP) mandates the use of\n   Datagram Transport Layer
    Security (DTLS) for a secure transaction\n   over CoAP. But DTLS is not a candidate
    technology for CNNs by\n   design. The DTLS handshake overhead to establish the
    credentials for\n   a session between two end-points in a CNN may not be resource\n
    \  efficient. There are ongoing efforts to secure one-time exchanges by\n   ensuring
    object security at the application layer. But a composite\n   standardized mechanism
    for resource-efficient end-to-end security\n   credential establishment is much
    needed to cater both one-time\n   exchanges as well as exchanges over a session.
    DTLS is essentially a\n   combination of two operations: (1) the session protocol
    to establish\n   the credentials (and this is the resource heavy part), (2) the\n
    \  record protocol to protect the information (this is the\n   cryptographic part).
    This draft proposes to distribute the security\n   responsibilities such that
    the session establishment happens in the\n   application layer, leveraging the
    lightweight semantics of CoAP, and\n   the record layer encryption happens by
    reusing the existing DTLS\n   record-layer protocol. This way the proposed mechanism
    enables a\n   resource-efficient session establishment mechanism besides reusing\n
    \  the existing DTLS encryption. Assuming a Pre-Shared Key (PSK)\n   environment,
    this draft proposes an embedding of handshake for\n   resource efficient end-to-end
    session establishment into CoAP. The\n   session establishment procedure produces
    the necessary and\n   sufficient inputs for seamless operation of the DTLS record-layer
    to\n   secure the channel. Also, this mechanism ensures a direct security\n   association
    between the end-applications for systems using\n   middleboxes like proxies and/or
    gateways which may not be always\n   trusted. The proposed approach provides a
    mechanism to securely\n   traverse through such middleboxes through an end-to-end
    trusted\n   channel.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
