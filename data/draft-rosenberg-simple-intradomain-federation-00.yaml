abstract:
- content: "<p>Presence federation involves the sharing of presence information across
    multiple presence systems. Most often, presence federation is assumed to be between
    different organizations, such as between two enterprises or between and enterprise
    and a service provider. However, federation can occur within a single organization
    or domain. This can be the result of a multi-vendor network, or a consequence
    of a large organization that requires partitioning. This document examines different
    use cases and models for intra-domain federation.</p>"
