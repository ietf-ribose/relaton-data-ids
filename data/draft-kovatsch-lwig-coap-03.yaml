abstract:
  content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is designed for resource-
    constrained nodes and networks, e.g., sensor nodes in a low-power lossy network
    (LLN). Yet to implement this Internet protocol on Class 1 devices (i.e., ~ 10
    KiB of RAM and ~ 100 KiB of ROM) also lightweight implementation techniques are
    necessary. This document provides lessons learned from implementing CoAP for tiny,
    battery- operated networked embedded systems. In particular, it provides guidance
    on correct implementation of the CoAP specification [I-D.ietf-core-coap], memory
    optimizations, and customized protocol parameters.</p>"
