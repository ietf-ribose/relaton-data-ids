abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MPLS is being deployed deeper into operator networks, often
    to or\n   past the access network node. Separately network access nodes such as\n
    \  PON OLTs have evolved to support first-mile access protection, where\n   one
    or more physical OLTs provide first-mile diversity to the\n   customer edge. Multi-homing
    support is needed on the MPLS-enabled PON\n   OLT to provide resiliency for provided
    services.  This document\n   describes the multi-chassis PON protection architecture
    in MPLS and\n   also proposes the ICCP extension to support it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
