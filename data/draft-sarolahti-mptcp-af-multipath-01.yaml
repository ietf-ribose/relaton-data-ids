abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies a new address family to be used for socketsthat
    are bound to more than one IP address, as motivated by theMultipath TCP work in
    the IETF. The goal is to use the same set offunction calls as traditionally, but
    by new address family make itpossible for them to express multiple addresses to
    connect or bindto. The document gives a high-level definition of the behavior
    ofthe traditional function calls, but a detailed specification of theAPI syntax
    is not in the scope of this document.</p>"
