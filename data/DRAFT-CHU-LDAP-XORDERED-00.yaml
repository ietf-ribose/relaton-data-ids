abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As LDAP is used more extensively for managing various kinds
    of data,\n   one often encounters a need to preserve both the ordering and the\n
    \  content of data, despite the inherently unordered structure of\n   entries
    and attribute values in the directory.  This document\n   describes a scheme to
    attach ordering information to attributes in a\n   directory so that the ordering
    may be preserved and propagated to\n   other LDAP applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
