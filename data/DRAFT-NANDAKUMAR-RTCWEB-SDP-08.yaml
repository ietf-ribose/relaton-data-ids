abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Web Real-Time Communication [WebRTC] working group is charged
    to\n   provide protocol support for direct interactive rich communication\n   using
    audio, video and data between two peers' web browsers.  With in\n   the WebRTC
    framework, Session Description protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] is\n   used for negotiating
    session capabilities between the peers.  Such a\n   negotiation happens based
    on the SDP Offer/Answer exchange mechanism\n   described in [RFC3264].\n\n   This
    document provides an informational reference in describing the\n   role of SDP
    and the Offer/Answer exchange mechanism for the most\n   common WebRTC use-cases.\n\n
    \  This SDP examples provided in this document is still a work in\n   progress,
    but it aims to align closest to the evolving standards\n   work.\n\n\t </p>\n
