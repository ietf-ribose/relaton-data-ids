abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is regarded as a popular\n
    \  encapsulation tunnel technology because of simpleness and easy\n   implementation.
    \ When a node tries to encapsulate the user traffic in\n   a GRE tunnel, it needs
    to first obtain the IP address of some\n   destination node to decapsulate the
    GRE packets.  According to the\n   information of destination node, a node can
    setup the GRE tunnel\n   connection.  In practice, the IP address of decapsulation
    node of GRE\n   tunnel may be manually configured on the GRE encapsulation side.\n
    \  This configuration introduces efficiency issues for operators,\n   especially,
    in the scenarios where there are large amount of GRE\n   tunnels needed.  This
    work proposes an approach to configure the GRE\n   tunnel dynamically.\n\n\n\t
