abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes a PIM routing problem owing to the reverse
    path\nforwarding (RPF) failure on routers having multiple addresses on a\nlink.
    \ This memo also considers possible solutions with their pros\nand cons.  The
    solutions include operational one which does not\nrequire any protocol change,
    and one which uses a new PIM Hello\noption.  However, it is beyond the scope of
    this memo to discuss what\nis the most appropriate solution for this problem.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
