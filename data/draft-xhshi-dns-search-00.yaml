abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document presents a user perspective to the notion of DNS searchlayers
    as defined by John Klensin's DNS search model [DNS_SEARCH]. Inparticular, the
    authors look at the integration of name lookupresults from layer 2, 3 and 4 services
    to discuss the presentation ofthese results across popular desktop applications
    such as Webbrowsing and email clients. The goal of this document is not topropose
    a standard UI to the DNS search problem (clearly somethingout of the scope of
    any IETF work). Instead, the document seeks todemonstrate that layered search
    services can be easily integratedwithin traditional desktop applications; hence
    that deployment of DNSsearch services is realistic and could rapidly be achieved.
    It isimportant to understand that the proposed form of integration andchoice of
    user interfaces are not fundamental. In fact, the authorsexpect many competing
    systems to pursue different alternativesolutions. However, in order to achieve
    critical deployment mass, itis crucial to demonstrate that the architectural model
    proposed byDNS search lends itself to simple user interfaces where different andpossibly
    competing services can complete each other to provide a moreprecise and complete
    navigation experience for the end-user. Thisdraft attempts to fulfill that goal
    by looking at possible solutionsfor popular navigation use cases.</p>"
