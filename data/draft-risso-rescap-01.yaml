    protocol defines a control connection, which is used to controlthe remote device,
    and a data connection, which is used to transportback the sampled data. This protocol
    includes has a set of optionalparameters that allows customizing the behavior
    of the samplingprocess. This protocol can be used also for packet capture and
    itshould be possible to implement it on both network devices (routerand switches)
