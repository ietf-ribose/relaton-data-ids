abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides a\n   mechanisms for the Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform
    path\n   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n
    \  The Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol\n   Label
    Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs) using
    PCEP.  Furthermore, PCE can be used for computing paths\n   in the SR networks.\n\n
    \  Stateful PCE provide active control of MPLS-TE LSPs via PCEP, for a\n   model
    where the PCC delegates control over one or more locally\n   configured LSPs to
    the PCE.  Further, stateful PCE could also create\n   and remove PCE-initiated
    LSPs by itself.  A PCE-based Central\n   Controller (PCECC) simplify the processing
    of a distributed control\n   plane by integrating with elements of Software-Defined
    Networking\n   (SDN).\n\n   In some use cases, such as PCECC or Binding Segment
    Identifier (SID)\n   for Segment Routing (SR), there are requirements for a stateful
    PCE\n   to make allocation of labels, SIDs, etc.  These use cases require PCE\n
    \  aware of various identifier spaces from where to make allocations on\n   behalf
    of a PCC.  This document describes a mechanism for a PCC to\n   inform the PCE
    of the identifier space set aside for the PCE control\n   via PCEP.  The identifier
    could be an MPLS label, a SID or any other\n   to-be-defined identifier that can
    be allocated by a PCE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
