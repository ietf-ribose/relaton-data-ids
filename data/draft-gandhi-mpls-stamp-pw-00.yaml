abstract:
- content: "<p>Pseudowires (PWs) are used in MPLS networks for various services including
    carrying layer 2 and layer 3 data packets. This document describes the procedure
    for encapsulation of the Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) defined
    in RFC 8762 and its optional extensions defined in RFC 8972 for PWs in MPLS networks.
    The procedure uses PW Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) to encapsulate the STAMP
    test packets with or without an IP/UDP header.</p>"
