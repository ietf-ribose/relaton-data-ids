abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the problems that enterprises face today when
    interconnecting their branch offices with dynamic workloads in third party data
    centers (a.k.a. Cloud DCs). It examines some of the approaches interconnecting
    cloud DCs with enterprises' on-premises DCs &amp; branch offices. This document
    also describes some of the network problems that many enterprises face when they
    have workloads &amp; applications &amp; data split among different data centers,
    especially for those enterprises with multiple sites that are already interconnected
    by VPNs (e.g., MPLS L2VPN/L3VPN). Current operational problems are examined to
    determine whether there is a need to improve existing protocols or whether a new
    protocol is necessary to solve them.</p>"
