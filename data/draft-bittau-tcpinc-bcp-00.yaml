abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP-ENO negotiates encryption of TCP connections, protecting legacy
    applications and protocols from passive eavesdropping. TCP-ENO generally falls
    back to unencrypted TCP when not supported by both endpoints or the network. Nonetheless,
    certain middlebox behavior could cause TCP connections to fail entirely in conjunction
    with TCP- ENO. This document specifies conventions for servers against which TCP-ENO
    machines can test network paths for TCP-ENO compatibility, and describes the best
    current practice for enabling TCP-ENO only when it is unlikely to cause connection
    failure.</p>"
