abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo presents the different security threats related to\nSPEERMINT
    classifying them into threats to the Location Function, to\nthe Signaling Function
    and to the Media Function.  The different\ninstances of the threats are briefly
    introduced inside the\nclassification.  Finally the existing security solutions
    in SIP and\nRTP/RTCP are presented to describe the countermeasures currently\navailable
    for such threats.  The objective of this document is to\nidentify and enumerate
    the SPEERMINT-specific threat vectors in order\nto specify security-related requirements.
    \ Once the requirements are\nidentified, methods and solutions how to achieve
    such requirements\ncan be selected.\n\t </p>\n      "
