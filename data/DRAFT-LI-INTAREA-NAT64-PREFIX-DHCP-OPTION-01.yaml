abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Several IPv6 transition mechanisms require the usage of stateless
    or\n   stateful translators (commonly named as NAT64) able to allow IP/ICMP\n
    \  communication between IPv4 and IPv6 networks.\n\n   Those translators are using
    either a default Well-Known Prefix (WKP),\n   and/or one or several additional
    Network Specific Prefix (NSP), which\n   need to be configured into the nodes
    willing to use the translator.\n   Different translators will likely have different
    IPv6 prefixes, to\n   attract traffic to the correct translator.  Thus, an automatic\n
    \  translator prefix discovery method is necessary.\n\n   This document defines
    a DHCPv6-based method to inform DHCPv6 clients\n   the set of IPv6 and IPv4 prefixes
    it serves.  This DHCPv6 option can\n   be used by several transition mechanisms
    such as SIIT, 464XLAT, EAM.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
