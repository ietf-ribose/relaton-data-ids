abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Today's mobility management schemes make use of a hierarchy
    of\n   tunnels from a relatively fixed anchor point, through one or more\n   intermediate
    nodes, to reach the MN's current point of attachment.\n   These schemes suffer
    from poor performance, scalability, and failure\n   modes due to the centralization
    and statefulness of the anchor\n   point(s).  The dmm (Distributed Mobility Management)
    working group is\n   currently chartered to investigate alternative solutions
    that will\n   provide greater performance, scalability, and robustness through
    the\n   distribution of mobility anchors.  This document is an input to the\n
    \  dmm discussion.  It outlines a problem statement for the existing\n   mobility
    management techniques and goes on to propose (high-level)\n   solutions to two
    of the most vexing problems: MN authentication and\n   mobility management in
    a fully distributed, flat (non-hierarchical)\n   access network.  These two aspects
    are often treated separately in a\n   layered architecture, but we argue there
    are important advantages to\n   considering how these two functions can work in
    tandem to provide a\n   simple and robust framework for the design of a wireless
    Internet\n   Service Provider network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
