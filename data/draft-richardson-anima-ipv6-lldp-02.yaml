abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to encapsulate IPv6 packets over
    the Link-Local Discovery Protocol (LLDP). The LLDP is a single layer-two protocol
    and is never forwarded, which is a desireable property when building the IPv6-over-IPsec-over-IPv6-Link-Local
    tunnels that make up the ANIMA Autonomic Control Plane (ACP). This unorthodox
    encapsulation avoids unwanted interactions between the ACP packets and native
    packet forwarding engines, as well as being safe for layer-2 switches which might
    otherwise have no IPv6 capabilities.</p>"
