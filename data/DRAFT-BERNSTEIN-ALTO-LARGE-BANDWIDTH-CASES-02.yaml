abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes two generic use-cases that illustrate\n
    \  application layer traffic optimization applied to high bandwidth\n   core networks.
    \ The type of information and interactions needed to\n   perform various optimizations
    is described. In addition extensions\n   to the existing ALTO protocol widely
    applicable to any high\n   bandwidth applications are suggested.  These include
    bandwidth\n   constraint representations for a diverse range of control and data\n
    \  plane technologies as well as advanced filtering based on\n   constraints.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
