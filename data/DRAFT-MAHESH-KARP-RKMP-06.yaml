abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism to secure the routing protocols\n
    \  which use unicast to transport their signaling messages.  Most of\n   such
    routing protocols are TCP-based (e.g., BGP and LDP), and the TCP\n   Authentication
    Option (TCP-AO) is primarily employed for securing the\n   signaling messages
    of these routing protocols.  There are also two\n   exceptions: BFD which is over
    UDP or MPLS, and RSVP-TE which is over\n   IP (but employs an integrated approach
    to protecting the signaling\n   messages instead of using IPsec).  The proposed
    mechanism secures\n   pairwise TCP-based Routing Protocol (RP) associations, BFD\n
    \  associations and RSVP-TE associations using the IKEv2 Key Management\n   Protocol
    (KMP) integrated with TCP-AO, BFD, and RSVP-TE respectively.\n   Included are
    extensions to IKEv2 and its Security Associations to\n   enable its key negotiation
    to support TCP-AO, BFD, and RSVP-TE.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
