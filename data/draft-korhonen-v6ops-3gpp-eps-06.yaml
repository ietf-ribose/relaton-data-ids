abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Internet connectivity and use of data services in 3GPP based mobilenetworks
    has increased rapidly as a result of smart phones, broadbandservice via HSPA and
    HSPA+ networks, competitive service offerings byoperators and a large number of
    applications. Operators who havedeployed networks based on 3GPP architectures
    are facing IPv4 addressshortages. With the impending exhaustion of available IPv4
    addressesfrom the registries there is an increased emphasis for operators tomigrate
    to IPv6. This document describes the support for IPv6 in3GPP network architectures.</p>"
