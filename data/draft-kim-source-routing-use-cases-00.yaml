abstract:
  content: "<p>In the SDN (Software-Defined Networking) architecture, an SDN controller
    decides and establishes flow paths. As an SDN controller provides control plane
    functions by communicating with switches, the latency of control functions is
    an important issue. Source routing is applicable to improve the performance of
    SDN. In this document, we illustrate SDN source routing use cases of flow setup
    and failure recovery.</p>"
