abstract:
- content: "<p>Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round trip times
    to the closest DNS root server. Such resolvers can greatly decrease the rount
    trip time by running a copy of the full root zone on a loopback address (such
    as 127.0.0.1). This document shows how to start and maintain such a copy of the
    root zone in a manner that is secure for the operator of the recursive resolver
    and does not pose a threat to other users of the DNS.</p>"
