abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol
    Label\n   Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  Extended from MPLS\n   technologies,
    MPLS-TP introduces new OAM capabilities, transport\n   oriented path protection
    mechanism, and strong emphasis on static\n   provisioning supported by network
    management systems.  This document\n   addresses the security aspects that are
    relevant in the context of\n   MPLS-TP specifically.  It describes the security
    requirements for\n   MPLS-TP; potential securities threats and migration procedures
    for\n   MPLS-TP networks and MPLS-TP inter-connection to MPLS and GMPLS\n   networks.\n\n
    \  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF)
    / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\n   Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF
    MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network.\n\n   This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed
    at achieving IETF\n   Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject
    to an IETF\n   Last Call.\n\n   [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication
    as an RFC and\n   insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the
    published\n   RFC has IETF Consensus.]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
