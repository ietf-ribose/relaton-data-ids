abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network tokens is a method for endpoints to explicitly and
    securely\n   coordinate with networks about how their traffic is treated.  They\n
    \  are inserted by endpoints in existing protocols, interpreted by\n   trusted
    networks, and may be signed or encrypted to meet security and\n   privacy requirements.
    \ Network tokens provide a means for network\n   operators to expose datapath
    services (such as a zero-rating service,\n   a user-driven QoS service, or a firewall
    whitelist), and for end\n   users and application providers to access such services.
    \ Network\n   tokens are inspired and derived by existing security tokens (like
    JWT\n   and CWT), and borrow several of their core ideas along with security\n
    \  and privacy properties.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
