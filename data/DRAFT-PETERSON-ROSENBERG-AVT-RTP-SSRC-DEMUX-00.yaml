abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a mechanism for the Real-Time Protocol (RTP)\n
    \  that allows multiple RTP sessions to be demultiplexed at a single\n   port.
    \ Accordingly, it also requests that the IANA allocate assigned\n   ports for
    the use of RTP with three applications: voice, video and\n   text.  A similar
    mechanism is proposed for the Real-Time Control\n   Protocol (RTCP).  The use
    of this mechanism is confined to a strict\n   domain of applicability.\n\t </p>\n
