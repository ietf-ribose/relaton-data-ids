abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to make DNS-SD browsing domains
    available\n   for browsing and discovery without requiring special cooperation
    from\n   the network infrastructure.  Zones made available in this way are\n   browsed
    using DNS or DNS Push.  The mechanism for advertising them is\n   Multicast DNS
    (mDNS).  This allows DNS-SD browsers to benefit from\n   the permissionless aspects
    of mDNS without relying on mDNS for all\n   queries, which improves scalability
    and reliability in applications\n   where many services may be advertised.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
