abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet-Draft proposes the \"app\" URI scheme for the
    Archive and\n   Packaging Protocol.\n\n   app URIs can be used to consume or reference
    hypermedia resources\n   bundled inside a file archive or a mobile application
    package, as\n   well as to resolve URIs for archive resources within a programmatic\n
    \  framework.\n\n   This URI scheme provides mechanisms to generate a unique base
    URI to\n   represent the root of the archive, so that relative URI references
    in\n   a bundled resource can be resolved within the archive without having\n
    \  to extract the archive content on the local file system.\n\n   An app URI can
    be used for purposes of isolation (e.g. when consuming\n   multiple archives),
    security constraints (avoiding \"climb out\" from\n   the archive), or for externally
    identiyfing sub-resources in other\n   hypermedia formats.\n\t </p>\n      "
