abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When small payloads are transmitted through a packet-switched\n
    \  network, the resulting overhead may result significant.  This is\n   stressed
    in the case of LISP, where a number of headers have to be\n   added to each packet.\n\n
    \  This document proposes to send together, into a single packet, a\n   number
    of small packets, which are in the buffer of a ITR, having the\n   same ETR as
    destination.  This way, they will share a single LISP\n   header, and therefore
    bandwidth savings can be obtained, and a\n   reduction in the overall number of
    packets sent to the network can be\n   achieved.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
