abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes functions implemented in Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) intermediaries known as Session Border Controllers (SBCs). The
    goal of this document is to describe the commonly provided functions of SBCs.
    A special focus is given to those practices that are viewed to be in conflict
    with SIP architectural principles. This document also explores the underlying
    requirements of network operators that have led to the use of these functions
    and practices in order to identify protocol requirements and determine whether
    those requirements are satisfied by existing specifications or if additional standards
    work is required. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
