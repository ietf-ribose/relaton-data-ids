abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a guide for IPv6 deployment in Internet Exchange
    Points (IXP). It includes information about the switching fabric configuration,
    the addressing plan options and general organizational tasks to be performed.
    IXP are mainly a layer 2 device (the switching fabric) and in many case the best
    recommendations state that IPv6 traffic and management should not be handled differently
    than in IPv4.</p>"
