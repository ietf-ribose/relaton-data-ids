abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Various network protocols make use of binary-encoded timestamps
    that\n   are incorporated in the protocol packet format, referred to as packet\n
    \  timestamps for short.  This document specifies guidelines for\n   defining
    packet timestamp formats in networking protocols at various\n   layers.  It also
    presents three recommended timestamp formats.  The\n   target audience of this
    document includes network protocol designers.\n   It is expected that a new network
    protocol that requires a packet\n   timestamp will, in most cases, use one of
    the recommended timestamp\n   formats.  If none of the recommended formats fits
    the protocol\n   requirements, the new protocol specification should specify the\n
    \  format of the packet timestamp according to the guidelines in this\n   document.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
