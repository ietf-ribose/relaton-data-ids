abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The possibility of Quantum Computers pose a serious challenge
    to\n   cryptography algorithms deployed widely today.  IKEv2 is one example\n
    \  of a cryptosystem that could be broken; someone storing VPN\n   communications
    today could decrypt them at a later time when a\n   Quantum Computer is available.
    \ It is anticipated that IKEv2 will be\n   extended to support quantum secure
    key exchange algorithms; however\n   that is not likely to happen in the near
    term.  To address this\n   problem before then, this document describes an extension
    of IKEv2 to\n   allow it to be resistant to a Quantum Computer, by using preshared\n
    \  keys.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
