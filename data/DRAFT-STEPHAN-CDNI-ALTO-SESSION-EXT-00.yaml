abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The selection of a downstream CDN by an upstream CDN is based
    on\n   multi-dimensional criteria such as the number of hops, the\n   performance
    of the connections between the user-agent and downstream\n   CDNs and the availability
    of downstream CDNs resources.  Various\n   protocols, such as BGP or ALTO, may
    be used by an upstream CDN to\n   collect footprints and interconnection preferences
    of downstream\n   CDNs.  This draft introduces several extensions to the ALTO
    protocol\n   for CDN interconnection.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
