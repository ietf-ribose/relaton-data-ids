abstract:
  content: "<p>Many web servers supply incorrect Content-Type header fields withtheir
    HTTP responses. In order to be compatible with these servers,user agents consider
    the content of HTTP responses as well as theContent-Type header fields when determining
    the effective media typeof the response. This document describes an algorithm
    fordetermining the effective media type of HTTP responses that balancessecurity
    and compatibility considerations.Please send feedback on this draft to apps-discuss@ietf.org.</p>"
