abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There is a need to negotiate a multitude of parameters, settings,
    \nand algorithms when setting up sessions using Session Initiated \nProtocol (SIP).
    While SIP itself provides mechanisms for \nnegotiation of these parameters on
    a per-session basis through the\nuse of the INVITE method, it does not provide
    a ready mechanism\nfor meta-session negotiation. The closest mechanism provided
    is \nthe REGISTER method, however, this method is directed towards the \nregistrar
    alone, and cannot be used to conduct negotiation of \nparameters between any two
    arbitrary SIP nodes.\n\t </p>\n      "
