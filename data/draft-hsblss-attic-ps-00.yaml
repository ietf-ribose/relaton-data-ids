- content: "<p>This document attempts to make the case for new work involving possibly
    a framework and protocols that need to be developed to be used among various virtualized
    functions and the end user which may be moving. First a set of functional requirements
    are developed and then these requirements are further elaborated in terms of potential
    engineering and design constraints. The need for the new work is described next.</p>"
