abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The objective of this proposal is to enable ID and Locator
    namespace\n   split in the CCN protocol that has several applications such as\n
    \  towards Interest routing optimization, mobility, handling\n   indirections
    in manifests, and routing scalability.  We enable this\n   through the notion
    of forwarding-label (FL) object, which is an\n   optional hop-by-hop payload in
    the Interest message with a locator\n   name which identifies a network domain,
    router, or a host.  Depending\n   on the application and trust context, an FL
    object can be subjected\n   to policy based actions by the forwarders such as
    invoking security\n   verification or enabling other service-centric actions such
    as FL\n   object replacement.  FL object can be inserted by the applications or\n
    \  by the network.  To enable dynamic name resolution FL objects can\n   also
    be modified in the network by designated points such as the edge\n   routers.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
