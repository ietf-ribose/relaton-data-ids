abstract:
- content: "<p>Edge RBridges currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses and
    their egress RBridges by observing the data packets traversed through. When ingress
    RBridge receives a data frame with its destination address (MAC&amp;VLAN) unknown,
    the data frame is flooded across the TRILL campus. When there are more than one
    RBridge ports connected to one bridged LAN, only one of them can be designated
    as AF port for forwarding/receiving traffic for each LAN, the rest have to be
    blocked for that LAN. This draft describes the framework for using directory service
    to assist edge RBridges to improve TRILL network scalability in data center environment.</p>"
