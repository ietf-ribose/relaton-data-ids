abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to
    roam\nand attach to different access networks without disrupting the\nongoing
    sessions that nodes of the network may have.  By extending\nthe Mobile IPv6 support
    to Mobile Routers, nodes of the network are\nnot required to support any kind
    of mobility, since packets must go\nthrough the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA)
    bi-directional tunnel.\nCommunications from/to a mobile network have to traverse
    the Home\nAgent, and therefore better paths may be available.  Additionally,\nthis
    solution adds packet overhead, due to the encapsulation.\n\nThis document describes
    an approach to the Route Optimisation for\nNEMO, called Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation
    for NEMO (MIRON).  MIRON\nenables mobility-agnostic nodes within the mobile network
    to directly\ncommunicate (i.e. without traversing the MRHA bi-directional tunnel)\nwith
    Correspondent Nodes.  The solution is based on the Mobile Router\nperforming the
    Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation signalling on behalf of\nthe nodes of the mobile
    network.\n\nThis document (in an appendix) also analyses how MIRON fits each of\nthe
    currently identified NEMO Route Optimisation requirements for\nOperational Use
    in Aeronautics and Space Exploration.\n\t </p>\n      "
