abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a handover authentication protocol based on
    the AAA server in FMIPv6. The proposed scheme employs the Diffie- Hellman (DH)
    algorithm to enhance security aspects, and modifies the DH key exchange to reduce
    computational cost at the Mobile Node (MN) by delegating exponential operation
    to the AAA server. The MN and Access Router (AR) establish the handover key HK
    through the AAA server. The main advantage of this document is more secure and
    suitable to a light-weight mobile terminal.</p>"
