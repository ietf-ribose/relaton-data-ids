abstract:
  content: "<p>Many user applications and the transport protocols that make thempossible
    require two-way communications. To address this need, andalso for system simplicity,
    round-trip loss measurements arefrequently conducted in practice. The Two-Way
    Active MeasurementProtocol specified in RFC 5357 establishes a round-trip lossmeasurement
    capability for the Internet. However, there is currentlyno metric specified according
    to the RFC 2330 framework.This memo proposes/adds round-trip loss to the set of
    IP PerformanceMetrics (IPPM).</p>"
