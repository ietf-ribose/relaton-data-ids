abstract:
- content: "<p>Many user applications and the transport protocols that make them possible
    require two-way communications. To address this need, and also for system simplicity,
    round-trip loss measurements are frequently conducted in practice. The Two-Way
    Active Measurement Protocol specified in RFC 5357 establishes a round-trip loss
    measurement capability for the Internet. However, there is currently no metric
    specified according to the RFC 2330 framework. This memo proposes/adds round-trip
    loss to the set of IP Performance Metrics (IPPM).</p>"
