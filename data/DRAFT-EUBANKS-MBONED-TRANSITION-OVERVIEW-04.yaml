abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPTV providers must serve content to their customers during
    the\n   period of transition from IPv4 to IPv6.  During this period, the\n   content
    provider may support only one version of IP while the\n   customer's receiver
    device supports only the other.  Likewise, the\n   network between the provider
    and its customer may include segments\n   supporting only one version of IP or
    another.\n\n   This document provides an overview of the multicast transition\n
    \  problem.  It also provides an overview of the solution space.  The\n   solution
    space is characterized by an adaptation function (AF) that\n   provides an interface
    between IPv4 and IPv6 multicast domains.  This\n   document also discusses various
    multicast use cases which may occur\n   during IPv6 transitioning.  These use
    cases motivate the solution\n   space discussion and the requirements that appear
    at the end.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
