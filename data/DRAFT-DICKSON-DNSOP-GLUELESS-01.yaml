abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet Draft proposes a method for protecting authority\n
    \  servers against MITM and poisoning attacks, using a domain naming\n   strategy
    to not require glue A/AAAA records and use of DNSSEC.\n\n   This technique assumes
    the use of validating resolvers.\n\n   MITM and poisoning attacks should only
    be effective/possible against\n   unsigned domains.\n\n   However, until all domains
    are signed, this guidance is relevant, in\n   that it can limit the attack surface
    of unsigned domains.\n\n   This guidance should be combined with [I-D.dickson-dnsop-ds-hack]\n\n\t
