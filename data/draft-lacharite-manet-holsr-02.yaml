abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the Hierarchical Optimized Link State Routing(HOLSR)
    mechanism for heterogeneous mobile ad hoc networks. In thisspecification a heterogeneous
    mobile ad hoc network is defined as anetwork of mobile routers that are characterized
    by differentcommunication capabilities, such as communication channels,processing
    powers or energy levels.The HOLSR mechanism is an extension to the OLSRv2 protocol.
    HOLSRtakes advantage of the router's distinct communications capabilitiesto reduce
    the routing control overhead in large heterogeneous ad hocnetworks, thus improving
    the performance of the routing mechanism.More precisely, HOLSR defines a hierarchy
    in the network and presentsa routing scheme for this hierarchical structure with
    a betterscalability.</p>"
