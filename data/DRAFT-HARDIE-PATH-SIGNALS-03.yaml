abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the nature of signals seen by on-path\n
    \  elements, contrasting implicit and explicit signals.  For example,\n   TCP's
    state mechanics uses a series of well-known messages that are\n   exchanged in
    the clear.  Because these are visible to network\n   elements on the path between
    the two nodes setting up the transport\n   connection, they are often used as
    signals by those network elements.\n   In transports that do not exchange these
    messages in the clear, on-\n   path network elements lack those signals.  This
    document recommends\n   that explict signals be used by transports which encrypt
    their state\n   mechanics.  It also recommends that a signal be exposed to the
    path\n   only when the signal's originator intends that it be used by the\n   network
    elements on the path.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
