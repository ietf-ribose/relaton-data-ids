abstract:
- content: "<p>Privacy and security issues with email header protection in S/MIME
    have been identified for some time. However, the desire to fix these issue has
    been expressed in the IETF LAMPS Working Group only recently. The existing S/MIME
    specification is likely to be updated regarding header protection. Several LAMPS
    WG participants expressed the opinion that whatever mechanism will be chosen,
    it should not be limited to S/MIME, but also applicable to PGP/MIME. This document
    describes the problem statement, generic use cases, and requirements. Additionally
    it drafts possible solutions to address the challenge. Finally some best practices
    are collected.</p>"
