abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Formally, any DNS resource record may occur under any domain
    name.\n   However some services use an operational convention for defining\n   specific
    interpretations of an RRset, by locating the records in a\n   DNS branch, under
    the parent domain to which the RRset actually\n   applies.  The top of this subordinate
    branch is defined by a naming\n   convention that uses a reserved node name, which
    begins with an\n   _underscore.  The underscored naming construct defines a semantic\n
    \  scope for DNS record types that are associated with the parent\n   domain,
    above the underscored branch.  This specification explores\n   the nature of this
    DNS usage and defines the \"DNS Global Underscore\n   Scoped Entry Registry\"
    with IANA.  The purpose of the Underscore\n   registry is to avoid collisions
    resulting from the use of the same\n   underscore-based name, for different services.\n\n\t
