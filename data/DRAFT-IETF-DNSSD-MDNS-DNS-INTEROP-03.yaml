abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery can use naming
    systems\n   other than the Domain Name System when looking for services.\n   Moreover,
    when it uses the DNS, DNS-Based Service Discovery uses the\n   full capability
    of DNS, rather than using a subset of available\n   octets.  In order for DNS-SD
    to be used effectively in environments\n   where multiple different name systems
    and conventions for their\n   operation are in use, it is important to attend
    to differences in the\n   underlying technology and operational environment.  This
    memo\n   presents an outline of the requirements for selection of labels for\n
    \  conventional DNS and other resolution systems when they are expected\n   to
    interoperate in this manner.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
