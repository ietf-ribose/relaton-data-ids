abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a solution suite for TRILL campuses to be connected
    over WAN networks. TRILL protocol is primarily designed to work within intra-data
    centers. Connecting different sites over WAN using overlay tunnel protocols is
    the primary method employed at present. Though this presents a simple mechanisms
    to extend TRILL campuses over WAN networks, it also brings in the problem of scalability
    for TRILL nicknames exchanged between sites, latency, duplication of traffic etc.
    This draft proposes a way to extend the TRILL sites without having the WAN network
    aware of TRILL campus network and its topology. This document details on how to
    extend TRILL campus sites and to establish connections between various sites without
    having to exchange entire TRILL campus information, thus reducing the information
    flow to the required sites only. This document do not add or define datacenter
    interconnect protocol.</p>"
