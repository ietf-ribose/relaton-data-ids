abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum (PQ) cryptography
    will\n   come uncertainty about the strength of cryptographic primitives.  For\n
    \  example; when will RSA and ECC fall?  Are Lattice schemes as strong\n   as
    we believe?  The cryptographic community is calling for hybrid\n   schemes that
    combine classic and post-quantum crypto in ways that\n   remain strong so long
    as at least one of the algorithms used remains\n   strong.\n\n   This document
    defines the problem statement for digital signatures in\n   PKIX-like protocols,
    and gives an overview of the general families of\n   solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
