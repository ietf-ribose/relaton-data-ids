abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes those features of a service which processessigned
    documents which must be present in order for that service toconstitute a 'technical
    non-repudiation' service. A technicalnon-repudiation service must permit an independent
    verifier todetermine whether a given signature was applied to a given dataobject
    by the private key associated with a given valid certificate,at a time later than
    the signature. The features of a technical non-repudiation service are expected
    to be necessary for a full non-repudiation service, although they may not be sufficient.This
    document is intended to clarify the definition of the'non-repudiation' service
    in RFC 2459. It should thus serve as aguide to when the nonRepudiation bit of
    the keyUsage extension shouldbe set and to when a Certificate Authority is required
    to archiveCRL's.</p>"
