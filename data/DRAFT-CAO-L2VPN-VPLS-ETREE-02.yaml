abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an approach to support Metro Ethernet
    Forum\n   (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) in Virtual Private LAN Service [RFC4761]\n
    \  [RFC4762]. The proposed solution is characterized by breaking\n   pseudowire
    setup between Leaf endpoints in E-Tree instance to fulfill\n   the specific E-Tree
    requirement: Leaf cannot communicate with Leaf.\n   Backward compatibility is
    also considered in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
