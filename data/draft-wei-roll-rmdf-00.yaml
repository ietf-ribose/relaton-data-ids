abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document presents a routing method through sending detectionframes
    including address of destination node to the neighbor nodes toreduce delay of
    data transmission because of the dormant nodes willincrease data transmission
    delay in low power and lossynetworks(LLNs). When receives the response from the
    neighbor nodes,the sending node can select a neighboring node as the next hop
    nodeto sent data, which has the lower cost parameter than the costparameter between
    the sending node and the destination node stored inthe routing table of sending
    node. This routing method finds a routein real-time by broadcasting detection
    frames. As long as anyneighbor node that can reach the destination is active,
    data can besent and then the data transmission delay will be reduced.</p>"
