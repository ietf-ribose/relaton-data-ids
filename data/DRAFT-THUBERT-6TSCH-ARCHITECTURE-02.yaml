abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents an architecture for an IPv6 multilink
    subnet\n   that is composed of a high speed powered backbone and a number of\n
    \  IEEE802.15.4e TSCH wireless networks attached and synchronized by\n   Backbone
    Routers.  Route Computation may be achieved in a centralized\n   fashion by a
    Path Computation Element, in a distributed fashion using\n   the Routing Protocol
    for Low Power and Lossy Networks, or in a mixed\n   mode.  The Backbone Routers
    perform proxy Neighbor discovery\n   operations over the backbone on behalf of
    the wireless device, so\n   they can share a same subnet and appear to be connected
    to the same\n   backbone as classical devices.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
