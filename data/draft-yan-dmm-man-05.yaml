abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on different requirements, multiple mobility management protocols
    have been developed. Different protocols have different functional requirements
    on the network element or the host and then a scheme should be used in order to
    support the negotiation and selection of adopted mobility management protocol
    when a host accesses to a new network. In this draft, this issue is analyzed.</p>"
