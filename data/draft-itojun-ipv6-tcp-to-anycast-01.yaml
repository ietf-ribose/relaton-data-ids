abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 specification implicitly disallows TCP connection toward IPv6
    anycast address. However, if such a connection request happens by mistake, currently
    there is no way to report the incident to the originator of the TCP connection.
    The document tries to define a way to disconnect TCP connections made toward IPv6
    anycast addresses.</p>"
