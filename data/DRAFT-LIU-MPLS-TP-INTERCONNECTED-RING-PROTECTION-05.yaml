abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The requirements for MPLS Transport Profile include a requirement\n
    \  (R93) that requires MPLS-TP must support recovery mechanisms for a\n   network
    constructed from interconnected rings that protect user data\n   that traverses
    more than one ring.  In particular, This includes\n   protecting against cases
    of failure at the ring-interconnect nodes\n   and links.  This document presents
    different scenario of\n   interconnected rings and special mechanism to address
    recovery of the\n   failure of ring-interconnect nodes and links.  .\n\n   This
    document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task\n   Force(IETF) / International
    Telecommunications Union\n   Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T)
    effort to include\n   an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3
    architectures\n   to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet
    transport\n   network as defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
