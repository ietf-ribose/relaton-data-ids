abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multicast security algorithm based on agent node can select the
    group\nnode corresponding to the smallest path cost to be the agent node,\nand
    multicast in accordance with the optimal multicast routing.  In\naddition, the
    multicast source node uses the key different from the\ngroup key to encrypt multicast
    data to meet the requirements of\nmulticast security.  The agent nodes can be
    different for different\nmulticast sources, which can spread the burden of the
    agent node and\navoid the excessive burden problem when the same node as the agent\nnode
    of different sources.\n\t </p>\n      "
