abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes a method to manage the address selectionpolicy
    tables in network hosts using RA's (Router Advertisements).The aim is to provide
    an easy method to network operators to controlthe src/dest address used by the
    host in communication within, andoutside of the site(s) in which the host resides.
    Control of thepolicy tables allows 1) the user to control the scope in which a
    hostmay operate, and 2) non-disruption of intra-site traffic duringrenumbering
    caused by change in the global prefix used by the site toconnect to the Internet.A
    major impact of the last benefit would be to provide one lessincentive to advertise
    routes to the stable network prefixes in theInternet.</p>"
