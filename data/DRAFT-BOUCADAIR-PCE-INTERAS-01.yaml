abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a solution for providing inter-AS MPLS-based
    \n   Quality of Service (QoS) tunnels. This solution makes use of Path \n   Computation
    \ Elements  (PCE)  as  a  means  to  compute  inter-domain \n   constraint-based
    paths. Service considerations and agreements between \n   two IP Network Providers
    (INP) implementing this solution are also \n   described.\n\t </p>\n      "
