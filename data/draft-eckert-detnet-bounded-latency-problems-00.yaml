abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this memo is to explain the challenges and limitations
    of existing (standardized) bounded latency queuing mechanisms for desirable (large
    scale) MPLS and/or IP based networks to allow them to support DetNet services.
    These challenges relate to low-cost, high-speed hardware implementations, desirable
    network design approaches, system complexity, reliability, scalability, cost of
    signaling, performance and jitter experience for the DetNet applications. Many
    of these problems are rooted in the use of per- hop, per-flow (DetNet) forwarding
    and queuing state, but highly accurate network wide time synchronization can be
    another challenge for some networks. This memo does not intend to propose a specific
    queuing solution, but in the same way in which it describes the challenges of
    mechanisms, it reviews how those problem are addressed by currently proposed new
    queuing mechanisms.</p>"
