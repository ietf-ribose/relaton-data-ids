abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In some network topologies, it is preferred to have a trusted
    network\nelement between the DHCP client and the L3 relay agent that adds the\nDHCP
    relay-agent-information option but does not set the giaddr\nfield.  They operate
    in Layer 2 mode and hence act as trusted Layer 2\nrelay agents.  The replies from
    the server are broadcasted by the L3\nrelay agents to these L2 relay agents which
    must be avoided.  This\ndocument defines a new sub-option for the relay-agent-information\noption.
    \ With this sub-option, the L3 relay agent will always unicast\nthe messages towards
    the trusted layer 2 DHCP relay agent with a\nhardware address that is known in
    the network.  The new sub-option is\ncalled the \"unicast-address\" sub-option.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
