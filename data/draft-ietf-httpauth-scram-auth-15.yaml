abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes a family of HTTP authentication mechanisms
    called the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which provides
    a more robust authentication mechanism than a plaintext password protected by
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) and avoids the deployment obstacles presented by
    earlier TLS-protected challenge response authentication mechanisms.</p>"
