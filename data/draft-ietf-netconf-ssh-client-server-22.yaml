abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines three YANG modules: the first defines groupings
    for a generic SSH client, the second defines groupings for a generic SSH server,
    and the third defines common identities and groupings used by both the client
    and the server. It is intended that these groupings will be used by applications
    using the SSH protocol. Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor) This draft
