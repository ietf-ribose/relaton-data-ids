abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 8226 provides a certificate extension to constrain the JWT claims
    that can be included in the PASSporT as defined in RFC 8225. If the signer includes
    a JWT claim outside the constraint boundaries, then the recipient will reject
    the entire PASSporT. This document defines an additional way that the JWT claims
    can be constrained.</p>"
