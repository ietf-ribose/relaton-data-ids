abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes a light weight route optimization technique
    that\n   helps to optimize the media path between two communicating nodes when\n
    \  Proxy MIP is used as the mobility protocol.  This routing\n   optimization
    technique is most useful when the two communicating\n   hosts are away from home
    and need to communicate with each other\n   using an optimized path.  It takes
    advantage of the data packet\n   between LMA and MAG to set up the optimized data
    path between the\n   communicating hosts.  This route optimization technique is
    applicable\n   to both the intra-LMA and inter-LMA scenarios.\n\t </p>\n      "
