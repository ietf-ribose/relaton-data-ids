abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Open Caching working group of the Streaming Video Alliance
    is\n   focused on the delegation of video delivery requests from commercial\n
    \  CDNs to a caching layer at the ISP.  In that aspect, Open Caching is\n   a
    specific use case of CDNI, where the commercial CDN is the upstream\n   CDN (uCDN)
    and the ISP caching layer is the downstream CDN (dCDN).\n   The extensions specified
    in this document to the CDNI Metadata and\n   FCI interfaces are derived from
    requirements raised by Open Caching\n   but are applicable to CDNI use cases in
    general.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
