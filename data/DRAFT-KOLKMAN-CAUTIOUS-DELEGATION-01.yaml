abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Sometimes, a DNS name is known to be in use in the wild even
    though\n   it was never properly delegated.  This situation appears\n   particularly,
    but not only, true in certain domains near the root of\n   the tree: people have
    independently used those non-existent top-level\n   domains as private namespaces.
    \ If those names are to be delegated in\n   the public DNS, prudence dictates
    that collisions between the private\n   uses and the public use be minimized.
    \ We outline a procedure to\n   evaluate the harm of delegation.\n\n\t </p>\n
    \     "
