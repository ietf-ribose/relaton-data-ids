abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends Directory-Based Information Services
    (DBIS)\n   described in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support hosts,\n
    \  networks, netmasks, protocols, rpc and services databases.\n\n   The database
    schemas SHALL be backwards compatible with the Network\n   Information Service
    [NIS] but stored within [X.500] entries so that\n   they may be resolved with
    the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n   [RFC4510].\n\n   A hosts database
    maps hostnames to IP addresses, networks map network\n   names to network numbers,
    netmasks map network numbers to netmasks,\n   protocols map network protocol names
    to protocol numbers, rpc maps\n   Remote Procedure Call [RFC1057] program names
    to RPC program numbers\n   and services map network service names to port numbers
    and protocols.\n\n   This document describes configuration maps [draft-bannister-dbis-\n
    \  mapping-00] for hosts, networks, protocols, rpc and services, and\n   database
    entries referenced by those maps.\n\t </p>\n      "
