abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of this document is to inform the Internet community
    of\nthe TCP optimization techniques that were found useful for\ntransmitting data
    over the CDMA2000 1x network. Our recommendations\nare based on lab measurements
    and simulations of FTP data\ntransmissions over the CDMA2000 1x systems. Same
    recommendations\ncould be applicable to networks with similar characteristics
    (e.g.,\nW-CDMA, GPRS, etc.) and therefore could be incorporated into the\nexisting
    document addressing performance implications of 2.5G/3G\nnetworks [3].\nThis document
    does not specify an Internet standard and it does not\npropose any changes to
    an Internet standard.\n\t </p>\n      "
