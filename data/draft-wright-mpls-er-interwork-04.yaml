abstract:
  content: "<p>The development of two explicit routing protocols RSVP-TE[RSVP-TE]and
    CR-LDP[CR-LDP] within MPLS has created the need to allowinterworking between the
    two MPLS. Explict routed (ER) label switchpaths do not have a prior knowledge
    of the ER signaling method inuse within the various links comprising a domain.
    In an integratedenvironment an ER path may crisscross between RSVP-TE and CR-LDPnodes
    numerous times.This document describes the procedures for the establishment of
    anRSVP-TE originated LSP transiting or terminating within a CR-LDPdomain and the
    procedures for the establishment of a CR-LDPoriginated LSP terminating within
    an RSVP-TE domain.</p>"
