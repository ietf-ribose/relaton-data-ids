abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide different customers
    with\n   logically separated connectivity over a common network\n   infrastructure.
    \ With the introduction and evolvement of 5G and other\n   network scenarios,
    some existing or new customers may require\n   connectivity services with advanced
    characteristics comparing to\n   traditional VPNs.  Such kind of network service
    is called enhanced\n   VPNs (VPN+).\n\n   A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is
    a virtual underlay network which\n   consists of a set of dedicated or shared
    network resources allocated\n   from the physical underlay network, and is associated
    with a\n   customized logical network topology.  VPN+ services can be delivered\n
    \  by mapping one or a group of overlay VPNs to the appropriate VTNs as\n   the
    virtual underlay.  In packet forwarding, some fields in the data\n   packet needs
    to be used to identify the VTN the packet belongs to, so\n   that the VTN-specific
    processing can be performed on each node the\n   packet traverses.\n\n   This
    document proposes a new Hop-by-Hop option of IPv6 extension\n   header to carry
    the VTN Resource ID, which is used to identify the\n   set of network resources
    allocated to a VTN for packet processing.\n   The procedure for processing the
    VTN option is also specified.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
