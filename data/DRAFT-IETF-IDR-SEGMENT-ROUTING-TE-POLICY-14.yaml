abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new BGP SAFI with a new NLRI to advertise
    a\n   candidate path of a Segment Routing (SR) Policy.  An SR Policy is a\n   set
    of candidate paths, each consisting of one or more segment lists.\n   The headend
    of an SR Policy may learn multiple candidate paths for an\n   SR Policy.  Candidate
    paths may be learned via several different\n   mechanisms, e.g., CLI, NetConf,
    PCEP, or BGP.  This document\n   specifies how BGP may be used to distribute SR
    Policy candidate\n   paths.  New sub-TLVs for the Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute
    are\n   defined for signaling information about these candidate paths.\n\n\t </p>\n
