abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents the concepts and the implementations
    of\n   address-sharing dual-stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation (dIVI).\n\n   The
    dIVI is an extension of 1:1 stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation with\n   features
    of IPv4 address sharing and dual translation.  The major\n   benefits of those
    extensions are using public IPv4 addresses more\n   effectively and removing the
    requirements of DNS64 and ALG, without\n   loosing the stateless, end-to-end address
    transparency and\n   bidirectional-initiated communications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
