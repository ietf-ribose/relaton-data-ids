abstract:
- content: <p>At one time, the RFC Editor published snapshots of the "Internet Official
    Protocol Standards". These documents were known as xx00 documents, the last of
    which was published in May 2008. These snapshots have been replaced by an online
    database. The RFC Editor provides an up-to-date list on the RFC Editor website
    and will no longer be publishing these snapshots as RFCs.</p>
