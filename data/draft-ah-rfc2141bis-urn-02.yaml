abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are intended to serve as persistent,location-independent,
    resource identifiers. This document serves asthe foundation of the 'urn' URI Scheme
    according to RFC 3986 and setsforward the canonical syntax for URNs, which subdivides
    URNs into\"namespaces\". A discussion of both existing legacy and newnamespaces
    and requirements for URN presentation and transmission arepresented. Finally,
    there is a discussion of URN equivalence and howto determine it. This document
    supersedes RFC 2141.The requirements and procedures for URN Namespace registrationdocuments
    are currently set forth in RFC 3406, which is also expectedto be updated by an
    independent, revised specification.DiscussionThis draft version has been obtained
    by importing the text from RFC2141 into modern tools and making a first round
    of updating steps.It is intended to serve as one of the starting points for an
    effortto bring URN RFCs in alignment with STD 63, STD 68, BCP 26, and therequirements
    from emerging distributed national and international URNresolution systems, and
    advance them on the IETF Standards Track.Comments are welcome on the urn@ietf.org
    mailing list (or sent to thedocument editor).</p>"
