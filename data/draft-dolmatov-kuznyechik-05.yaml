  content: "\t <t>This document is intended to be a source of information about the
    Russian Federal standard GOST R 34.12-2015 describing the block cipher with a
    block length of n=128 bits and a key length of k=256 bits, which is also referred
    to as \"Kuznyechik\". This algorithm is one of the set of Russian cryptographic
    standard algorithms (called GOST algorithms).</p>"
