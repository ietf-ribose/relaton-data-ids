abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes how the concept of URI signing supports the
    content access control requirements of CDNI and proposes a URI signing method
    as a JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] profile. The proposed URI signing method specifies
    the information needed to be included in the URI to transmit the signed JWT as
    well as the claims needed by the signed JWT to authorize a UA. The mechanism described
    can be used both in CDNI and single CDN scenarios.</p>"
