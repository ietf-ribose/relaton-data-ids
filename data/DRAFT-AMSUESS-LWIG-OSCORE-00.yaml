abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)
    is a\n   means of end-to-end protection of short request/response exchanges\n
    \  for tiny devices, typically transported using the Constrained\n   Application
    Protocol (CoAP).  This document aims to assist\n   implementers in leveraging
    the optimizations catered for by the\n   combination of CoAP and OSCORE, and by
    generally providing experience\n   from earlier implementations.\n\n\t </p>\n
