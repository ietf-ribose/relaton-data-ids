abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In case a webserver gets defaced a black hat might change vital\ninformation
    with massive danger for the normal surfer.  If for example a\nbanking web portal
    site containing a link to the online banking login\nscreen gets changed pointing
    to the black hats identical mirror of the\nlogin screen (as happend here some
    times already) he will get his hands\non real banking accounts.  The encryption
    via SSL of already defaced\ndata will be no solution at all. SSL is only a counterpart
    in this\nscenario to ensure the connected web server is the right one and to dis-\nable
    data sniffing on the wire.\nThe solution to this case might be signing all HTTP-accessable
    con-\ntent including static and dynamic HTML pages.  This solution even keeps\nan
    eye on dynamic portal content, as most starting pages now have\ndynamic content
    on it, starting from the current time to brokerage news.\nBest solution would
    never the less be to have the critical data within\nstatic pages.\nWe can sign
    any URL based content because the signature doesn't get\ninto the content sent,
    but into the HTTP reply headers.  So we don't\nmodify any data. The HTTP reply
    doesn't need any change within the web-\nserver source code but can most times
    be configured by standard configu-\nration ways.\nSigning not only HTML but possibly
    any critical data is needed for\nexample with a flash movie who display critical
    data like online broker-\nage data.  This data might be forged by replacing a
    lying flash movie\nwith possibly bad consequences to stock rates.  One shouldn't
    underesti-\nmate the criminal energy in these cases.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
