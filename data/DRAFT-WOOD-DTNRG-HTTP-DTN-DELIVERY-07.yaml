abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol,\n
    \  HTTP, for communication across delay- and disruption-tolerant\n   networks,
    by making every transit node in the network HTTP-capable,\n   and doing peer HTTP
    transfers between nodes to move data hop-by-hop\n   or subnet-by-subnet towards
    its final destination.  HTTP is well-\n   known and straightforward to implement
    in these networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
