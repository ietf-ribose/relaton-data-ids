abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a protocol, BMP, that can be used to monitor
    BGP sessions. BMP is intended to provide a more convenient interface for obtaining
    route views for research purpose than the screen- scraping approach in common
    use today. The design goals are to keep BMP simple, useful, easily implemented,
    and minimally service- affecting. BMP is not suitable for use as a routing protocol.</p>"
