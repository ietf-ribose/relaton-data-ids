abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF currently meets three times per year in various parts
    of the\n   world.  Somewhere around 1,000 people all get into planes, consume\n
    \  carbon, and then attend various meetings in what often is a jetlagged\n   stupor.
    \ We gotta to stop meeting like this.  This draft calls on the\n   LLC to research
    on the community's behalf new modalities for IETF\n   face-to-face meetings.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
