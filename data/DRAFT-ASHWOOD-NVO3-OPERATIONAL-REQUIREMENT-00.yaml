abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>           This document provides framework and requirements for
    Network\n           Virtualization over Layer 3 (NVO3) Operations, Administration,\n
    \          and Maintenance (OAM). This document for the most part gathers\n           requirements
    from existing IETF drafts and RFCs which have\n           already extensively
    studied this subject for different data\n           planes and layering. As a
    result this draft is high level and\n           broad. We begin to ask which are
    truely required for NVO3 and\n           expect the list to be narrowed by the
    working group as\n           subsequent versions of this draft are created.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
