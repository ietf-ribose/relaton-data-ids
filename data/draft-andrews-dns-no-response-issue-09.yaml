abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS is a query / response protocol. Failure to respond to queries
    causes both immediate operational problems and long term problems with protocol
    development. This document identifies a number of common classes of queries that
    some servers fail to respond too. This document also suggests procedures for TLD
    and other similar zone operators to apply to help reduce / eliminate the problem.</p>"
