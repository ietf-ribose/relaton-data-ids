abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a solution to the Internet address
    depletion\n   issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part
    of\n   the original IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for\n   Easy
    IPv4), outlines the IPv4 public address pool expansion and the\n   Internet system
    architecture enhancement considerations. EzIP may\n   expand an IPv4 address by
    a factor of 256M without affecting the\n   existing IPv4 based Internet, or the
    current private networks. It is\n   in full conformance with the IPv4 protocol,
    and supports not only\n   both direct and private network connectivity, but also
    their\n   interoperability. EzIP deployments may coexist with existing Internet\n
    \  traffic and the IoT (Internet of Things) operations without\n   perturbing
    their setups, while offering end-users the freedom to\n   indepdently choose which
    service. EzIP may be implemented as a\n   software or firmware enhancement to
    Internet edge routers or private\n   network routing gateways, wherever needed,
    or simply installed as an\n   inline adjunct hardware module between the two,
    enabling a seamless\n   introduction. The 256M case detailed here establishes
    a complete\n   spherical layer of routers for interfacing between the Internet
    fabic\n   (core plus edge routers) and the end user premises. Incorporating\n
    \  caching proxy technology in the gateway, a fairly large geographical\n   region
    may enjoy address expansion based on as little as one ordinary\n   IPv4 public
    address utilizing IP packets with degenerated EzIP\n   header. If IPv4 public
    pool allocations were reorganized, the\n   assignable pool could be multiplied
    512M fold or even more. EzIP will\n   immediately resolve local IPv4 address shortages,
    while being\n   transparent to the rest of the Internet. Under the Dual-Stack\n
    \  environment, these proposed interim facilities will relieve the IPv4\n   address
    shortage issue, while affording IPv6 more time to reach\n   maturity and to provide
    the availability levels required for\n   delivering a long-term general service.\n\n\t
