abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed.\n
    \  The Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous sites, each being\n   a
    collection of nodes.  Each site is named by a exterior address\n   whereas each
    node by a interior local address.  Exterior routing\n   depends solely on site
    addresses while interior routing on node\n   addresses.  Both interior and exterior
    routings render inherent\n   mobility as well as seamless multihoming capability.
    \ The model can\n   recursively repeat itself both outwards and inwards in the
    network,\n   enabling its applicability, for example, to inter-planetary as well\n
    \  as Internet of Things.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
