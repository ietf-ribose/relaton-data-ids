abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)
    \ \nworking group is developing protocol for authenticating clients to  \nthe
    access network using IP based protocols.  The PANA protocol  \nauthenticates the
    client and also establishes a PANA security  \nassociation between the PANA client
    and PANA authentication agent at  \nthe end of a successful authentication. But
    it does not specify any  \nmechanism for preventing service theft. This document
    discusses the  \ndetails for establishing an IPsec security association for securing
    \nthe link between PANA client and the enforcement point, which can be  \nused
    to prevent service theft.   \n\t </p>\n      "
