abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates
    used\n   to enable validation of Autonomous System (AS) paths in the Border\n
    \  Gateway Protocol (BGP), as part of an extension to that protocol\n   known
    as BGPsec.  BGP is the standard for inter-domain routing in the\n   Internet;
    it is the \"glue\" that holds the Internet together. BGPsec\n   is being developed
    as one component of a solution that addresses the\n   requirement to provide security
    for BGP.  The goal of BGPsec is to\n   provide full AS path validation based on
    the use of strong\n   cryptographic primitives.  The end-entity (EE) certificates
    specified\n   by this profile are issued (to routers within an Autonomous System).\n
    \  Each of these certificates is issued under a Resource Public Key\n   Infrastructure
    (RPKI) Certification Authority (CA) certificate.\n   These CA certificates and
    EE certificates both contain the AS\n   Identifier Delegation extension.  An EE
    certificate of this type\n   asserts that the router(s) holding the corresponding
    private key are\n   authorized to emit secure route advertisements on behalf of
    the\n   AS(es) specified in the certificate.  This document also profiles the\n
    \  format of certification requests, and specifies Relying Party (RP)\n   certificate
    path validation procedures for these EE certificates.\n   This document extends
    the RPKI; therefore, this documents updates the\n   RPKI Resource Certificates
    Profile (RFC 6487).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
