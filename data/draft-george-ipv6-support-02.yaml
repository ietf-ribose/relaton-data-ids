abstract:
- content: "<p>This document recommends that IETF formally require its standards work
    to be IP version agnostic or to explicitly include support for IPv6, with some
    exceptions. It further recommends that IETF revisit and update the previous attempts
    to review existing standards for IPv6 compliance. It makes this recommendation
    in order to ensure that it is possible to operate without dependencies on IPv4.</p>"
