abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines
    an\n   architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize\n   information
    exchange between the control plane and the forwarding\n   plane in a ForCES Network
    Element (ForCES NE).  RFC5812 has defined\n   the ForCES Model that provides a
    formal way to represent the\n   capabilities, state, and configuration of forwarding
    elements within\n   the context of the ForCES protocol, so that control elements
    (CEs)\n   can control the FEs accordingly.  More specifically, the model\n   describes
    the logical functions that are present in a forwarding\n   element (FE), what
    capabilities these functions support, and how\n   these functions are or can be
    interconnected.\n\n   RFC5812 has been around for two years and experience in
    its use has\n   shown room for small extensions without a need to alter the protocol\n
    \  while retaining backward compatibility with older xml libraries.\n   This document
    updates RFC5812 and extends the model to allow complex\n   datatypes for metadata,
    optional default values for datatypes,\n   optional access types for structures
    and fixes an issue with Logical\n   Functional Block (LFB) inheritance.  The document
    also introduces two\n   new features a new event condition BecomesEqualTo and
    LFB properties.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
