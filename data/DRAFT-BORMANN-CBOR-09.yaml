abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format
    whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly
    small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.
    \ These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such
    as ASN.1 and MessagePack.\n\t </p>\n      "
