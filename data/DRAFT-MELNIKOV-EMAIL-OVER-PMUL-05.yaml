abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ACP 142 defines P_MUL, which is a protocol for reliable multicast\n
    \  suitable for bandwidth constrained and delayed acknowledgement\n   (Emissions
    Control or \"EMCON\") environments running over UDP.  This\n   document is a specification
    of the basic protocol for electronic mail\n   transfer over ACP 142 to enable
    MTA to MTA transfer.  It explains how\n   MULE can be used in conjunction with
    Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\n   (RFC 5321), including some common SMTP extensions,
    to provide an\n   alternate MTA to MTA transfer mechanism.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
