abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In many roaming scenarios, it is necessary to be able to carry
    cost \ninformation between the different parties in order to facilitate    credit
    checking, real-time accounting, cost presentation to the \nuser. It is also necessary
    that this information be interpretable by \nautomated systems, that these systems
    be able to modify it to take \ncommissions into account, and that non-repudiation
    mechanisms be \navailable. This document proposes such a system to be used with
    AAA \narchitectures.\n\t </p>\n      "
