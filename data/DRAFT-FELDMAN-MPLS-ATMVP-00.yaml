abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS Architecture [ARCH] discusses the way in which ATM\n
    \  switches may be used as Label Switching Routers.  The MPLS ATM VC\n   switching
    document [ATMVC] details the way in which ATM-LSRs are\n   used, specifically
    in the presence of non-merge and VC-merge\n   capable switches.  This document
    is a companion document to\n   [ATMVC]; it extends the ATM procedures for the
    support of VP-\n   switching on ATM-LSRs.  It is assumed the reader is familiar
    with\n   the contents of [ATMVC].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
