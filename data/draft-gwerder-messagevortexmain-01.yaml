abstract:
- content: "<p>MessageVortex Protocol is a protocol to achieve different degrees of
    anonymity. It specifies messages embedded within existing transfer protocols such
    as SMTP or XMPP to send them via peer nodes to one or more recipients. The protocol
    outperforms other protocols by decoupling transport from the final transmitter
    and receiver party. There is no trust put into any infrastructure except for the
    infrastructure of the sending and receiving party of a message. The creator of
    the routing block has full control over the message flow. Routing nodes gain no
    non- obvious knowledge about messages even when collaborating. Third- party anonymity
    is always achieved. Furthermore, the protocol allows achieving either sender or
    receiver anonymity.</p>"
