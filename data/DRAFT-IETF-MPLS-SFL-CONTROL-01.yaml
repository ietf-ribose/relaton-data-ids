abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In RFC 8957 the concept of MPLS synonymos flow labels (SFL)
    was\n   introduced.  This document describes a simple control protocol that\n
    \  runs over an associated control header to request, withdraw, and\n   extend
    the lifetime of such labels.  It is not the only control\n   protocol that might
    be used to support SFL, but it has the benefit of\n   being able to be used without
    modifying of the existing MPLS control\n   protocols.  The existence of this design
    is not intended to restrict\n   the ability to enhance an existing MPLS control
    protocol to add a\n   similar capability.\n\n   A Querier MUST wait a configured
    time (suggested wait of 60 seconds)\n   before re-attempting a Withdraw request.
    \ No more than three Withdraw\n   requests SHOULD be made.  These restrictions
    are to prevent\n   overloading the control plane of the actioning router.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
