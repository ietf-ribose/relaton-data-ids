abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides\n   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n
    \  computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n    The
    Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol\n   Label Switching
    (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs) using PCEP.\n\n
    \  This document defines PCEP extensions for grouping two reverse\n   unidirectional
    MPLS TE LSPs into an Associated Bidirectional LSP when\n   using a Stateful PCE
    for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs as\n   well as when using a Stateless
    PCE.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
