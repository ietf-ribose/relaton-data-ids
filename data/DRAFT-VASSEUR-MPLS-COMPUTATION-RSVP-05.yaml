abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE to support a
    new \n   message type called a “Path computation” message.  This message is to
    \n   be used between an LSR and a Path Computation Element (PCE), which \n   may
    be an LSR or a centralized path computation tool. An RSVP Path \n   Computation
    Request message is used by the head-end LSR to send its \n   request to the PCE.
    The PCE in turn sends an RSVP Path Computation \n   Reply message containing either:
    \n        - a positive reply, containing one or more paths, if the request \n
    \       can be satisfied. \n        - a negative reply if no path obeying the
    requested constraints \n        can be found. The PCE may also optionally suggest
    new constraint \n        values for which one or several paths could be found.
    \n   There are many situations where a PCE may be used. A typical example \n   is
    in the context of Inter-area MPLS TE. A head-end LSR could request \n   that a
    PCE compute one or more paths obeying a specified set of \n   constraints for
    a TE LSP spanning multiple areas. The PCE could be a \n   centralized path computation
    Element or an LSR such as an ABR or an \n   ASBR. Another example is the use of
    a PCE to compute diversely routed \n   paths between two end points.  This may
    be useful in the context of \n   MPLS TE LSP Path protection or GMPLS LSP Path
    protection. The \n   computation of Multi-constraints paths requires intensive
    CPU \n   resources, and may be yet another usage example. Lastly, those \n   protocol
    extensions could be used as a “UNI” like protocol between a \n   CE (Customer
    Edge equipment) and a PE (Provider Edge equipment) where \n   the CE is not part
    of the PE’s IGP domain. \n\t </p>\n      "
