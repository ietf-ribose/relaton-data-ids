abstract:
- content: "<p>The Endpoint Cost Service maps a source-destination pair into a cost
    value, which provides an abstract network view based on a subset of the 2-dimension
    address space. Given that the emergence of new networking datapath capabilities
    has substantially increased the routing flexibility, such a query space is not
    sufficient to uniquely identify a flow. To address the limitations of the network
    information query space provided by the legacy ALTO protocol, this document takes
    two approaches: extending the existing ALTO cost query services with fine-grained
    semantics, and enabling a new flow-based query service named Flow Cost Service.
    These extensions move ALTO to a more flexible and expressive network information
    query space.</p>"
