abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Hybrid key exchange refers to using multiple key exchange algorithms\n
    \  simultaneously and combining the result with the goal of providing\n   security
    even if all but one of the component algorithms is broken.\n   It is motivated
    by transition to post-quantum cryptography.  This\n   document provides a construction
    for hybrid key exchange in the\n   Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version
    1.3.\n\n   Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the TLS IETF\n   mailing
    list tls@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository which contains\n   the draft: https://github.com/dstebila/draft-stebila-tls-hybrid-\n
    \  design.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
