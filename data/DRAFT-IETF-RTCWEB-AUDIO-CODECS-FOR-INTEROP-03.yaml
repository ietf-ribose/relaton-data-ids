abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To ensure a baseline level of interoperability between WebRTC\n
    \  clients, a minimum set of required codecs is specified.  However, to\n   maximize
    the possibility to establish the session without the need\n   for audio transcoding,
    it is also recommended to include in the offer\n   other suitable audio codecs
    that are available to the browser.\n\n   This document provides some guidelines
    on the suitable codecs to be\n   considered for WebRTC clients to address the
    most relevant\n   interoperability use cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
