abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An MPLS Traffic Engineering(TE) network is typically configured
    and\n   results of its operation are analyzed by Command Line Interface\n   (CLI),
    SNMP or NETCONF.  These interactions to control MPLS TE and\n   diagnose its operation
    encompass: MPLS TE configuration, MPLS TE\n   protection, traffic switching-over,
    monitoring of MPLS TE and fault\n   detection.\n\n   Interface to the Routing
    System's (I2RS) Programmatic interfaces, as\n   defined in [I-D.ward-i2rs-framework],
    provides an alternate way to\n   control the configuration and diagnose the operation
    of MPLS TE.\n   I2RS may be used for the configuration, manipulation, polling
    or\n   analyzing MPLS TE.  This document describes set of use cases for\n   which
    I2RS can be used for MPLS TE.  It is intended to provide a base\n   for the solution
    draft describing a set of interfaces to MPLS TE.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
