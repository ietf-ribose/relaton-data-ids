abstract:
- content: "<p>This informational memo describes Datacenter TCP (DCTCP), a TCP congestion
    control scheme for datacenter traffic. DCTCP extends the Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN) processing to estimate the fraction of bytes that encounter congestion,
    rather than simply detecting that some congestion has occurred. DCTCP then scales
    the TCP congestion window based on this estimate. This method achieves high burst
    tolerance, low latency, and high throughput with shallow- buffered switches. This
    memo also discusses deployment issues related to the coexistence of DCTCP and
    conventional TCP, the lack of a negotiating mechanism between sender and receiver,
    and presents some possible mitigations. This memo documents existing DCTCP implementations
    ([WINDOWS], [LINUX], [FREEBSD]) and deployment experience ([MORGANSTANLEY]). DCTCP
    as described in this draft is applicable to deployments in controlled environments
    like datacenters but it must not be deployed over the public Internet without
    additional measures, as detailed in Section 5.</p>"
