abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In ICN (Information-centric network), everything is an identifiable\n
    \  object with a name, therefore the number of name prefixes is a few\n   orders
    of magnitude higher than that in current BGP routing table.\n   Towards scalable
    routing in ICN, we propose a name scheme, called\n   container assisted  naming.
    With this scheme, an object name consists\n   of two components: a content name
    which uniquely specifies the object\n   within certain scope, and one or more
    containers which define access\n   relationships to the object. This document
    illustrates the concept of\n   container and how it assists scalable routing in
    ICN.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
