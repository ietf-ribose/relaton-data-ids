abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Internet is evolving to become a more ubiquitous network,
    driven\nby the low prices of wireless routers and access points and by the\nusers'
    requirements of connectivity anytime and anywhere.  For that\nreason, a cloud
    of nodes connected by wireless technology is being\ncreated at the edge of the
    Internet.  We refer to this cloud as a\nFringe Stub (FS).  It is expected that
    networking in the FS will be\nhighly unmanaged and ad-hoc, but at the same time
    will need to offer\nexcellent service availability.  The NEMO Basic Support protocol\ncould
    be used to provide global reachability for a mobile access\nnetwork within the
    FS and the Tree-Discovery mechanism could be used\nto avoid the formation of loops
    in this highly unmanaged structure.\nSince Internet connectivity in mobile scenarios
    can be costly,\nlimited or unavailable, there is a need to enable local routing\nbetween
    the Mobile Routers within a portion of the FS.  This form of\nlocal routing is
    useful for Route Optimization (RO) between Mobile\nRouters that are communicating
    directly in a portion of the FS.\n\nNetwork In Node Advertisement (NINA) is the
    second of a 2-passes\nrouting protocol; a first pass, Tree Discovery, builds a
    loop-less\nstructure -- a tree --, and the second pass, NINA, exposes the Mobile\nNetwork
    Prefixes (MNPs) up the tree.  The protocol operates as a\nmulti-hop extension
    of Neighbor Discovery (ND), to populate TD-based\ntrees with prefixes, and establish
    routes towards the MNPs down the\ntree, from the root-MR towards the MR that owns
    the prefix, whereas\nthe default route is oriented towards the root-MR.\n\nThe
    NINA protocol introduces a new option in the ND Neighbor\nAdvertisement (NA),
    the Network In Node Option (NINO).  An NA with\nNINO(s) is called a NINA (Network
    In Node Advertisement).  NINA is\ndesigned for a hierarchical model, and by using
    this NA based\napproach it abstracts the embedded network of a Mobile Router as
    a\nhost to the upper level of network abstraction.  With NINA, a Mobile\nRouter
    presents its sub-tree to its parent as an embedded network and\nhides the inner
    topology and movements.\n\t </p>\n      "
