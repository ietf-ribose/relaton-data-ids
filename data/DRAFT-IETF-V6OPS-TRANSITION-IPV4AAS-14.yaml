abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the IPv4 service continuity requirements
    for\n   an IPv6 Customer Edge (CE) router, either provided by the service\n   provider
    or by vendors who sell through the retail market.\n\n   Specifically, this document
    extends the \"Basic Requirements for IPv6\n   Customer Edge Routers\" (RFC7084)
    in order to allow the provisioning\n   of IPv6 transition services for the support
    of \"IPv4 as-a-Service\"\n   (IPv4aaS) by means of new transition mechanisms.
    \ The document only\n   covers transition technologies for delivering IPv4 in
    IPv6-only\n   access networks, commonly called \"IPv4 as-a-Service\" (IPv4aaS).
    \ This\n   is necessary because there aren't sufficient IPv4 addresses available\n
    \  for every possible customer/device.  However, devices or applications\n   in
    the customer LANs (Local Area Networks) may be IPv4-only or\n   IPv6-only and
    still need to communicate with IPv4-only services at\n   the Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n
