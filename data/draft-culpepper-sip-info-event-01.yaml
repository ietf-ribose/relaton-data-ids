abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the use of the SIP INFO Method forcommunicating
    mid-call events in SIP [1] sessions. Two new MIMEtypes are described, according
    to the rules defined in RFC 2046 [2],for use in the INFO message. These media
    types can be used within aSIP INFO message to request, and report, event detection
    between SIPnetwork entities. Emphasis is placed on DTMF signaling tocommunicate
    user indications when using SIP between a Media GatewayController (MGC) and a
    SIP application.</p>"
