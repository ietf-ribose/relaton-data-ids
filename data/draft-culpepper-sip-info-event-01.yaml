abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of the SIP INFO Method for communicating
    mid-call events in SIP [1] sessions. Two new MIME types are described, according
    to the rules defined in RFC 2046 [2], for use in the INFO message. These media
    types can be used within a SIP INFO message to request, and report, event detection
    between SIP network entities. Emphasis is placed on DTMF signaling to communicate
    user indications when using SIP between a Media Gateway Controller (MGC) and a
    SIP application.</p>"
