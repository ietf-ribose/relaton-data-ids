abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a signalling solution for setup\n   and
    maintenance of multi-hop pseudo-wires. This signalling solution \n   is a natural
    extention of the method described in \"Pseudowire Setup \n   and Maintenance using
    LDP\" [PWE3-CTRL]. The main purpose of this \n   document is to solve the scaling
    issues in single hop pseudo-wire \n   architectures.\n\t </p>\n      "
