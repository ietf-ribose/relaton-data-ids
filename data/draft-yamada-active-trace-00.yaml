abstract:
  content: "<p>General traceback protocols (e.g. itrace) only consider to sendtraceback
    information from Generator to Tracer. But they are nothelpful when victims and/or
    Tracer want to know who attacks thembecause of conventional traceback mechanisms
    have not beenreflected in Tracer intention. Therefore this draft proposes anadditional
    protocol for conventional traceback protocols,especially itrace, to reflect in
    Tracer intention and be able tocontrol generation of traceback information by
    Generator.</p>"
