abstract:
  content: "<p>General traceback protocols (e.g. itrace) only consider to send traceback
    information from Generator to Tracer. But they are not helpful when victims and/or
    Tracer want to know who attacks them because of conventional traceback mechanisms
    have not been reflected in Tracer intention. Therefore this draft proposes an
    additional protocol for conventional traceback protocols, especially itrace, to
    reflect in Tracer intention and be able to control generation of traceback information
    by Generator.</p>"
