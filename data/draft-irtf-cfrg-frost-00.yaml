abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we present FROST, a Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr
    Threshold signature scheme that reduces network overhead during signing operations
    while protecting against forgery attacks applicable to prior similar threshold
    and multisignature constructions. FROST can be safely used without limiting concurrency
    of signing operations yet allows for true threshold signing, as only a threshold
    number of participants are required for signing operations. Here, we define FROST
    as a two-round protocol, but it can be optimized to a single-round single-round
    signing protocol as the first round can be performed as a batched pre-processing
    stage.</p>"
