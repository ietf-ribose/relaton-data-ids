abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft introduces several information elements (IEs) to
    enable\n   IPFIX [RFC7011] to export the BGP community information, including\n
    \  the information of BGP standard community [RFC1997], BGP extended\n   community
    [RFC4360], and BGP large community [RFC8092].  Network\n   traffic information
    can then be accumulated and analysed at the BGP\n   community granularity, which
    represents the traffic of different\n   kinds of customers, services, or geographical
    regions according to\n   the network operator's BGP community planning.  Network
    traffic\n   information at the BGP community granularity is useful for network\n
    \  traffic analysis and engineering.\n\n   To clarify, no new BGP community attribute
    is defined in this\n   document and this document has no purpose to replace BGP
    Monitoring\n   Protocol (BMP) defined in RFC7854.  The IEs introduced in this\n
    \  document are used by IPFIX together with other IEs to facilitate the\n   IPFIX
    collector analyzing the network traffic at the BGP community\n   granularity without
    running the heavy BGP protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
