abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>New vulnerabilities in software and hardware products are discovered\nand
    publicized on a daily basis.  The disclosure of vulnerability\ninformation has
    been a divisive topic for years.  During the process\nof disclosure, many vendors,
    security researchers, and other parties\nfollow a variety of unwritten or informal
    guidelines for how they\ninteract and share information.  Some parties may be
    unaware of these\nguidelines, or they may intentionally ignore them.  This state
    of\naffairs can make it difficult to achieve a satisfactory outcome for\neveryone
    who uses or is affected by vulnerability information. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
