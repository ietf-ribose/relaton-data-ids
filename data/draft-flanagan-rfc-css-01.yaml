abstract:
- content: "<p>While individuals may choose their own Cascading Style Sheet for presenting
    HTML-formatted RFCs, the default offered by the RFC Editor must meet certain requirements.
    This draft describes those requirements and is based on the classes defined in
    draft-hildebrand- html-rfc. Discussion of this draft takes place on the rfc-interest
    mailing list (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org), which has its home page at https://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest.</p>"
