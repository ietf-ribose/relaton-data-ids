abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>LoST maps service identifiers and location information to service\ncontact
    URIs.  If a LoST client wants to discover available services\nfor a particular
    location, it will perform a &lt;listServicesByLocation&gt;\nquery to the LoST
    server.  However, the response from the LoST server\ndoes not provide information
    about the geographical region for which\nthe returned service list is valid.  Therefore,
    this document\nproposes a ServiceListBoundary to assist the client to not miss
    a\nchange in available services when moving.\n\t </p>\n      "
