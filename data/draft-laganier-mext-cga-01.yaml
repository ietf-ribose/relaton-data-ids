abstract:
  content: "<p>The standard RFC 3775 mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updatessent
    by a Mobile Node to its Home Agent relies on the use of a pairof unidirectional
    IPsec security associations between these twonodes. The standard mechanism to
    secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updatessent by a Mobile Node to one of its Correspondent
    Nodes relies on theuse of a return routability test that involves the Correspondent
    Nodeverifying reachability of the Mobile Node at both its Home Addressand its
    Care-of Address. The mechanism also requires thecorrespondent node to send keying
    material to both of theseaddresses.RFC 4866 specifies a standard track mecanism
    that allows a MobileNode that has configured a Cryptographically Generated Address
    (RFC3972) as its Home Address to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates sentits Correspondent
    Nodes based on the properties of itsCryptographically Generated Addresses. Note
    that CryptographicallyGenerated Addresses have also been used to counter similar
    securityissues in the context of SHIM6 (RFC 5533) and Secure NeighborDiscovery
    (RFC 3971.)This memo proposes a mechanism that would let a Mobile Node use asimilar
    mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates its sent toits Home Agent with
    a similar technique based on the use ofCryptographically Generated Addresses.</p>"
