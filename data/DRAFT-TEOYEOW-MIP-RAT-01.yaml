abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a protocol that provides IP reachability
    for\n   mobile users. Like IP Mobility Support, RFC 2002, each mobile node is\n
    \  accessible by its home address, regardless of its current location in\n   the
    Internet. When away from home, the mobile node acquires a care-of\n   address
    indicating its current location. It registers the care-of\n   address with a registration
    server (RS). The RS setups a reverse\n   twice network address translation (RAT)
    table on a RAT device. The\n   RAT device transparently routes datagrams destined
    for the mobile\n   node's home address to the care-of address by reverse twice
    network\n   address translation. The protocol requirements for the mobile node
    is\n   minimal. End-users can have mobility support easily as registration\n   is
    done using widely available applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
