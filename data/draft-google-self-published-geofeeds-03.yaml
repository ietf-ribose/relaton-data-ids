abstract:
- content: '<p>This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish
    a mapping of IP address prefixes to simplified geolocation information, colloquially
    termed a geolocation "feed". Interested parties can poll and parse these feeds
    to update or merge with other geolocation data sources and procedures. This format
    intentionally only allows specifying coarse level location. Some technical organizations
    operating networks that move from one conference location to the next have already
    experimentally published small geolocation feeds. At least one consumer (Google)
    has incorporated these ad hoc feeds into a geolocation data pipeline, and is using
    it to allow ISPs to inform them where the prefixes live. [RFC Ed - Please remove
    publication: The IETF Meeting network currently publishes a feed in this format
    at: https://noc.ietf.org/geo/google.csv -- this has significantly cut down on
    the number of "Gah! Why does the network believe I''m in Montreal, that was last
    meeting! How am I supposed to find a pub?!" complaints. A number of other meeting
    networks, including RIPE and ICANN publish this information as well, see below.
    ] [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background information,
    answers to frequently asked questions, general musings, etc. They will be removed
    before publication.] [ This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/google/self-published-geo
    . The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available
    here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]</p>'
