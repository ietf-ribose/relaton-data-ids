abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In a SIP network, call and session state resides in the user agents\nat
    the edge of the network. These user agents can be elements such as\ngateways,
    conferencing servers, and media servers whose availability\nis important for service
    delivery. In order to achieve fault\ntolerance for these user agents, this state
    must somehow be\nreplicated to backup servers. Traditionally, replication is done\nthrough
    direct memory copies between a primary and its backup.\nHowever, the soft-state
    nature of SIP re-INVITEs means that an\nalternate mechanism for call state replication
    is possible. This\ndocument proposes mechanisms for reconstituting call state
    in a UA\nthrough triggered re-INVITEs from a peer.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
