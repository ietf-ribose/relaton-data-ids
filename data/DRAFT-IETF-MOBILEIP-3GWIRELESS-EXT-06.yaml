abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines extensions to the Mobile IP protocol [1]
    to\nallow mobility management for the interface between a radio network\nand a
    packet data network in the third generation cdma2000 network.\nMobile IP requires
    link layer connectivity between the Mobile Node\nand the Foreign Agent. This draft
    proposes a protocol for achieving\nthis when the physical layer terminating at
    a point distant from the\nFA. In particular, this protocol applies to cdma2000
    networks where\nthe physical layer terminates at a Radio Network Node (RNN) and
    the\nFA resides inside a separate Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN). The\nPDSN is
    responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating\nthe link layer to
    the Mobile Node. A RNN is responsible for relaying\nthe link layer protocol between
    a Mobile Node and its corresponding\nPDSN.\nThe interface between the RNN and
    the PDSN is called the RP\ninterface. This interface requires mobility management
    for handling\nhandoff from one RNN to another without interrupting end to end\ncommunication.
    It also requires the support of the link layer\nprotocol encapsulation.\n\t </p>\n
