abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a rate adaptation framework for conversational\n
    \  video services.  The solution conforms to the packet conservation\n   principle
    and uses a hybrid loss and delay based congestion control\n   algorithm.  The
    framework is evaluated over both simulated bottleneck\n   scenarios as well as
    in a LTE (Long Term Evolution) system simulator\n   and is shown to achieve both
    low latency and high video throughput in\n   these scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
