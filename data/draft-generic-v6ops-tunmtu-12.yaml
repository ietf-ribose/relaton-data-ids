abstract:
- content: <p>The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for popular IP-in-IP tunnels is
    currently recommended to be set to 1500 (or less) minus the length of the encapsulation
    headers when static MTU determination is used. This requires the tunnel ingress
    to either fragment any IP packet larger than the MTU or drop the packet and return
    an ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB) message. Concerns for operational issues with Path
    MTU Discovery (PMTUD) point to the possibility of MTU-related black holes when
    a packet is dropped due to an MTU restriction. The current "Internet cell size"
    is effectively 1500 bytes (i.e., the minimum MTU configured by the vast majority
    of links in the Internet) and should therefore also be the minimum MTU assigned
    to tunnels, but this has proven to be problematic in common operational practice.
    This document therefore discusses operational considerations for tunnel fragmentation
    and reassembly necessary to accommodate this Internet cell size.</p>
