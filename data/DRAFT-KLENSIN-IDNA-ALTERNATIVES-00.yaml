abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Internet protocol for internationalized domain names (IDNs)
    is\ndocumented in RFC 3490 and associated documents and commonly known as\nIDNA.
    \ While that protocol was being developed (and more recently),\nthere were a number
    of alternate proposals and suggestions for\ndifferent ways to do IDNs.  IDNA was
    favored over those alternatives,\nbut variations on them seem to keep reappearing
    with the suggestion\nthat they are novel ideas.  This memo describes some of those\nsuggested
    alternatives and summarizes the reasons why they were not\nfavored over IDNA.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
