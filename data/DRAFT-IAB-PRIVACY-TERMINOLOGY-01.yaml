abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Privacy is a concept that has been debated and argued throughout
    the\n   last few millennia.  Its most striking feature is the difficulty that\n
    \  disparate parties encounter when they attempt to precisely define it.\n   In
    order to discuss privacy in a meaningful way, a tightly defined\n   context is
    necessary.  The specific context of privacy used within\n   this document is that
    of personal data in Internet protocols.\n   Personal data is any information relating
    to a data subject, where a\n   data subject is an identified natural person or
    a natural person who\n   can be identified, directly or indirectly.\n\n   A lot
    of work within the IETF involves defining protocols that can\n   potentially transport
    (either explicitly or implicitly) personal\n   data.  This document aims to establish
    a consistent lexicon around\n   privacy for IETF contributors to use when discussing
    privacy\n   considerations within their work.\n\n   Note: This document is discussed
    at\n   https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-privacy\n\n\t </p>\n      "
