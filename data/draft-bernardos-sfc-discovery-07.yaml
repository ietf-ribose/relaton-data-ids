abstract:
- content: <p>Service function chaining (SFC) allows the instantiation of an ordered
    set of service functions and subsequent "steering" of traffic through them. Service
    functions provide an specific treatment of received packets, therefore they need
    to be known so they can be used in a given service composition via SFC. This document
    discusses the need for service function discovery mechanisms and propose some
    solutions for sfc-aware nodes to discover available service functions in fog environments.</p>
