abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Protocol mechanisms for fast mobile multicast in IPv6 based on
    multicast\nlistening context transfer are proposed. \nThe focus is the context
    transfer for mobile multicast listeners using\nMulticast Listener Discovery protocol
    Version 2 (MLDv2).\nMulticast context transfer block and operational considerations
    for\noptimised multicast context transfer based on Fast Handovers for Mobile\nIPv6
    and Candidate Access Router Discovery are described.  \nThe requirements for MLDv2
    context extension and operation at access\nrouters to support multicast context
    transfer for mobile IPv6 are\nspecified. \nInteractions of MLDv2 with Protocol
    Independent Multicast Sparse Mode\n(PIM-SM) for multicast routing state update
    based on multicast\nlistening context transfer are overviewed.\nOperational considerations
    for MLDv2 and PIM-SM to support multicast\nreceiver and source mobility based
    on context transfer are discussed.\nComparison with other multicast protocol proposals
    for Mobile IPv6\n(MIPv6) is given. \n\t </p>\n      "
