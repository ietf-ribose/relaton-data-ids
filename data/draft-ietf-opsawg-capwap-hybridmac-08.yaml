abstract:
- content: "<p>The Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol
    binding for IEEE 802.11 defines two Medium Access Control (MAC) modes for IEEE
    802.11 Wireless Transmission Points (WTPs): Split and Local MAC. In the Split
    MAC mode, the partitioning of encryption/decryption functions is not clearly defined.
    In the Split MAC mode description, IEEE 802.11 encryption is specified as located
    in either the Access Controller (AC) or the WTP, with no clear way for the AC
    to inform the WTP of where the encryption functionality should be located. This
    leads to interoperability issues, especially when the AC and WTP come from different
    vendors. To prevent interoperability issues, this specification defines an IEEE
    802.11 MAC Profile message element in which each profile specifies an unambiguous
    division of encryption functionality between the WTP and AC.</p>"
