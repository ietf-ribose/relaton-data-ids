abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) Data
    Item that is used to support traffic classification. Traffic classification information
    is used to identify traffic flows based on frame/packet content such as destination
    address. The Data Item is defined in an extensible and reusable fashion. Its use
    will be mandated in other documents defining specific DLEP extensions. This document
    also introduces DLEP Sub-Data Items, and Sub-Data Items are defined to support
    DiffServ and Ethernet traffic classification.</p>"
