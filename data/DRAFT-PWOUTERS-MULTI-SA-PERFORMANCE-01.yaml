abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines two Notification Payloads for the Internet
    Key\n   Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2): NUM_QUEUES and QUEUE_INFO.\n   These
    payloads add support for indicating that the negotiating of\n   multiple identical
    Child SAs are to be used to optimize performance\n   based on the number of queues
    or CPUs, or to create multiple Child\n   SAs for different Quality of Service
    (QoS) levels.  It indicates that\n   a newer idetnical Child SA should not be
    interpreted as a replacement\n   Child SA.\n\n   Using multiple identical Child
    Sa's has the benefit that each stream\n   has its own Sequence Number, ensuring
    that CPU's don't have to\n   synchronize their crypto state or disable their packet
    replay\n   detection.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
