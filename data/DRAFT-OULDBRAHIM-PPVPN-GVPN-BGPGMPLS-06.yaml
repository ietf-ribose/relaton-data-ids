abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a suite of port-based Provider-provisioned
    \n        VPN services called Generalized VPNs (GVPNs) that uses BGP as a \n        VPN
    auto-discovery and GMPLS as a signaling mechanism. GVPN \n        services are
    \"generalized\" as the interfaces on the customer’s \n        and provider ports
    could be any of the interfaces supported by \n        Generalized MPLS (GMPLS).
    GVPN services outlined in this \n        document are: (1) a port-based Generalized
    Virtual Private Wire \n        (GVPW) where the basic unit of service is a Label
    Switched Path\n\n        (LSP) between a pair of customer’s ports within a given
    VPN \n        port-topology. (2) a Generalized Virtual Private Cross-connect \n
    \       (GVPXC) service where the service provider network appears to \n        the
    customer network as a GMPLS-enabled Virtual Private node. A \n        GVPXC service
    provides flexible traffic engineering on the \n        client network and eliminates
    the need for n square routing \n        peering between CEs. Since GVPNs uses
    GMPLS as the signaling \n        mechanism, and since GMPLS applies to both TDM
    and Optical \n        interfaces, it results that GVPN services include Optical/TDM
    \n        VPNs (though they need not be restricted to).\n\t </p>\n      "
