abstract:
- content: "<p>The PKIX certificate format, and many associated formats, are expressed
    using ASN.1. The current ASN.1 modules conform to the 1988 version of ASN.1. This
    document updates those ASN.1 modules to conform to the 2002 version of ASN.1.
    There are no bits-on-the-wire changes to any of the formats; this is simply a
    change to the syntax.</p>"
