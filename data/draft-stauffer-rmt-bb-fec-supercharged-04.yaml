abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a fully-specified FEC scheme for the Supercharged
    forward error correction code. Supercharged codes are designed for use on the
    erasure channel. Coding for the erasure channel commonly arises for data transmission
    over the internet, where lower layers either successfully deliver packets or fail
    to deliver them. Coding is required to insure that data is not lost, even if packets
    are lost at the lower layers. Error free reception is important for multimedia
    applications, such as streaming, where it may not be possible to correct an error
    in time by any other means. Coding insures that lost packets can be recovered.</p>"
