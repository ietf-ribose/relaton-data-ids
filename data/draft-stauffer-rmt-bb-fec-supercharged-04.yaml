abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a fully-specified FEC scheme for theSupercharged
    forward error correction code. Supercharged codes aredesigned for use on the erasure
    channel. Coding for the erasurechannel commonly arises for data transmission over
    the internet, wherelower layers either successfully deliver packets or fail to
    deliverthem. Coding is required to insure that data is not lost, even ifpackets
    are lost at the lower layers. Error free reception isimportant for multimedia
    applications, such as streaming, where it maynot be possible to correct an error
    in time by any other means. Codinginsures that lost packets can be recovered.</p>"
