abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification provides a way to request timely completion
    for\nInternet mail delivery, for services such as facsimile and voice\nmessaging.
    \ Traditional Internet mail uses a _postal_ mail model,\nwith normal delivery
    having an indeterminate gap between delivery\ninto a mailbox and processing by
    the recipient.  Timely completion\nadds a timelines service feature and extends
    delivery processing\nall the way to the recipient.  This specification provides
    a\ndeterministic service quality response, while preserving most of\nthe traditional
    roles and responsibilities of the agents involved\nin email transfers.\n\n\t </p>\n
