abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an attack model and discusses threats based on
    the system design presented in [I-D.ietf-trans-rfc6962-bis]. It analyzes potential
    vulnerabilities associated with that design, and considers compromises of system
    elements and malicious behavior by such elements. It does not consider implementation
    vulnerabilities, including ones that might enable denial of service attacks against
    these elements.</p>"
