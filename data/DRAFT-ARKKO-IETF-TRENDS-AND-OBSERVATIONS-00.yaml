abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   While most of the work in the IETF is technical, the IETF should
    and\n   does regularly examine itself, including its processes and goals, to\n
    \  determine if the technical community is truly serving the larger\n   network
    engineering community effectively.  Changes in this area tend\n   to be incremental,
    as is fitting for an organization with decades of\n   experience and history in
    developing and managing the process of\n   building technical specifications.\n\n
    \  The rapid and ongoing changes in the world have recently caused a\n   number
    of IETF participants to examine the current processes and\n   operation of the
    IETF, particularly in the context of the culture of\n   the IETF.  This memo discusses
    some cultural and global trends in\n   relation to the IETF's operating environment,
    how these trends might\n   affect the operation of the IETF, and notes some topics
    for further\n   exploration.\n\n   Writing this memo has been inspired by involvement
    in various\n   decisions that the IETF leadership has to take part in, often wishing\n
    \  to be able to draw more on understanding trends and their impact on\n   the
    IETF.\n\n   This memo is also input for discussion that the IETF community should\n
    \  have.\n\n   The memo has no particular official standing, nor does it claim
    to\n   represent more than the authors' thinking at the time of writing.\n   There
    is no intent on the part of the authors for this to be\n   published as a RFC.
    \ Please direct discussion about this topic to the\n   ietf@ietf.org mailing list.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
