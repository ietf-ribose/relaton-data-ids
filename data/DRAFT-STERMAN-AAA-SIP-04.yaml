abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Several protocols borrow the authentication mechanisms from
    the\n   Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP.  This document specifies an\n   extension
    to RADIUS that allows a RADIUS client in an HTTP-style\n   server, upon reception
    of a request, retrieve and compute Digest\n   authentication information from
    a RADIUS server.  Additionally, a\n   scenario describing  the authentication
    of a user emitting an\n   HTTP-style request is provided.\n\t </p>\n      "
