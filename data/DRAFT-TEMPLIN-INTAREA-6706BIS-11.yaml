abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operation of IP over tunnel virtual
    links\n   using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO).  Nodes attached\n
    \  to AERO links can exchange packets via trusted intermediate routers\n   that
    provide forwarding services to reach off-link destinations and\n   route optimization
    services for improved performance.  AERO provides\n   an IPv6 link-local address
    format that supports operation of the IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol
    and links ND to IP forwarding.\n   Prefix delegation services are employed to
    manage the routing system.\n   Dynamic link selection, mobility management, quality
    of service (QoS)\n   signaling and route optimization are naturally supported
    through\n   dynamic neighbor cache updates.  AERO is a widely-applicable\n   tunneling
    solution especially well-suited to aviation services,\n   mobile Virtual Private
    Networks (VPNs) and other applications as\n   described in this document.\n\n\t
