abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Capacity planning is the continuous art of forecasting traffic\nload
    and failures to evolve the network topology, its capacity,\nand its routing to
    meet a defined Service-Level Agreement (SLA).\nThis document takes a holistic
    view of network capacity planning\nand identifies the role of traffic accounting
    in network\noperation and capacity planning, without creating any additional\nstates
    in the SR fabric.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
