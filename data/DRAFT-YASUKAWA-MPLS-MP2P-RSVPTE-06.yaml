abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) uses\nResource
    Reservation Protocol traffic engineering extensions\n(RSVP-TE) as the signaling
    protocol to establish Label Switched Paths\n(LSPs). Although the Resource Reservation
    Protocol (RSVP) on which\nRSVP-TE is built supports the convergence of traffic
    flows toward a\ncommon destination, this concept has not been exploited in MPLS-TE\nwhich
    has been limited to point-to-point (P2P) and\npoint-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.\n\nThis
    document describes extensions to RSVP-TE procedures and protocol\nelements to
    support multipoint-to-point (MP2P) LSPs.\n\t </p>\n      "
