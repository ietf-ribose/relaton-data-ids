abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Web servers and the entities that operate them have long had theability
    to track user agents as they access resources hosted acrossdifferent web domains.
    Concern over the privacy implications of suchtracking has prompted recent work
    on a number of solutions that aimto provide a universal opt-out mechanism for
    web tracking that can beeffectuated through a simple binary choice presented to
    users.This document provides an overview of the following mechanisms:permanent
    opt-out cookies, cookie blocking, domain blocking, a \"DoNot Track\" (DNT) HTTP
    header, and a Do Not Track Document ObjectModel (DOM) property. The aim of this
    document is to describe eachapproach, the pros and cons of each, and areas where
    standardizationmay be necessary should each approach be further pursued, withoutmaking
    recommendations about which approach or approaches should beadopted.</p>"
