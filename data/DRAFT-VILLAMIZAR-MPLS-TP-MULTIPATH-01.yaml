abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques
    and\nmany MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in\nvery
    high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core\nnetworks.  MPLS-TP
    has discouraged the use of multipath techniques.\nSome degradation of MPLS-TP
    OAM performance cannot be avoided when\noperating over current high bandwidth
    multipath implementations.\n\nThe tradeoffs involved in using multipath techniques
    with MPLS and\nMPLS-TP are described.  Requirements are discussed which enable
    full\nMPLS-TP compliant LSP including full OAM capability to be carried\nover
    MPLS LSP which are traversing multipath links.  Other means of\nsupporting MPLS-TP
    coexisting with MPLS and multipath are discussed.\n\t </p>\n      "
