abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   FSP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol that
    provides\n   mobility and multihoming support by introducing the concept of 'upper\n
    \  layer thread ID', which is associated with some shared secret that is\n   applied
    with some secure hash or authenticated encryption algorithm\n   to protect authenticity
    of the origin of the FSP packets.  It is able\n   to provide following services
    to the upper layer application:\n\n   o  Stream-oriented send-receive with native
    message boundary\n   o  Ubiquitous authenticated encryption\n   o  0-RTT multiplication
    of connections\n   o  On-the-wire compression\n\n\t </p>\n      "
