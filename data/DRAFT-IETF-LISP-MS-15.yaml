abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes the Maping Service for the Locator Identifier\n
    \  Separation Protocol (LISP), implemented by two new types of LISP-\n   speaking
    devices, the LISP Map Resolver and LISP Map Server, that\n   provides a simplified
    \"front end\" to for one or more Endpoint ID to\n   Routing Locator mapping databases.\n\n
    \  By using this service interface and communicating with Map Resolvers\n   and
    Map Servers, LISP Ingress Tunnel Routers and Egress Tunnel\n   Routers, are not
    dependent on the details of mapping database\n   systems, which facilitates experimentation
    with different database\n   designs.  Since these devices implement the \"edge\"
    of the LISP\n   infrastructure, connect directly to LISP-capable Internet end
    sites,\n   and comprise the bulk of LISP-speaking devices, reducing their\n   implementation
    and operational complexity should also reduce the\n   overall cost and effort
    of deploying LISP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
