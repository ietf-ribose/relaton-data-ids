abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is intended to provide operational guidelines
    for\n   datacenter operators planning to deploy IPv6 in their\n   infrastructures.
    \ It aims to offer a reference framework for\n   evaluating different products
    and architectures, and therefore it is\n   also addressed to manufacturers and
    solution providers, so they can\n   use it to gauge their solutions.  We believe
    this will translate in a\n   smoother and faster transition of these infrastuctures
    into IPv6\n\n   The document focuses on the DC infrastructure itself, its operation,\n
    \  and the aspects related to DC interconnection through IPv6.  It does\n   not
    consider the particular mechanisms for making Internet services\n   provided by
    applications hosted in the DC available through IPv6\n   beyond the specific aspects
    related to how their deployment on the DC\n   infrastructure.\n\n   Apart from
    facilitating the transition to IPv6, the mechanisms\n   outlined here are intended
    to make this transition as transparent as\n   possible (if not completely transparent)
    to applications and services\n   running on the DC infrastructure, as well as
    to take advantage of\n   IPv6 features to simplify DC operations, internally and
    across the\n   Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
