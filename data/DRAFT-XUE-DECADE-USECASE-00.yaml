abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The objective of DECADE is to provide storage access to Content\n
    \  Distribution Applications to improve their efficiency and reduce load\n   on
    the network infrastructure.\n\n   In this document, we outline several potential
    use cases (not\n   technical solutions) for DECADE.  These use cases may provide\n
    \  motivations for DECADE.  Interactions within DECADE and between\n   DECADE
    Servers and DECADE Clients are described at an abstract level\n   so as to not
    constrain future protocol development.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
