abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a mechanism to run BFD on Link Aggregation\n
    \  Group (LAG) interfaces.  It does so by running an independent\n   Asynchronous
    mode BFD session on every LAG member link.\n\n   This mechanism allows the verification
    of member link continuity,\n   either in combination with, or in absence of, LACP.
    \ It provides a\n   shorter detection time than what LACP offers.  The continuity
    check\n   can also cover elements of layer 3 bidirectional forwarding.\n\n   This
    mechanism utilizes a well-known UDP port distinct from that of\n   single-hop
    BFD over IP.  This new UDP port removes the ambiguity of\n   BFD over LAG packets
    from BFD over single-hop IP.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
