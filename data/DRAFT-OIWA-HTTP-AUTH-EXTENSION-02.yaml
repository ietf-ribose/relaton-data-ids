abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a few extensions of HTTP authentication\n
    \  framework for interactive clients.  Recently, fundamental features of\n   HTTP-level
    authentication is not enough for complex requirements of\n   various Web-based
    applications.  This makes these applications to\n   implement their own authentication
    frameworks using HTML Forms and\n   other means, which becomes one of the hurdles
    against introducing\n   secure authentication mechanisms handled jointly by servers
    and user-\n   agent clients.  The extended framework fills gaps between Web\n
    \  application requirements and HTTP authentication provisions to solve\n   the
    above problems, while maintaining compatibility against existing\n   Web and non-Web
    uses of HTTP authentications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
