abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Domain Name System (DNS) was designed to return matching
    records\n   efficiently for queries for data that is relatively static.  When\n
    \  those records change frequently, DNS is still efficient at returning\n   the
    updated results when polled.  But there exists no mechanism\n   for a client to
    be asynchronously notified when these changes occur.\n   This document defines
    a mechanism for a client to be notified\n   of such changes to DNS records, called
    DNS Push Notifications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
