abstract:
  content: <p>This Internet Draft discusses a proposed extension to the set ofInterface
    Identifier construction methods for 802 networks. Thepurpose of this is to allow
    autoconf RA announcments of prefix lengthother than 64 bits. It is intended to
    be fully backward compatiblefor /64 announcements. Instead of having one Interface
    Identifierconstruction method for all purposes, this adds an alternate methodwhich
    is only used for autoconf, and only if the prefix length is not/64. No other IPv6
    methods or protocols require modification.However, without modification, use of
    prefixes other than /64 likelywon't support many IPv6 enhanced functions.The ultimate
    goal it providing enough bits between the top levelallocation by Regional Internet
    Registristry (RIR) and the smallestautoconfiguration allocation, to allow both
    external aggregation byISPs into one prefix, as well as internal hierarchical
    aggregation tosupport a variety of ISP topologies and practices. Current policiesare
    driven from below by the current 64 bit Interface Identifier.Only by relaxing
    this to 48 bits for such technologies as 802(Ethernet), does the number of bits
    available reach a level deemed"sufficient".Author's NoteThis Internet Draft is
    intended to result in this draft or a relateddraft(s) being placed on the Standards
    Track for 6man.The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted
    as described in [5].</p>
