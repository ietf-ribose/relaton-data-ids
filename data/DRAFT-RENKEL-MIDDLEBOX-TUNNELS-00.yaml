abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet Draft compares Network Address Translation (NAT)
    and\nRealm Specific IP (RSIP) tunnels, and the advantages and\ndisadvantages of
    each. It then shows how the advantages can be\ncombined by implementing NAT as
    a tunnel in hosts, while\nminimizing the disadvantages. Based on the advantages
    of middlebox\ntunnels in general and implementing NAT as a middlebox tunnel in\nparticular,
    it then recommends that the Middlebox Communications\narchitecture protocol (MIDCOM)
    be amended to support tunnels\nbetween hosts and middleboxes.\nThis .txt version
    of this internet draft is identical to the\nPostScript version (draft-renkel-middlebox-tunnels-00.ps)
    except\nthat the figures from the PostScript version have been deleted.\nPlease
    refer to the PostScript version for these figures.\n\t </p>\n      "
