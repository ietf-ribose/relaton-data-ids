abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies Circuit Breaker Assisted Congestion
    Control\n   (CBACC), which provides bandwidth information from senders to\n   intermediate
    network nodes to enable good decisions for fast-trip\n   Network Transport Circuit
    Breaker activity\n   ([I-D.ietf-tsvwg-circuit-breaker]) when necessary for network
    health.\n   CBACC is specifically designed to support protocols using IP\n   multicast,
    particularly as a supplement to receiver-driven congestion\n   control protocols
    to help affected networks rapidly detect and\n   mitigate the impact of scenarios
    in which a network is oversubscribed\n   to flows which are not responsive to
    congestion.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
