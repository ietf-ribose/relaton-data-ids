abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   During the process of creating a peer-to-peer connection, ICE\n
    \  implementations can encounter situations where they have no candidate\n   pairs
    to check, and, as a result, conclude that ICE processing has\n   failed.  However,
    because additional candidate pairs can be\n   discovered during ICE processing,
    declaring failure at this point may\n   be premature.  This document discusses
    when these situations can\n   occur and proposes a way to avoid premature failure.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
