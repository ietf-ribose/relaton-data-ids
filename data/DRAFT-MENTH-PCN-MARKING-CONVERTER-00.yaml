abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes an algorithm that converts packet markings
    of\na stream that was excess-marked based on a lower-rate into packet\nmarkings
    that correspond to a stream that was excess-marked based on\na higher-rate.  It
    may be applied in the PCN context to convert\nmarked admissible-rate-overload
    into marked supportable-rate-\noverload.  This allows to perform marked flow termination
    when\npackets are excess-marked based on the admissible rate only.\n\t </p>\n
