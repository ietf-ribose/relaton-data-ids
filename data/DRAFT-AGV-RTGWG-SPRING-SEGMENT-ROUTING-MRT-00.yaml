abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>      This document presents a Fast Reroute (FRR) approach aimed
    at\n   providing link and node protection of node and adjacency segments\n   within
    the Segment Routing (SR) framework.  This FRR behavior builds\n   on Maximally
    Redundant Trees (MRT) FRR algorithm [I-D.atlas-rtgwg-\n   mrt-mc-arch].\n\n      Fast-Reroute
    with Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT-FRR) using\n   Segment routing is a technology
    that gives link-protection and node-\n   protection with 100% coverage in any
    network topology that is still\n   connected after the failure. MRT is computational
    efficient. For any\n   router in the network, the MRT computation is less than
    the LFA\n   computation for a node with three or more neighbors in SR domain (Ex:\n
    \  Topology Independent Fast Reroute).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
