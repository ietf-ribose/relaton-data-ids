abstract:
  content: '<p>The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in RFC 8610,
    provides "control operators" as its main language extension point. The present
    document defines a number of control operators that were not yet ready at the
    time RFC 8610 was completed: .plus, .cat and .det for the construction of constants,
    .abnf/.abnfb for including ABNF (RFC 5234/RFC 7405) in CDDL specifications, and
    .feature for indicating the use of a non-basic feature in an instance.</p>'
