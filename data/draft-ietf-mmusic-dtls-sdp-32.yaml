abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer
    procedures for negotiating and establishing a Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) association. The document also defines the criteria for when a new DTLS
    association must be established. The document updates RFCs 5763 and 7345 by replacing
    common SDP offer/answer procedures with a reference to this specification. This
    document defines a new SDP media-level attribute, "tls-id". This document also
    defines how the "tls-id" attribute can be used for negotiating and establishing
    a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection, in conjunction with the procedures
    in RFCs 4145 and 8122.</p>
