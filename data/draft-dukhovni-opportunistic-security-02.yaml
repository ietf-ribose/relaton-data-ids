abstract:
- content: <p>This memo defines the term "opportunistic security". In contrast to
    the established approach of employing protection against both passive and active
    attacks or else (frequently) no protection at all, opportunistic security strives
    to deliver at least some protection most of the time. The primary goal is therefore
    broad interoperability, with security policy tailored to the capabilities of peer
    systems.</p>
