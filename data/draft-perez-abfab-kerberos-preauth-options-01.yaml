abstract:
- content: <p>Kerberos is widely used for authentication within organisations. It
    is not, however, commonly used for authentication between domains or realms ("cross-realm
    operation"). Abfab is a new architecture, based on the AAA framework, that provides
    a mechanism for federating authentication between realms. AAA protocols are already
    widely used for federating authentication for network access scenarios today.
    It has been proposed that Abfab could be used to provide a mechanism yielding
    cross-realm functionality for Kerberos. This document discusses two alternative
    models with the aim of informing and facilitating discussion.</p>
