abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   According to the ring protection Requirements in RFC 5654,\n
    \  Requirement 93 : When a network is constructed from interconnected\n   rings,
    MPLS-TP MUST support recovery mechanisms that protect user\n   data that traverses
    more than one ring.  This includes the\n   possibility of failure of the ring-interconnect
    nodes and links,so\n   this document will describle all kinds of interconnected
    rings\n   Scenario and a few possible solutions for recovery the failure of the\n
    \  ring-interconnect nodes and Links. .\n\n\n   This document is a product of
    a joint Internet Task Force(IETF) /\n   International Telecommunications Union
    Telecommunications\n   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    Transport\n   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n
    \  capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as\n   defined
    by the ITU-T.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
