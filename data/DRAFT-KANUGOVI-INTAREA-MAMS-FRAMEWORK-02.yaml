abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In multiconnectivity scenarios the end-user devices can\n   simultaneously
    connect to multiple networks based on different access\n   technologies and network
    architectures like WiFi, LTE, DSL.  Both the\n   quality of experience of the
    users and the overall network\n   utilization and efficiency may be improved through
    a smart selection\n   and combination of access and core network paths that can
    dynamically\n   adapt to changing network conditions.  The document presents a\n
    \  unified problem statement and introduces a solution for managing\n   multiconnectivity.
    \ The solution has been developed based on the\n   authors' experience in multiple
    standards bodies including the IETF\n   and 3GPP and is not an Internet Standard.
    \ It describes the\n   requirements, solution principles and the architectural
    framework\n   that ensures best performance and can be easily implemented in a
    wide\n   variety of multiconnectivity deployments.  It specifies the the\n   protocol
    multi-access management to 1) flexibly select the best\n   combination of access
    and core network paths for uplink and downlink,\n   as well as 2) determining
    the user plane treatment and traffic\n   distribution over the selected links
    ensuring better network\n   efficiency and enhanced application performance.\n\n\t
