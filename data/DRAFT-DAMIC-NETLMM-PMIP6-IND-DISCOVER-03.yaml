abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility protocol that enabes\nmobility
    management for an IP host as it moves across different\npoints of attachment within
    the mobility domain.  An IP host whose\nmobility is being managed by the network
    is unaware of the access\nnetworks capability to do mobility management on its
    behalf using\nProxy Mobile IPv6.  This draft proposes mechanisms by which the
    host\nis informed of Proxy Mobile IPv6 support, as well as how to actively\ndiscover
    such capability in the network that host attaches to.  The\nability of the host
    to discover or be aware of Proxy Mobile IPv6\nsupport in the access network enables
    better decision making in terms\nof the network selection and attach procedure
    as well as the choice\nof mobility management.\n\t </p>\n      "
