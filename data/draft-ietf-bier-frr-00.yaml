abstract:
- content: "<p>BIER is a scalable multicast overlay [RFC8279] that utilizes a routing
    underlay, e.g., IP, to build up its Bit Index Forwarding Tables (BIFTs). This
    document proposes Fast Reroute for BIER (BIER- FRR). It protects BIER traffic
    after detecting the failure of a link or node in the core of a BIER domain until
    affected BIFT entries are recomputed after reconvergence of the routing underlay.
    BIER-FRR is applied locally at the point of local repair (PLR) and does not introduce
    any per-flow state. The document specifies nomenclature for BIER-FRR and gives
    examples for its integration in BIER forwarding. Furthermore, it presents operation
    modes for BIER-FRR. Link and node protection may be chosen as protection level.
    Moreover, the backup strategies tunnel-based BIER-FRR and LFA-based BIER-FRR are
    defined and compared.</p>"
