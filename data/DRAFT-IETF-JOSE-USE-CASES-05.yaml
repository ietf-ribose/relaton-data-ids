abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many Internet applications have a need for object-based security\n
    \  mechanisms in addition to security mechanisms at the network layer or\n   transport
    layer.  In the past, the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)\n   has provided a
    binary secure object format based on ASN.1.  Over\n   time, the use of binary
    object encodings such as ASN.1 has been\n   overtaken by text-based encodings,
    for example JavaScript Object\n   Notation.  This document defines a set of use
    cases and requirements\n   for a secure object format encoded using JavaScript
    Object Notation\n   (JSON), drawn from a variety of application security mechanisms\n
    \  currently in development.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
