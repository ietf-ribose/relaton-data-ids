abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the implementation, named LLCPS, of
    the TLS\n   protocol over the NFC (Near Field Communication) LLCP layer. The NFC\n
    \  peer to peer (P2P) protocol may be used by any application that\n   needs communication
    between two devices at very small distances (a\n   few centimeters). LLCPS enforces
    a strong security in NFC P2P\n   exchanges, and may be deployed for many services,
    in the Internet Of\n   Things ecosystem, such as access control or ticketing operations.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
