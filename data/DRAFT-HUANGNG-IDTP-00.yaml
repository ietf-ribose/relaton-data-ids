abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Identifier Tracing Protocol (IDTP) is an application-level\n
    \  protocol for distributed and collaborative information systems. It\n   is a
    generic communication protocol which can be used for many tasks\n   with two types
    of forwarding mechanisms to achieve traceability by\n   using Universal Traceable
    Identifier (UTID) [I-D-UTID] which\n   contains two types of forwarding messages.\n\n
    \  This document provides the specification of IDTP, including syntax,\n   data
    format, and the guidelines for their use, too.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
