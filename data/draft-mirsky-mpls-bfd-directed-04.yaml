abstract:
- content: "<p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is expected to monitor bi-
    directional paths. When a BFD session monitors in its forward direction an explicitly
    routed path there is a need to be able to direct egress BFD peer to use specific
    path as reverse direction of the BFD session.</p>"
