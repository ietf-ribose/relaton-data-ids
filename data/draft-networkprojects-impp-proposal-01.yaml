abstract:
  content: "<p>There is a growing number of people, on the Internet and elsewhere,that
    are interested in knowing when others are available, in order tocommunicate with
    them. A system that provides this information isknown as Presence Service.Instant
    Messaging is the ability to communicate with someone in arapid, conversational
    fashion. This usually involves short textmessages, but it may be extended in different
    ways.This draft is a response to the efforts of the Instant Messaging andPresence
    Protocol (IMPP) group. It describes an architecture andprotocols for Presence
    and Instant Messaging that meet therequirements of [RFC 2779]. This draft covers
    the basic functionalmodules needed to provide Presence and Instant Messaging services.
    Italso provides the semantics for the interactions among this set offunctional
    modules, along with the data format of the informationexchanged.</p>"
