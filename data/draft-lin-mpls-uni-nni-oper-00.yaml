abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents the transitional phases that optical network connection
    operations undergo, providing high-level processes and states of the connection
    operations. A list of potential parameters associated with the connection operations
    signaling protocol is provided. The list of parameters is not an exhaustive list;
    it should be used as a basis for more comprehensive parameters for the signaling
    mechanism.</p>"
