abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes to increase the current max window size\n
    \  allowed in TCP.  It describes the current logic that limits the max\n   window
    size and provides a rationale to relax the limitation as well\n   as the negotiation
    mechanism to enable this feature safely.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
