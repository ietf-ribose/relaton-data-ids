abstract:
- content: "<p>WINS Lookup is a system that provides a limited gateway between the
    Domain Name System [RFC 1034] and the Windows Internet Name System [WINS]. Using
    WINS Lookup, a DNS server can resolve A and PTR type queries for names registered
    exclusively in WINS. This document describes the WINS Lookup system and the format
    of the WINS and WINSR resource records.</p>"
