abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the high level architecture for Security\n
    \  Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM).  The architecture\n   identifies
    the components that provide for the collection, storage,\n   dissemination, and
    evaluation of posture information.  This\n   architecture also describes the interfaces
    and associated operations\n   that define the interactions between these components.
    \ This\n   information will inform future engineering work around identifying\n
    \  existing standards for collecting, storing, disseminating, and\n   evaluating
    endpoint posture information.  This architecture will also\n   help in identifying
    standardization gaps that require new engineering\n   effort.\n\n   Security practitioners
    need to request, analyze, and aggregate\n   posture information from disparate
    sources that use differing means\n   to identify endpoints, hardware, software,
    and configurations.  This\n   task is made harder by the large number of different
    protocols and\n   formats needed to bring together all of this information into
    a\n   single view.  This architecture provides a means to automatically\n   gather
    posture data together for standardized dissemination to\n   downstream components.
    \ This allows security practitioners that\n   leverage this architecture to focus
    on managing security problems,\n   not data.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
