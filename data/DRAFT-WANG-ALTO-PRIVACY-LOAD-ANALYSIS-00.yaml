abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to\nprovide
    guidance to applications, which have to select one or several\nhosts from a set
    of candidates, which are able to provide the desired\nresource.  Now the members
    in alto group propose many solutions, such\nas P4P and PROXIDOR.  These solutions
    still have unsolved problems\nregarding privacy and workload.  The privacy and
    load issues are\ncrucial aspects for the benefits of ISP and P2P.This draft is
    to do a\ncomparative study to analyze and compare the privacy and workload of\nseveral
    existing solutions, hence to provide guidance in order to\nimprove, optimize and
    deploy the protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
