abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3261 introduces the concept of adding an S/MIME body to a Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) request or response in order to provide reference integrity
    over its headers. This document provides a more specific mechanism to derive integrity
    and authentication properties from an 'authenticated identity body', a digitally-signed
    SIP message, or message fragment. A standard format for such bodies (known as
    Authenticated Identity Bodies, or AIBs) is given in this document. Some considerations
    for the processing of AIBs by recipients of SIP messages with such bodies are
    also given. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
