abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the environment, problem statement,
    and goals\n   of On-The-Fly (OTF) scheduling, a Layer-3 mechanism for 6TiSCH\n
    \  networks.  The purpose of OTF is to dynamically adapt the aggregate\n   bandwidth,
    i.e., the number of reserved soft cells between neighbor\n   nodes, based on the
    specific application constraints to be satisfied.\n   When using OTF, softcell
    reservation is distributed: through the 6top\n   interface, neighbor nodes negotiate
    the cell(s) to be (re)allocated/\n   deleted, with no intervention needed of a
    centralized entity.  This\n   document aims at defining a module which uses the
    functionalities\n   provided by the 6top sublayer to (i) extract statistics and
    (ii)\n   determine when to reserve/delete soft cells in the schedule.  The\n   exact
    reservation and deletion algorithm, and the number and type of\n   statistics
    to be used in the algorithm are out of scope.  OTF deals\n   only with the number
    of softcells to be reserved/deleted; it is up to\n   6top to select the specific
    soft cells within the TSCH schedule.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
