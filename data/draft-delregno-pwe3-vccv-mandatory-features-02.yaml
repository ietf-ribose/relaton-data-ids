abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) [RFC5085]defines
    several Control Channel (CC) Types for MPLS PW's , none ofwhich are preferred
    or mandatory. As a result, independentimplementations of different subsets of
    the three options haveresulted in interoperability challenges. In RFC5085 the
    CV type ofLSP Ping is made the default for MPLS PW's and ICMP Ping is madeoptional.
    This however, is a recommendation and not a requirementfor implementations which
    can also lead to interoperabilitychallenges.To enable interoperability between
    implementations, this documentdefines a subset of control channels that is considered
    mandatory forVCCV implementation. This will ensure that VCCV remains the valuabletool
    it was designed to be in multi-vendor, multi-implementation andmulti-carrier networks.
    This document also states requirements forthe CV type too.This draft is specific
    to MPLS PW's and not L2TPv3 PW. For theL2TPv3 PW only one CC and CV type are specified
    and the issues raisedin this draft do not arise.</p>"
