abstract:
- content: "<p>To ensure a baseline level of interoperability between WebRTC endpoints,
    a minimum set of required codecs is specified. However, to maximize the possibility
    to establish the session without the need for audio transcoding, it is also recommended
    to include in the offer other suitable audio codecs that are available to the
    browser. This document provides some guidelines on the suitable codecs to be considered
    for WebRTC endpoints to address the most relevant interoperability use cases.</p>"
