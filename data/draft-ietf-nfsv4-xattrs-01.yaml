abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extensions to the NFSv4 protocol which allow
    file extended attributes (hereinafter also referred to as xattrs) to be manipulated
    using NFSv4. An xattr is a file system feature that allows opaque metadata, not
    interpreted by the file system, to be associated with files and directories. Such
    support is present in many modern local file systems. New file attributes are
    proposed to allow clients to query the server for xattr support, and new operations
    to get and set xattrs on file system objects are provided.</p>"
