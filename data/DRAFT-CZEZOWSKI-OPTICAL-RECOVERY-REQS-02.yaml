abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes requirements for control plane-based recovery
    \nfrom data plane failures in pre-OTN networks.  pre-OTN networks are \ntransport
    networks that have a GMPLS-based control plane and various \ntransport plane technologies
    (such as Optical Cross Connects and \nOptical Add/Drop Multiplexers, etc.)  An
    important feature of these \nnetworks is recovery from failures - using either
    a protection or \nrestoration scheme.  Achieving recovery under strict time constraints
    \nis a difficult problem.  Shared mesh-based recovery is especially \ndesirable
    for reducing spare capacity ratios and achieving flexible \nrecovery scenarios.
    \ Following a brief overview and consideration of \nthe requirements, they are
    presented in an itemized list in section \n3.4 of this document.\n\t </p>\n      "
