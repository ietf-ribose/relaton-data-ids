abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a method of representing rules for validating
    identifier labels and alternate representations of those labels using Extensible
    Markup Language (XML). These policies, known as "Label Generation Rulesets" (LGRs),
    are particularly used for the implementation of Internationalized Domain Names
    (IDNs). The rulesets are used to implement and share that aspect of policy defining
    which labels and specific Unicode code points are permitted for registrations,
    which alternative code points are considered variants, and what actions may be
    performed on labels containing those variants.</p>
