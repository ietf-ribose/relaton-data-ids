abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When a Location Information Server receives a request for location\n
    \  information (using the locationRequest message), described in the\n   base
    HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) specification, it uses the\n   source IP
    address of arriving message as a pointer to the location\n   determination process.
    \ This is sufficient in environments where the\n   location of a Device can be
    determined based on its IP address.\n\n   Two additional use cases are addresses
    by this document.  In the\n   first, location configuration requires additional
    or alternative\n   identifiers from the source IP address provided in the request.
    \ In\n   the second, an entity other than the Device requests the location of\n
    \  the Device.\n\n   This document extends the HELD protocol to allow the location
    request\n   message to carry Device identifiers.  Privacy and security\n   considerations
    describe the conditions where requests containing\n   identifiers are permitted.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
