abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This is a first document describing the rational about network\nsupport
    for decision making and execution of handovers.  Starting\nfrom existing technologies
    and considering new trends from mobile\noperators, we draw potential deployment
    scenarios and derive a set of\nassociated functionalities.  These functionalities
    and associated\nassumptions are listed in the document.  Application areas for\nnetwork
    initiated handovers are then illustrated specifying a set of\ngoals and non-goals
    to be addressed in a future version.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
