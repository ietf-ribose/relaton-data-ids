abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   LOOPS (Local Optimizations on Path Segments) aims to provide
    local\n   (not end-to-end but in-network) recovery of lost packets to achieve\n
    \  better data delivery in the presence of losses.\n   [I-D.li-tsvwg-loops-problem-opportunities]
    provides an overview over\n   the problems and optimization opportunities that
    LOOPS could address.\n\n   The present document is a strawman for the set of information
    that\n   would be interchanged in a LOOPS protocol, without already defining a\n
    \  specific data packet format.\n\n   The generic information set needs to be
    mapped to a specific\n   encapsulation protocol to actually run the LOOPS optimizations.
    \ The\n   current version of this document contains sketches of bindings to GUE\n
    \  [I-D.ietf-intarea-gue] and Geneve [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
