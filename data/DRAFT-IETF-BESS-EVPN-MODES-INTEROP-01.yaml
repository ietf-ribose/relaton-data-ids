abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides different functional modes in
    the area\n   of Service Interface, Integrated Route and Bridge (IRB) and IRB Core\n
    \  connectivity. This document specifies how the different EVPN\n   functional
    modes and types can interoperate with each other. This\n   document doesn't aim
    to redefine the existing functional modes but\n   describe how there is interoperability.\n\n\n\n\t
