abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents an approach for organizing YANG models
    in a\n   comprehensive structure that may be used to configure and operate\n   network
    devices.  The structure is itself represented as a YANG\n   model, with all of
    the related component models logically organized\n   in a way that is operationally
    intuitive, but this model is not\n   expected to be implemented.  The identified
    component modules are\n   expected to be defined and implemented on common network
    devices.\n\n   This document also defines two modules that can be used to model
    the\n   logical and virtual resource representations that may be present on a\n
    \  network device.  Examples of common industry terms for logical\n   resource
    representations are Logical Systems or Routers.  Examples of\n   of common industry
    terms for virtual resource representations are\n   Virtual Routing and Forwarding
    (VRF) instances and Virtual Switch\n   Instances (VSIs).\n\n   This document is
    derived from work submitted to the IETF by members\n   of the informal OpenConfig
    working group of network operators and is\n   a product of the Routing Area YANG
    Architecture design team.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
