abstract:
- content: "<p>Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control allows each
    network element (NE) to perform local resource discovery, routing and signaling
    in a distributed manner. On the other hand, with the development of software-defined
    transport networking technology, a set of NEs can be controlled via centralized
    controller hierarchies to address the issue from multi- domain, multi-vendor and
    multi-technology. An example of such centralized architecture is ACTN controller
    hierarchy described in RFC 8453. Instead of competing with each other, both the
    distributed and the centralized control plane have their own advantages, and should
    be complementary in the system. This document describes how the GMPLS distributed
    control plane can interwork with a centralized controller system in a transport
    network.</p>"
