abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A number of methods and tools are available for defining the
    format\n   of messages used for application protocols.  However, many of these\n
    \  methods and tools have been designed for purposes other than message\n   definition,
    and have been adopted on the basis that they are\n   available rather than being
    ideally suited to the task.  This often\n   means that the methods make it difficult
    to get definitions correct,\n   or result in unnecessary complexity and verbosity
    both in the\n   definition and on the wire.\n\n   Lumas - Language for Universal
    Message Abstraction and Specification\n   - has been custom designed for the purpose
    of message definition.  It\n   is thus easy to specify messages in a compact,
    extensible format that\n   is readily machine manipulated to produce a compact
    encoding on the\n   wire.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
