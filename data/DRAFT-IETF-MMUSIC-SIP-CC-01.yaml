abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a set of extensions to SIP which allow
    for\nvarious call control services. Example services include blind\ntransfer,
    transfer with consultation, multi-party calls, bridged\nconferences, and ad-hoc
    conferencing. The services are supported in a\nfully distributed manner, so that
    they can be provided without a\ncentral conference server. However, a SIP proxy
    can act as a\nconference server to provide these services. For the various services\ndescribed
    here, we overview the requirements for the service, and\nspecify the protocol
    functions needed to support it. We then define a\nbasic set of SIP primitives
    which can be used to construct these\nservices, and others.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
