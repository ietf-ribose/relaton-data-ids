abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces a network
    model\n   in which communications can be subject to long delays and/or\n   intermittent
    connectivity.  DTN specifies the use of public-key\n   cryptography to secure
    the confidentiality and integrity of messages\n   in transit.  The use of public-key
    cryptography posits the need for\n   certification of public keys and revocation
    of certificates.  This\n   document formally defines the DTN key management problem
    and then\n   provides a high-level design solution for delay and disruption\n
    \  tolerant distribution and revocation of public-key certificates along\n   with
    relevant design options and recommendations for design choices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
