abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to include trust into the ASTM
    Remote ID\n   specification defined in ASTM F3411 under Broadcast Remote ID (RID).\n
    \  It defines a few message schemes (sent within the Authentication\n   Message)
    that can be used to authenticate past messages sent by a\n   unmanned aircraft
    (UA) and provide proof of UA trustworthiness even\n   in the absence of Internet
    connectivity at the receiving node.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
