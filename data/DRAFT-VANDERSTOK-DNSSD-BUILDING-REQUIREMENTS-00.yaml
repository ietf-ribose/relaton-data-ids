abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The draft describes an interface to the discovery of services
    on a\n   bounded network segment from a building control perspective.\n   Building
    control has special boundary conditions related to: (1)\n   management of devices
    and services, (2) an installation involving\n   stand-alone networks (3) (dis)connecting
    network (from) to Internet\n   without renaming services and devices.  Roaming
    devices are not\n   considered in this version.\n\nNote\n\n   Discussion and suggestions
    for improvement are requested, and should\n   be sent to dnssd@ietf.org.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
