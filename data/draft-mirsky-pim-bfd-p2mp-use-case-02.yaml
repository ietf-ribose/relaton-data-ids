abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the use of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
    (BFD) for multi-point networks to provide nodes that participate in Protocol Independent
    Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) with the sub- second convergence. Optional extension
    to PIM-SM Hello, as specified in RFC 7761, to bootstrap point-to-multipoint BFD
    session. also defined in this document.</p>"
