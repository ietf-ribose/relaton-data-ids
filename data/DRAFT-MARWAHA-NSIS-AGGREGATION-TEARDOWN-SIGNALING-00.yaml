abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     If a Mobile Node communicates with different Corresponding
    Nodes and \n     there exists a common path for these sessions, NSIS allows these
    \n     reservations to be aggregated. However, change of aggregation path \n     caused
    by mobility event creates problems related to the prompt removal \n     of the
    old aggregation state in case Correspondent Nodes are NSIS \n     Initiators,
    \ i.e.  multiple  Correspondent  Nodes  will  send  multiple \n     teardown messages
    for tearing down the same unused aggregated section \n     and may cause problems
    of extra signaling overhead, delay in tearing \n     down, reliability, redundancy
    and extra processing overhead. This draft \n     presents the analysis of these
    problems.\n\t </p>\n      "
