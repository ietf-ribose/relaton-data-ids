abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A novel mobility management approach has been proposed, that\n
    \  leverages routable location-independent identifiers (IDs) and an\n   Information-Centric
    Networking (ICN) communication model integrated\n   in IPv6, also referred to
    as Hybrid ICN (hICN).  In virtue of its\n   anchorless property, we denote this
    approach as hICN-AMM (hICN\n   Anchorless Mobility Management) hereinafter.\n\n
    \  Such approach belongs to the category of pure ID-based mobility\n   management
    schemes whose objective is (i) to overcome the limitations\n   of traditional
    locator-based solutions like Mobile IP, (ii) to remove\n   the need for a global
    mapping system as the one required by locator-\n   identifier separation solutions
    like LISP or ILA.\n\n   ID-based networking as proposed by ICN architectures allows
    to\n   disentangle forwarding operations from changes of network location,\n   hence
    removing tunnels and user plane or control plane anchors.\n\n   This document
    discusses hICN-AMM deployment options and related\n   tradeoffs in terms of cost/benefits.
    \ Particular attention is devoted\n   to the insertion in the recently proposed
    5G Service Based\n   Architecture under study at 3GPP where an hICN-AMM solution
    might\n   present a more efficient alternative to the traditional tunnel-based\n
    \  mobility architecture through GTP-U.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
