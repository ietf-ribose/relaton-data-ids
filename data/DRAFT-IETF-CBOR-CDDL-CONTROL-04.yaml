abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in
    RFC\n   8610, provides \"control operators\" as its main language extension\n
    \  point.\n\n   The present document defines a number of control operators that
    did\n   not make it into RFC 8610: \".plus\", \".cat\" and \".det\" for the\n
    \  construction of constants, \".abnf\"/\".abnfb\" for including ABNF (RFC\n   5234/RFC
    7405) in CDDL specifications, and \".feature\" for indicating\n   the use of a
    non-basic feature in an instance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
