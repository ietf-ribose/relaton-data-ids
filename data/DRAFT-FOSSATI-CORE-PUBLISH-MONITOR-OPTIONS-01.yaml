abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines two additional Options for the Constrained\n
    \  Application Protocol (CoAP) especially targeted at sleepy sensors:\n   Publish
    and Monitor.\n\n   The Publish Option enables opportunistic updates of a given
    resource\n   state, by temporarily delegating the authority of the Publish'ed\n
    \  resource to a Proxy node.  The whole process is driven by the\n   (sleepy)
    origin -- which may actually never need to listen.\n\n   The Monitor Option complements
    the typical Observe pattern, enabling\n   the tracking of a resource hosted by
    a node sleeping most of the\n   time, by taking care of establishing and maintaining
    an Observe\n   relationship with the (sleepy) origin on behalf of the (sleepy)\n
    \  client.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
