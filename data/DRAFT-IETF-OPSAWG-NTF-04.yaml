abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network telemetry is the technology for gaining network insight
    and\n   facilitating efficient and automated network management.  It engages\n
    \  various techniques for remote data collection, correlation, and\n   consumption.
    \ This document provides an architectural framework for\n   network telemetry,
    motivated by the network operation challenges and\n   requirements.  As evidenced
    by some key characteristics and industry\n   practices, network telemetry covers
    technologies and protocols beyond\n   the conventional network Operations, Administration,
    and Management\n   (OAM).  It promises better flexibility, scalability, accuracy,\n
    \  coverage, and performance and allows automated control loops to suit\n   both
    today's and tomorrow's network operation.  This document\n   clarifies the terminologies
    and classifies the modules and components\n   of a network telemetry system from
    several different perspectives.\n   The framework and taxonomy help to set a common
    ground for the\n   collection of related work and provide guidance for related
    technique\n   and standard developments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
