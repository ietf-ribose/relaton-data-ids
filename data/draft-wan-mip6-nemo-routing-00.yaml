abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The current Mobile IPv6 and NEMO specification supports only IPv6.As
    an extension, the DSMip6 protocol [v4traversal]defines how thedual-stack mobile
    node roams in the ipv4 network. The dsmip6protocol assumes that both home agent
    and mobile node supports mipv4and mipv6 protocol. It also assumes that both the
    home agent andmobile node have a configured ipv4 address. These assumptions dowork
    during many scenarios. However, as the ipv4 address is a scarceresource in many
    counrties, some mobile nodes may not be able to getconfigured ipv4 home addresses
    from their home agents. In thisscenario, a temporary ipv4 home address is more
    useful. Thisdocument will focuse on this scenario.</p>"
