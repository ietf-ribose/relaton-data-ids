abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses strategies for assigning and aggregating
    IPv6\naddress space.  While CIDR was created to help alleviate this problem\nin
    regards to IPv4 addresses with the original [RFC1519] (and updated\nin [RFC4632])
    we are now in need of a similar document to give\ndirection for IPv6 addressing
    policies.  Similarly, [RFC1518]\ndiscussed how to use CIDR to allocate address
    space for IPv4, and\n[RFC1887] discusses the subject for IPv6.  The objective
    here is to\nupdate these documents and provide the best current guidance on how\nto
    manage address space in conjunction with managing the growth of\nrouting tables
    in an IPv6 world.\n\t </p>\n      "
