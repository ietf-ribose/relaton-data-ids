abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The decision to develop a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)\nTransport
    Profile in cooperation between IETF and ITU-T does not\nfully define and document
    processes for development of the required\nRFCs.\n\nThis document complements
    the processes documented in the JWT\ndecision with a few separate elements; it:\n\no
    \ provides an adaptation of the IETF working group process,\n\no  identifies the
    expected participation in the process by the ITU-T,\n\no  clarifies the decision
    rules regarding MPLS-TP documents.\n\nThis document is not intended to specify
    any ITU-T process; to the\nextent necessary ITU-T activities will be done according
    to ITU-T\nprocess/rules.\n\nNor is this document is intended to specify the IETF
    working group\nprocess, it is limited to the temporary adaptations of that process\nthat
    is the result of that IETF and ITU-T accepted the proposal in\nthe JWT report
    to jointly develop the MPLS Transport Profile.  In\ngeneral it may be said that
    these adaptations are introduced to\nensure a good and consistent document review
    across the two\norganizations.\n\t </p>\n      "
