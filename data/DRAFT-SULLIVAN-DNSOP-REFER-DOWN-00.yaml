abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A server in the Domain Name System can use a mechanism called\n
    \  \"referral\" to indicate that the server is not authoritative for a\n   given
    zone, and to redirect the query to another, more appropriate\n   server.  The
    mechanism was originally specified such that a referral\n   might be to any location
    in the DNS.  Operational experience\n   indicates dubious value to referrals other
    than those to zones below\n   the zones for which a server is authoritative.  This
    memo therefore\n   recommends such referrals and discourages other kinds of referrals.\n\n\t
