abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a new method, which will automatically
    \nacquire the host name of active IPv6 nodes and register it to the \nlocal Domain
    Name System (DNS) server. Active IPv6 nodes are nodes \nthat are connected to
    a network. \nOur proposed new method [6] will automatically learn some useful
    \ninformation from all the IPv6 nodes, such as the host name and the \nIP address.
    The Agent using a new method will keep all the \ninformation that is send by the
    nodes. The Resolver will add the \nhost name together with the IPv6 address to
    the DNS. This will be \nimplemented without the need for any changes at the clients'
    site.  \nThe objective of this document is to specify a new procedure and \nalso
    the algorithm used in the procedure.\n\t </p>\n      "
