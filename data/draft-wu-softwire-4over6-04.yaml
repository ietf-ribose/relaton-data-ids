abstract:
- content: "<p>The emerging and growing deployment of IPv6 networks will introduce
    cases where connectivity with IPv4 networks crossing IPv6 transit backbones is
    desired. This document describes a mechanism for automatic discovery and creation
    of IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnels via extensions to multiprotocol BGP. It is targeted
    at connecting islands of IPv4 networks across an IPv6-only backbone without the
    need for a manually configured overlay of tunnels. The mechanisms described in
    this document have been implemented, tested, and deployed on the large research
    IPv6 network in China. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.</p>"
