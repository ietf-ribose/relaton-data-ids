abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes an application level protocol for the\n
    \  communication of end-to-end QoS compliance information based on the\n   Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Session Description\n   Protocol (SDP).  The
    Quality for Service Protocol (Q4S) provides a\n   mechanism to negotiate and monitor
    latency, jitter, bandwidth, and\n   packet, and to alert whenever one of the negotiated
    conditions is\n   violated.\n\n   Implementation details on the actions to be
    triggered upon\n   reception/detection of QoS alerts exchanged by the protocol
    are out\n   of scope of this document, it is application dependent (e.g., act
    to\n   increase quality or reduce bit-rate) or network dependent (e.g.,\n   change
    connection's quality profile).\n\n   This protocol specification is the product
    of research conducted\n   over a number of years, and is presented here as a permanent
    record\n   and to offer a foundation for future similar work.  It does not\n   represent
    a standard protocol and does not have IETF consensus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n
