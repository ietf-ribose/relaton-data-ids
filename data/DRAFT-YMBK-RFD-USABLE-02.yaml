abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed to reduce BGP churn
    in\n   routers.  Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for\n
    \  being well-connected because topological richness amplifies the\n   number
    of update messages exchanged.  Many operators have turned RFD\n   off.  Based
    on experimental measurement, this document recommends\n   adjusting a few RFD
    algorithmic constants and limits, to reduce the\n   high risks with RFD, with
    the result being damping a non-trivial\n   amount of long term churn without penalizing
    well-behaved prefixes'\n   normal convergence process.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
