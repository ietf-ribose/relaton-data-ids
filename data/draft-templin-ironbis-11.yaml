abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the Internet must continue to support escalating growth due to
    increasing demand, it is clear that current routing architectures and operational
    practices must be updated. This document proposes an Internet Routing Overlay
    Network (IRON) architecture that supports sustainable growth while requiring no
    changes to end systems and no changes to the existing routing system. In addition
    to routing scaling, IRON further addresses other important issues including mobility
    management, mobile networks, multihoming, traffic engineering, NAT traversal and
    security. While business considerations are an important determining factor for
    widespread adoption, they are out of scope for this document.</p>"
