abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Group communication services exist in a large variety of flavors,
    andtechnical implementations at different protocol layers. Multicastdata distribution
    is most efficiently performed on the lowestavailable layer, but a heterogeneous
    deployment status of multicasttechnologies throughout the Internet requires an
    adaptive servicebinding at runtime. Today, it is difficult to write an applicationthat
    runs everywhere and at the same time makes use of the mostefficient multicast
    service available in the network. Facingrobustness requirements, developers are
    frequently forced to using astable, upper layer protocol controlled by the application
    itself.This document describes a common multicast API that is suitable fortransparent
    communication in underlay and overlay, and grants accessto the different multicast
    flavors. It proposes an abstract namingby multicast URIs and discusses mapping
    mechanisms between differentnamespaces and distribution technologies. Additionally,
    it describesthe application of this API for building gateways that interconnectcurrent
    multicast domains throughout the Internet.</p>"
