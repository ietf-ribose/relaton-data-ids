abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet-Draft provides a description of the pNFS extension
    for\n   NFSv4.\n\n   The key feature of the protocol extension is the ability
    for clients\n   to perform read and write operations that go directly from the
    client\n   to individual storage system elements without funneling all such\n
    \  accesses through a single file server.  Of course, the file server\n   must
    provide sufficient coordination of the client I/O so that the\n   file system
    retains its integrity.\n\n   The extension adds operations that query and manage
    layout\n   information that allows parallel I/O between clients and storage\n
    \  system elements.  The layouts are managed in a similar way to\n   delegations
    in that they are associated with leases and can be\n   recalled by the server,
    but layout information is independent of\n   delegations.\n\t </p>\n      "
