abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The core IPv6 specification requires that when a host receives
    an\n   ICMPv6 \"Packet Too Big\" message reporting a \"Next-Hop MTU\" smaller\n
    \  than 1280, the host includes a Fragment Header in all subsequent\n   packets
    sent to that destination, without reducing the assumed Path-\n   MTU.  The simplicity
    with which ICMPv6 \"Packet Too Big\" messages can\n   be forged, coupled with
    the widespread filtering of IPv6 fragments,\n   results in an attack vector that
    can be leveraged for Denial of\n   Service purposes.  This document briefly discusses
    the aforementioned\n   attack vector, and formally updates RFC2460 such that generation
    of\n   IPv6 atomic fragments is deprecated, thus eliminating the\n   aforementioned
    attack vector.  Additionally, it formally updates\n   RFC6145 such that the Stateless
    IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT)\n   does not rely on the generation of IPv6
    atomic fragments, thus\n   improving the robustness of the protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n
