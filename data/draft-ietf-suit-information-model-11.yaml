abstract:
- content: "<p>Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the
    need for a reliable and secure firmware update mechanism that is also suitable
    for constrained devices. Ensuring that devices function and remain secure over
    their service life requires such an update mechanism to fix vulnerabilities, to
    update configuration settings, as well as adding new functionality. One component
    of such a firmware update is a concise and machine- processable meta-data document,
    or manifest, that describes the firmware image(s) and offers appropriate protection.
    This document describes the information that must be present in the manifest.</p>"
