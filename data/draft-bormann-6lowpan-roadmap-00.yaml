abstract:
  content: "<p>6LoWPAN is defined in RFC 4944 in conjunction with a number ofspecifications
    that are currently nearing completion. The entiretyof these specifications may
    be hard to understand, pose specificimplementation problems, or be simply inconsistent.The
    present guide aims to provide a roadmap to these documents aswell as provide specific
    advice how to use these specifications incombination. In certain cases, it may
    provide clarifications or evencorrections to the specifications referenced.This
    guide is intended as a continued work-in-progress, i.e. a long-lived Internet-Draft,
    to be updated whenever new information becomesavailable and new consensus on how
    to handle issues is formed.Similar to the ROHC implementation guide, RFC 4815,
    it might bepublished as an RFC at some future time later in the acceptance curveof
    the specifications.This document does not describe a new protocol or attempts
    to set anew standard of any kind -- it mostly describes good practice inusing
    the existing specifications, but it may also document emergingconsensus where
    a correction needs to be made.The current version -00 of this document is just
    an initial draftthat is intended to spark the collection of relevant information.</p>"
