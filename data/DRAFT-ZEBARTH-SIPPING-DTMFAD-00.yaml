abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event
    \npackage 'DTMFAD' to allow the use of SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY to collect \nDTMF
    signals.  This package is required to implement Committee T1 \nTechnical Report
    T1.TR.82-2003. \n\nThe 'DTMFAD' event package requires the definition of two new
    Event \nheader field parameters.  This package also requires the use of a new
    \nMIME type, application/DTMF-event, to allow for the transfer of DTMF \ndata
    in the NOTIFY body.  Registration of this MIME type is also \nprovided in this
    document.  \n\n      This document has been produced, on behalf of Committee T1,
    as part \n      of the IANA registration process. \n\t </p>\n      "
