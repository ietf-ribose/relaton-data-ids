abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies signaling procedures for Segment Routing
    in\n   RIFT.  Each node's loopback address, Segment Routing Global Block\n   (SRGB)
    and Node Segment Identifier (Node-SID), which are typically\n   assigned by a
    configuration management system and distibuted by\n   routing protocols, are distributed
    southbound from the Top Of Fabric\n   (TOF) nodes via RIFT's Key-Value distribution
    mechanism, so that each\n   node can compute how to reach a segment represented
    by the active SID\n   in a packet.  An SR controller signals SR policies to ingress
    nodes\n   so that they can send packets with a desired segment list to steer\n
    \  traffic.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
