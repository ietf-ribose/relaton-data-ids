abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an update of RFC 2460[RFC2460] in order
    to\n   improve the performance of IPv6 in an increasingly important use\n   case,
    the use of tunneling to carry new transport protocols.  The\n   performance improvement
    is obtained by relaxing the IPv6 UDP checksum\n   requirement for suitable tunneling
    protocol where header information\n   is protected on the \"inner\" packet being
    carried.  This relaxation\n   removes the overhead associated with the computation
    of UDP checksums\n   on tunneled IPv6 packets and thereby improves the efficiency
    of the\n   traversal of firewalls and other network middleware by such new\n   protocols.
    \ We describe how the IPv6 UDP checksum requirement can be\n   relaxed in the
    situation where the encapsulated packet itself\n   contains a checksum, the limitations
    and risks of this approach, and\n   provides restrictions on the use of this relaxation
    to mitigate these\n   risks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
