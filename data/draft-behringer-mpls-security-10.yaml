abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyses the security of the BGP/MPLS IP virtual private
    network (VPN) architecture that is described in RFC 4364, for the benefit of service
    providers and VPN users. The analysis shows that BGP/MPLS IP VPN networks can
    be as secure as traditional layer-2 VPN services using Asynchronous Transfer Mode
    (ATM) or Frame Relay. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
