abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document elaborates a threat model for pervasive surveillance.\n
    \  We assume an adversary with an interest in indiscriminate\n   eavesdropping
    that can passively observe network traffic at every\n   layer at every point in
    the network between the endpoints.  It is\n   intended to demonstrate to protocol
    designers and implementors the\n   observability and inferability of information
    and metainformation\n   transported over their respective protocols, to assist
    in the\n   evaluation of the performance of these protocols and the\n   effectiveness
    of their protection mechanisms under pervasive passive\n   surveillance.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
