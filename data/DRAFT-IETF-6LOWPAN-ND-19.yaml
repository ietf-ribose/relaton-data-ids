abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF 6LoWPAN work defines IPv6 over Low-power Wireless
    Personal\n   Area Networks such as IEEE 802.15.4.  This and other similar link\n
    \  technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to\n   energy
    conservation.  In addition, the wireless network may not\n   strictly follow the
    traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links.\n   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was
    not designed for non-transitive wireless\n   links, as its reliance on the traditional
    IPv6 link concept and its\n   heavy use of multicast make it inefficient and sometimes
    impractical\n   in a low-power and lossy network.  This document describes simple\n
    \  optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, its addressing mechanisms\n   and
    duplicate address detection for Low-power Wireless Personal Area\n   Networks
    and similar networks.  The document thus updates [RFC4944]\n   to specify the
    use of the optimizations defined here.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
