abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv4 Identification (ID) field enables fragmentation and reassembly
    and, as currently specified, is required to be unique within the maximum lifetime
    for all datagrams with a given source address/destination address/protocol tuple.
    If enforced, this uniqueness requirement would limit all connections to 6.4 Mbps
    for typical datagram sizes. Because individual connections commonly exceed this
    speed, it is clear that existing systems violate the current specification. This
    document updates the specification of the IPv4 ID field in RFCs 791, 1122, and
    2003 to more closely reflect current practice and to more closely match IPv6 so
    that the field's value is defined only when a datagram is actually fragmented.
    It also discusses the impact of these changes on how datagrams are used. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
