abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Moving the focus from nodes to information objects raises scalability\n
    \  issues because the number of addressable information objects is huge\n   compared
    to the number of nodes, so scalable routing is an important\n   challenge issue
    of ICN. There are two types of naming scheme which\n   have been proposed in the
    ICN literatures: hierarchical and flat. To\n   guarantee clean separation of identifier
    from locator and scalability\n   of routing, we chose flat name and designed domain-based
    routing. A\n   significant requisite to be considered when flat name is used is
    an\n   efficient name-resolution system (NRS). Bloomfilter-based NRS [BF\n   NRS]
    is our proposal to this issue. Once a name is resolved into\n   locator(s), discovery
    and delivery steps are carried out based on the\n   routing scheme of locator.
    For scalability in routing of locator,\n   network is projected into hierarchically-organized
    domain structure.\n   A domain is a group of nodes or other domains. This composition
    could\n   be physical or logical. Each domain has its own identifier, and the\n
    \  concatenation of domain IDs from top level domain to a certain domain\n   which
    a node belongs to plays the role of \"locator\" for that node.\n   Each domain
    has one or more domain gateways. All traffic from/to the\n   domain should pass
    through any of domain gateways. Routing\n   information based on this type of
    locators is exchanged among domain\n   gateways by using modified link-state routing
    protocol which can\n   suppress LSA explosion [LSR]. Thanks to this hierarchical
    domain\n   structure, locators are highly aggregatable (which means scalable\n
    \  routing), and any node in heterogeneous network can communicate each\n   other.\n\n\n\n\t
