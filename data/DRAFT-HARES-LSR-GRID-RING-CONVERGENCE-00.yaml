abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes problems with IGP convergence time in
    some IPRAN\n   networks that use a physical topology of grid backbones that connect\n
    \  rings of routers.  Part of these IPRAN network topologies exist in\n   data
    centers with sufficient power and interconnections, but some\n   network equipment
    sits in remote sites impacted by power loss.  In\n   some geographic areas these
    remote sites may be subject to rolling\n   blackouts.  These rolling power blackouts
    could cause multiple\n   simultaneous node and link failures.  In these remote
    networks with\n   blackouts, it is often critical that the IPRAN phone network
    re-\n   converge quickly.\n\n   The IGP running in these networks may run in a
    single level of the\n   IGP.  This document seeks to briefly describe these problems
    to\n   determine if the emerging IGP technologies (flexible algorithms,\n   dynamic
    flooding, layers of hierarchy in IGPs) can be applied to help\n   reduce convergence
    times.  It also seeks to determine if the\n   improvements of these algorithms
    or the IP-Fast re-route algorithms\n   are thwarted by the failure of multiple
    link and nodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
