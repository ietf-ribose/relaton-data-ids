abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft presents the ongoing work in ITU-T SG2 Question 2/2
    on\nRecommendation E.352 'Routing Guidelines for Efficient Routing Methods.'\nRouting
    policies typically used in ATM- and IP-based networks do not fully consider the
    possible instabilities and drastic loss of throughput that can occur under congestion.
    \ Use of bandwidth reservation and avoidance of long paths are recommended under
    such congestion, which can lead to more efficient use of network resources.  Also,
    there is an emphasis in ATM- and IP-based networks on the use of state-dependent-routing
    (SDR) methods.\nHowever, the flooding methods typically used by these SDR methods
    to\ndisseminate network status information can lead to inefficient use of\nnetwork
    resources. Use of event-dependent-routing (EDR) methods and/or more efficient
    dissemination of network status information are recommended as other possible
    approaches to consider.  Finally, QoS routing rules are recommended to ensure
    service performance quality, such as avoidance of excessive transfer delay by
    limiting the number of satellite hops in an end-to-end connection.\n\t </p>\n
