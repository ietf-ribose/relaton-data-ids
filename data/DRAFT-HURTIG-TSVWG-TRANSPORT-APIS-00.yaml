abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Commonly used networking APIs are currently limited by the
    transport\n   layer's inability to expose services instead of protocols.  An API/\n
    \  application/user is therefore forced to use exactly the services that\n   are
    implemented by the selected transport.  This document surveys\n   networking APIs
    and discusses how they can be improved by a more\n   expressive transport layer
    that hides and automatizes the choice of\n   the transport protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n
