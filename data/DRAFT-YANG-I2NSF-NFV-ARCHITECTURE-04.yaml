    \  Security Functions (I2NSF) Framework into the Network Functions\n   Virtualization
    (NFV) Reference Model.  This document explains how the\n   components and interfaces
    in the I2NSF Framework can be placed in the\n   NFV reference architecture, and
    also explains the procedures of the\n   lifecycle management of Network Security
    Functions (NSFs) according\n   to a user's security policy specification in the
    I2NSF framework on\n   the NFV system.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
