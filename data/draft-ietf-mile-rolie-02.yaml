abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a resource-oriented approach to cyber security
    information sharing. Using this approach, operators may share and exchange representations
    of cyber security incidents, attack indicators, software vulnerabilities, and
    other related information as Web-addressable resources. Furthermore, consumers
    and other stakeholders may access and search this security content as needed,
    establishing a rapid and on-demand information exchange network for restricted
    internal use or public access repositories. This specification builds on and extends
    the Atom Publishing Protocol and Atom Syndication Format to transport and share
    cyber security resource representations. This document leverages the existing
    representations IODEF and RID where appropriate, and supports related cyber security
    representation standards.</p>"
