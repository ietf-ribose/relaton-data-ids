abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes usecases and requirements for MPLS
    big label.\n   The MPLS label format and encoding method have been specified in
    [RFC\n   3032], the label value is represented by 20-bit space and support up\n
    \  to 1 million of instances. This proven technology has been widely\n   deployed
    and worked fine for years. However in certain network\n   deployment scenarios
    of recent years, the 20-bit MPLS label space is\n   no longer sufficient to support
    the widespread adoption of network\n   virtualization technologies. In what follows
    we will describe each of\n   the usecase respectively\n\n\t </p>\n      "
