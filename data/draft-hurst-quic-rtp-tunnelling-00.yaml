abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC is a UDP-based transport protocol for stream-orientated, congestion-controlled,
    secure, multiplexed data transfer. RTP carries real-time data between endpoints,
    and the accompanying control protocol RTCP allows monitoring and control of the
    transfer of such data. With RTP and RTCP being agnostic to the underlying transport
    protocol, it is possible to multiplex both the RTP and associated RTCP flows into
    a single QUIC connection to take advantage of QUIC features such as low-latency
    setup and strong TLS-based security.</p>"
