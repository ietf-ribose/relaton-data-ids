abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how a Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC)
    data channel can be used as a transport mechanism for the Message Session Relay
    Protocol (MSRP) and how the Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer mechanism
    can be used to negotiate such a data channel, referred to as an MSRP data channel.
    Two network configurations are supported: the connection of two MSRP data channel
    endpoints; and a gateway configuration, which connects an MSRP data channel endpoint
    with an MSRP endpoint that uses either TCP or TLS. This document updates RFC 4975.</p>"
