abstract:
- content: "<p>This document described conventions for using the Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) described in RFC2327 for controlling ATM Bearer Connections, and
    any associated ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL). The AALs addressed are Type 1, Type
    2 and Type 5. This list of conventions is meant to be exhaustive. Individual applications
    can use subsets of these conventions. Further, these conventions are meant to
    comply strictly with the SDP syntax as defined in rfc2327.</p>"
