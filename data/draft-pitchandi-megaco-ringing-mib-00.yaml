abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it defines objects for use by the MEGACO/H.248 Ringing Packages operating on Media
    Gateways. These objects can be used to manage the network containing Media Gateway(s).
    This is the initial version of this draft. This draft defines a MIB that contains
    the elements for defining ringing patterns [21]. Rules have been defined below
    which MUST be adhered to ensure a properly defined set of ringing patterns.</p>"
