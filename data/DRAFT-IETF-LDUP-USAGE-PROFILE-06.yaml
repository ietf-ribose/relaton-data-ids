abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Support for replication in LDAP directory systems is often one
    of the \nkey factors in the decision to deploy them.  But replication brings \ndesign
    constraints along with its benefits. \nWe discuss some of the factors that should
    be taken into consideration \nwhen designing a replicated directory system.  Both
    programming and \narchitectural/operational concerns are addressed and both single-
    and \nmulti-master directories are considered. \n\t </p>\n      "
