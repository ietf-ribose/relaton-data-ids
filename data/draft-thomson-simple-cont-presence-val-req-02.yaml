abstract:
- content: "<p>The attributes of continuous-valued data are examined in respect to
    presence systems. The limitations of the existing presence system with respect
    to continuous-valued data is examined. Requirements are formulated that would
    enable the use of the presence system for this data, with an emphasis on providing
    the watcher with a means of control over the measurement process.</p>"
