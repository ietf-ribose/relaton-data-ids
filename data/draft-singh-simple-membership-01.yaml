- content: "<p>This document defines a new event membership package that allows to
    track changes in membership in groups. Groups can represent entities contained
    within a physical space, such as a room or vehicle, or a logical group of entities,
    such as a call center team. Each member of a group can support a different set
    of event packages.</p>"
