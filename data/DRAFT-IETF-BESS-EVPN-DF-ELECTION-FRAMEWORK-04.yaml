abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Designated Forwarder (DF) in EVPN networks is the Provider
    Edge\n   (PE) router responsible for sending broadcast, unknown unicast and\n
    \  multicast (BUM) traffic to a multi-homed Customer Equipment (CE)\n   device,
    on a given VLAN on a particular Ethernet Segment (ES). The DF\n   is selected
    out of a list of candidate PEs that advertise the same\n   Ethernet Segment Identifier
    (ESI) to the EVPN network. By default,\n   EVPN uses a DF Election algorithm referred
    to as \"Service Carving\"\n   and it is based on a modulus function (V mod N)
    that takes the number\n   of PEs in the ES (N) and the VLAN value (V) as input.
    This default DF\n   Election algorithm has some inefficiencies that this document\n
    \  addresses by defining a new DF Election algorithm and a capability to\n   influence
    the DF Election result for a VLAN, depending on the state\n   of the associated
    Attachment Circuit (AC). In addition, this document\n   creates a registry with
    IANA, for future DF Election Algorithms and\n   Capabilities. It also presents
    a formal definition and clarification\n   of the DF Election Finite State Machine.\n\n\n\t
