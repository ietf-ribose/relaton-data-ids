abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft provides an applicability statement for the transparent
    \nAAL5 PDU frame mode encapsulation in draft-fischer [4]. \nDraft-fischer describes
    methods to carry ATM services over IP, L2TP \nor MPLS. The PSN (e.g. MPLS) is
    used to transport ATM layer services \nsuch as those defined by ITU-T as ATM transfer
    capabilities [2] and \nthe ATM Forum as ATM service categories [3]. The basic
    requirement is \nto transparently transport ATM VCC service related information
    (e.g., \ntraffic parameters, QoS, OAM, etc.) over the Pseudo Wire (PW), over \nthe
    packet network. Transparent PDU frame mode enables bandwidth \nefficiency gains
    to be realized for ATM VCCs that use AAL5, yet still \nprovide full ATM transparency,
    including the correct sequencing of \nOAM cells on an AAL5 flow.  \n    \n\n\t
