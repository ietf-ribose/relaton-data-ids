abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In order to simplify the deployment of AAAA records in the DNS,
    name\nservers should only perform automatic inclusion of these RRs when\nthere
    is an explicit indication that the resolver can understand\nthose RRs.  This document
    proposes the use of a bit in the EDNS0 header\nto provide that explicit indication
    and describes the necessary protocol\nchanges to implement that notification.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
