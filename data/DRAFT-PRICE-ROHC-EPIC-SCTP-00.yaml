abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Efficient Protocol Independent Compression [EPIC] scheme is
    a \ngeneral mechanism for providing additional profiles for use within \nthe [ROHC8]
    framework. The EPIC inputset is a list of fields from the \nprotocol stack to
    be compressed, and for each field a choice of \nencoding techniques together with
    the probabilities that they will be \nused. The output of EPIC is a set of optimally
    efficient compressed \nheader formats for the chosen protocol stack, and an automatic
    \nmechanism for translating between compressed and uncompressed packet \nformats.
