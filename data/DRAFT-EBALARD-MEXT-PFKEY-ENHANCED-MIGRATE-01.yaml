abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the need for an interface between Mobile
    IPv6\nand IPsec/IKE and shows how the two protocols can interwork.  An\nextension
    of the PF_KEY framework is proposed which allows smooth and\nsolid operation of
    IPsec/IKE in a Mobile IPv6 environment.\n\nThis document is heavily based on a
    previous draft [MIGRATE] written\nby Shinta Sugimoto, Masahide Nakamura and Francis
    Dupont.  It simply\nreuses the MIGRATE mechanism defined in the expired document,
    removes\na companion extension (SADB_X_EXT_PACKET) based on implementation\nfeedback
    (complexity, limitations, ...) and fills the gap by very\nsimple changes to MIGRATE
    mechanism.  This results in a more simple\nand consistent mechanism, which also
    proved to be easier to\nimplement.  This document is expected to serve as a continuation
    of\n[MIGRATE] work.  For that reason, the name of the extension has been\nkept.\n\nPF_KEY
    MIGRATE message serves as a carrier for updated information\nfor both the in-kernel
    IPsec structures (Security Policy Database /\nSecurity Association Database) and
    those maintained by the key\nmanagers.  This includes in-kernel Security Policy
    / Security\nAssociation endpoints, key manager maintained equivalents, and\naddresses
    used by IKE_SA (current and to be negotiated).  The\nextension is helpful for
    assuring smooth interworking between Mobile\nIPv6 and IPsec/IKE for the bootstrapping
    of mobile nodes and their\nmovements.\n\t </p>\n      "
