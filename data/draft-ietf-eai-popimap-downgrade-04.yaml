abstract:
- content: "<p>The Email Address Internationalization (SMTPUTF8) extension allows
    UTF-8 characters in mail header fields. Upgraded POP and IMAP servers support
    internationalized email messages. If a POP/IMAP client does not support Email
    Address Internationalization, POP/IMAP servers cannot send Internationalized Email
    Headers to the client and cannot remove the message. To avoid the situation, this
    document describes a conversion mechanism for internationalized Email messages
    to be traditional message format. The purpose of post-delivery message downgrading
    is to enable POP/IMAP servers to deliver internationalized messages to traditional
    POP/IMAP clients. In the process, message elements requiring internationalized
    treatment can be removed or recoded and receivers can know they received messages
    containing such elements even if they cannot receive the elements themselves.</p>"
