abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It may not be possible for a network to determine the cause
    for an\n   attack, but instead just realize that some resources seem to be under\n
    \  attack.  To fill that gap, Distributed-Denial-of-Service Open Threat\n   Signaling
    (DOTS) allows a network to inform a server that it is under\n   a potential attack
    so that appropriate mitigation actions are\n   undertaken.\n\n   This document
    specifies DHCP (IPv4 and IPv6) options to configure\n   hosts with DOTS servers.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
