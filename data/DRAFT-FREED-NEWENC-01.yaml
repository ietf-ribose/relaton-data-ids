abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines two additional content-transfer-\nencodings,
    deflate and deflate-base64. Adding these CTEs to\nMIME that provide facilities
    for loss-less, adaptive,\ngeneral-purpose compression. The first of these, deflate,\nproduces
    binary output, while the second, deflate-base64,\nproduces the same sort of output
    as the base64 content-\ntransfer-encoding defined in [RFC-2045].\n\t </p>\n      "
