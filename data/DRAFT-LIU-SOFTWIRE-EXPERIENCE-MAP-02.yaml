  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the experiences of using Mapping of
    Address\n   and Port (MAP).\n\n   Network setup and testing results using MAP-Translation
    (MAP-T), MAP-\n   Encapsulation (MAP-E) and mixed MAP-T/MAP-E are described in
    this\n   document.\n\n   Relationships among native IPv6, single translation,
    double\n   translation, and encapsulation are also discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
