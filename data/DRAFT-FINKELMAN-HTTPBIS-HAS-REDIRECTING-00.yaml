abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document motivates the need for clarifications of client\n
    \  behavior in cases of HTTP redirect to a content delivery network\n   (CDN)
    when the redirected object contains relative references.  This\n   document focuses
    on HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) use cases, but it\n   might be possible to generalize
    to other use cases.  The goal of this\n   document is to present the current status
    of things and to explore\n   potential solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
