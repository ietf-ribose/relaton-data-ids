abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As per industry trends, Access Networks have been migrating
    from\n   traditional ATM based networks to Ethernet networks.  In Ethernet\n   based
    access networks, Access Concentrators are typically configured\n   to act as a
    transparent bridge in Layer 2 mode.  These Access\n   Concentrators also act as
    Layer 2 relay agents.  Layer 2 Relay Agent\n   functionality does not provide
    means to avoid flooding of DHCP\n   messages and also needs to be extended to
    support DHCP LeaseQuery\n   This draft discusses these issues and provides solutions
    for the\n   same.\n\t </p>\n      "
