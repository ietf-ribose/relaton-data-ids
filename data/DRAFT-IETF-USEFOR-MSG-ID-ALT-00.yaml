abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RFC822] and [RFC1036] define so-called 'Message-IDs' that
    represent\n   a unique identifier for email and netnews messages. A similar\n
    \  identifier is also used by [RFC2045] for the 'Content-ID' label.\n \n   For
    each of these protocols, uniqueness of the identifiers generated\n   is more or
    less essential. Unfortunately, the original Message-ID\n   specification requires
    that the generator have an own, non-temporary\n   full qualified domain name available,
    which does not allow hosts that\n   are connected via dialup lines and get dynamically
    assigned IP\n   addresses (and hostnames) to generate unique IDs offline.\n \n
    \  This memo provides recommendations for the generation of such IDs\n   without
    risking non-uniqueness.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
