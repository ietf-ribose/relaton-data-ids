abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) can be combined with Ethernet
    VPN\n   (EVPN) to deploy Ethernet Local Area Network (ELAN) services in large\n
    \  Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks (PBB-EVPN).  Single-\n   Active
    Multi-homing and per-I-SID (per Service Instance Identifier)\n   Load-Balancing
    can be provided to access devices and aggregation\n   networks.  In order to speed
    up the network convergence in case of\n   failures on Single-Active Multi-Homed
    Ethernet Segments, PBB-EVPN\n   defines a flush mechanism for Customer MACs (CMAC-flush)
    that works\n   for different Ethernet Segment Backbone MAC (BMAC) address allocation\n
    \  models.  This document complements those CMAC-flush procedures for\n   cases
    in which no PBB-EVPN Ethernet Segments are defined (the\n   attachment circuit
    is associated to a zero Ethernet Segment\n   Identifier) and a Service Instance
    Identifier based (I-SID-based)\n   CMAC-flush granularity is required.\n\n\t </p>\n
