abstract:
- content: "<p>Some HTTP servers provide a subset of resources that require additional
    authentication to interact with. HTTP/1.1 servers rely on TLS renegotiation that
    is triggered by a request to a protected resource. HTTP/2 made this pattern impossible
    by forbidding the use of TLS renegotiation. This document describes a how client
    authentication might be requested by a server as a result of receiving a request
    to a protected resource. This document updates RFC 7540 to allow TLS renegotiation
    in limited circumstances.</p>"
