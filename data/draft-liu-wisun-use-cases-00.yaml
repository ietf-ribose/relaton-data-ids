abstract:
- content: <p>This draft presents several use cases in which WiSUN technology can
    be applied, including Advanced Metering Infrastructure and Intelligent Street
    Lights. The draft can stand alone as an independent draft, but also represents
    a potential contribution to the "WiSUN overview" section of [I-D.ietf-lpwan-overview].</p>
