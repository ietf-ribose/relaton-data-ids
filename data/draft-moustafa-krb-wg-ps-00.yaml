abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document presents the problem of authentication andauthorization
    in distributed environments constituted by severalusers communicating with application
    servers and communicating witheach others. Each user in this environment can also
    play the role ofan application provider.Imagine a large music event where the
    provided network infrastructureis enhanced with network storage equipment to allow
    visitors toaccess content relating to the bands playing at the events, such asrecorded
    video of previous performances, supplementary audio andvideo material relevant
    to the bands playing, etc. Certain contentis, however, not necessarily available
    to everyone under the sameconditions. Instead access control is applied before
    the full rangeof audio, and video material can be accessed. Other content, such
    aspreviews, might be offered for free. How can such authentication,and authorization
    infrastructure be made available with minimalconfiguration complexity for a temporary
    event like a music festival?This document describes a problem statement based
    on the attempt touse Kerberos and lists a couple of requirements for potentiallyneeded
    Kerberos extensions.</p>"
