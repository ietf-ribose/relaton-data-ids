abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RSVP [1] is designed as a signaling protocol that provides
    end-to-end\n   QoS guarantee for real-time services in the fixed hardwired network.\n
    \  However, when used in the mobile environment, the protocol doesn't\n   work
    well due to the mobility of the endpoints.  Immediately after a\n   handover occurs,
    because of the lack of resource reservation in the\n   handoff target subnet,
    QoS of the session degrades notably.  Another\n   problem is that when route optimization
    is implemented,the protocol\n   will be invalidated due to certain features of
    the route optimization\n   mechanism.\n\n   This document proposes extensions
    to RSVP.  The extensions enable\n   RSVP to operate in the mobile IPv6 network
    while providing advanced\n   resource reservation before handover and resource
    reservation on the\n   optimized route after handover.  With these features, QoS
    of the\n   sessions can be guaranteed and the utilization of network resources\n
    \  can be enhanced resulting in the improvement of overall network\n   performance.\n\n\t
