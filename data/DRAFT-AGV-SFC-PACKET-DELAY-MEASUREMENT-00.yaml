abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on
    the\n   capability to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet\n   Delay.\n\n
    \  The common reasons for packet delay are Nodal processing(Algorithmic,\n   Packetization
    etc...), Queuing, Transmission delay, Propagation delay\n   and Service Function
    processing delay.\n\n   Packet Delay Measurement capability also provides operators
    with\n   greater visibility into the performance characteristics of their\n   networks,
    thereby facilitating planning, troubleshooting, and network\n   performance evaluation.\n\n
    \  This document specifies best possible efficient and accurate\n   mechanism
    for passive packet delay measurement for Service Function\n   Chains (SFCs) for
    a SFC network domain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
