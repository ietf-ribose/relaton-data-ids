abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a requirement for some multi-homed sites to influence the
    path selected by autonomous systems beyond those that are immediately adjacent.
    This draft describes a community-based convention which might be used to limit
    propagation of particular prefixes to those ASes where they are required.</p>"
