abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document looks at control plane aspect related to both
    tenant\n   system to NVE control interface and NVE to Network Virtualization\n
    \  Authority (NVA) control interface NVE use to enable communication\n   between
    tenant systems and focuses on NVE to NVA control interface,\n   which is complementary
    to [draft-kreeger-nvo3-hypervisor-nve-cp] that\n   describes the high level control
    plane requirements related to the\n   interaction between tenant system and NVE
    when the two entities are\n   not co-located on the same physical device.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
