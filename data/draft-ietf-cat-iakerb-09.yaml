abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines extensions to the Kerberos protocolspecification
    (RFC 1510 [1]) and GSSAPI Kerberos protocol mechanism(RFC 1964 [2]) that enables
    a client to obtain Kerberos tickets forservices where the KDC is not accessible
    to the client, but isaccessible to the application server. Some common scenarios
    wherelack of accessibility would occur are when the client does not havean IP
    address prior to authenticating to an access point, the clientis unable to locate
    a KDC, or a KDC is behind a firewall. Thedocument specifies two protocols to allow
    a client to exchange KDCmessages (which are GSS encapsulated) with an IAKERB proxy
    instead ofa KDC.</p>"
