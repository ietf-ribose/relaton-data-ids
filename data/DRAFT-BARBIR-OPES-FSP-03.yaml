    \n(FSP) defined within the bounds of the Open Pluggable Edge Services \n(OPES)
    Framework. The work described here aims to provide a \nFramework and Protocols
    for the delivery of the optimal content \nvariant for a given requestor based
    on subscriber profile and \npolicies, content profile and its associated policies.
    This document \nprovides a general outline of FSP that could be used as a vehicle
    \nfor performing personalization services in edge and intermediary \ndevices or
