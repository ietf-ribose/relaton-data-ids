abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports on experience and simulations of dynamic probing
    of alternate paths between two IPv6 hosts when network failures occur. Two models
    for such probing were investigated: the SHIM6 REAchability Protocol (REAP) and
    the Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP). The motivation for this document
    is to identify some aspects of path probing at large or very large scale that
    may be broadly relevant to future protocol design.</p>"
