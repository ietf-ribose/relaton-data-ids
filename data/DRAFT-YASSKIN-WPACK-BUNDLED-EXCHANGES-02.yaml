abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bundled exchanges provide a way to bundle up groups of HTTP\n
    \  request+response pairs to transmit or store them together.  They can\n   include
    multiple top-level resources with one identified as the\n   default by a manifest,
    provide random access to their component\n   exchanges, and efficiently store
    8-bit resources.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
