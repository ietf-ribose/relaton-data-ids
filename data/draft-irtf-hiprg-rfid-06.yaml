abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture based on the Host Identity
    Protocol (HIP), for active RFIDs, i.e. Radio Frequency Identifiers including tamper
    resistant computing resources, as specified for example in the ISO 14443 or 15693
    standards. HIP-RFIDs never expose their identity in clear text, but hide this
    value (typically an EPC- Code) by a particular equation that can be only solved
    by a dedicated entity, referred as the portal. HIP exchanges occur between HIP-RFIDs
    and portals; they are transported by IP packets, through the Internet cloud.</p>"
