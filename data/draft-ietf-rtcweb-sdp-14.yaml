    mechanism for direct interactive rich communication using audio, video, and data
    between two peers' web browsers. With in the WebRTC framework, the Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) is used for negotiating session capabilities between the peers.
    Such a negotiation happens based on the SDP offer/answer exchange mechanism This
    document provides an informational reference in describing the role of SDP and
    the offer/answer exchange mechanism for the most common WebRTC use cases. This
    document makes no changes to the SDP offer/answer exchange mechanism.</p>"
