abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet-Draft proposes the Archive and Packaging Pointer
    URI\n   scheme \"app\".\n\n   app URIs can be used to consume or reference hypermedia
    resources\n   bundled inside a file archive or an application package, as well
    as\n   to resolve URIs for archive resources within a programmatic\n   framework.\n\n
    \  This URI scheme provides mechanisms to generate a unique base URI to\n   represent
    the root of the archive, so that relative URI references in\n   a bundled resource
    can be resolved within the archive without having\n   to extract the archive content
    on the local file system.\n\n   An app URI can be used for purposes of isolation
    (e.g. when consuming\n   multiple archives), security constraints (avoiding \"climb
    out\" from\n   the archive), or for externally identiyfing sub-resources referenced\n
    \  by hypermedia formats.\n\t </p>\n      "
