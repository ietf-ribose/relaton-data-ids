abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The authorization request in OAuth 2.0 described in RFC 6749
    utilizes\n   query parameter serialization, which means that Authorization Request\n
    \  parameters are encoded in the URI of the request and sent through\n   user
    agents such as web browsers.  While it is easy to implement, it\n   means that
    (a) the communication through the user agents are not\n   integrity protected
    and thus the parameters can be tainted, and (b)\n   the source of the communication
    is not authenticated.  Because of\n   these weaknesses, several attacks to the
    protocol have now been put\n   forward.\n\n   This document introduces the ability
    to send request parameters in a\n   JSON Web Token (JWT) instead, which allows
    the request to be signed\n   with JSON Web Signature (JWS) and encrypted with
    JSON Web Encryption\n   (JWE) so that the integrity, source authentication and\n
    \  confidentiality property of the Authorization Request is attained.\n   The
    request can be sent by value or by reference.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
