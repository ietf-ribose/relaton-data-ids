abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traditionally, the management of the DNS root zone permitted
    only\n   \"alphabetic\" labels.  As long as the root zone included only ASCII\n
    \  characters, and as long as there was only one form of a label, the\n   restriction
    plainly meant that only the letters A-Z and a-z were\n   permitted.  The advent
    of internationalized labels using IDNA2008\n   presents some complications for
    the restriction.  One of the\n   complications is the meaning of the term \"alphabetic\"
    when applied to\n   the Unicode code points in U-labels.  This memo presents a
    set of\n   principles that can be used to determine whether a Unicode code point\n
    \  may be wisely included in the repertoire of permissible code points\n   in
    a U-label in a zone.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
