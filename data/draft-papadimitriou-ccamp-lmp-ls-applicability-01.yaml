abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Integration of Generalized MPLS-capable SONET/SDH networks inexisting
    backbone environments has generated the need to determineinter-working capabilities
    between nodes interconnected by bothSONET/SDH and non-SONET/SDH overhead terminating
    networks. This isparticularly the case for critical functions and applications
    suchas the ones provided by the Link Management Protocol [LMP] and itsWDM extensions
    [LMP-WDM]. In this context, this document describesthe applicability of their
    respective functions and illustrates themthrough several inter-connection architectures.</p>"
