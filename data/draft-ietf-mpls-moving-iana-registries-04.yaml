abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 5586 generalized the applicability of the pseudowire Associated
    Channel Header (PW-ACH) into the Generic Associated Channel G-ACh. However, registries
    and allocations of G-ACh parameters had been distributed throughout different,
    sometimes unrelated, registries. This document coalesces these into a new "Generic
    Associated Channel (G-ACh) Parameters" registry under the "Multiprotocol Label
    Switching Architecture (MPLS)" heading. This document updates RFC 5586. This document
    also updates RFCs 6374, 6378, 6427, and 6428.</p>
