abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol and new DNS Resource Record that
    can be used to provide a cryptographic message digest over DNS zone data. The
    ZONEMD Resource Record conveys the digest data in the zone itself. When a zone
    publisher includes an ZONEMD record, recipients can verify the zone contents for
    accuracy and completeness. This provides assurance that received zone data matches
    published data, regardless of how the zone data has been transmitted and received.
    ZONEMD is not designed to replace DNSSEC. Whereas DNSSEC protects individual RRSets
    (DNS data with fine granularity), ZONEMD protects a zone's data as a whole, whether
    consumed by authoritative name servers, recursive name servers, or any other applications.
    As specified at this time, ZONEMD is not designed for use in large, dynamic zones
    due to the time and resources required for digest calculation. The ZONEMD record
    described in this document is designed so that new digest schemes may be developed
    in the future to support large, dynamic zones.</p>"
