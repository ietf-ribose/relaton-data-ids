abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a mechanism for a host to signal via
    Port\n   Control Protocol (PCP) which connections should be protected against\n
    \  network failures.  These connections will be elected to be subject to\n   high
    availability mechanisms enabled at the network side.\n\n   This approach assumes
    that applications/users have more visibility\n   about sensitive connections rather
    than any heuristic that can be\n   enabled at the network side to guess which
    connections should be\n   secured.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
