abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Internet Integrated Services (IIS) architecture[2] has a\n
    \  fundamental scaling problem in that per flow state is maintained at\n   all
    routers and end-systems supporting a flow.  This draft examines\n   the use of
    aggregation as a technique to reduce the amount of state\n   needed to provide
    IIS, and describes the modifications to RSVP to\n   support aggregation.  In our
    approach, routers at the edge of a\n   region doing aggregation keep detailed
    IIS state, while in the\n   interior of this region, routers keep a greatly reduced
    amount of\n   state.  Packets will be tagged at the edge with scheduling\n   information
    that will be used in place of the detailed IIS state.\n   The aggregation scheme
    described will allow large scale deployment of\n   IIS without overloading routers
    with state and associated processing.\n\t </p>\n      "
