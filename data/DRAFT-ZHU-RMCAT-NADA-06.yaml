abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA) is a novel congestion\n
    \  control scheme for interactive real-time media applications, such as\n   video
    conferencing. In NADA, the sender regulates its sending rate\n   based on either
    implicit or explicit congestion signaling in a\n   consistent manner. As one example
    of explicit signaling, NADA can\n   benefit from explicit congestion notification
    (ECN) markings from\n   network nodes. It also maintains consistent sender behavior
    in the\n   absence of explicit signaling by reacting to queuing delay and packet\n
    \  loss.\n\n   This document describes the overall system architecture for NADA,
    as\n   well as recommended behavior at the sender and the receiver.\n\n\t </p>\n
