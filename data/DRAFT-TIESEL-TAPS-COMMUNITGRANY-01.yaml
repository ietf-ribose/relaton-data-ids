abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides guidelines how to reason about the composition\n
    \  of multi-path aware systems and how to compose the functionality\n   needed
    by stacking existing protocols.  It discusses fundamental\n   mechanisms that
    are used in multi-path systems and the consequences\n   of applying them to different
    granularities of communication units.\n   This document is targeted as consideration
    basis for automation of\n   destination selection, path selection, and transport
    protocol\n   selection.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
