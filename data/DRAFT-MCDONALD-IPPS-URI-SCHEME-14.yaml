abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) over
    HTTPS\n   transport binding and the corresponding 'ipps' URI scheme, that is\n
    \  used to designate the access to the network location of a secure IPP\n   print
    service or a network resource (for example, a print job)\n   managed by such a
    service.\n\n   This memo is an independent submission to the RFC Editor Stream,
    with\n   IETF AD sponsoring, by the Internet Printing Protocol Working Group\n
    \  of the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working Group, as part of their PWG IPP\n   Everywhere
    (PWG 5100.14) project for secure mobile printing with\n   vendor-neutral Client
    software.\n\n   This memo defines an alternate IPP transport binding to that defined\n
    \  in the original IPP URL Scheme (RFC 3510), but this memo does not\n   update
    or obsolete (RFC 3510).\n\n   This memo updates RFC 2910 and RFC 2911.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
