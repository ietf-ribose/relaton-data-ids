abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an OSPF Link-Local-Signaling (LLS)
    TLV to\n   signal the current Geo Coordinates of the OSPF router.  For Point-to-\n
    \  Point (P2)) and Point-to-Multi-Point (P2MP) networks, the Geo\n   Coordinates
    can be used to dynamically computing the cost to\n   neighbors.  This is useful
    both from the standpoint of auto-\n   configuration and situations where the OSPF
    routers are moving.  The\n   Geo Coordinates are also useful for other applications
    such as\n   Traffic Engineering (TE) and network management and can be advertised\n
    \  in the OSPF Router Information (RI) LSA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
