abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) WG is
    defining a\n   set of protocols to inter-connect CDNs, to achieve multiple goals\n
    \  such as extending the reach of a given CDN to areas that are not\n   covered
    by that particular CDN.  One componet that is needed to\n   achieve the goal of
    CDNI is the CDNI Request Routing Footprint &amp;\n   Capabilities Advertisement
    interface (FCI) [RFC7336].  [RFC8008] has\n   defined precisely the semantics
    of FCI and provided guidelines on the\n   FCI protocol, but the exact protocol
    is explicitly outside the scope\n   of that document.  In this document, we define
    an FCI protocol using\n   the Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
