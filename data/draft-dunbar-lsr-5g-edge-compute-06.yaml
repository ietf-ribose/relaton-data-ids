abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes using additional site capacity and preference
    related metrics to influence the SPF and using Flexible Algorithms to indicate
    the topologies those metrics are applied. The purpose is to differentiate multiple
    paths with similar routing distance to one destination in 5G Local Data Network
    (LDN)to achieve optimal performance.</p>"
