abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NOTE: The authors recognize that the statistical models that
    would\n   inform the process are not well understood and that the possibilities\n
    \  to game the system might be unmountable.  Unless we reach more\n   insights
    on how to deal with this details this work is abandoned.\n\n   Sometimes, a DNS
    name is known to be in use in the wild even though\n   it was never properly delegated.
    \ This situation appears\n   particularly, but not only, true in certain domains
    near the root of\n   the tree: people have independently used those non-existent
    top-level\n   domains as private namespaces.  If those names are to be delegated
    in\n   the public DNS, prudence dictates that collisions between the private\n
    \  uses and the public use be minimized.  We outline a procedure to\n   evaluate
    the harm of delegation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
