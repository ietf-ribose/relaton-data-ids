abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IEEE 802.1ah standard [IEEE802.1ah], also known as Provider
    Backbone\n   Bridges (PBB) defines an architecture and bridge protocols for\n
    \  interconnection of multiple Provider Bridge Networks (PBNs). PBB was\n   defined
    in IEEE as a connectionless technology based on multipoint\n   VLAN tunnels. MSTP
    is used as the core control plane for loop\n   avoidance and load balancing. As
    a result, the coverage of the\n   solution is limited by STP scale in the core
    of large service\n   provider networks. PBB on the other hand can be used to attain
    better\n   scalability in terms of number of customer MAC addresses and number\n
    \  of service instances that can be supported.\n\n   Virtual Private LAN Service
    (VPLS) [RFC4664] provides a framework for\n   extending Ethernet LAN services,
    using MPLS tunneling capabilities,\n   through a routed MPLS backbone without
    running (M)STP across the\n   backbone. As a result, VPLS has been deployed on
    a large scale in\n   service provider networks.\n\n   This draft discusses extensions
    to the VPLS PE model required to\n   incorporate desirable PBB components while
    maintaining the Service\n   Provider fit of the initial model.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
