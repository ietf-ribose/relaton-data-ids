abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines how a series of security event tokens (SETs)
    may be delivered to a previously registered receiver using HTTP over TLS. The
    specification defines the metadata the an Event Transmitter uses to describe the
    Event Receiver's HTTP endpoint and the SET token delivery configuration. The specification
    defines how the Event Receiver may check the current configuration metadata and
    delivery status using HTTP GET over TLS. The specification also defines how delivery
    can be assured subject to the SET Token Receiver's need for assurance.</p>"
