abstract:
- content: "<p>MIF hosts normally have multiple provisioning domains or interfaces.
    In some cases, the applications running on the MIF hosts need to select provisioning
    domain or interface based on either user preferences or network polices. There
    is currently no standard ways for the MIF hosts to implement this kind of provisioning
    domain/ interface selection. This document discusses the problem statement of
    provisioning domain/interface control of the MIF hosts.</p>"
