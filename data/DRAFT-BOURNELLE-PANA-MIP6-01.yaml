abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A Mobile IPv6 node needs a home address, a home agent address
    and a\nsecurity association with its home agent.  One of the current\nchallenge
    is to dynamically provide these information to the Mobile\nNode.  This problem
    is known as the Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping\nproblem.  A solution for this is to
    rely on the AAA infrastructure to\nprovide the Home Agent Information to the Network
    Access server\n(NAS).  Then the Mobile Node uses DHCPv6 to get this information.\nThis
    document provides a way for the Mobile Node to get the Home\nAgent information
    by using the PANA protocol instead of DHCPv6.\n\nBefore the authentication phase,
    the PANA Authentication Agent (PAA)\nindicates to the PANA Client (PaC) that it
    can provide him with the\nHome Agent Information.  According to the PANA client's
    response,\nafter the authentication and authorization phase with the AAA\ninfrastructure,
    the PAA will send this information to the PaC.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
