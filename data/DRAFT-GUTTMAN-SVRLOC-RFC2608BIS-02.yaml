abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for
    the\ndiscovery and selection of network services.  Using this protocol,\ncomputers
    using the Internet need little or no static configuration\nof network services
    for network based applications.  This is\nespecially important as computers become
    more portable, and users\nless tolerant or able to fulfill the demands of network
    system\nadministration.  This document updates SLPv2, adding clarifications\nand
    removing features which were neither widely implemented or deemed\nuseful.\n\t
