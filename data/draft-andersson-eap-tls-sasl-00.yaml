abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)mechanism
    for mutual authentication and session key generation in aroaming environment.
    The server authentication and the negotiation ofthe session key is done using
    the PPP EAP Transport Layer SecurityAuthentication Protocol. The user authenticates
    using a SASLmechanism, the SASL authentication being protected by TLS. Animportant
    application discussed in this document is to provide astrong form of authentication
    of access points and stations within anIEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network
    (WLAN), but otherapplications such as LAN access over Bluetooth might also beconsidered
    in the future.</p>"
