abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has
    been\nextended with a Leasequery capability that allows a requestor to\nrequest
    information about DHCPv4 bindings.  That mechanism is limited\nto queries for
    individual bindings.  In some situations individual\nbinding queries may not be
    efficient, or even possible.  This\ndocument expands on the DHCPv4 Leasequery
    protocol to allow for bulk\ntransfer of DHCPv4 address binding data via TCP.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
