abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a method for generating IPv6 Interface Identifiers
    to be used with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), such that addresses
    configured using this method are stable within each subnet, but the Interface
    Identifier changes when hosts move from one network to another. The aforementioned
    method is meant to be an alternative to generating Interface Identifiers based
    on IEEE identifiers, such that the same manageability benefits can be achieved
    without sacrificing the privacy of users.</p>"
