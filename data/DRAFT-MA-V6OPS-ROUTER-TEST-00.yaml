abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces the test for the router and BRAS devices
    on\n   the degree of IPv6 support.  IPv6 functions and performance of the\n   routers
    and BRAS widely deployed in current networks are included in\n   testing items.
    \ It turns out that some specific IPv6 functions and\n   performance are not well-supported
    by the router and BRAS devices.\n   The test results have been discussed to share
    with internet\n   community.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
