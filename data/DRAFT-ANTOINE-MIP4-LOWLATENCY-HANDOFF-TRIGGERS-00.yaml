abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document introduces the use of triggers coming from
    layers\n   higher than the link layer to initiate the Low Latency Handoff in\n
    \  Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4) .  The Low Latency Handoff for MIPv4 assumes\n   availability
    of Layer 2 (L2) triggers that contain Layer 3 (L3)\n   information for the Mobile
    Node (MN) to handoff.  However, the low\n   latency draft does not describe the
    method by which the L2 trigger is\n\n   produced neither does it explicitly describe
    by what mechanism the L3\n   information present in the L2 trigger is acquired.
    \ The Low Latency\n   Handoff for MIPv4 relies on availability of the L2 trigger.
    \ However\n   relying only on the link information to initiate a handoff does
    not\n   generally gather enough information for the MN to handoff to the most\n
    \  suitable available access network.  Information from higher layers\n   such
    as Higher Layer Triggers can be used to command a MN to quickly\n   move from
    one access to another one.  Using Higher Layer Triggers to\n   initiate the handoff
    enables the implementation of policy based\n   handoff to garantee load balancing
    of the wireless networks and\n   Quality of Services to the end users.\n\n\n\t
