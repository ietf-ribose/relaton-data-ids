abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo provides a mechanism whereby messages conforming
    to the\n   MIME specifications [RFC 2045, RFC 2046, RFC 2047, RFC 2048, RFC\n
    \  2049] can convey information not intended for display by the Mail\n   User
    Agent (UA), but for processing (as opposed to display) by an\n   external program.
    \ It specifies a new type of 'Content-Disposition'\n   (defined by [RFC 2183]),
    which is valid for any MIME entity\n   ('message' or 'body part).  When 'body
    part' is referred to in this\n   memo, it is referring to any MIME entity, except
    in section 2.4. This\n   memo is the definition of this type, as specified by
    Section 9 of\n   [RFC 2183].\n\n   This document is intended as an extension to
    MIME.  As such, the\n   reader is assumed to be familiar with the MIME specifications,\n
    \  [RFC 822], and [RFC 2183].  The information presented herein\n   supplements
    but does not replace that found in those documents.\n\t </p>\n      "
