abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a strategy for domain name server operators
    \nto prepare and transition their services for multilingual domain \nnames (IDN
    â€“ Internationalized Domain Names). \nThe IDNX approach accepts that users with
    non-IDN aware applications \nwill be attempting to access multilingual domain
    names.  Hence it is \nthe registry or domain operator's responsibility to provide
    an IDN \nsolution that resolves these issues to make it a seamless transition
    \nexperience for technically unsophisticated users. \nIn essence, the IDNX approach
    embraces a complementary server-side \nimplementation to smooth the transition.
    \ IDNX compliant domain \nservers will successfully resolve IDN requests sent
    via non-IDN aware \napplications, whether they are formatted in local encoding,
    UTF-8 or \nan identifiable variant. \nThe IDNX approach also utilizes a dynamic
    CNAME mechanism to \nprovision for the sub-delegation of multilingual domain names
    to \nhosts running non-IDN aware DNS servers.\n\t </p>\n      "
