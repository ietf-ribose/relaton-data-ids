abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the experiences of a project team at Cray Research,
    Inc., in implementing support for circuit-switched T3 services. While the issues
    discussed may not be directly relevant to the research problems of the Internet,
    they may be interesting to a number of researchers and implementers. This RFC
    provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet
    standard.</p>"
