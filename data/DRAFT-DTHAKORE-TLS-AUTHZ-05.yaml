abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the use of Digital Transmission Content\n
    \  Protection (DTCP) certificates as an authorization data type in the\n   authorization
    extension for the Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n   Protocol.  This is in accordance
    with the guidelines for\n   authorization extensions as specified in [RFC5878].
    \ As with other\n   TLS extensions, this authorization data can be included in
    the client\n   and server Hello messages to confirm that both parties support
    the\n   desired authorization data types.  If supported by both the client\n   and
    the server, DTCP certificates are exchanged in the supplemental\n   data TLS handshake
    message as specified in RFC4680.  This\n   authorization data type extension is
    in support of devices containing\n   DTCP certificates, issued by the Digital
    Transmission Licensing\n   Administrator [DTLA].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
