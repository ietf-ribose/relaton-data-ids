abstract:
  content: "\t <t>TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path perconnection,
    yet multiple paths often exist between peers. Thesimultaneous use of these multiple
    paths for a TCP/IP session wouldimprove resource usage within the network, and
    thus improve userexperience through higher throughput and improved resilience
    tonetwork failure.Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiplepaths
    between peers. This document presents a set of extensions totraditional TCP to
    support multipath operation. The protocol offersthe same type of service to applications
    as TCP - reliable bytestream- and provides the components necessary to establish
    and use multipleTCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.</p>"
