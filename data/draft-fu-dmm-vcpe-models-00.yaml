abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the concept of Virtual Customer Premises Equipment
    (VCPE). Such concept was first proposed in Broadband Forum (BBF) as Network Enhanced
    Residential Gateway (NERG). The VCPE is the Home Agent (HA) of the Mobile Nodes
    (MN) attached to the physical CPE (pCPE). In this document, we explain the motivation
    and advantages of VCPE. Three usecases of VCPE is further discussed in the enterprise
    network, the residential network, and the Internet of Things (IoT) Network. Two
    models of field deployment of VCPE are discussed afterwards. The models of VCPE
    decompose the Control Plane (CP) and the Data Plane (DP), which makes it easier
    for the deployment of the distributed mobility model.</p>"
