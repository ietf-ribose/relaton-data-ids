abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides security methods based on identity based\n
    \  cryptography to protect DHCP messages.  Identity based cryptography\n   is
    a special kind of public key cryptography.  Specifically, an\n   authetication
    protocol based on IBS (identity based signature)\n   algorithms is proposed.  A
    key distribution method adopting IBE (\n   identity based encryption) algorithms
    is also proposed, where key is\n   used as a shared secret in calculating authentication
    information\n   according to authentication protocol specified in RFC 3315.\n\n\t
