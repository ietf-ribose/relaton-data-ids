abstract:
- content: "<p>This document poses open questions in path-aware networking, as a background
    for framing discussions in the Path Aware Networking proposed Research Group (PANRG).
    Path-aware networking has two aspects: the exposure of properties of available
    Internet paths to endpoints and applications running on them, and allowing endpoints
    and applications to use these properties to select paths through the Internet
    for their traffic.</p>"
