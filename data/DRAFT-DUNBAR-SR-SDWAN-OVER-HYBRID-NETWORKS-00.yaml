abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method for end-to-end (E2E) SD-WAN
    paths\n   (most likely encrypted) to traverse specific list of network\n   segments,
    some of which may be legacy networks that do not support\n   SR, to achieve the
    desired optimal E2E quality.\n\n   The method described in this draft uses the
    principle of segment\n   routing to enforce the SD-WAN paths' head ends selecting
    paths\n   traversing through a list of specific nodes of multiple network\n   segments
    without requiring the nodes in each network segments to\n   have the intelligence
    (or maintaining states) of selecting next hop\n   or next domain. Those networks
    over which the SD-WAN path traverse\n   may have different data planes (some maybe
    IPv4, others maybe IPv6\n   or MPLS) and can be owned &amp; managed by different
    network service\n   providers (SP).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
