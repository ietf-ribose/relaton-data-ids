abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Ethernet Virtual Private Networks (EVPN)
    Proxy-ARP/ND function, augmented by the capability of the ARP/ND Extended Community.
    From that perspective this document updates the EVPN specification to provide
    more comprehensive documentation of the operation of the Proxy-ARP/ND function.
    The EVPN Proxy-ARP/ND function and the ARP/ND Extended Community help operators
    of Internet Exchange Points, Data Centers, and other networks deal with IPv4 and
    IPv6 address resolution issues associated with large Broadcast Domains by reducing
    and even suppressing the flooding produced by address resolution in the EVPN network.</p>"
