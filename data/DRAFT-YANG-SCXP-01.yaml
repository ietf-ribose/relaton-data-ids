abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>At present, various security components have appeared. All the\nsecurity
    components should work together to establish a stronger\ndefense architecture
    in the future, so it is necessary for these\ncomponents to communicate with each
    other.  This document describes\nthe Security Components Exchange Protocol (SCXP),
    an\napplication-level protocol for exchanging data between security\ncomponents.
    \ SCXP supports mutual-authentication, integrity,\nconfidentiality and replay
    protection over a connection-oriented\nprotocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
