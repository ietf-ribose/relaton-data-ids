abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Procedures for the measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughput\nin
    MPLS networks are defined in RFC XXXX.  This document describes a\nprofile, i.e.
    a simplified subset, of these procedures that suffices\nto meet the specific requirements
    of MPLS-based transport networks.\n\nThis document is a product of a joint Internet
    Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\nStandardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\nProfile within the IETF MPLS
    and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge\n(PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities\nof a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.\n\n[RFC
    Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and\ninsert the correct
    Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published\nRFC has IETF consensus.]\n\t
