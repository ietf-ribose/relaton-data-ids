abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a framework for the inter-working between\n
    \  Protocol Independent Multicast [PIM] and a leaf-driven P2MP tunnel\n   signaling
    protocol such as [mRSVP-TE] or [mLDP] so that multiple PIM\n   sites around an
    MPLS network can form a single PIM domain without\n   compromising PIM's features,
    scalability, and performance.  \n\n\n   In this document, PIM modes PIM-SM, PIM-SSM,
    and PIM-BIDIR are\n   considered.\n\t </p>\n      "
