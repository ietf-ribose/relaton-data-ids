abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we present a two-round signing variant of FROST, a Flexible
    Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold signature scheme. FROST signatures can be issued
    after a threshold number of entities cooperate to issue a signature, allowing
    for improved distribution of trust and redundancy with respect to a secret key.
    Further, this draft specifies signatures that are compatible with [RFC8032]. However,
    unlike [RFC8032], the protocol for producing signatures in this draft is not deterministic,
    so as to ensure protection against a key-recovery attack that is possible when
    even only one participant is malicious.</p>"
