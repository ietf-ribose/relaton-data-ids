abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Email Address Internationalization (EAI) is implemented
    by\n   allowing UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail headers.\n   UTF8SMTP
    extension of ESMTP takes care that mails with UTF-8\n   characters in SMTP envelope
    and mail headers are not delivered to EAI\n   non-compliant SMTP servers.  This
    document describes mechanism how to\n   keep messages with UTF-8 characters on
    mail headers separated from\n   EAI non-compliant Mail User Agents.  This document
    also describes\n   general requirements for UTF8SMTP Message Store.\n\n\t </p>\n
