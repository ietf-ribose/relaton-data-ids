abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MPLS-SPRING is an MPLS-based source routing paradigm in which
    a\n   sender of a packet is allowed to partially or completely specify the\n   route
    the packet takes through the network by imposing stacked MPLS\n   labels to the
    packet.  To facilitate the incremental deployment of\n   this new technology,
    this document describes a mechanism which allows\n   the outermost LSP be replaced
    by an IP-based tunnel.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
