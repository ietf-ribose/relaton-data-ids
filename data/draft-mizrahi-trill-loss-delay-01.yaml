- content: "<p>Performance Monitoring (PM) is a key aspect of Operations, Administration
    and Maintenance (OAM). It allows network operators to verify the Service Level
    Agreement (SLA) provided to customers, and to detect network anomalies. This document
    specifies mechanisms for Loss Measurement (LM) and Delay Measurement (DM) in TRILL
    networks.</p>"
