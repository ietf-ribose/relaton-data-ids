abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses events occurring in a telephony network
    that \ncould be useful for call related services created in an Internet \nenvironment.
    It also shows one possible implementation of a SPIRITS \nprotocol based on Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2]. The SPIRITS \nworking group has not yet done any
    protocol decisions, so this draft \nis written for informative purpose showing
    that the introduction of \nvirtual SIP user agents (SIP UAs) in a SPIRITS client
    makes it \npossible to realize the services described in the pre-spirits \nimplementations
    document [3].\n\t </p>\n      "
