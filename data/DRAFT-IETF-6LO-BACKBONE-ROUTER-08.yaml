abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Backbone Routers running IPv6 Neighbor Discovery can manage
    multiple\n   wireless links to form a large MultiLink Subnet, but it is more\n
    \  efficient if IPv6 Neighbor Discovery packets are not broadcast over\n   the
    wireless links.  This specification specifies proxy operations\n   for IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery on behalf of devices located on\n   broadcast-inefficient wireless networks.
    \ Backbone Routers placed\n   along the wireless edge of the backbone handle IPv6
    Neighbor\n   Discovery, and route packets on behalf of registered nodes.  Wireless\n
    \  nodes register, or are registered by proxy, to a Backbone Router to\n   establish
    proxy services in a fashion similar to layer-2 association.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
