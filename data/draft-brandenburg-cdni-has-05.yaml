abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents thoughts on the potential impact of supporting
    HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) technologies in Content Distribution Network Interconnection
    (CDNI) scenarios. The intent is to present the authors' analysis of the CDNI-HAS
    problem space and discuss different options put forward by the authors (and by
    others during informal discussions) on how to deal with HAS in the context of
    CDNI. This document has been used as input information during the CDNI working
    group process for making a decision regarding support for HAS.</p>"
