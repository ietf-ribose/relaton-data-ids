abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a resource-oriented approach to cyber
    security\n   information sharing.  Using this approach, a CSIRT or other\n   stakeholder
    may share and exchange representations of cyber security\n   incidents, indicators,
    and other related information as Web-\n   addressable resources.  The transport
    protocol binding is specified\n   as HTTP(S) with a MIME media type of Atom+XML.
    \ An appropriate set of\n   link relation types specific to cyber security information
    sharing is\n   defined.  The resource representations leverage the existing IODEF\n
    \  [RFC5070] and RID [RFC6545] specifications as appropriate.\n   Coexistence
    with deployments that conform to existing specifications\n   including RID [RFC6545]
    and Transport of Real-time Inter-network\n   Defense (RID) Messages over HTTP/TLS
    [RFC6546] is supported via\n   appropriate use of HTTP status codes.\n\n\t </p>\n
