abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the security model for the OAuth\nauthorization
    system, which allows a party that holds some\nauthorization to delegate a subset
    of that authorization to another\nparty, without requiring either party to disclose
    its credentials to\nthe other.  In this document, we describe a set of design\nconstraints,
    a high-level work flow for establishing authorizations\nsubject to those constraints,
    and set of security requirements for\nprotocols that implement this model.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
