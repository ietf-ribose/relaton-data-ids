abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the framework of a mechanism for use in conjunction
    with link state routing protocols which prevents the transient loops which would
    otherwise occur during topology changes. It does this by correctly sequencing
    the forwarding information base (FIB) updates on the routers. This mechanism can
    be used in the case of non-urgent link or node shutdowns and restarts or link
    metric changes. It can also be used in conjunction with a fast re-route mechanism
    which converts a sudden link or node failure into a non-urgent topology change.
    This is possible where a complete repair path is provided for all affected destinations.
    After a non-urgent topology change, each router computes a rank that defines the
    time at which it can safely update its FIB. A method for accelerating this loop-free
    convergence process by the use of completion messages is also described. The technology
    described in this document has been subject to extensive simulation using real
    network topologies and costs, and pathological convergence behaviour. However
    mechanism described in this document are purely illustrative of the general approach
    and do not constitute a protocol specification. The document represents a snapshot
    of the work of the Routing Area Working Group at the time of publication and is
    published as a document of record. Further work is needed before implementation
    or deployment.</p>"
