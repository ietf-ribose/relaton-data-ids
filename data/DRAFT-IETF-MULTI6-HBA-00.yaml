abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a mechanism to provide a secure binding
    between\n   the multiple addresses with different prefixes available to a host\n
    \  within a multihomed site.  The main idea is that information about\n   the
    multiple prefixes is included within the addresses themselves.\n   This is achieved
    by generating the interface identifiers of the\n   addresses of a host as hashes
    of the available prefixes and a random\n   number.  Then, the multiple addresses
    are generated by prepending the\n   different prefixes to the generated interface
    identifiers.  The\n   result is a set of addresses, called Hash Based Addresses
    (HBAs),\n   that are inherently bound.\n\t </p>\n      "
