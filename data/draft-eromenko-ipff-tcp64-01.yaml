abstract:
- content: "<p>This document attempts to modernize TCP protocol for new reality, faster
    bandwidth, encryption-optimization and optional checksums, which is required for
    Identity-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) compatibility. This extension is backwards
    compatible with the original TCP specification during session establishment, but
    not compatible during the rest of the session nor with deployed middleboxes.</p>"
