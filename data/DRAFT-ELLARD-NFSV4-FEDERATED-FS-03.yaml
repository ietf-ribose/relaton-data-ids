abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes and lists the functional requirements of
    a\nfederated file system and defines related terms.  Our intent is to\nuse this
    draft as a starting point and refine it, with input and\nfeedback from the file
    system community and other interested parties,\nuntil we reach general agreement.
    \ We will then begin, again with the\nhelp of any interested parties, to define
    standard, open federated\nfile system protocols that satisfy these requirements
    and are\nsuitable for implementation and deployment.\n\t </p>\n      "
