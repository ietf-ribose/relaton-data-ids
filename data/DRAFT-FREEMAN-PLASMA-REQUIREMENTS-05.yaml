abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are many situations where organizations want to protect\n
    \  information with robust access control, either for implementation of\n   intellectual
    property right protections, enforcement of contractual\n   confidentiality agreements
    or because of legal regulations.  The\n   Enhanced Security Services (ESS) for
    S/MIME defines an access control\n   mechanism for email which is enforced by
    the recipient's client after\n   decryption of the message. The ESS mechanism
    therefore is dependent\n   on the correct access policy configuration of every
    recipient's\n   client. This mechanism also provides full access to the data to
    all\n   recipients prior to the access control check, this is considered to\n
    \  be inadequate due to the difficulty in demonstrating policy\n   compliance.\n\n
    \  This document lays out the deficiencies of the current ESS security\n   label,
    and presents requirements for a new model for doing/providing\n   access control
    to messages where the access check is performed prior\n   to message content decryption.
    This new model also does not require\n   policy configuration on the client to
    simplify deployment and\n   compliance verification.\n\n   The proposed model
    additionally provides a method where non-X.509\n   certificate credentials can
    be used for encryption/decryption of\n   S/MIME messages.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
