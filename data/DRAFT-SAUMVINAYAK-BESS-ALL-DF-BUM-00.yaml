abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Designated forwarder concept is leveraged to prevent looping
    of\n   BUM traffic into tenant network sourced across NVO fabric for\n   multihoming
    deployments.  [RFC7432] defines a prelimn approach to\n   select the DF for an
    ES,VLAN or ES,Vlan Group panning across multiple\n   NVE's.  [RFC8584] makes the
    election logic more robust and fine\n   grained inculcating fair election of DF
    handling most of the\n   prevalent use-cases.  This document presents a deployment
    problem and\n   a corresponding solution which cannot be easily resolve by rules\n
    \  mentioned in [RFC7432] and [RFC8584].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
