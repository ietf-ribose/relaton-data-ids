abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies two approaches by which multimedia data
    (e.g.,MBone conferences), transmitted using the Real-Time Protocol (RTP), maybe
    recorded to Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) files. The first methodrequires a
    minimum amount of buffering at the recording station butresults in recordings
    which identically preserve the received contentincluding out of order packets,
    network ''jitter'', etc. The secondapproach requires buffering at the recording
    station but results inenhanced recordings (i.e., higher percentage of correctly
    orderedpackets, elimination of a percentage of received jitter, potentialrecovery
    of a percentage of lost packets). Both approaches record allreceived RTP content
    and the relevant subset of RTCP information. Thisrecording occurs transparently
    to the MBone conference or RTP session,and does not involve any alterations to
    normal RTP, RTCP, or ASF use.</p>"
