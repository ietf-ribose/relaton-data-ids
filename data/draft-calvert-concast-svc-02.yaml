abstract:
  content: "<p>Concast is a many-to-one best-effort network service that allows areceiver
    to treat a group of senders as a single entity, in much thesame way that IP multicast
    allows a sender to treat a group ofreceivers as one. Each concast datagram delivered
    to a receiver isderived from (possibly many) datagrams sent by different members
    ofthe concast group to that receiver, according to a 'mergespecification'. Concast
    allows the semantics of this mergingoperation to vary to suit the needs of different
    applications. Thisdocument describes the concast service and presents a framework
    fordefining merge semantics. It also describes the processing ofconcast datagrams
    by concast-capable routers and hosts. The concastsignaling protocol (CSP), an
    integral part of the concast service, isspecified in a separate document.</p>"
