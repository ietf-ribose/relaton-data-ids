abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), randomizing
    the\n   interface identifier (IID) is a common practice to promote privacy.\n
    \  If there are a very large number of nodes, as has been discussed in\n   several
    use cases, the effect will to proportionately increase the\n   number of IIDs.
    \ A duplicate address detection (DAD) cycle is needed\n   for each configured
    IID, introducing more and more overhead into the\n   network.  Each failed DAD
    requires the initiating node to regenerate\n   a new IID and undergo the DAD cycle
    again.  This document proposes an\n   optimized approach when higher privacy is
    required in a given network\n   by allowing a 6LBR (6LoWPAN Border Router) to
    provide a unique IID,\n   avoiding any potential duplication.  Such practice also
    prevents\n   failure of time-critical applications, by enabling 6LBR to provide
    a\n   unique IID, in case of address collision.\n\n   Further improvements are
    proposed to enable multiple concurrent DAD\n   cycles, and to return the randomized
    IID from 6LBR to 6LN in a space-\n   efficient manner.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
