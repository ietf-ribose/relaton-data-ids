abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>While the device management protocol NETCONF is generally well
    served\nby BEEP, there are environments where additional transports are\ndesirable.
    \ The binding to SOAP described here may find application\nwhere SOAP-based tools
    and implementations are prevalent or where the\nnetwork configuration favors HTTP.
    \ When used with multiple HTTP\nconnections, SOAP over HTTP is sufficient for
    all NETCONF features\nexcept those involving asynchronous notification.\n\t </p>\n
