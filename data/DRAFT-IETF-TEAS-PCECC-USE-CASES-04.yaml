abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of a
    Software-\n   Defined Networking (SDN) system.  It can compute optimal paths for\n
    \  traffic across a network and can also update the paths to reflect\n   changes
    in the network or traffic demands.  PCE was developed to\n   derive paths for
    MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), which are supplied\n   to the head end of the
    LSP using the Path Computation Element\n   Communication Protocol (PCEP).\n\n
    \  SDN has a broader applicability than signaled MPLS traffic-engineered\n   (TE)
    networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range\n   of use cases
    including static LSPs, segment routing (SR), Service\n   Function Chaining (SFC),
    and most forms of a routed or switched\n   network.  It is, therefore, reasonable
    to consider PCEP as a control\n   protocol for use in these environments to allow
    the PCE to be fully\n   enabled as a central controller.\n\n   This document describes
    general considerations for PCECC deployment\n   and examines its applicability
    and benefits, as well as its\n   challenges and limitations, through a number
    of use cases.  PCEP\n   extensions required for stateful PCE usage are covered
    in separate\n   documents.\n\n   This is a living document to catalogue the use
    cases for PCECC.\n   There is currently no intention to publish this work as an
    RFC.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
