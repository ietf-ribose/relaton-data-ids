abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   QUIC connection IDs allow continuation of connections across
    address/\n   port 4-tuple changes, and can store routing information for stateless\n
    \  or low-state load balancers.  They also can prevent linkability of\n   connections
    across deliberate address migration through the use of\n   protected communications
    between client and server.  This creates\n   issues for load-balancing intermediaries.
    \ This specification\n   standardizes methods for encoding routing information
    given a small\n   set of configuration parameters.  This framework also enables
    offload\n   of other QUIC functions to trusted intermediaries, given the explicit\n
    \  cooperation of the QUIC server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
