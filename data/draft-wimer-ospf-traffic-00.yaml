abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF is a link-state IP interior routing protocol specified in [1].
    Several different extensions to OSPF have been proposed [2,3,5] to support Traffic
    Engineering [4] and Quality of Service routing [5]. This document acknowledges
    all of this earlier work and proposes that a single style of protocol encoding
    be used for all of the parameters involved. This document employs the OSPF Opaque
    LSA Option [6] and the TVLV mechanism proposed in [3] to encode additional parameters
    describing information about the state of an OSPF network. This additional information
    is useful for Traffic Engineering and QoS-based routing.</p>"
