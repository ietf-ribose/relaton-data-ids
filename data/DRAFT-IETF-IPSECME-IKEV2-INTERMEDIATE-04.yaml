abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This documents defines a new exchange, called Intermediate
    Exchange,\n   for the Internet Key Exchange protocol Version 2 (IKEv2).  This\n
    \  exchange can be used for transferring large amount of data in the\n   process
    of IKEv2 Security Association (SA) establishment.\n   Introducing Intermediate
    Exchange allows re-using existing IKE\n   Fragmentation mechanism, that helps
    to avoid IP fragmentation of\n   large IKE messages, but cannot be used in the
    initial IKEv2 exchange.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
