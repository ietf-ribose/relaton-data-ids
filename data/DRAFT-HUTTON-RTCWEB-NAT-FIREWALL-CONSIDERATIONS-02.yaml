abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes mechanism to enable media stream\n
    \  establishment for Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (WebRTC) in\n   the
    presence of network address translators, firewalls and HTTP\n   proxies.  HTTP
    proxy and firewall deployed in many private network\n   domains introduce obstacles
    to the successful establishment of media\n   stream via WebRTC.  This document
    examines some of these deployment\n   scenarios and develops requirements on the
    web browsers designed to\n   provide the best possible chance of media connectivity
    between WebRTC\n   peers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
