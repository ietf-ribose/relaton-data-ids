abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides a framework for group key management for
    \nmulticast security, motivated by three main considerations, namely \nthe multicast
    application, scalability and trust-relationships among \nentities.  It introduces
    two planes corresponding to the network \nentities and functions important to
    multicasting and to security. The \nkey management plane consists of two hierarchy-levels
    in the form of \na single 'trunk region' (inter-region) and one or more 'leaf
    regions' \n(intra-region). The advantages of the framework among others \nare
    that it is scalable, it has reduced complexity and allows the \nindependence in
    regions of group key management.\n\t </p>\n      "
