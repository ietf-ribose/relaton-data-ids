abstract:
  content: "<p>Traffic localization for peer-to-peer applications is currentlydiscussed
    by the IETF ALTO working group. The protocol specificationitself is discussed
    and some issues about load reduction for ALTO/P4Pservers are also discussed, but
    mainly on the transport level (i.e.,caching of traffic localization data) and
    some data aggregation byusing macros that comprise a number of IP prefixes. However,
    thereare no considerations about reducing the query load to the ALTOserver. This
    memo aims at giving informational guidance to P2Papplications implementers on
    how reduce the query load for ALTO.</p>"
