abstract:
- content: "<p>Mapping Services in Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) networks
    are key to proper LISP forwarding operation. When considering the deployment of
    LISP at large scale, these Mapping Services are even more crucial for the sake
    of the LISP forwarding efficiency. This document introduces two additional LISP
    messages that are meant to facilitate the dynamic discovery of Mapping Systems,
    improve Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITR) recovery times and optimize the solicitation
    of the LISP Mapping System as a function of the ITR location, in particular.</p>"
