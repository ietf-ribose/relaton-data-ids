  content: "\t <t>This document discusses the use of L2TP for establishing PPVPNs.
    Itproposes to use L2TP for VPN membership, topology discovery, and as atunneling
    mechanism. The basic idea is based on leveraging the inherentstrengths of L2TP
    for tunneling traffic, and extend the same advantagesto PPVPNS. The mechanism
    is applicable for both Layer2 and Layer3PPVPNs.</p>"
