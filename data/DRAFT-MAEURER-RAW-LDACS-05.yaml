abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an overview of the architecture of the
    L-band\n   Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS), which provides
    a\n   secure, scalable and spectrum efficient terrestrial data link for\n   civil
    aviation.  LDACS is a scheduled, reliable multi-application\n   cellular broadband
    system with support for IPv6.  LDACS shall provide\n   a data link for IP network-based
    aircraft guidance.  High reliability\n   and availability for IP connectivity
    over LDACS are therefore\n   essential.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
