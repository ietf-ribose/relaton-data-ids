abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Consider a service provider network that offers Optical Virtual
    \nPrivate Network (OVPN) service. An important goal in the OVPN \nservice is the
    ability to support what is known as _single end \nprovisioning_, where addition
    of a new port to a given OVPN would \ninvolve configuration/provisioning changes
    only on the devices \nconnected to that port. Another important goal in the OVPN
    service \nis the ability to establish/terminate an optical connection between
    \na pair of (existing) ports within an OVPN without involving \nconfiguration/provisioning
    changes in any of the provider devices. \nIn this document we describe a set of
    mechanisms that accomplishes \nthese goals.\n\t </p>\n      "
