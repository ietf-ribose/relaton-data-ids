abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The University of Tokyo (UOT) is currently performing a demonstration\n
    \  experiment in COMMA House, the experimental smart-house owned by UOT\n   and
    used as a connected house.  The things installed in the house\n   (Things) are
    operated using applications on smartphones and other\n   devices.  The various
    Things in the smart-house are operated online\n   via a Web API that has been
    created as a prototype.  This report is\n   an overview of the experimental demonstration,
    which is gradually\n   clarifying that Web API should be effective for solving
    issues for\n   IoT.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
