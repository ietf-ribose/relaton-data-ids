abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs) supporting Scalable Video
    Coding\n   (SVC) typically parse the RTP payload in the forwarding plane, and\n
    \  often utilize codec-specific control messages within the control\n   plane.
    \ As a result, the control and/or forwarding planes of these\n   implementations
    need to be modified (sometimes substantially) in\n   order to support additional
    video codecs.  With SFUs now supporting\n   VP8 in addition to H.264/SVC, and
    with additional video codecs\n   expected to become popular, the inflexibility
    of SFU designs that\n   depend on RTP payload parsing has become increasingly
    apparent.  In\n   addition, these designs cannot function where the RTP payload
    is\n   inaccessible, such as when it is encrypted with a key not available\n   to
    the SFU.  Based on a summary of SFU implementation practice, this\n   document
    develops requirements for codec-independent SFUs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
