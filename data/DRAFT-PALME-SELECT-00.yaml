abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The SELECT protocol allows Internet users to supply their ratings
    of\nInternet documents, and to use ratings provided by other users to\nfilter
    and select what to read In particular, SELECT supports so-called\ncollaborative
    filtering. By this is meant that the filtering and\nselection for a particular
    user is made based on ratings provided by\nspecial groups of raters, such as peer
    groups, people with similar\nvalues, interests and expertise as the person for
    whom the selecting\nand filtering is done.\n\nThe SELECT functionality is downwards
    compatible with PICS [PICS 1,\nPICS 2], but a major difference is that while PICS
    is mainly oriented\ntowards keeping out unsuitable information from children\n(blackballing),
    SELECT is mainly oriented towards helping people find\nthe best and most valuable
    information for them on the Internet\n(goldballing). A syntactical difference
    from PICS is that the encodings\nin SELECT are using the XML encoding format.\n\t
