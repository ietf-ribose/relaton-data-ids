abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the promising deployment scenarios for Multipath TCP
    (MPTCP)\n   is to enable a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) that is connected
    to\n   multiple networks (e.g., DSL, LTE, WLAN) to optimize the usage of\n   such
    resources, thereby providing better serviceability overall\n   (including whenever
    the CPE fails to connect to one of the access\n   networks).  This document specifies
    a MPTCP profile for such\n   deployments in network regions that are firewall-
    and NAT-free.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
