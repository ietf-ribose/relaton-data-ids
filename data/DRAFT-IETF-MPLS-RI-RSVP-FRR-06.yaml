abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RSVP-TE relies on periodic refresh of RSVP messages to synchronize\n
    \  and maintain the Label Switched Path (LSP) related states along the\n   reserved
    path.  In the absence of refresh messages, the LSP-related\n   states are automatically
    deleted.  Reliance on periodic refreshes and\n   refresh timeouts are problematic
    from the scalability point of view.\n   The number of RSVP-TE LSPs that a router
    needs to maintain has been\n   growing in service provider networks and the implementations
    should\n   be capable of handling increase in LSP scale.\n\n   RFC 2961 specifies
    mechanisms to eliminate the reliance on periodic\n   refresh and refresh timeout
    of RSVP messages, and enables a router to\n   increase the message refresh interval
    to values much longer than the\n   default 30 seconds defined in RFC 2205.  However,
    the protocol\n   extensions defined in RFC 4090 for supporting Fast ReRoute (FRR)\n
    \  using bypass tunnels implicitly rely on short refresh timeouts to\n   cleanup
    stale states.\n\n   In order to eliminate the reliance on refresh timeouts, the
    routers\n   should unambiguously determine when a particular LSP state should
    be\n   deleted.  Coupling LSP state with the corresponding RSVP-TE signaling\n
    \  adjacencies as recommended in RFC 8370 will apply in scenarios other\n   than
    RFC 4090 FRR using bypass tunnels.  In scenarios involving RFC\n   4090 FRR using
    bypass tunnels, additional explicit tear down messages\n   are necessary.  Refresh-interval
    Independent RSVP FRR (RI-RSVP-FRR)\n   extensions specified in this document consists
    of procedures to\n   enable LSP state cleanup that are essential in scenarios
    not covered\n   by procedures defined in RSVP-TE Scaling Recommendations.  Hence,\n
    \  this document updates the procedures defined in RFC 4090 to support\n   Refresh-interval
    Independent RSVP (RI-RSVP) capability specified in\n   RFC 8370.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
