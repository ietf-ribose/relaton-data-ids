abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a safe means to register delivery paths
    used\nby a domain's messages.  Message handling might be negatively\naffected
    without an apparent relationship between the sending system\nand the various email
    related source domains contain within either\nthe message envelope or the message
    itself.  Name based associations\ncan be achieved within a single DNS transaction.
    \ The alternative has\nbeen to assemble a list of IP addresses for all systems
    employed to\nsend messages for a domain.  The IP address list approach may require\nhundreds
    of DNS transactions that endanger the network.  The safer\nname based method accommodates
    an unlimited number of sending\nsystems, without the overhead and size issues
    created by a list of IP\naddresses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
