abstract:
- content: "<p>The generation of BGP adj-rib-in, local-rib or adj-rib-out comes from
    BGP route exchange and route policy processing. BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
    provides the monitoring of BGP adj-rib-in [RFC7854], BGP local-rib [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-local-rib]
    and BGP adj-rib-out [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-adj-rib-out]. By monitoring these BGP RIB's
    the full state of the network is visible, but how route-policies affect the route
    propagation or changes BGP attributes is still not. This document describes a
    method of using BMP to record the trace data on how BGP routes are (not) changed
    under the process of route policies.</p>"
