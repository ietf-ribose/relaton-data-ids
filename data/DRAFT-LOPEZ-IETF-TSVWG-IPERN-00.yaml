abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo introduces an architecture, called IP-ERN, which
    allows\n   Explicit Rate Notification (ERN) protocols to be inter-operable with\n
    \  current IP-based networks.  IP-ERN is based on the execution of both\n   End-to-End
    (E2E) and ERN protocols at the end hosts.  The resulting\n   E2E-ERN protocol
    provides inter and intra protocol fairness and\n   benefits from all ERN advantages
    when possible.  We detail the\n   principle of this novel architecture, which
    is compliant with every\n   TCP feature, as well as IP-in-IP tunneling solutions.
    \ In particular,\n   IP-ERN is an alternative to splitting Performance Enhancement\n
    \  Proxies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
