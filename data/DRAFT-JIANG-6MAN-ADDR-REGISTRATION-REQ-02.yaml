abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, node self-generated
    \naddresses are notionally conflicted with the network managed address \narchitecture.
    These addresses need to be registered in the networking \nmanagement plate for
    the purposes of central address administration. \nThis document discusses the
    requirements of address registration and \nanalyzes the possible solutions.\n\t
