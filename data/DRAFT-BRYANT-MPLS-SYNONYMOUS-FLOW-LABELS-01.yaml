abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [Editor's note - there was a comment that synonymous was not
    the\n   right term because synonymous implied a greater degree of\n   interchangeability
    than is actually the case (there is only one way\n   interchangeability).  I have
    looked for other terms, and so far I\n   have only come up with enhanced and multi-purpose,
    but they are not\n   quite right either.  I plan to continue with the term unless
    anyone\n   has a better idea.]\n\n   This document describes a method of providing
    flow identification\n   information when making RFC6374 performance measurements.
    \ This\n   allows RFC6374 measurements to be made on multi-point to point LSPs\n
    \  and allows the measurement of flows within an MPLS construct using\n   RFC6374.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
