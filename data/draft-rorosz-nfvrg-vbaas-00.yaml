abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Function Virtualization (NFV) promises the delivery of flexible
    chaining of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) with portability, elasticity,
    guaranteed performance, reliability among others. Service providers expect similar
    behavior from NFV as their current appliances based infrastructure, however, with
    the ease and flexibility of operation and cost effectiveness. Managing for predictable
    performance in virtualized environments is far from straightforward. Considering
    resource provisioning, selection of an NFV Infrastructure Point of Presence to
    host a VNF or allocation of resources (e.g., virtual CPUs, memory) needs to be
    done over virtualized (abstracted and simplified) resource views. In order to
    support orchestration decisions, we argue that a framework for VNF benchmarking
    is need.</p>"
