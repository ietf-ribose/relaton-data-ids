abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) works by validating so
    called\n   chains of authority.  The start of these chains of authority are\n
    \  usually public keys that are anchored in the DNS clients.  These keys\n   are
    known as the so called trust anchors.\n\n   This memo describes a method how these
    client trust anchors can be\n   replaced using the DNS validation and querying
    mechanisms (in-band)\n   when the key pairs used for signing by zone owner are
    rolled.\n\n   This memo also describes a method to establish the validity of trust\n
    \  anchors for initial configuration, or priming, using out of band\n   mechanisms.\n\t
