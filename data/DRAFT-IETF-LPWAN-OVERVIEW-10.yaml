abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) are wireless technologies
    with characteristics such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth, possibly very
    small packet and application-layer data sizes, and long battery life operation.
    \ This memo is an informational overview of the set of LPWAN technologies being
    considered in the IETF and of the gaps that exist between the needs of those technologies
    and the goal of running IP in LPWANs.\n\t </p>\n      "
