abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Internet applications have a need for object-based security mechanisms
    in addition to security mechanisms at the network layer or transport layer. In
    the past, the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) has provided a binary secure
    object format based on ASN.1. Over time, the use of binary object encodings such
    as ASN.1 has been overtaken by text-based encodings, for example JavaScript Object
    Notation. This document defines a set of use cases and requirements for a secure
    object format encoded using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), drawn from a variety
    of application security mechanisms currently in development.</p>"
