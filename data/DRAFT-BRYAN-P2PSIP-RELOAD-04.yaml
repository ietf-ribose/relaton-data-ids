abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD),
    a\npeer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet.  A P2P\nsignaling
    protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage and\nmessaging service
    between a set of cooperating peers that form the\noverlay network.  RELOAD is
    designed to support a P2P Session\nInitiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can
    be utilized by other\napplications with similar requirements by defining new usages
    that\nspecify the kinds of data that must be stored for a particular\napplication.
    \ RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate\nenrollment service that
    provides unique identities.  NAT traversal is\na fundamental service of the protocol.
    \ RELOAD also allows access\nfrom \"client\" nodes which do not need to route
    traffic or store data\nfor others.\n\t </p>\n      "
