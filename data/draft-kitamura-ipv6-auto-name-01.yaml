abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses notion and actual mechanisms of Corresponding
    Auto Names for IPv6 Addresses. With this mechanism, all IPv6 addresses (even if
    they are link-local scoped addresses) can obtain their own Names, and it will
    be able to use Names anywhere instead of IPv6 Addresses. IPv6 address is too long
    and complicated to remember, and it is very nuisance to type a literal IPv6 address
    manually as an argument of applications. Also, it is very difficult for human
    beings to tell which IPv6 address is set to which actual IPv6 node. In this sense,
    literal IPv6 address information can be called meaningless information for human
    beings. In order to solve above problems and to make the information meaningful,
    mechanisms called Corresponding Auto Names for IPv6 addresses is introduced. They
    will become human friendly information. By applying a simple naming rule to the
    Auto Names (e.g., use the same Auto Name Prefix for IPv6 addresses that are set
    to the same interface (node)), this will contribute to help people to understand
    which IPv6 address / Name indicates which actual IPv6 node and provide meaningful
    information.</p>"
