abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses how to build the large-scale mobile IPv6
    \  \nnetwork along with the MPLS network. It proposes that CR-LDP/RSVP-TE \ncan
    be applied to set up the QoS guaranteed Label switched path (LSP) \ntunnels between
    an LER of mobile node and an LER of correspondent \nnode. It means that the IPv6-in-IPv6
    tunnels can be replaced by one \nor multiple LSPs on the MPLS network. This follows
    design principles \nsuch as idle mobile node consideration and QoS guarantee,
    smooth \nhandoff, no change of Mobile IPv6 etc.\n\t </p>\n      "
