abstract:
- content: "<p>The 'Internet X.500 Schema' defines an RFC-822 email address attribute
    of a person's entry, rfc822Mailbox (aka 'Mail'), but it does not address the issues
    involved in routing RFC-822-based email within an administrative domain served
    by an X.500/LDAP-based directory service. Significantly, it doesn't delineate
    between a person's publicaly 'advertised' or 'promoted' email address and the
    actual 'internal to the administrative domain' address for the person. This memo
    illustrates an object class and an attendant attribute we use at Stanford University
    to solve this issue. This scheme provides us with flexible, simple to implement,
    distributed routing of RFC-822-based email to people represented by entries within
    our directory service. The LDAP-enabled version of sendmail we use is freely available.
    Additionally, we anticipate that the Internet community will devise conventions
    and perhaps support a process for facilitating multi-vendor directory utilization.
    We present an anticipated tenet and goals.</p>"
