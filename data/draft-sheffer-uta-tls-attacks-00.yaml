abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the last few years there have been several serious attacks on
    TLS, including attacks on its most commonly used ciphers and modes of operation.
    This document summarizes these attacks, with the goal of motivating generic and
    protocol-specific recommendations on the usage of TLS and DTLS.</p>"
