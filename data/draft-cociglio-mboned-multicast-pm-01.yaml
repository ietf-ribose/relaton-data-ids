abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines a method to accomplish performance monitoringmeasurements
    on live IP flows, including packet loss, one-way delayand jitter. The proposed
    method is applicable to both unicast andmulticast traffic, but only IP multicast
    streams are considered inthis document. The method can be implemented using tools
    andfeatures already available on IP routers and does not require anyprotocol extension.
    For this reason, it does not raise anyinteroperability issue. However, the method
    could be furtherimproved by means of some extension to existing protocols, but
    thisaspect is left for further study and it is out of the scope of thedocument.</p>"
