abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the typical usage and communication protocolof
    a client/server shared registry system for management of domainname registrations.
    The system described is a \"thick registry\"system, providing support for the
    storage and management of both thetechnical and the registrant contact information
    concerning domainregistrations. The system relies on the existing HTTP and HTTPSinfrastructure
    for transport and secure transfer to avoid having toimplement a dedicated protocol
    and server environment. A bespoke XMLformat is used to communicate between clients
    and the SRS server.Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the author:matt@nzrs.net.nz</p>"
