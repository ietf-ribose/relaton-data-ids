abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Ident protocol [RFC-1413], specifies a method for a host to\n
    \  request from a remote host an assertion of an identifier associated\n   with
    a TCP connection between the two hosts.  This memo specifies\n   extensions to
    Ident to support strong (i.e., cryptographic)\n   authentication methods.  The
    extensions are based on the Simple\n   Authentication and Security Layer [RFC-2222].\n\t
    </p>\n      "
