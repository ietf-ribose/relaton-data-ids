abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new approach for realizing classical L3VPN
    (vpnv4/vpnv6/6PE/6VPE) over Segment Routing (SR) networks. It significantly improves
    scalability and convergence of the L3VPN control plane. Furthermore, it naturally
    brings the benefits of All- Active multi-homing support to the classical L3VPN.</p>"
