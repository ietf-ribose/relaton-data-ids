abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document explores how a server can send particular responses\n
    \  that are authoritative for an origin, when the server itself is not\n   authoritative
    for that origin.  For now, the appendices containing\n   use cases and requirements
    should be treated as more confident than\n   the proposal itself.\n\n\t </p>\n
