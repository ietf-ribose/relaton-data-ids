abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
    paths by encoding an ordered list of instructions, called "segments". The SR architecture
    can be implemented over an MPLS data plane as well as an IPv6 data plane. Currently,
    Path Segment has been defined to identify an SR path in SR-MPLS networks, and
    is used for various use-cases such as end-to- end SR Path Protection and Performance
    Measurement (PM) of an SR path. This document defines the Path Segment to identify
    an SRv6 path in an IPv6 network.</p>
