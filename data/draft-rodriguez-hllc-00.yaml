- content: "<p>The great advance in telecommunications techniques to increase the
    level of reliability on the physical layer (Packet Loss) has made a tremendous
    contribution to the way higher layer protocols are designed nowadays. The High-Level
    Logical Link Control (HLLC) is intended for use as a highly reliable and fast
    host-to-host protocol between hosts current packet-switched computer communication
    networks. This document describes the functions to be performed by the High-Level
    Logical Link Control, the program that implements it, and its interface to programs
    or users that require its services.</p>"
