abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a new BGP NLRI encoding format that can
    be used\n   to distribute traffic flow specifications.  This allows the routing\n
    \  system to propagate information regarding more-specific components of\n   the
    traffic aggregate defined by an IP destination prefix.\n\n   Additionally it defines
    two applications of that encoding format.\n   One that can be used to automate
    inter-domain coordination of traffic\n   filtering, such as what is required in
    order to mitigate\n   (distributed) denial of service attacks.  And a second application
    to\n   traffic filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service.\n\n   The information
    is carried via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP),\n   thereby reusing protocol
    algorithms, operational experience and\n   administrative processes such as inter-provider
    peering agreements.\n\t </p>\n      "
