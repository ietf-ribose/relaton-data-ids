abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a limited flooding approach to address the
    \nproblem of routing scalability in link state IGPs. The solution is \nbased on
    decomposition  of a routing area into 'zones' and the \nrestriction of the exchange
    of routing information between zones.  \nThis approach introduces an extra level
    in the isolation of \nknowledge within a routing domain. The advantage of this
    solution is \nthat it considerably decreases the amount of information flooded
    in \nlink state advertisements and reduces the size of the link-state \ndatabase
    (and traffic engineering entries) on network elements \nutilizing link state protocols.
    \  The technique presented in this \ndocument has been particularized to OSPF
    in order to make the \ndiscussion practical and concrete. However, the underlying
    concepts \nare very general and similar modifications can be easily applied to
    \nother IGPs, such as ISIS.  \n    \n\t </p>\n      "
