abstract:
- content: "<p>Service providers are exploring the edge computing to achieve better
    response time, control over data and carbon energy saving by moving the computing
    services towards the edge of the network in 5G MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing)
    scenarios, virtualized central office, and others. Providing services by sharing
    computing resources from multiple edges is an emerging concept that is becoming
    more useful for computationally intensive tasks. Ideally, services should be computationally
    balanced using service-specific metrics instead of simply dispatching the service
    in a static way, e.g., to the geographically closest edge since this may cause
    unbalanced usage of computing resources at edges which further degrades user experience
    and system utilization. This draft provides an overview of scenarios and problems
    associated with realizing such scenarios. The document identifies several key
    areas which require more investigations in terms of architecture and protocol
    to achieve balanced computing and networking resource utilization among edges
    providing the services.</p>"
