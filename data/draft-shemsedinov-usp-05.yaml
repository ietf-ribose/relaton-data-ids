    protocol called the USP. This protocol is the maximally generalized way of client/server
    interactions in distributed systems of object- oriented, hierarchical, relational
    or hybrid data model. USP treats such interaction as remote procedure calls. This
    document contains specification of calls, responses and events of USP including
    the complex structures' coding needed for representation of the objects. Also
    URI schema of USP is considered.</p>"
