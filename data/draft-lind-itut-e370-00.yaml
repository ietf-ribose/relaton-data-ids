abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the current thinking of the collaborators
    ofITU-T Question 10/2, 'Management and development of PSTN-basedtelecommunication
    services,' about service principles when publiccircuit switched international
    telecommunication networks interworkwith IP-based networks. This document contains
    most of the text(there has been some rearrangement of the text) from draft newRecommendation
    E.370 [1], starting from section 3 of this InternetDraft, which was determined
    to be stable at the March 2000 meetingof Study Group 2. It may be approved by
    the members of the ITU,subject to written comments received from those members,
    at ameeting of the Study Group (or its successor) in early 2001(provisionally
    23-26 January 2001). It is hoped that this documentwill further the collaborative
    efforts between Study Group 2 and thevarious working groups of the IETF.</p>"
