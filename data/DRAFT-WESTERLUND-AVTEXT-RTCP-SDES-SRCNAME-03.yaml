abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new Source Description (SDES) item
    called\n   SRCNAME, which uniquely identifies a single media source, like a\n
    \  camera or a microphone.  It also enables identification of the\n   encoding
    to support when multiple ones are produced.  That way anyone\n   receiving the
    SDES information from a set of interlinked RTP sessions\n   can determine which
    SSRCs are logically related to the same media\n   source and encoding.  In addition
    the new SDES item is also defined\n   for usage with both a header extension and
    with the SDP source\n   specific media attribute (\"a=ssrc\").  Enabling an end-point
    to\n   receive the SRCNAME with the relevant RTP packets, as well as RTCP,\n   or
    learn the source bindings through signalling, ahead of receiving\n   RTP and RTCP
    packets.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
