abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a YANG data model for Segment Routing IPv6
    (SRv6) base. The model serves as a base framework for configuring and managing
    an SRv6 subsystem and expected to be augmented by other SRv6 technology models
    accordingly. Additionally, this document also specifies the model for the SRv6
    Static application. The YANG modules in this document conform to the Network Management
    Datastore Architecture (NMDA).</p>"
