abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC
    3748,\n   provides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication\n
    \  methods.  This document specifies the use of EAP-Transport Layer\n   Security
    (EAP-TLS) with TLS 1.3 while remaining backwards compatible\n   with existing
    implementations of EAP-TLS.  TLS 1.3 provides\n   significantly improved security
    and privacy, and reduced latency when\n   compared to earlier versions of TLS.
    \ EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 (EAP-TLS\n   1.3) further improves security and privacy
    by always providing\n   forward secrecy, never disclosing the peer identity, and
    by mandating\n   use of revocation checking, when compared to EAP-TLS with earlier\n
    \  versions of TLS.  This document also provides guidance on\n   authentication,
    authorization, and resumption for EAP-TLS in general\n   (regardless of the underlying
    TLS version used).  This document\n   updates RFC 5216.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
