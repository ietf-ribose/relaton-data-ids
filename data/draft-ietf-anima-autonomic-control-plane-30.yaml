abstract:
- content: <p>Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which depends
    on some addressing and routing. This Autonomic Control Plane should ideally be
    self-managing and be as independent as possible of configuration. This document
    defines such a plane and calls it the "Autonomic Control Plane", with the primary
    use as a control plane for autonomic functions. It also serves as a "virtual out-of-band
    channel" for Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) communications over
    a network that provides automatically configured, hop-by-hop authenticated and
    encrypted communications via automatically configured IPv6 even when the network
    is not configured or is misconfigured.</p>
