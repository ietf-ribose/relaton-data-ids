abstract:
- content: "<p>The internet consists of many hosts and many implementations of each
    protocol suite. There are no formal tests or approval mechanisms associated with
    membership of the internet, and therefore there are very varied levels of conformance
    to the various standards. This document intends to describe some of the common
    problems, mistakes and errors that are made in electronic mail. Most of them are
    easily avoidable, and some guidance on what to do in each case is given here.
    Some of these guidelines are pragmatic, some are mandated by other standards,
    and others are religious.</p>"
