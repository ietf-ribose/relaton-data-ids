abstract:
- content: "<p>Several review teams ensure specific types of review are performed
    on Internet Drafts as they progress towards becoming RFCs. The tools used by these
    teams to assign and track reviews would benefit from tighter integration to the
    Datatracker. This document discusses requirements for improving those tools without
    disrupting current work flows.</p>"
