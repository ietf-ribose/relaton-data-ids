abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a visited domain key hierarchy derived from
    the extended master session key (EMSK) from EAP to facilitate visited domain key
    management for various purposes including fast handovers and visited domain services.
    The visited domain key hierarchy avoids the latency associated with communicating
    with the home domain as in case of a full EAP method run or even in a single round
    trip as with the EAP efficient reauthentication scheme, and that is especially
    desirable when the protocol is in the critical path of a handover.</p>"
