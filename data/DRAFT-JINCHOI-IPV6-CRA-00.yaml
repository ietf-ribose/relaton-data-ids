abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft presents the Router Advertisement issues for Movement
    \nDetection/ Detection of Network Attachment. Based on [RFC-2461], the \ninformation
    contained in RA is inadequate for efficient Movement \nDetection due to inconsistency
    and incompleteness. This draft \ndescribes the problems concerning Movement Detection
    and investigates \nthe possible solutions. \n\t </p>\n      "
