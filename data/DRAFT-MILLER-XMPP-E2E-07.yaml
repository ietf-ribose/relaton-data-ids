abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines two methods for securing objects (often\n
    \  referred to as stanzas) for the Extensible Messaging and Presence\n   Protocol
    (XMPP), which allows for efficient asynchronous\n   communication between two
    entities, each with might have multiple\n   devices operating simultaneously.
    \ One is a method to encrypt stanzas\n   to provide confidentiality protection;
    another is a method to sign\n   stanzas to provide authentication and integrity
    protection.  This\n   document also defines a related protocol for entities to
    request the\n   ephemeral session keys in use.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
