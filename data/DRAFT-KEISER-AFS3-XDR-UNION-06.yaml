abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   AFS-3 relies upon XDR to carry Rx RPC call payloads.  XDR\n
    \  discriminated unions are ill-suited to cases where the protocol needs\n   to
    evolve without inventing new RPCs, i.e., unknown discriminant\n   values cause
    the entire XDR payload to fail the decoding step.  While\n   this can be circumvented
    through the use of opaque payloads (and\n   recursive XDR invocations), such solutions
    are inelegant and\n   difficult to implement.  This memo defines a new XDR primitive
    type,\n   \"ext-union\", which is derived from the XDR discriminated union\n   primitive
    type, but with two key variations: 1) each leg contains a\n   length field, and
    2) no default leg is supported.\n\nInternet Draft Comments\n\n   Comments regarding
    this draft are solicited.  Please include the\n   AFS-3 protocol standardization
    mailing list\n   (afs3-standardization@openafs.org) as a recipient of any comments.\n\nAFS-3
    Document State\n\n   This document is in state \"draft\", as per the document
    state\n   definitions set forth in [I-D.wilkinson-afs3-standardisation].\n\n\t
