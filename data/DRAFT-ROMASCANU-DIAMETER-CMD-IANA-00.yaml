abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Diameter Base specification, described in RFC 3588, provides
    a\nnumber of ways to extend Diameter, with new Diameter commands, i.e.\nmessages
    used by Diameter applications, and applications as the most\nextensive enhancements.
    \ RFC 3588 illustrates the conditions that\nlead to the need to define a new Diameter
    application or a new\ncommand code.  Depending on the scope of the Diameter extension
    IETF\nactions are necessary.  Although defining new Diameter applications\ndoes
    not require IETF consensus, defining new Diameter commands\nrequires IETF consensus
    per RFC 3588.  This has lead to questionable\ndesign decisions by other Standards
    Development Organizations which\nchose to define new applications on existing
    commands rather than\nasking for assignment of new command codes for the pure
    purpose of\navoiding bringing their specifications to the IETF.  In some cases\ninteroperability
    problems were causes as an effect of the poor design\ncaused by overloading existing
    commands.\n\nThis document aligns the extensibility rules of Diameter application\nwith
    the Diameter commands offering ways to delegate work on Diameter\nto other SDOs
    to extend Diameter in a way that does not lead to poor\ndesign choices.\n\t </p>\n
