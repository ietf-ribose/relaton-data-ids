abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a general purpose message framing named
    WiSH\n   which supports bi-directional (bidi) message-based communication over\n
    \  byte-stream oriented protocols such as HTTP (in its standard\n   semantics).
    \ WiSH is designed to be compatible with WebSocket.  WiSH\n   can be viewed as
    a binary and bidi alternative to the framing defined\n   for the server-sent events
    (SSE, EventSource) Web API [SSE].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
