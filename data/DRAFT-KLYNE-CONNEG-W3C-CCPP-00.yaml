abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document suggests some possible areas for extending the IETF\n'conneg'
    working group's capability description framework,\ndescribed in [2,3,4].  The
    suggested areas for extension have been\nmotivated by WWW Consortium (W3C) work
    on Composite\nCapability/Preference Profiles (CCPP) [5] that parallels some\naspects
    of the IETF 'conneg' work.\nThis is presented as a discussion document, with a
    view to maybe\nintegrating some of these ideas into ongoing 'conneg' work, and
    to\nindicate some areas for ongoing collaboration between the IETF and\nW3C in
    the area of content description.\n\t </p>\n      "
