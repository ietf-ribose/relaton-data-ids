abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an abstract syntax and semantic of HTTP
    \ncookies. This approach presents a new cookie attribute that ensures\ncookie
    integrity and improves source authentication of the cookie\nsent back to the server.\n\nCookies
    are always used on the Web in order to store user \nidentification data and sensible
    user information. Adversary can\neasily modify cookiesstored in the User Agent.
    Therefore, Origin\nServer has to be able to verify cookie integrity and ensure
    that\nthe returned cookies are its own cookies.\n\nThis document explains a way
    to calculate and apply the integrity\nattribute in HTTP cookie headers.\n\t </p>\n
