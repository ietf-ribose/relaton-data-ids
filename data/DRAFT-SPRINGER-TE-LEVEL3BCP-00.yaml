abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This paper discusses Traffic Engineering with Multi-Protocol\nLabel
    Switching in the Level3 network. A brief overview of traffic\nengineering is given
    followed by constraints affecting Level3's\ndesign. The approach Level3 will use,
    which is LDP edge and an RSVP-TE\ncore, is presented. Several architectures were
    considered when\ndeciding upon a design. These methods are discussed as well as
    the\nreasons they were ultimately refuted.\n\t </p>\n      "
