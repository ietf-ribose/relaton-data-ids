abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BULK DNS resource record type defines a method of pattern-based\n
    \  creation of DNS resource records based on numeric substrings of query\n   names.
    \ The intent of BULK is to simplify generic assignments in a\n   memory-efficient
    way that can be easily shared between the primary\n   and secondary nameservers
    for a zone.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
