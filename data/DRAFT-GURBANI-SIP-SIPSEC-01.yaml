abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), there
    does not\n   exist any means for a user agent client (UAC) to signal to the\n
    \  destination user agent server (UAS) that an end-to-end secure channel\n   is
    to be established.  Instead, what is prevalent today in the\n   protocol is a
    hop-by-hop security model, wherein intermediaries\n   forward a request towards
    the destination without the UAC knowing\n\n   whether or not the intermediary
    behaved in a trusted manner (i.e., it\n   did not, unknown to the UAC, downgrade
    the security of the downstream\n   channel from the intermediary onwards).  This
    document discusses the\n   security properties of a hop-by-hop model; and in doing
    so,\n   formulates requirements an for an end-to-end security model and a\n   solution
    that satisfies these requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
