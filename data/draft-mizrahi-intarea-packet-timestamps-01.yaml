abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies guidelines for defining binary packet timestamp
    formats in networking protocols at various layers. It also presents three recommended
    timestamp formats. The target audience of this memo includes network protocol
    designers. It is expected that a new network protocol that requires a packet timestamp
    will, in most cases, use one of the recommended timestamp formats. If none of
    the recommended formats fits the protocol requirements, the new protocol specification
    should specify the format of the packet timestamp according to the guidelines
    in this document.</p>"
