abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a proposed extension to SIP.\nThis document
    proposes a mechansim to encrypt/hide Record-Route and\nRoute entries in or to
    support confidentiality of SIP proxy\nrouting information.  The functionality
    of the Record-Route and\nRoute headers are preserved.\nThe introduction of this
    extension allows a set of\ntrusted SIP proxies to cooperatively hide the route
    that\nSIP PDUs transit from untrusted proxies and user agents.\n\t </p>\n      "
