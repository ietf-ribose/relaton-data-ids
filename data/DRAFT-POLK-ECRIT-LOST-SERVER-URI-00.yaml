abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Location-to-Service Translation protocol (LoST) Server is
    used to \n   resolve or map a given location with an appropriate Public Safety
    \n   Answering Point (PSAP) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for that \n   location.
    \ This query is conceivably performed on two occasions: \n   prior to making an
    emergency call, and during an emergency call.  \n   This document specifies a
    new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) \n   header, returned in a SIP Registration
    transaction, indicating to a \n   SIP user agent the appropriate LoST Server's
    URI to send this query \n   to.\n\t </p>\n      "
