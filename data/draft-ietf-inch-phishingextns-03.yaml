abstract:
- content: <p>This document extends the INCH WG's IODEF XML incident reporting format
    for reporting phishing, fraud, other types of electronic crime, and widespread
    spam incidents. Although the term "phishing attack" is used, the data format extensions
    are flexible enough to support information gleaned from activities throughout
    the entire electronic fraud life cycle and extensible enough to be used for other
    types of electronic crime incidents, along with simple spam. The extensions support
    very simple reporting as well as optional fields for detailed forensic reports,
    and support single phish/fraud incidents as well as consolidated reports of multiple
    phish incidents. Sections 1 and 2 of this document introduce the high-level report
    format. Sections 3 and 4 describe the data elements of the fraud extensions. This
    document includes an XML schema for the extensions and a few example fraud reports.</p>
