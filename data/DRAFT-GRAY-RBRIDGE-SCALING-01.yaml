  content: "\n\t <p>RBridges are link layer (L2) devices that use routing protocols
    \n\n  as a control plane. They combine several of the benefits of the \n\n  link
    layer with network layer routing benefits. RBridges may use \n\n  existing link
    state routing (without requiring configuration) to \n\n  improve RBridge to RBridge
    aggregate throughput. RBridges also \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Gray\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Expires

    Deployments\n\nNovember 2007 \n\n\n\n\n\n  provide support for IP multicast and
    IP address resolution \n\n  optimizations. They are intended to be applicable
    to similar L2 \n\n  network sizes as conventional bridges and are intended to
    be \n\n  backward compatible with those bridges as both ingress/egress \n\n  and
    transit. They also support VLANs (although this generally \n\n  requires configuration)
    and otherwise attempt to retain as much \n\n  'plug and play' as is already available
    in existing bridges. \n\n  There has been a lot of discussion within the TRILL
    working \n\n  group about the potential for scaling issues when using IS-IS in
    \n\n  combination with (possibly as many as 4K) VLANs. This document \n\n  is
    intended to provide information on potential scaling issues \n\n  and the possible
    solutions that may be applied in deploying \n\n  RBridges. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
