abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Managing energy consumption of devices presents new challenges
    and\n   issues.  The EMAN Requirements draft identifies essential\n   capabilities
    needed to accomplish this.  This draft describes how an\n   energy management
    system can use EMAN to gather and interpret data\n   from individual devices,
    and how some of the Requirements are\n   implemented in the model.  This document
    focuses on Energy Reporting,\n   though acknowledges and fully includes the limited
    control functions\n   specified in the Requirements draft.  Topics addressed in
    detail\n   include the topology of power distribution, reporting mechanisms, and\n
    \  the various roles of devices, power interfaces, and components.\n\n\t </p>\n
