  content: "<p>IKEv2 is the protocol used to set up and negotiate Security Associations
    between nodes. IKEv2 has not been designed for nodes with multiple interfaces.
    This document is focused on IKEv2 ability to set up IPsec protected communications
    between nodes with multiple interfaces. This document states the problems and
    provides requirements for IKEv2 to ease IPsec for multiple interface communication.</p>"
