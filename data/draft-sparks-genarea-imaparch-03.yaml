abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work. This often
    involves accessing the archived history of those email lists. Participants would
    like to have the ability to browse and search those archives using standard IMAP
    clients. This memo captures the requirements for providing a service that would
    allow such browsing and searching.</p>"
