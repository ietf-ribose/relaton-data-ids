abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies proactive, in-band network layer OAM mechanisms
    to detect loss of continuity and miss-connection faults that affect unicast and
    multi-destination paths (used by Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast traffic)
    in an Ethernet VPN (EVPN) network. The mechanisms specified in the draft are based
    on the widely adopted Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol.</p>"
