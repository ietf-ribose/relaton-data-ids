abstract:
- content: "<p>A policy architecture and framework is discussed to support NFV environments,
    where policies are used to enforce business rules and to specify resource constraints
    in a number of subsystems. This document approaches the policy framework and architecture
    from the perspective of overall orchestration requirements for services involving
    multiple subsystems. The framework extends beyond common orchestration constraints
    across compute, network, and storage subsystems to include energy conservation.
    This document also analyses policy scope, global versus local policies, policy
    actions and translations, policy conflict detection and resolution, interactions
    among policies engines, and a hierarchical policy architecture/framework to address
    the demanding and growing requirements of NFV environments, that could also be
    applicable to cloud infrastructures in general.</p>"
