abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Internet's Transmission Control
    Protocol\n   (TCP).  TCP is an important transport layer protocol in the Internet\n
    \  stack, and has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of\n   the
    Internet.  Over this time, a number of changes have been made to\n   TCP as it
    was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been\n   documented in a piecemeal
    fashion.  This document collects and brings\n   those changes together with the
    protocol specification from RFC 793.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 793 and several
    other RFCs (TODO: list\n   all actual RFCs when finished).\n\n   RFC EDITOR NOTE:
    If approved for publication as an RFC, this should\n   be marked additionally
    as \"STD: 7\" and replace RFC 793 in that role.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
