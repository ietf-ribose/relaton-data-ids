abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a YANG data model for Ethernet VPN
    services.\n   The model is agnostic of the underlay. It apply to MPLS as well
    as to\n   VxLAN encapsulation. The model is also agnostic of the services\n   including
    E-LAN, E-LINE and E-TREE services. The merging of this\n   model with L2 services
    model is for future investigation. Any \"add-\n   on\" features such as EVPN IRB,
    EVPN overlay, etc. are for future\n   investigation. This document mainly focuses
    on EVPN instance\n   framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
