abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In line with the HTTP compatibility goal for HTTP 2.0, HTTP
    2.0 must\n   also be compatible with currently deployed authentication schemes.\n
    \  This draft addresses this goal in the presence of multiplexing\n   (expected
    to be part of HTTP 2.0), while addressing some of the\n   issues currently encountered
    when performing multilegged\n   authentication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
