abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes a new namespace, the Host Identity namespace,
    and\na new protocol layer, the Host Identity Protocol, between the\ninternetworking
    and transport layers.  Herein are presented the\nbasics of the current namespaces,
    their strengths and weaknesses, and\nhow a new namespace will add completeness
    to them.  The roles of this\nnew namespace in the protocols are defined.\n\nThis
    document obsoletes RFC 4423 and addresses the concerns raised by\nthe IESG, particularly
    that of crypto agility.  It also incorporates\nlessons learned from the implementations
    of RFC 5201.\n\t </p>\n      "
