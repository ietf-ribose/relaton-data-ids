abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation (BIBE), a Delay-Tolerant
    Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol (BP) "convergence layer" protocol that tunnels
    BP "bundles" through encapsulating bundles. The services provided by the BIBE
    convergence-layer protocol adapter encapsulate an outbound BP "bundle" in a BIBE
    convergence-layer protocol data unit for transmission as the payload of a bundle.
    Security measures applied to the encapsulating bundle may augment those applied
    to the encapsulated bundle.</p>
