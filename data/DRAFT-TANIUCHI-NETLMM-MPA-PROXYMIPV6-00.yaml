abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a proactive mechanism to provide fast-\n
    \  handover involving PMIPv6.  In particular, it describes how one can\n   achieve
    fast handoff for PMIPv6 using Media-independent Pre-\n   Authentication (MPA)
    technique.  It discusses the need for a fast-\n   handoff for PMIPv6 environment.
    \ It then describes how MPA techniques\n   could be used during different steps
    involving both intra-domain and\n   inter-domain handoff for PMIPv6.  MPA-based
    fast-handover takes\n   advantage of the pre-authentication mechanism so that
    the mobile can\n   perform the access authentication while in the previous local\n
    \  mobility (PMA) domain and thus would be able to complete many of the\n   handoff
    related operations while still in the previous network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
