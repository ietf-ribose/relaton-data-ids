abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public\nkey
    and associated data.  The public key is used to verify digital\nsignatures and
    the associated data is used to constrain the types of\ninformation for which the
    trust anchor is authoritative.  A relying\nparty uses trust anchors to determine
    if a digitally signed object is\nvalid by verifying a digital signature using
    the trust anchor's\npublic key, and by enforcing the constraints expressed in
    the\nassociated data for the trust anchor.  This document describes some\nof the
    problems associated with the lack of a standard trust anchor\nmanagement mechanism
    as well as problems that must be addressed by\nsuch a mechanism.  This document
    discusses only public keys as trust\nanchors; symmetric key trust anchors are
    not considered.\n\t </p>\n      "
