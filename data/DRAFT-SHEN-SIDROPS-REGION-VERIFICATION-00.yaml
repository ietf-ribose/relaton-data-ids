abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP routing security is becoming a major issue that affects
    the\n   normal running of Internet services.  Currently, there are many\n   solutions,
    including ROA authentication and ASPA authentication, to\n   prevent route source
    hijacking, path hijacking, and route leaking.\n   However, on an actual network,
    large ISPs with multiple ASes can use\n   carefully constructed routes to bypass
    ROA and ASPA authentication to\n   attack the target network.\n\n   This document
    defines an region-based authentication method for large\n   ISPs with many ASes
    to prevent traffic hijacking within ISPs.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
