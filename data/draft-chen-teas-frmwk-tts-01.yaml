abstract:
- content: "<p>For existing MPLS LSP tunnel services, it is hard for LSP tunnels to
    be booked in advance. In addition, once an LSP tunnel is set up, it is assumed
    to consume a certain amount of resources such as link bandwidth forever. Temporal
    LSP tunnel services (TTS) provides an easy way for us to book temporal LSP tunnels
    in advance. More importantly, a temporal LSP is an LSP with one or more time intervals
    and it is assumed to consume the resources and carry traffic only in these time
    intervals. This document specifies a framework for temporal LSP tunnel services
    and provides a few of reference models along with logical components required
    to design a solution for TTS.</p>"
