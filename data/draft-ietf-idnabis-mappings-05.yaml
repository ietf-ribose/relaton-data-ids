abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In the original version of the Internationalized Domain Names inApplications
    (IDNA) protocol, any Unicode code points taken from userinput were mapped into
    a set of Unicode code points that \"makesense\", which were then encoded and passed
    to the domain name system(DNS). The current version of IDNA presumes that the
    input to theprotocol comes from a set of \"permitted\" code points, which it thenencodes
    and passes to the DNS, but does not specify what to do withthe result of user
    input. This document describes the actions thatcan be taken by an implementation
    between user input and passingpermitted code points to the new IDNA protocol.</p>"
