abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When an RTP receiver joins a primary multicast session, it may
    need\nto acquire and parse certain Reference Information before it can\nprocess
    any data sent in the multicast session.  Depending on the\njoin time, length of
    the Reference Information repetition interval,\nsize of the Reference Information
    as well as the application and\ntransport properties, the time lag before an RTP
    receiver can\nusefully consume the multicast data, which we refer to as the\nAcquisition
    Delay, varies and may be large.  This is an undesirable\nphenomenon for receivers
    that frequently switch among different\nmulticast sessions, such as video broadcasts.\n\nIn
    this document, we describe a method using the existing RTP and\nRTCP protocol
    machinery that reduces the acquisition delay.  In this\nmethod, an auxiliary unicast
    RTP session carrying the Reference\nInformation to the receiver precedes/accompanies
    the primary\nmulticast stream.  This unicast RTP flow may be transmitted at a\nfaster
    than natural rate to further accelerate the acquisition.  The\nmotivating use
    case for this capability is multicast applications\nthat carry real-time compressed
    audio and video.  However, the\nproposed method can also be used in other types
    of multicast\napplications where the acquisition delay is long enough to be a\nproblem.\n\t
