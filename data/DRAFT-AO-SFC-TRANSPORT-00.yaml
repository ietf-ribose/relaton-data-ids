abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Network Service Header(NSH) is imposed encapsulates a packet
    or a\n   frame for Service Function Chaining.  The resulting packet, in turn,\n
    \  is encapsulate according to transport layer.  The NSH contains a\n   Service
    Path Identifier (SPI) and a Service Index (SI).  The SPI is,\n   as per its name,
    an identifier.  The SPI alone cannot be used to\n   forward packets along a service
    path.  Rather, the SPI provides a\n   level of indirection between the service
    path / topology and the\n   network transport encapsulation.  For different transport\n
    \  encapsulations, this document provides the format information with\n   transport
    and NSH, and gives operational constraints that transport\n   technologies, used
    by NSH need to meet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
