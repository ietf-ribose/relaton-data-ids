abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is common operator practice to mitigate security risks by\n
    \  enforcing appropriate packet filtering.  This document analyzes both\n   the
    general security implications of IPv6 Extension Headers and the\n   specific security
    implications of each Extension Header and Option\n   type.  Additionally, it discusses
    the operational and\n   interoperability implications of discarding packets based
    on the IPv6\n   Extension Headers and IPv6 options they contain.  Finally, it\n
    \  provides advice on the filtering of such IPv6 packets at transit\n   routers
    for traffic *not* directed to them, for those cases in which\n   such filtering
    is deemed as necessary.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
