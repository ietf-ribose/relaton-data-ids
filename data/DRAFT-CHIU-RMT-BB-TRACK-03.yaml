abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) Working Group has been
    \nchartered to standardize reliable multicast transport services and \nprotocol
    instantiations, which include the tree-based ACK (TRACK) \nprotocol. This document
    describes the RMT Building Block for Tree-\nbased ACK (TRACK) mechanisms.  It
    contains functions relating to \npositive acknowledgments and hierarchical tree
    construction and \nmaintenance.  It might primarily be used as part of the TRACK
    \nProtocol Instantiation. According to the charter, a building block \nis 'a coarse-grained
    modular component that is common to multiple \nprotocols along with abstract APIs
    that define a building block's \naccess methods and their arguments.' The TRACK
    BB mechanisms will \noperate on the logical ACK-tree that is configured by the
    TREE BB \n[10] in the TRACK PI sessions. This document is made based on the \nguidelines
    for the RMT BB [5].\n\t </p>\n      "
