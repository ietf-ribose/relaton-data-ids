abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) Content-Type headers, the
    MIME types used therein, and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) are being used,
    in different contexts, to label entities. A mapping is specified from each kind
    of label into the other. This makes it possible to express the meaning of almost
    any URI or Content-Type in the syntax of the other.</p>"
