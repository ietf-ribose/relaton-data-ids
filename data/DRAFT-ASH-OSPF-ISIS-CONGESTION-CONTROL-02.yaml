abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Earlier papers and contributions identified issues of congestion
    control and failure recovery for link-state protocol networks, such as OSPF, ISIS,
    and PNNI networks [maunder, choudhury, pappalardo1, pappalardo2, atm01-0101].
    The problem addressed is to enable link-state protocols to a) gracefully recover
    from massive loss of topology database information, and b) respond gracefully
    to network overloads and failures. This contribution proposes specific additional
    considerations for network congestion control/failure recovery.  Candidate mechanisms
    are proposed for control of network congestion and failure recovery, in particular
    we initially propose to investigate the following mechanisms:\na)      throttle
    new connection setups, topology-state updates, and Hello updates based on automatic
    congestion control mechanisms, \nb)      special marking of critical control messages
    (e.g., Hello and\ntopology-state-update Ack) so that they may receive prioritized
    processing,\nc)      database backup, in which a topology database could be automatically
    recovered from loss based on local backup mechanisms, and \nd)      hitless restart,
    which allows routes to continue to be used if there is an uninterrupted data path,
    even if the control path is interrupted due to a failure.\nWe propose that the
    OSPF and ISIS working groups include the candidate\nmechanisms in an evaluation
    of congestion control/failure recovery for OSPF and ISIS networks.  \n\n\t </p>\n
