abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cloud services need to interoperate across cloud providers,
    service\n   vendors and private/public domains. To enable this interoperability,\n
    \  there is need for network level deployment architecture to connect\n   users
    and providers. This document describes functionality\n   partitioning in network
    deployment and the different advantages of\n   using distributed functionality
    deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
