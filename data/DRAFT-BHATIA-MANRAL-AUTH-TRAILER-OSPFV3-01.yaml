abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Currently OSPFv3 uses IPsec for authenticating protocol packets.\nHowever,
    there are some environments, e.g., Mobile Ad-hoc Networks\n(MANETs), where IPsec
    is difficult to configure and maintain, and\nthis mechanism cannot be used.  This
    draft proposes an alternative\nmechanism that can be used so that OSPFv3 does
    not depend upon IPsec\nfor authentication.\n\t </p>\n      "
