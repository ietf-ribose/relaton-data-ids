abstract:
- content: "<p>Semantic Routing is the process of making routing and forwarding decisions
    based, not only on the destination IP address, but on other information carried
    in an IP packet. The intent is to facilitate enhanced routing decisions based
    on this information in order to provide differentiated forwarding paths for specific
    packet flows. Software Defined Networking (SDN) places control of network elements
    (including all or some of their forwarding decisions) within external software
    components called controllers and orchestrators. This approach differs from conventional
    approaches that solely rely upon distributed routing protocols for the delivery
    of advanced connectivity services. By doing so, SDN aims to enable network elements
    to be simplified while still performing (some high level) forwarding function.
    This document examines the applicability of SDN techniques to Semantic Routing
    and provides considerations for the development of Semantic Routing solutions
    in the context of SDN.</p>"
