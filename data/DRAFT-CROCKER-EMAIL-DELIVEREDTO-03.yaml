abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The address to which email is delivered might be different
    than any\n   of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were\n
    \  created by the author.  The address used by the mail transport\n   service
    is provided separately, through an envelope SMTP \"RCPT TO\"\n   command.  Before
    final delivery, handling can entail a sequence of\n   submission/delivery events,
    using different destination addresses,\n   that lead to the recipient.  It can
    be helpful for a message to have\n   a common way to record each delivery in such
    a sequence, and to\n   include each address used for that recipient.  This specification\n
    \  defines a header field for this information.\n\n   Email handling information
    is a matter of modifying the email\n   infrastructure and possibly creating privacy
    concerns.  A header\n   field such as this is not automatically assured of adoption
    or use.\n   Therefore it is being published as an Experiment, looking for\n   constituency
    and for operational utility.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
