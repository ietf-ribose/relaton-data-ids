abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Pre-Congestion Notification [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture]\n
    \  approach proposes Admission Control to limit the amount of real-time\n   PCN
    traffic to a configured level during the normal operating\n   conditions, and
    Flow Termination used to tear-down some of the flows\n\n   to bring the PCN traffic
    level down to a desirable amount during\n   unexpected events such as network
    failures, with the goal of\n   maintaining the QoS assurances to the remaining
    flows.  Preliminary\n   performance evaluation results on example admission and
    termination\n   mechanisms were presented in [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-phb] and in\n
    \  earlier versions of this draft.  This draft presents the results of a\n   follow-up
    simulation study.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
