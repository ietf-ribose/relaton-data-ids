abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Deployment of RPKI-based BGP origin validation is hampered
    by, among\n   other things, vendor mis-implementations in two critical areas,
    which\n   routes are validated and whether policy is applied when not specified\n
    \  by configuration.  This document is meant to clarify possible\n   misunderstandings
    causing those mis-implementations.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
