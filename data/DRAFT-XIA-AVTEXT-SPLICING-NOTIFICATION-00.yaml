abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Content splicing is a process that replaces the content of
    a main\n   multimedia stream with other multimedia content, and delivers the\n
    \  substitutive multimedia content to the receivers for a period of\n   time.
    \ The RTP mixer is designed to handle RTP splicing in [RFC6828],\n   but how the
    RTP mixer knows when to start and end the splicing is\n   still unspecified.\n\n
    \  This memo defines two RTP/RTCP extensions to indicate the splicing\n   related
    information to the RTP mixer: an RTP header extension that\n   conveys the information
    in-band and an RTCP packet that conveys the\n   information out-of-band.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
