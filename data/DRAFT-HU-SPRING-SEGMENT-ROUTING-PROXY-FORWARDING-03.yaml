abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (SR-TE) supports the creation
    of\n   explicit paths using segment lists containing adjacency-sids, node-\n   sids,
    anycast-sids, and binding-sids.  When the segment list defining\n   an SR-TE path
    contains a node-sid, and the node fails, the network\n   may no longer be able
    to properly forward traffic on that SR-TE path.\n   [I-D.bashandy-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa]
    and\n   [I-D.hegde-spring-node-protection-for-sr-te-paths] describe a\n   mechanism
    that allows local repair actions on the direct neighbors of\n   the failed node
    to temporarily route traffic to the node immediately\n   following the failed
    node on the SR-TE path segment list.  However,\n   once the IGP shortest paths
    have converged, the local repair\n   mechanism is no longer sufficient to continue
    forwarding traffic\n   using the original segment list of the SR-TE path, since
    the non-\n   neighbors of the failed node will no longer have a route to reach
    the\n   failed node.  This document describes a mechanism that allows traffic\n
    \  to continue to be forwarded on an SR-TE path for an extended period\n   of
    time after the failure of a node used in the path's segment list.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
