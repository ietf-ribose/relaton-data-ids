abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, customer equipment
    may have\n   to support one of the various transition methods that have been or\n
    \  are currently being defined for carrying IPv4 packets over IPv6.\n   Work is
    currently in progress to enumerate the information that needs\n   to be provisioned
    on a customer edge router to support a list of\n   transition techniques based
    on tunneling IPv4 in IPv6, with a view to\n   defining reusable components for
    a reasonable transition path between\n   these techniques.  To the extent that
    the provisioning is done\n   dynamically, AAA support is needed to provide the
    information to the\n   network server responsible for passing the information
    to the\n   customer equipment.  This document specifies Diameter attribute-value\n
    \  pairs to be used for that purpose.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
