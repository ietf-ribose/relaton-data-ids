abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism that helps to protect and
    recover \nuser traffic when carried over pseudo-wires. The mechanism requires
    \nsome minor modification to the existing pseudo-wire setup procedure, \nand is
    fully backward compatible. \n    \nThe proposed mechanism allows the network operators
    to setup one or \nmultiple backup pseudo-wires to protect a working pseudo-wire.
    Upon \nnetwork failure, user traffic can be switched over to the next \"best\"
    \npseudo-wire base on preference levels. \n    \nThis document first describes
    the motivation of the work base on the \ndiscussions with a number of carriers.
    Then we define the protocol \nextension itself. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
