abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes
    and\n   networks.  Through the Observe option, clients can observe changes in\n
    \  the state of resources and obtain a current representation of the\n   last
    resource state.  This document defines two new options for CoAP\n   Observe so
    that a CoAP client can specify timing conditions when\n   observing a resource
    on a CoAP server.  As a result, the CoAP client\n   is only informed about resource
    state changes when the timing\n   conditions are met.  This offers possibilities
    to extend network\n   intelligence, enhance scalability, and optimize the lifetime
    and\n   performance in order to address the requirements from the Constrained\n
    \  Nodes and Networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
