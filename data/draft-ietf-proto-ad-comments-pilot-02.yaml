abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a pilot implementation of a protocol change
    within the IETF. The essence of the change is to have workgroup chairs handle
    the feedback of AD (Area Director) Evaluation comments on a draft to the authors
    (and workgroup if necessary) and make sure that needed draft changes are made,
    and the AD notified when a new draft which resolves the comments is available.</p>"
