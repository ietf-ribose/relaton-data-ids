abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Diameter protocol has specified and relies on the use of
    per-user\n   sessions, which are established between a Diameter client and server\n
    \  during a user's authentication and authorization procedure.  This\n   document
    proposes an extension to the Diameter session concept to\n   establish a general
    purpose Diameter session for signaling the\n   context of multiple users, such
    as for group handling or application\n   state restoration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
