abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which then
    use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks. This document
    considers prefix delegation models according to whether the requesting router
    acts as a router on behalf of any downstream networks, as host on behalf of its
    local applications or as both.</p>"
