abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This document specifies the extensions to the Session Initiation
    \n    Protocol (SIP) for the call completion services provided in the \n    context
    of ETSI Next Generation Networks (NGN).  Therefore this \n    document describes
    a SIP event package that enables subscribing to \n    and managing call completion
    queues.  Furthermore this document \n    extends the usage of the Allows-events
    header field to 180 Ringing \n    and 486 Busy responses, and specifies an indication
    used for the \n    prioritization of call-completion calls. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
