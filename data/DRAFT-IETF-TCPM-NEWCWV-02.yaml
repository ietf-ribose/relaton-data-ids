abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an update to RFC 5681 to address issues
    that\n   arise when TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where\n
    \  the sending rate is limited by the application rather than the\n   congestion
    window.  It updates TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart\n   quickly following
    either an idle or rate-limited interval.  This\n   method is expected to benefit
    applications that send rate-limited\n   traffic using TCP, while also providing
    an appropriate response if\n   congestion is experienced.\n\n   It also evaluates
    the Experimental specification of TCP Congestion\n   Window Validation, CWV, defined
    in RFC 2861, and concludes that RFC\n   2861 sought to address important issues,
    but failed to deliver a\n   widely used solution.  This document therefore recommends
    that the\n   status of RFC 2861 is moved from Experimental to Historic, and that\n
    \  it is replaced by the current specification.\n\n   NOTE: The standards status
    of this WG document is under review for\n   consideration as either Experimental
    (EXP) or Proposed Standard (PS).\n   This decision will be made later as the document
    is finalised.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
