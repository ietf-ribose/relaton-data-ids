abstract:
  content: "<p>Conventional multicast builds a tree structure from the source of amulticast
    stream to the destinations of that stream. Multicastpackets are forwarded from
    the sources down the tree by eachintervening router. Each router contains state
    information todetermine the next hop forwarding destination(s) for a packet. Wherethere
    are a large number of groups, this gives rise to a scalingproblem. The amount
    of state to be stored in the routers becomesimpossibly large.It is attractive
    to consider the use of multicast to provideapplications such as n-way voice and
    video conferencing, which wouldrequire a very large number (perhaps millions)
    of relatively small(between 3 and 10 members) multicast groups.</p>"
