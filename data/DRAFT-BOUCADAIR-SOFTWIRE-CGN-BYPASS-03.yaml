abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a solution to avoid the use of two stateful\nDS-Lite
    AFTR devices when both end-points are located behind\ndifferent AFTR devices.
    \ For this purpose a new IPv6 extension\nheader, called Tunnel Endpoint Extension
    Header (TEEH), is defined.\nThe proposed procedure encourages the use of IPv6
    between DS-Lite\nAFTR nodes as a means to avoid the unnecessary crossing of AFTR\ndevices.
    \ A Flow Label based solution is also described.\n\t </p>\n      "
