abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is now entering widespread deployment.
    However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet as mature and reliable
    as those for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration tools and processes. Negative
    Trust Anchors (described in this document) can be used to mitigate DNSSEC validation
    failures. [ Editor note: This document was originally draft-livingood-negative-
    trust-anchors-07 - renamved at the request of the DNSOP chairs ]</p>"
