abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding\n
    \  standard ISO/IEC International Standard 23094-1 [EVC], also known as\n   Essential
    Video Coding [EVC] and developed by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11\n   (MPEG).  The RTP
    payload format allows for packetization of one or\n   more Network Abstraction
    Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload\n   as well as fragmentation of a
    NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.\n   The payload format has wide applicability
    in videoconferencing,\n   Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality\n
    \  video, among other applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
