abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS Error Reporting is a lightweight error reporting mechanism
    that\n   provides the operator of an authoritative server with reports on DNS\n
    \  resource records that fail to resolve or validate, that a Domain\n   Owner
    or DNS Hosting organization can use to improve domain hosting.\n   The reports
    are based on Extended DNS Errors [RFC8914].\n\n   When a domain name fails to
    resolve or validate due to a\n   misconfiguration or an attack, the operator of
    the authoritative\n   server may be unaware of this.  To mitigate this lack of
    feedback,\n   this document describes a method for a validating recursive resolver\n
    \  to automatically signal an error to an agent specified by the\n   authoritative
    server.  DNS Error Reporting uses the DNS to report\n   errors.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
