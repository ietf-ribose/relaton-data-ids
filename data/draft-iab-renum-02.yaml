abstract:
- content: <p>Hosts in an IP network are identified by IP addresses, and the IP address
    prefixes of subnets are advertised by routing protocols. A change in such IP addressing
    information associated with a host or subnet is known as "renumbering". This memo
    provides information for the Internet community. This memo does not specify an
    Internet standard of any kind.</p>
