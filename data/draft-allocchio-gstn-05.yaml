abstract:
- content: '<p>This memo describes the full set of notations needed to represent a
    text string in a Dial Sequence. A Dial Sequence is normally composed of Dual Tone
    Multi Frequency (DTMF) elements, plus separators and additional "actions" (such
    as "wait for dialtone", "pause for N secs", etc.) which could be needed to successfully
    establish the connection with the target service: this includes the cases where
    subaddresses or DTMF menu navigation apply.</p>'
