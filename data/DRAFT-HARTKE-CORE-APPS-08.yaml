abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The application programmable interfaces of RESTful, hypermedia-driven\n
    \  Web applications consist of a number of reusable components such as\n   Internet
    media types and link relation types.  This document proposes\n   \"CoRE Applications\",
    a convention for application designers to build\n   the interfaces of their applications
    in a structured way, so that\n   implementers can easily build interoperable clients
    and servers, and\n   other designers can reuse the components in their own applications.\n\n\t
