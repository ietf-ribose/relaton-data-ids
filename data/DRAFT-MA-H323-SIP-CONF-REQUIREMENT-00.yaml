abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   H.323 conference system is well defined and widely deployed
    today.\n   It is important for SIP UA, both IPv4 and IPv6, to access H.323\n   conference
    system.  This document defines an architecture for a SIP\n   UA to access H.323
    conference system.  The requirements for the\n   elements in this architecture
    are examined.  Also the transition\n   scenario for IPv6 SIP UA to access IPv4
    H.323 conference system is\n   discussed.\n\t </p>\n      "
