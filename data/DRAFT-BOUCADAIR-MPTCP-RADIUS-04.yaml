abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Because of the lack of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) support at the
    server\n   side, some service providers now consider a network-assisted model\n
    \  that relies upon the activation of a dedicated function called MPTCP\n   Conversion
    Point (MCP).  Network-assisted MPTCP deployment models are\n   designed to facilitate
    the adoption of MPTCP for the establishment of\n   multi-path communications without
    making any assumption about the\n   support of MPTCP by the communicating peers.
    \ MCPs located in the\n   network are responsible for establishing multi-path
    communications on\n   behalf of endpoints, thereby taking advantage of MPTCP capabilities\n
    \  to achieve different goals that include (but are not limited to)\n   optimization
    of resource usage (e.g., bandwidth aggregation), of\n   resiliency (e.g., primary/backup
    communication paths), and traffic\n   offload management.\n\n   This document
    specifies a new Remote Authentication Dial-In User\n   Service (RADIUS) attributes
    that carry the IP addresses that will be\n   returned to authorized users to reach
    one or multiple MCPs.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
