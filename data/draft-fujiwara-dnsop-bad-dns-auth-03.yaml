abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes misconfigurations of DNS authoritative servers
    and its effect to old DNS iterative resolver servers we experienced. We recommend
    re-checking DNS authoritative server configuration and advise using newer iterative
    resolver server implementations. The recommendations made in this document are
    based on analysis of abnormal DNS resolver server load at large ISP resolver server
    which has many customers. This is not protocol issue.</p>"
