abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) is an open protocol for
    enterprise-wide network based backup. The NDMP architecture allows network attached
    storage vendors to ship NDMP compliant file servers which can be used by any NDMP-compliant
    backup administration application. This same architecture is also used for network-attached
    backup devices, such as tape drives and tape libraries.</p>"
