abstract:
- content: "<p>There are requirements in diverse industries to establish multi-hop
    paths for characterized flows with bounded end-to-end latency and extremely low
    packet loss rate. Deterministic Networking (DetNet) can provide service satisfying
    the requirements. This document describes extensions to IGP-TE, including OSPF-TE
    and ISIS-TE to distribute information of DetNet, which can be used for DetNet
    path computation/selection. This document only covers the mechanisms by which
    DetNet information is distributed. The mechanisms for measuring, calculating or
    configuring DetNet capabilities, resources and other relevant parameters are out
    of the scope.</p>"
