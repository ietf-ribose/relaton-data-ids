abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the problems that enterprises face today when
    connecting their branch offices to dynamic workloads in third party data centers
    (a.k.a. Cloud DCs). It examines some of the approaches interconnecting cloud DCs
    with enterprises' on-premises DCs &amp; branch offices. This document also describes
    some of the (network) problems that many enterprises face when they have workloads
    &amp; applications &amp; data split among hybrid data centers, especially for
    those enterprises with multiple sites that are already interconnected by VPNs
    (e.g., MPLS L2VPN/L3VPN). Current operational problems are examined to determine
    whether there is a need to improve existing protocols or whether a new protocol
    is necessary to solve them.</p>"
