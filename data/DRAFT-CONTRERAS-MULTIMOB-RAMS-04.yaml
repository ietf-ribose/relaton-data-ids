abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a multicast handover optimization mechanism\n
    \  for Proxy Mobile IPv6 to accelerate the delivery of multicast traffic\n   to
    mobile nodes after handovers. The mechanism is based on speeding\n   up the acquisition
    of mobile nodes' active multicast subscriptions\n   information by the mobile
    access gateways. To do that, extensions to\n   the current Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol
    are proposed. These extensions\n   are not only applicable to the base solution
    for multicast support in\n   Proxy Mobile IPv6, but also can be applied to other
    solutions\n   envisioned as possible architectural evolutions of it. Furthermore,\n
    \  they are also independent of the role played by the mobile access\n   gateway
    within the multicast network (either acting as multicast\n   listener discovery
    proxy or multicast router).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
