abstract:
- content: "<p>This document highlights some of the issues that should be considered
    when IPSec [2] and Mobile IP [3] inter-work with each other. This work finds some
    applications in the following fields: VPN traversal requirement [4], IPSec Remote
    access client co-located with a Mobile Node, IPSec security Gateway running in
    parallel with a Home Agent or a MIP Proxy [5]. The purpose of this document is
    informational. Rather that strictly indicating how both protocol should take advantages
    of each other (IPSec running on top of Mobile IP or the other way around), which
    is a subjective task left to the user and implementation developers of both protocol,
    it rather proposes some usage guidelines and general considerations regarding
    the preference of one solution over the other one.</p>"
