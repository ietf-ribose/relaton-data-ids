abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The operator of the TURN server might want to have fine grained\n
    \  control on the clients usage of the server resources for providing\n   features
    such as limiting the bandwidth usage, number of allocations\n   and so on.  This
    document proposes a generic mechanism for the\n   operator to introspect the access
    token to retrieve any policy\n   restrictions imposed by the authorization server
    on the TURN server\n   resources assigned to the client.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
