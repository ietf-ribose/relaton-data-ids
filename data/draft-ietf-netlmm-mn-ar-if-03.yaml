abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an interface between mobile nodes (MNs) and
    a mobility access gateway (MAG) of a network-based localized mobility management
    (NETLMM) domain. The interface has two functions which are invoked when a MN attaches
    and detaches from a MAG. The attachment function lets the MAG authenticate the
    MN identifier, does address(es) and default router configuration for the MN, and
    informs the MAG about the multicast listener state of the MN. During the attachment
    function the NETLMM protocol is triggered between the MAG and Localized Mobility
    Anchor (LMA) to register the MN in the local domain. The detachment function lets
    the MAG detect that the MN has left so that it can deregister the MN at the LMA
    using the NETLMM protocol.</p>"
