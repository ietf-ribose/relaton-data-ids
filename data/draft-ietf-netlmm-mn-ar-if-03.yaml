abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes an interface between mobile nodes (MNs)
    and amobility access gateway (MAG) of a network-based localized mobilitymanagement
    (NETLMM) domain. The interface has two functions whichare invoked when a MN attaches
    and detaches from a MAG. Theattachment function lets the MAG authenticate the
    MN identifier, doesaddress(es) and default router configuration for the MN, and
    informsthe MAG about the multicast listener state of the MN. During theattachment
    function the NETLMM protocol is triggered between the MAGand Localized Mobility
    Anchor (LMA) to register the MN in the localdomain. The detachment function lets
    the MAG detect that the MN hasleft so that it can deregister the MN at the LMA
    using the NETLMMprotocol.</p>"
