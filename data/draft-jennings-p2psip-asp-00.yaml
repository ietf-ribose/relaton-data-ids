abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines Address Settlement by Peer-to-Peer (ASP),
    apeer-to-peer (P2P) binary signaling protocol for usage on theInternet. A P2P
    signaling protocol provides its clients with anabstract hash table service between
    a set of cooperating peers thatform the P2P network. ASP is designed to support
    a P2P SessionInitiation Protocol (SIP) network, but it can be utilized by otherapplications
    with similar requirements. ASP introduces the notion ofusages, which are a collection
    of data types that are required for aparticular application. For SIP, these types
    include location, STUNand TURN servers. ASP defines a security model based on
    acertificate enrollment service that provides peers with uniqueidentities. ASP
    also provides protocol extensibility and defines amigration methodology, allowing
    for major upgrades of the P2P networkwithout service disruption.</p>"
