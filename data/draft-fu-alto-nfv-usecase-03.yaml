abstract:
- content: "<p>This documentation presents a use case of Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) with the emergence of Network Function Virtualization (NFV).
    The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service provides network information
    (e.g., basic network location structure and preferences of network paths) with
    the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining
    or improving application performance. The emerging NFV, which is currently being
    in progress in ETSI NFV, leverages standard IT virtualisation technology to consolidate
    many network equipment types onto industry standard high-volume servers, switches,
    and storage. The use case presented in this document discusses the impact of virtualization
    on the ALTO protocol.</p>"
