abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes
    and\n   networks.  This specification provides a simple extension for CoAP,\n
    \  the Patience option.  This option informs a recipient of the\n   preferred
    time frame for a request or response depending on usage\n   context.  In a unicast
    request, it indicates the patience a client\n   has in waiting for a response.
    \ The CoAP server tries to return the\n   response within the specified time frame.
    \ In a multicast request, it\n   indicates the patience a server should have in
    sending its response.\n   The recipient would then try to randomly delay its response
    within\n   the time frame that the requester indicated or computed by the\n   recipient
    itself.  In a CoAP observe notification, it indicates the\n   patience an observer
    should have in both waiting for a subsequent\n   notification and in re-establishing
    an observation relation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
