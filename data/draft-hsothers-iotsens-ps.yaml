abstract:
- content: "<p>The document attempts to establish the need for new authentication
    methods in the Internet of Things (IoT) as a future networking area beyond 5G
    going into 6G for standardization. Several scenarios are described where the current
    authentication protocols do not work or are insufficient. Next we discuss a few
    new approaches such as Wireless LAN/6G sensing and LED light based which can be
    further explored.</p>"
