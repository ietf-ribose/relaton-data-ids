abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Transport Layer Security (TLS) master secret is not\n   cryptographically
    bound to important session parameters such as the\n   client and server identities.
    \ Consequently, it is possible for an\n   active attacker to set up two sessions,
    one with a client and another\n   with a server such that the master secrets on
    the two sessions are\n   the same.  Thereafter, any mechanism that relies on the
    master secret\n   for authentication, including renegotiation after session resumption,\n
    \  becomes vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, where the attacker\n   can
    simply forward messages back and forth between the client and\n   server.  This
    specification defines a TLS extension that contextually\n   binds the master secret
    to a log of the full handshake that computes\n   it, thus preventing such attacks.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
