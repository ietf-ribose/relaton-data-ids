abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo explores some choices that arise when IPsec is to be
    used \nto implement secure 'virtual links' interconnecting customer premises \nVPN
    devices and/or network based virtual routers.  The main focus is \non the network
    based cases. \nRequirements are proposed and some relevant aspects of the IPsec
    \nprotocol suite are discussed.  A number of different protocol \narchitectures
    for virtual links are then evaluated. \nThis memo is informational in nature;
    it is intended that it will \nfocus discussion toward a standard in this area.
    \n\t </p>\n      "
