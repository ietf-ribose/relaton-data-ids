abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Mapping of addresses to names is a feature of DNS. Many sitesimplement
    it, many others do not. Some applications attempt to useit as a part of a security
    strategy. This document outlines whatshould be taken into account when deciding
    whether to implementreverse mappings of addresses to names, suggests that siteadministrators
    implement reverse mappings if there are no strongconsiderations against such mappings,
    and provides considerations tobe taken into account when using reverse mappings.</p>"
