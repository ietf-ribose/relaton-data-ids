abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The File transfer protocol(FTP) has a long histroy,, but still
    being\n   widely used.  The first concept of FTP was described RFC 114, and\n
    \  then was specified in RFC 354.  FTP can work in IPv4 environment and\n   then
    was extended to IPv6.  RFC 2428 defines IPv6 extensions of FTP.\n   In the IPv6-IPv4
    translation scenario, considerations should be\n   applied to FTP client, server
    and translation box to ensure FTP\n   protocol work properly.  This document discusses
    the details for FTP\n   to work in IPv4-IPv6 transitiion scenario.  This document
    gives\n   recommendation regarding how IPv6 FTP client should behave in 6to4\n
    \  scenario.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
