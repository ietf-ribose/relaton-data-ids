abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) addresses
    the\n   needs of operators and application developers to represent\n   multiple
    types of policy rules. This document defines a common\n   structure for policy
    rules that is independent of language,\n   protocol, and the level of abstraction
    of the content of the\n   policy rule. This enables multiple policy rule data
    models to be\n   constructed from it.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
