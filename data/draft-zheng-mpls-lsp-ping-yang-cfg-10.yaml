abstract:
  content: "<p>When an LSP fails to deliver user traffic, the failure cannot always
    be detected by the MPLS control plane. RFC 8029 defines a mechanism that would
    enable users to detect such failure and to isolate faults. YANG, defined in RFC
    6020 and RFC 7950, is a data modeling language used to specify the contents of
    a conceptual data stores that allows networked devices to be managed using NETCONF,
    as specified in RFC 6241. This document defines a YANG data model that can be
    used to configure and manage LSP-Ping.</p>"
