abstract:
  content: <p>***replaces abstract in WG IM*** This document defines the information
    model for Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM). This includes
    the definition of information elements transported between SACM components (data
    in motion) and how to express their relationships. This information model is maintained
    as the IANA "SACM Information Elements" registry. The information model captures
    the information needs described in the use cases defined by SACM.</p>
