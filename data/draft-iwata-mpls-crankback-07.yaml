abstract:
  content: "<p>In a distributed, constraint-based routing environment, theinformation
    used to compute a path may be out of date. This meansthat Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) label switched path (LSP)setup requests may be blocked by links
    or nodes without sufficientresources. Crankback is a scheme whereby setup failure
    information isreturned from the point of failure to allow new setup attempts to
    bemade avoiding the blocked resources. Crankback can also be applied toLSP restoration
    to indicate the location of the failed link or node.This document specifies crankback
    signaling extensions for use inMPLS signaling using RSVP-TE as defined in 'RSVP-TE:
    Extensions toRSVP for LSP Tunnels', RFC3209, so that the LSP setup request can
    beretried on an alternate path that detours around blocked links ornodes. This
    offers significant improvements in the successful setupand recovery ratios for
    LSPs, especially in situations where a largenumber of setup requests are triggered
    at the same time.</p>"
