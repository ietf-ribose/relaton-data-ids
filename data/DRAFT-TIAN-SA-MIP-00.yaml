abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The speed extension to the Mobile Internet Protocol provides a
    way \nfor the Foreign Agents and Home Agents to perceive the moving speed \nof
    the Mobile Nodes. With the speed information popularized in the \nmobile IP network,
    the behavior of the Mobile IP implementation with \nspeed adaptive algorithm implemented
    will automatically adapt to the \nspeed of the Mobile Node so that the performance
    of the Mobile IP \nwonâ€™t decline dramatically in a rapid moving environment. At
    the same \ntime, the Mobile IP speed adaptive algorithm only requires reasonable
    \nresources that are enough for seamless handoff.  \n\t </p>\n      "
