abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>While the RTP payload format defined in RFC 2250 is generally
    applicable\nto all forms of MPEG audio or video, it is less suitable for MPEG
    1 or 2,\nlayer III audio (commonly known as 'MP3').  The reason for this is that\nan
    MP3 frame is not a true 'Application Data Unit' - it contains a\nback-pointer
    to data in earlier frames, and so cannot be decoded\nindependently of these earlier
    frames.  Because RFC 2250 defines that packet\nboundaries coincide with frame
    boundaries, it handles packet loss\ninefficiently when carrying MP3 data.  The
    loss of an MP3 frame will render\nsome data in previous (or future) frames useless,
    even if they are received\nwithout loss.\n \nIn this document we define a new
    RTP payload format for MP3 audio.  The new\nformat is essentially the same as
    that defined in RFC 2250, except for a\ndata-preserving rearrangement of the original
    MPEG frames, so that packet\nboundaries now coincide with true MP3 'Application
    Data Units'.  This new\nformat is therefore more data efficient in the face of
    packet loss.\n\t </p>\n      "
