abstract:
- content: <p>The purpose of this memo is to document how the requirements for publication
    of a routing protocol as an Internet Draft Standard have been satisfied by Border
    Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP-4). This report satisfies the requirement for
    "the second report", as described in Section 6.0 of RFC 1264. In order to fulfill
    the requirement, this report augments RFC 1773 and describes additional knowledge
    and understanding gained in the time between when the protocol was made a Draft
    Standard and when it was submitted for Standard. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>
