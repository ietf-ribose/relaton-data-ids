abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document focuses on control plane aspect related to both
    tenant\n   system to NVE control interface and NVE to Network Virtualization\n
    \  Authority (NVA) control interface NVE use to enable communication\n   between
    tenant systems, which is complementary to\n   [draft-kreeger-nvo3-hypervisor-nve-cp]
    that describes the high level\n   control plane requirements related to the interaction
    between tenant\n   system and NVE when the two entities are not co-located on
    the same\n   physical device.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
