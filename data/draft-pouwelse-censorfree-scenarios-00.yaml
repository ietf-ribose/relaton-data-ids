abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes some scenarios in which one can imagine that
    the ability of authoritarian regime to censor news dissemination is reduced. It
    tries to draw some conclusions about what's desirable and what's not acceptable
    for users in those scenarios. The CensorFree objective is to standardize the protocols
    for microblogging on smartphones with a focus on security and censorship resistance.
    Microblog entries are short text messages, possibly enriched with pictures or
    streaming video. The goal is to devise protocols which guard against all known
    forms of censorship such as: cyberspace sabotage, digital eavesdropping, infiltration,
    fraud, Internet kill switches and lawyer-based attacks with the best known protective
    methods.</p>"
