abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines an extensible metadata member that
    may be\n   inserted into the OAuth 2.0 responses to assist the clients to\n   process
    those responses.  It is expressed as a member called \"_links\"\n   that is inserted
    as the top level member in the responses.  It will\n   allow the client to learn
    where the members in the response could be\n   used and how, etc.  Since it is
    just a member, any client that does\n   not understand this extension should not
    break and work normally\n   while supporting clients can utilize the metadata
    to its advantage.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
