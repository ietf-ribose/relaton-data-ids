abstract:
  content: <p>This document specifies a set of cipher suites for the TransportLayer
    Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS) protocols that useElliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone
    (ECQV) certificates to authenticate anElliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV)
    exchange. These ciphersuites provide forward secrecy.Status of this MemoThis Internet-Draft
