abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes hierarchically structured binary encoding format
    called the Ruoska Encoding (RSK). The main design goals are minimal resource usage,
    well defined structured with good selection of widely known data types, and still
    extendable for future usage. The main benefit when compared to non binary hierarchically
    structured formats like XML is simplicity and minimal resource demands. Even basic
    XML parsing is time and memory consuming operation. When compared to other binary
    formats like encoding formats of ASN.1 the main benefit is simplicity. ASN.1 with
    different encondings is complex and even simple implementation needs a lot of
    effort.</p>"
