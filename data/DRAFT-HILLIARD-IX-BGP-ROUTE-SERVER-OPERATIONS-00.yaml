abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The growing popularity of Internet exchange points (IXPs) brings
    a\n   new set of requirements to interconnect participating networks.\n   While
    bilateral exterior BGP sessions between exchange participants\n   were previously
    the most common means of exchanging reachability\n   information, the overhead
    associated with dense interconnection has\n   caused substantial operational scaling
    problems for Internet exchange\n   point participants.\n\n   Multilateral interconnection
    can dramatically reduce the\n   administrative and operational overhead of IXP
    participation and is\n   now used by many IXP participants as a means of exchanging
    routing\n   information.\n\n   This document outlines operational considerations
    for multilateral\n   interconnections at IXPs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
