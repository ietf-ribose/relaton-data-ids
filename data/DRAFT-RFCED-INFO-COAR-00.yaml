abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a simple interface for running\nexternal
    programs, software or gateways under an information server in\na platform-independent
    manner. Currently, the supported information\nservers are HTTP servers.\n\nThe
    interface has been in use by the World-Wide Web since 1993. This\nspecification
    defines the interface known as 'CGI/1.2', which is an\nextension of the 'CGI/1.1'
    interface developed and documented at the\nU.S. National Centre for Supercomputing
    Applications [NCSA-CGI].  This\ndocument also defines the use of the CGI/1.2 interface
    on the Unix(R)\nand AmigaDOS(tm) systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
