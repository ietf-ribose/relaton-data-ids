abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a control channel based on IPv6, called Associated
    CHannel over IPv6 (ACH6), that may carry different types of control and management
    messages. By using the associated channel, messages can be transmitted between
    network nodes to provide functions like path identification, OAM, automatic protection
    switchover signaling, resource reservation, etc., targeting to provide high quality
    SLA guarantees to IPv6 services.</p>"
