abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the architecture of NFV configuration in the
    provider's network through a centralized management system and focus on the virtualisation
    characteristics related issues. It is also a typical scenario in cloud computing
    environment where end users do not have to install or manage their applications
    on their end hosts, but can install and manage their own featured powerful software
    application in the cloud. This specification describes an architecture of NFV
    configuration. It is also applicable to other use cases with similar requirements.</p>"
