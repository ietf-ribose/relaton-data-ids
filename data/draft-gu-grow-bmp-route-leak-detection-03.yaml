abstract:
- content: "<p>According to RFC7908 [RFC7908], Route leaks refer to case that the
    delivery range of route advertisements is beyond the expected range. For many
    current security protection solutions, the ISPs (Internet Service Providers) are
    focusing on finding ways to prevent the happening of route leaks. However, the
    real-time route leak detection if any occurs is important as well, and serves
    as the basis for leak mitigation. This document extends the BGP Monitoring Protocol
    (BMP) [RFC7854] to provide a routing security scheme suitable for ISPs to detect
    BGP route leaks at the prefix level.</p>"
