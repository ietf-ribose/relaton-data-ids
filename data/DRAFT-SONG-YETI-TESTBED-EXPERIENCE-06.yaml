abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) is built upon the foundation\n
    \  provided by the Root Server System -- that is, the critical\n   infrastructure
    that serves the DNS root zone.\n\n   Yeti DNS is an experimental, non-production
    testbed that provides an\n   environment where technical and operational experiments
    can safely be\n   performed without risk to production infrastructure.  This testbed\n
    \  has been used by a broad community of participants to perform\n   experiments
    that aim to inform operations and future development of\n   the production DNS.
    \ Yeti DNS is an independently-coordinated project\n   and is not affiliated with
    ICANN, IANA or any Root Server Operator.\n\n   The Yeti DNS testbed implementation
    includes various novel and\n   experimental components including IPv6-only transport,
    independent,\n   autonomous Zone Signing Key management, large cryptographic keys
    and\n   a large number of Yeti-Root Servers.  These differences from the Root\n
    \  Server System have operational consequences such as large responses\n   to
    priming queries and the coordination of a large pool of\n   independent operators;
    by deploying such a system globally but\n   outside the production DNS system,
    the Yeti DNS project provides an\n   opportunity to gain insight into those consequences
    without\n   threatening the stability of the DNS.\n\n   This document neither
    addresses the relevant policies under which the\n   Root Server System is operated
    nor makes any proposal for changing\n   any aspect of its implementation or operation.
    \ This document aims\n   solely to document the technical and operational experience
    of\n   deploying a system which is similar to but different from the Root\n   Server
    System.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
