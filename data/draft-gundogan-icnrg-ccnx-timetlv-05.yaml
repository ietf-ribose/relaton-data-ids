abstract:
- content: "<p>CCNx utilizes delta time for a number of functions. When using CCNx
    in environments with constrained nodes and/or bandwidth constrained networks,
    it is valuable to have a compressed representation of delta time. In order to
    do so, either accuracy or dynamic range has to be sacrificed. Since the current
    uses of delta time do not require both simultaneously, one can consider a logarithmic
    encoding such as that specified in [IEEE.754.2019]. This document updates _CCNx
    messages in TLV Format_ (RFC8609) to specify this alternative encoding.</p>"
