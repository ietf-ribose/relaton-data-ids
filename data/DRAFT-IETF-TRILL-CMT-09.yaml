abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL facilitates loop free connectivity to non-TRILL networks
    via\n   choice of an Appointed Forwarder for a set of VLANs. Appointed\n   Forwarders
    provide load sharing based on VLAN with an active-standby\n   model. High performance
    applications require an active-active load-\n   sharing model. The Active-Active
    load-sharing model can be\n   accomplished by representing any given non-TRILL
    network with a\n   single virtual RBridge. Virtual representation of the non-TRILL\n
    \  network with a single RBridge poses serious challenges in multi-\n   destination
    RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) check calculations. This\n   document specifies
    required enhancements to build Coordinated\n   Multicast Trees (CMT) within the
    TRILL campus to solve related RPF\n   issues. CMT provides flexibility to RBridges
    in selecting desired\n   path of association to a given TRILL multi-destination
    distribution\n   tree. This document updates RFC 6325.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
