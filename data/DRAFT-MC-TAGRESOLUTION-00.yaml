abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies automated description resolution mechanism\n
    \  for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) in the \"tag\" scheme.  Tag\n   URIs
    (also known as \"tags\") are designed to be non-dereferenceable,\n   however it
    may be useful for a tag minter to optinally provide a\n   public easily accessible
    description of the entity associated with a\n   tag.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
