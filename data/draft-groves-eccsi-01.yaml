abstract:
- content: "<p>Many signature schemes currently in use rely on certificates for authentication
    of identity. In Identity-based cryptography, this adds unnecessary overhead and
    administration. The Elliptic Curve-based Certificateless Signatures for Identity-based
    Encryption (ECCSI) signature scheme described in this document is certificateless.
    This scheme has the additional advantages of low bandwidth and low computational
    requirements. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
