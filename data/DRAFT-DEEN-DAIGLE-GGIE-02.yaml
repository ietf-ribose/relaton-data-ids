abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces the Glass to Glass Internet Ecosystem\n
    \  (GGIE).  GGIE's purpose is to improve how the Internet is used create\n   and
    consume video, both amateur and professional, reflecting that the\n   line between
    amateur and professional video technology is\n   increasingly blurred.  Glass
    to Glass refers to the entire video\n   ecosystem, from the camera lens to the
    viewing screen.  As the name\n   implies, GGIE's scope is the entire video ecosystem
    from capture,\n   through the steps of editing, packaging, distributed and searching,\n
    \  and finally viewing.  GGIE is not a complete end to end architecture\n   or
    solution, it provides foundational elements that can serve as\n   building blocks
    for new Internet video innovation.\n\n   This is a companion effort to the GGIE
    W3C Taskforce in the W3C Web\n   and TV Interest Group.\n\n   This document is
    being discussed on the ggie@ietf.org mailing list.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
