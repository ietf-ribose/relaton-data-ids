abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ACV Protocol provides a method for communication between
    a\n   cryptographic module that is embedded inside of a device or otherwise\n
    \  running on a platform accessible via computer network, and an\n   external
    testing system, using standard network communication\n   interfaces and protocols.
    \ This communication protocol can also be\n   used to validate the correctness
    of the algorithm implementations in\n   the cryptographic module with a validation
    authority.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
