abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We are considering the IETF Mobile IP WG proposed Low Latency
    Handoff\ndraft[2] in the different network scenerios and suggesting one simpler\nsolution
    with low loss, reduced number of timers, reduced network \noverhead, along with
    the low latency. One more achievement will \nbe reduction in the dependency on
    exact L2 trigger timing and \nPre-Registration timer expiration in Combined Handoff
    method[2].\n\t </p>\n      "
