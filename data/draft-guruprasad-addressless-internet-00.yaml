abstract:
  content: "<p>This Internet-Draft proposes elimination of end-to-end IP addressesfrom
    the Internet, presenting a stronger embodiment of the end-to-endprinciple by elevating
    the end-to-end aspects of connectivity androuting above the network to an operating
    system-like framework thatimplements virtual network addressing and efficient
    translation toswitched paths, obviating end-to-end addressing at all levels. Theresulting
    flexibility would allow, for example, piecewise transitionto IPv6 and full access
    to the existing Internet for the emergingwireless services without allocating
    new addresses.</p>"
