abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A number of IETF protocols make use of Abstract Syntax Notation
    One\n(ASN.1), which is a very complex language for describing abstract\ntypes
    and values, in addition to several sets of encoding rules for\nthose types and
    values.  Some of these uses of ASN.1, particularly\nthe Kerberos protocol [RFC1510]
    pose implementation problems.  This\ndocument analyzes some of the likely problems
    associated with the use\nof ASN.1 in IETF protocols, and some possible reasons
    for these\nproblems.\n\t </p>\n      "
