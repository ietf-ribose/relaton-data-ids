abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an HTTP header that allows the partitioning
    of\n   a single origin (as defined in RFC 6454) into multiple origins, so\n   that
    the same origin policy applies among them.\n\n   The header introduced in this
    document allows a portal to specify\n   that resources that appear to be from
    the same origin should, in\n   fact, be treated as though they are from different
    origins, by\n   extending the 3-tuple of the origin to a 4-tuple.  A compliant
    user\n   agent is expected to apply the same-origin policy according to the\n
    \  4-tuple rather than the 3-tuple.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
