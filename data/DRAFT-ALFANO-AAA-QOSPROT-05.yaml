abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a Diameter application that performs\n
    \  Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting for Quality of Service\n   (QoS)
    reservations.  This protocol is used by elements along the path\n   of a given
    application flow to authenticate a reservation request,\n   ensure that the reservation
    is authorized, and to account for\n   resources consumed during the lifetime of
    the application flow.\n   Clients that implement the Diameter QoS application
    contact an\n   authorizing entity/application server that is located somewhere
    in\n   the network, allowing for a wide variety of flexible deployment\n   models.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
