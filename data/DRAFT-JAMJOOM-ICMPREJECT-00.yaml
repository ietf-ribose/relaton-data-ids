abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the incorporation of a Reject message
    to \n\nICMP to improve a server’s ability for controlling TCP \n\nconnection requests
    during periods of overload beyond dropping \n\nthem.  The Reject message serves
    two purposes: (1) it can inform \n\na connecting host (the client) to completely
    abort the \n\nconnection attempt as if a connection timeout has expired, and \n\n(2)
    modify the retransmission timeout interval to reduce the \n\nclient’s wait times
    and also to break the re-synchronization of \n\nconnection requests when multiple
    SYN packets are dropped.  \n\nIntroducing an additional ICMP message, as opposed
    to modifying \n\nthe behavior of TCP, was motivated by the need for backward \n\ncompatibility
    (i.e., a host can ignore the ICMP Reject message \n\nwithout affecting the behavior
    of TCP) and incremental \n\ndeployment. \n\n         \n\t </p>\n      "
