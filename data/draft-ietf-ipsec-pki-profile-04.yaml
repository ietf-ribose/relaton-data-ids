abstract:
  content: "<p>ISAKMP and PKIX both provide frameworks that must be profiled for usein
    a given application. This document provides a profile of ISAKMPand PKIX that defines
    the requirements for using PKI technology inthe context of IPsec. The document
    compliments protocolspecifications such as IKE, which assume the existence of
    public keycertificates and related keying materials, but which do not addressPKI
    issues explicitly. This document addresses those issues.</p>"
