abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SIP as defined in RFC 3261 [1] defines a Via header as a construct
    to\nbe used for upstream response routing and for downstream assistance\nin loop
    detection.  There is an increasing need on downstream\nadministrative domains
    (ADs) to gain visibility into all the ADs in\nits upstream path.  The information
    needed is not IP based as\ninternal architectures at upstream ADs is of no consequence
    to\ndownstream ADs.  Logical domain marking, however, is desperately\nneeded for
    any traffic analysis to occur at the receiving side.\nGathering AD information
    from Via headers is non obvious and in many\ninstances nearly impossible.  This
    documents identifies the\nrequirements for addressing this issue.\n\t </p>\n      "
