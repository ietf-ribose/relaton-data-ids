abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies INSIGNIA, an in-band signaling system
    for\nsupporting quality of service (QOS) in mobile ad hoc networks. The\nterm
    `in-band signaling` refers to the fact that control information\nis carried along
    with data in IP packets. We argue that in-band\nsignaling is more suitable than
    explicit out-of-band approaches\n(e.g., RSVP) when supporting end-to-end quality
    of service in highly\ndynamic environments such as mobile ad hoc networks where
    network\ntopology, node connectivity and end-to-end quality of service are\nstrongly
    time-varying. INSIGNIA is designed to support the delivery\nof adaptive real-time
    services and includes fast\nsession/flow/microflow reservation, restoration and
    adaptation\nalgorithms between source/destination pairs. In this memo we discuss\nhow
    INSIGNIA fits into our broader vision of a wireless flow\nmanagement model for
    mobile ad hoc networks and how it interfaces to\nthe proposed MANET Working Group
    routing algorithm.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
