abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Acknowledgement (ACK) is a basic function and implemented in
    most of\n   the ordered and reliable transport protocols [RFC0793].  Legacy TCP\n
    \  ACK is designed with high frequency to guarantee correct interaction\n   between
    sender and receiver.  However, the shared nature of the\n   wireless medium over
    wireless local area network (WLAN) induces\n   contention between data transport
    and backward signaling, such as\n   acknowledgement.  The current way of TCP acknowledgment
    induces\n   control overhead which is counter-productive for TCP performance\n
    \  especially for WLAN scenarios.\n\n   This document conducts the ACK frequency
    breakdown, analyzes several\n   ways of reducing ACK frequency, and discusses
    the compatibility\n   issues with existing systems in detail.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
