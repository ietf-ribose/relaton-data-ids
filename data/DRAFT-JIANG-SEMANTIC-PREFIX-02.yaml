abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some Internet Service Providers and enterprises desire to be
    aware of\n   more information about each packet, so that packets can be treated\n
    \  differently and efficiently. Packet-level differentiating can also\n   enable
    flow-level and user-level differentiating.\n\n   IPv6, with a large address space,
    allows semantics to be embedded\n   into addresses. Routers can easily apply relevant
    operations\n   accordingly.\n\n   This document describes a framework that embeds
    semantics into IPv6\n   prefixes, so that network devices can treat packets based
    on these\n   explicit semantics. This document also analyzes on the technical
    gaps\n   for embedding complex semantics.\n\n   This informational document only
    discusses usage of semantics in a\n   Semantic Prefix Domain. It does NOT intent
    or suggest to standardize\n   any common global semantics.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
