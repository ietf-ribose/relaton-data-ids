abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS-SD Sleep Proxy Service uses a message format identical
    to\n   that used by standard DNS Update, with two additional pieces of\n   information:
    the identity of the sleeping server to which the records\n   belong, and the Wake-on-LAN
    Magic Packet bit pattern which should be\n   used to wake the sleeping server.
    \ This document specifies the EDNS0\n   option used to carry that additional information.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
