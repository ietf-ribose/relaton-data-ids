abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  A handover is the process during which a mobile node is handed
    over \n  between access networks. Especially for vertical handovers in overlay
    \n  networks the mobile node changes the access network using multiple \n  interfaces
    including different link layers, e.g., WLAN, GPRS, and \n  UMTS. Handovers occur
    as a consequence of lower layer (i.e., link-\n  layer) handovers that signify
    a switch of the physical connection to \n  a new location. For the duration of
    a handover, a mobile node is \n  unable to send or receive traffic. The length
    of this disruption is \n  considered critical because it affects the performance
    of the \n  communication. An additional factor is the link layer selection. It
    \n  implies the selection of the most suitable link layer from which a \n  mobile
    node should receive services. \n\t </p>\n      "
