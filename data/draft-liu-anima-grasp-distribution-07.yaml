abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the requirement of capability of information
    distribution among autonomic nodes in autonomic networks. In general, information
    distribution can be categorized into two different modes: 1) one autonomic node
    instantly sends information to other nodes in the domain; 2) one autonomic node
    can publish some information and then some other interested nodes can subscribe
    the published information. In the former case, information data will be generated
    and consumed instantly. In the latter case, however, information data shall be
    stored in the network and retrieved when necessary. These capabilities are fundamental
    and basic to a network system and an autonomic network infrastructure (ANI) should
    consider to integrate them, rather than assisted by other transport or routing
    protocols (HTTP, BGP/IGP as bearing protocols etc.). Thus, this document clarifies
    possible use cases and requirements to ANI so that information distribution can
    be natively supported. Possible options to realize the information distribution
    function are also briefly discussed.</p>"
