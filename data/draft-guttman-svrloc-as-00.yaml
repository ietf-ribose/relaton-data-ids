abstract:
- content: "<p>The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for the
    discovery and selection of network services. Using this protocol, computers using
    the Internet need little or no static configuration of network services for network
    based applications. This document describes the domain for which the protocol
    applies, in short networks under a common administration, compatibility issues
    among different versions of the protocol and provides an overview to the various
    IETF documents which concern the use of SLP.</p>"
