abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The offer/answer model for SDP assumes that endpoints establish,\n
    \  somehow, the QoS required for the media streams they establish.\n   Endpoints
    in closed environments typically agree out of band (e.g.,\n   using configuration
    information) which QoS mechanism to use.\n   However, on the Internet, there is
    more than one QoS service\n   available.  Consequently, there is a need for a
    mechanism to\n   negotiate which QoS mechanism to use for a particular media stream.\n
    \  This document defines such a mechanism.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
