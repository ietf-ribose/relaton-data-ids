abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As defined in I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn, enhanced VPN (VPN+)
    aims to\n   provide enhanced VPN service to support the needs of enhanced\n   isolation
    and stringent performance requirements.  VPN+ requires\n   integration between
    the overlay VPN and the underlay network.  A\n   Virtual Transport Network (VTN)
    is a virtual network which consists\n   of a subset of network topology and network
    resources allocated from\n   the underlay network.  A VTN could be used as the
    underlay for one or\n   a group of VPN+ services.\n\n   I-D.dong-lsr-sr-enhanced-vpn
    defines the IGP mechanisms with\n   necessary extensions to build a set of Segment
    Routing (SR) based\n   VTNs.  This document describes a simplified mechanism to
    build the SR\n   based VTNs using SR Flex-Algo together with minor extensions
    to IGP\n   L2 bundle.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
