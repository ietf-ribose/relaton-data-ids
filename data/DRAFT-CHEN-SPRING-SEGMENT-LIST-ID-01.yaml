abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing allows a node to steer a packet through an
    ordered\n   list of instructions, called segments.  The ingress node prepends
    a\n   SR header to a packet containing a set of \"segments\".  A segment can\n
    \  represent any instruction topological or service-based.\n\n   The Segment Routing
    architecture can be implemented using MPLS with\n   no change to the forwarding
    plane.  A segment is encoded as an MPLS\n   label.  An ordered list of segments
    is encoded as a stack of labels,\n   but it has implications on label stack depth.\n\n
    \  This document describes how to decrease the depth of the label stack\n   in
    order to do effective Segment Routing operation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
