abstract:
- content: "<p>The performance monitoring (PM) of BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks
    (L3VPN) is important for satisfying the Service Level Agreement(SLA) for critical
    network services. Since L3VPN is essentially using a multipoint-to-point service
    model, flow identification becomes a big challenge for L3VPN PM. This document
    specifies the framework and mechanisms for the application of PM in L3VPN.</p>"
