abstract:
- content: <p>Rules for validating identifier labels and alternate representations
    of those labels (variants) are known as "Label Generation Rulesets" (LGRs); they
    are used for the implementation of identifier systems such as Internationalized
    Domain Names (IDNs). This document describes ways of designing Label Generation
    Rulesets (LGRs) that support variant labels. In designing LGRs, it is important
    to ensure that the label generation rules are consistent and well-behaved in the
    presence of variants. The design decisions can then be expressed using the XML
    representation of LGRs that is defined in RFC7940.</p>
