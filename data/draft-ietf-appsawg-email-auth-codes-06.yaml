abstract:
- content: "<p>This document registers code points to allow status codes to be returned
    to an email client to indicate that a message is being rejected or deferred specifically
    because of email authentication failures. This document updates [RFC7208] since
    some of the code points registered replace the ones recommended for use in that
    document.</p>"
