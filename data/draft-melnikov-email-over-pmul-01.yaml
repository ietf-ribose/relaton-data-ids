    bandwidth constrained and delayed acknowledgement (EMCON) environments running
    over UDP. This document is a specification of the basic protocol for electronic
    mail transfer over P_MUL. It also described how to gateway this basic protocol
    to/from Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (RFC 5321).</p>"
