abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the application of security staining on an
    IPv6 datagrams and the minimum requirements for IPv6 nodes staining flows, IPv6
    nodes forwarding stained packets and interpreting stains on flows. The usage of
    the packet staining destination option enables proactive delivery of security
    intelligence to IPv6 nodes such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems,
    and end-points such servers, workstations, mobile and smart devices and an infinite
    array of as- yet-to-be-invented sensors and controllers.</p>"
