abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes an authentication protocol based on TLS
    pre \n   shared key (TLS-PSK), RFC 4279. Identity and psk attributes, defined
    \n   in TLS-PSK are extracted from EMV chips, which are widely deployed \n   for
    payments transactions. The goal of this protocol is to provide a \n   strong mutual
    authentication transparent for the end users and \n   guarantying the confidentiality
    and the integrity of exchanged data \n   over Internet network. \n   This is a
    new step avoiding the use of static passwords for on-line \n   services, such
    as electronic banking or electronic payment. \n\t </p>\n      "
