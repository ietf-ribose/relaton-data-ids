abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The EAP framework does not provide an effective way to protect
    the\n   peer's identity.  This creates the risk of identity forgery.  This\n   document
    revisits the EAP identity protection problem, and proposes a\n   solution to this
    problem via the use of Cryptographically Binding\n   Identity (CBID).\n\n\t </p>\n
