abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism that\nallows
    a User Agent Client (UAC) to request that a particular\nprotocol extension has
    to be used to process the request. The User\nAgent Server (UAS) declines the request
    if it does not support the\nextension. Recently also means have been defined for
    the User Agent\nServer (UAS) to determine which extensions are supported by the
    User\nAgent Client (UAC). Furthermore there are also means for requiring \nproxy
    servers to understand certain features.\n\t </p>\n      "
