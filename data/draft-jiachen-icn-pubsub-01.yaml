abstract:
- content: <p>Information-Centric Networks (ICN) provide substantial flexibility for
    users to obtain information without regard to the source of the information or
    its current location. Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems have gained popularity
    in society to provide the convenience of removing the temporal dependency of the
    user having to indicate an interest each time he or she wants to receive a particular
    piece of related information. Such an "information-centric" communication model
    should be supported in the new ICN network paradigm. This document outlines some
    research directions for ICN with respect to enhancing the inherently pull-based
    ICN approaches for achieving efficient pub/sub capability.</p>
