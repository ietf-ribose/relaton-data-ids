  content: "<p>This document describes two(2) extensions to the current diameterrouting
    scheme. The first extension describes an explicit routingmechanism that MAY be
    employed by Diameter nodes to allow specificstateful Diameter proxies to remain
    in the path of all messagesexchanges constituting a Diameter session. The second
    extensiondescribes a realm based redirection scheme as an alternative to hostbased
    redirection described in [RFC3588].</p>"
