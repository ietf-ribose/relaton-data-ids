abstract:
  content: "<p>The VIEW extension allows an [IMAP] client to create and manipulate
    mailbox views (persistent searches). All [IMAP] clients can access a view, as
    if it were an ordinary mailbox. Clients which implement the VIEW extension can
    create views. Clients which implement both VIEW and [LISTEXT] can find and modify
    existing views.</p>"
