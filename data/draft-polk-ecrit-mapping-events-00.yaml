abstract:
- content: "<p>Emergency calling is a localized event, requiring a caller to place
    an specially identified local emergency call to a Public Safety Answering Point
    (PSAP), while including the location of the caller in that signaling. The function
    of routing the set-up messaging to the appropriate PSAP is performed by a mapping
    function that binds a given location with one or more PSAP SIP(S)-URIs. This function
    is done by the ECRIT mapping protocol. This document analyzes when the ECRIT mapping
    protocol function can occur, and what general components are involved in that
    mapping.</p>"
