abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes a framework for simple caller authorization.\nIt
    is a generalization of the RMX draft[1], which was designed to\nprotect against
    e-mail fraud and spam.  This new draft describes a\ngeneral mechanism suitable
    for other protocols used in the Internet\nor other networks. It is designed to
    be simple and to not make use\nof any kind of secret, and to establish  a cheap,
    robust, and\nlightweight authorization scheme.  It is intended to be used for\nlow
    security requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
