abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document outlines a specialized, dynamic routing protocol
    for\n   Clos and fat-tree network topologies.  The protocol (1) deals with\n   automatic
    construction of fat-tree topologies based on detection of\n   links, (2) minimizes
    the amount of routing state held at each level,\n   (3) automatically prunes the
    topology distribution exchanges to a\n   sufficient subset of links, (4) supports
    automatic disaggregation of\n   prefixes on link and node failures to prevent
    black-holing and\n   suboptimal routing, (5) allows traffic steering and re-routing\n
    \  policies, (6) allows non-ECMP forwarding, (7) automatically re-\n   balances
    traffic towards the spines based on bandwidth available and\n   ultimately (8)
    provides mechanisms to synchronize a limited key-value\n   data-store that can
    be used after protocol convergence to e.g.\n   bootstrap higher levels of functionality
    on nodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
