abstract:
- content: "<p>This protocol allows for transaction level authentication using shared
    secrets and one way hashing. It can be used to authenticate dynamic updates as
    coming from an approved client, or to authenticate responses as coming from an
    approved name server. No provision has been made here for distributing the shared
    secrets: it is expected that a network administrator will statically configure
    name servers and clients using some out of band mechanism. This document includes
    revised original TSIG specifications (RFC2845) and its extension for HMAC-SHA
    (RFC4635).</p>"
