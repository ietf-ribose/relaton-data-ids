abstract:
- content: "<p>The Request Routing Interface comprises of (1) the asynchronous advertisement
    of footprint and capabilities by a downstream CDN that allows a upstream CDN to
    decide whether to redirect particular user requests to that downstream CDN; and
    (2) the synchronous operation of an upstream CDN requesting whether a downstream
    CDN is prepared to accept a user request and of a downstream CDN responding with
    how to actually redirect the user request. This document describes an interface
    for the latter part, i.e. the CDNI request routing/ Redirection Interface.</p>"
