abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo analyzes the need for SIP extensions for SPIT (Spam
    Over\n   Internet telephony) identification.  This memo describes requirements\n
    \  and gives an overview of possible solutions to send feedback\n   information
    using the SIP protocol for the scope of SPIT.  Feedback\n   information from the
    users to the SPIT identification system (e.g.,\n   working closely with the callee's
    SIP proxy server) are important for\n   SPIT detection and prevention.  The overall
    SPIT protection systems\n   on the internet will benefit from such information.
    \ The basic idea\n   is that each user who receives a SPIT session request, will
    send a\n   feedback to SPIT identification system (for example, using a button\n
    \  on the user interface of the client).  Information could be also\n   exchanged
    among domains and/or servers in order to increase\n   effectiveness of SPIT detection
    systems.  The idea is that SIP proxy\n   servers and/or B2BUAs include SPIT likeliness
    estimations (based on\n   some knowledge they have which is out of the scope of
    this draft) as\n   additional message headers (e.g.  INVITE headers) when forwarding\n
    \  such messages to other domains.  This memo identifies the parameters\n   that
    the SPIT identification system may need in order to detect\n   abusive behaviors;
    moreover it proposes an overview of technical\n   solutions how such information
    can be sent back to the SPIT\n   identification system by means of the SIP protocol.
    \ The memo also\n   addresses the technical solutions on how forward information
    could be\n   passed among domains as well as how communication initiation could
    be\n   denied to users (e.g. blacklisted ones).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
