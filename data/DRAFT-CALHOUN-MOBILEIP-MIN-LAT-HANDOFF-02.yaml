abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Mobile IP Working Group has been working on defining its AAA\nrequirements,
    which currently supports a Key Distribution Center\n(KDC) model that issues temporary
    session keys for use between the\nmobility nodes. In order to support real-time
    traffic, the Mobile IP\narchitecture also requires that hand-off be done in a
    quick and\nefficient manner, and has provisions to allow new foreign agents to\nretrieve
    the session keys from the AAA infrastructure.\nAlthough the AAA infrastructure
    can assist in the hand-off process,\nthis is largely a mobility problem, and should
    be dealt with in the\nmobility protocol.  This draft describes how the mobile
    node can\nassist in the hand-off process by carrying the foreign agent's keying\ninformation,
    providing the keys to new foreign agents (within the\nsame administrative domain)
    while registering. This proposal is\nintended to decrease the latency involved
    in the hand-off process,\nthereby enabling seamless real time traffic over Mobile
    IP networks.\nThis draft still allows the foreign agents to get keying information\nfrom
    the AAA infrastructure should that be necessary.\nAt present, authentication in
    Mobile IP uses shared key cryptography.\nHowever, this proposal is general enough
    to be able to accommodate\nauthentication based on public key digital signatures
    if and when it\nbecomes feasible.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
