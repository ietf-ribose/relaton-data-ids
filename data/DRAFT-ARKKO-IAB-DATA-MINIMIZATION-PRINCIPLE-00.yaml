abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Communications security has been at the center of many security\n
    \  improvements in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that\n   communications
    are protected against outside observers and attackers.\n   This memo suggests
    that this is no longer alone sufficient to cater\n   for the security and privacy
    issues seen on the Internet today.  For\n   instance, it is often also necessary
    to protect against endpoints\n   that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests
    simply do not\n   align with the interests of users.  While such protection is\n
    \  difficult, there are some measures that can be taken.  It is\n   particularly
    important that new technology and new deployments\n   consider the role of data
    passed to various parties -- including the\n   primary protocol participants --
    and balance the information given to\n   them considering their roles and possible
    compromise of the\n   information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
