abstract:
- content: "<p>The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol is commonly used
    to verify connectivity between two systems. BFD packets are typically very small.
    It is desirable in some circumstances to know that not only is the path between
    two systems reachable, but also that it is capable of carrying a payload of a
    particular size. This document discusses thoughts on how to implement such a mechanism
    using BFD in Asynchronous mode.</p>"
