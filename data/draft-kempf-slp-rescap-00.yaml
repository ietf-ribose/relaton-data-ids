abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The danger in defining a new protocol specifically for discoveringresources
    on the Internet is that, like DNS, the protocol wouldprobably be deployed internally
    as well. Developers would then havethe opportunity to use the protocol to perform
    service discovery onthe client side by downloading resources and inferencing over
    themrather than using protocols such as Service Location Protocol (SLP)or Lightweight
    Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) that inference onthe server side. Besides the
    increased amount of network trafficinvolved in transferring attributes rather
    than the smaller query,every client would need to incorporate its own inferencing
    code. Inthis document, we discuss how the requirements for wide area resourcediscovery
    can be met by slightly modifying SLP to remove featuresmore appropriate for internal
    networks and by establishing a fewnaming conventions. An added benefit of this
    design is that Internetclients can perform service discovery as well as simple
    resourcediscovery. It should be noted the proposals in this document are notmeant
    to suggest that SLP is the only or even the best candidate forInternet resource
    discovery among existing protocols. The point ofthis paper is to emphasize the
    need for a concerted effort to make anexisting discovery or directory services
    protocol fill the Internetresource discovery niche, rather than inventing yet
    another protocoloffering discovery or directory services capabilites.</p>"
