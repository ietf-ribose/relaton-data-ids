abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>For the new network configuration concept discussed at XMLCONF,
    we\nmention the importance of building new network architecture.  We can\nnot
    develop and discuss the concept using XML because it is only\ntools but the concept
    is confusable.  The consensus of architecture\nis required to clarify the items
    and technologies that should be\ndiscussed and standardized at IETF.\n\n\t </p>\n
