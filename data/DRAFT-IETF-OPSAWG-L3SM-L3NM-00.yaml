abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC8299 defines a L3VPN Service YANG data Model (L3SM) that
    can be\n   used for communication between customers and network operators.  Such\n
    \  model is adequate for the customer to network operator conversation\n   and
    plays the role of a Customer Service Model, according to the\n   terminology defined
    in RFC8309.\n\n   There is a need for a YANG model to be used in the communication\n
    \  between the entity that interacts directly with the customer, the\n   service
    orchestrator, (either fully automated or a human operator)\n   and the entity
    in charge of network orchestration and control (aka\n   network controller / orchestrator).\n\n
    \  This document proposes a L3VPN Network Yang Model (L3NM) to\n   facilitate
    communication between a service orchestrator and a network\n   controller / orchestrator.
    \ The resulting model is called the L3VPN\n   Network Model (L3NM) and provides
    a network-centric view of the L3VPN\n   services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
