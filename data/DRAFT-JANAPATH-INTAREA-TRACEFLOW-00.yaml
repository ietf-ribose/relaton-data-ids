abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a new OAM protocol - TraceFlow that
    captures\n   information pertaining to a traffic flow along the path that the
    flow\n   takes through the network. TraceFlow is ECMP and link-aggregation\n   aware
    and captures the information about constituent members through\n   which the traffic
    flow passes. TraceFlow gathers information that is\n   relevant to the flow such
    as outgoing interface Layer 3 address,\n   Next-hop to which the packet of the
    flow is forwarded, effect of\n   network policies such as access control lists
    on the flow. This draft\n   requires the Traceflow protocol to be processed by
    Layer 3 devices\n   only. Devices such as Layer 2 devices, MPLS LERs/LSRs along
    the way\n   are passed through without any processing as if in a pass-through\n
    \  mode. IP tunnels such as IP-in-IP, IP-in-GRE mechanisms are expected\n   to
    pass the Traceflow packets through them using the pass through\n   mode.  For
    achieving its purpose Traceflow advocates the use of a\n   specific UDP destination
    port to be assigned from IANA.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
