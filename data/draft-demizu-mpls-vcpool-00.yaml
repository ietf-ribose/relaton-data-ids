abstract:
- content: "<p>Several label switching schemes have been proposed to fuse and integrate
    Layer 2 and Layer 3. They can be applied to various datalinks including intermittent
    links such as ATM SVC. Intermittent links require signaling to establish VCs before
    employing them and to release VCs after utilizing them. Because signaling often
    introduces delays and costs, some kind of optimization is necessary. This document
    proposes to introduce a VC pool to reduce the delays and the costs of signaling.</p>"
