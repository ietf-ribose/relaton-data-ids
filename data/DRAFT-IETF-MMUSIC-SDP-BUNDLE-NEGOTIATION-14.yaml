abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a new Session Description Protocol
    (SDP)\n   Grouping Framework extension, 'BUNDLE'.  The extension can be used\n
    \  with the SDP Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a\n   single
    address:port combination (BUNDLE address) for receiving media,\n   referred to
    as bundled media, associated with multiple SDP media\n   descriptions (\"m=\"
    lines).\n\n   To assist endpoints in negotiating the use of bundle this\n   specification
    defines a new SDP attribute, 'bundle-only', which can\n   be used to request that
    specific media is only used if bundled.  This\n   specification also updates sections
    5.1, 8.1 and 8.2 of RFC 3264 to\n   allow an answerer to assign a non-zero port
    value to an \"m=\" line in\n   an SDP answer, even if the \"m=\" line in the associated
    SDP offer\n   contained a zero port value.\n\n   There are multiple ways to correlate
    the bundled RTP packets with the\n   appropriate media descriptions.  This specification
    defines a new\n   RTCP source description (SDES) item and a new RTP header extension\n
    \  that provides an additional way to do this correlation by using them\n   to
    carry a value that associates the RTP/RTCP packets with a specific\n   media description.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
