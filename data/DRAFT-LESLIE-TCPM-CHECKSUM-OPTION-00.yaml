abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are a number of situations in TCP where middleboxes are
    known\n   to change TCP-layer data; and it would be helpful for endpoints to\n
    \  detect such changes.  TCP-Checksum is a TCP option to pass checksums\n   over
    particular fields from sender to receiver, which can detect such\n   changes by
    legacy middleboxes.  This document also sets a rule for\n   future middleboxes
    which insist upon modifying these checksums.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
