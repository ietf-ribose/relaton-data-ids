abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates PKINIT, as defined in RFC 4556, to remove\n
    \  protocol structures tied to specific cryptographic algorithms.  The\n   PKINIT
    key derivation function is made negotiable, the digest\n   algorithms for signing
    the pre-authentication data and the client's\n   X.509 certificates are made discoverable.\n\n
    \  These changes provide preemptive protection against vulnerabilities\n   discovered
    in the future against any specific cryptographic\n   algorithm, and allow incremental
    deployment of newer algorithms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
