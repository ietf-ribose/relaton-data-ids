abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of extensions to SIP which allow for
    various call control services. Example services include blind transfer, transfer
    with consultation, multi-party calls, bridged conferences, and ad-hoc conferencing.
    The services are supported in a fully distributed manner, so that they can be
    provided without a central conference server. However, a SIP proxy can act as
    a conference server to provide these services. For the various services described
    here, we overview the requirements for the service, and specify the protocol functions
    needed to support it. We then define a basic set of SIP primitives which can be
    used to construct these services, and others.</p>"
