abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a set of extensions to SIP which allow forvarious
    call control services. Example services include blindtransfer, transfer with consultation,
    multi-party calls, bridgedconferences, and ad-hoc conferencing. The services are
    supported in afully distributed manner, so that they can be provided without acentral
    conference server. However, a SIP proxy can act as aconference server to provide
    these services. For the various servicesdescribed here, we overview the requirements
    for the service, andspecify the protocol functions needed to support it. We then
    define abasic set of SIP primitives which can be used to construct theseservices,
    and others.</p>"
