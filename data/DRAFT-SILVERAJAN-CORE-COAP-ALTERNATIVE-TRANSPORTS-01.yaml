abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is being standardised as an application level REST-based\n
    \  protocol.  A single CoAP message is typically encapsulated and\n   transmitted
    using UDP.  This draft examines the requirements and\n   possible solutions for
    conveying CoAP packets to end points over\n   alternative transports to UDP.  While
    UDP remains an optimal solution\n   for use in IP-based constrained environments
    and nodes, M2M\n   communication using non-IP networks, NAT and firewall traversal\n
    \  issues and possibly mechanisms incurring a lower overhead to CoAP/\n   HTTP
    gateways provide compelling motivation for understanding how\n   CoAP can operate
    in various other environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
