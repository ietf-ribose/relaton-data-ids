abstract:
  content: <p>This document presents a technique for a NETCONF server to initiate
    a SSH connection to a NETCONF client. This is accomplished by the NETCONF client
    listening on IANA-assigned TCP port YYYY and starting the SSH client protocol
    immediately after accepting a TCP connection on it. This role-reversal is necessary
    as the NETCONF server must also be the SSH server, in order for the NETCONF client
    to open the IANA-assigned SSH subsystem "netconf".</p>
