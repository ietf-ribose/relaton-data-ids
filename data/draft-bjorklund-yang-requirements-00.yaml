abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft addresses requirements for a NETCONF data modeling language
    and how the YANG Modeling Language proposes to fulfill these requirements or specifically
    chooses not to. Requirements have been gathered from multiple documents and each
    document's requirements are handled in a separate section in this draft. This
    draft also explains some of the design choices behind YANG.</p>"
