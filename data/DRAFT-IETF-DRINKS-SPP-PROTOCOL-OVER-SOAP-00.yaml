abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF) is an XML
    framework\n   that exists to enable the provisioning of session establishment
    data\n   into Session Data Registries or SIP Service Provider data stores.\n   Sending
    XML data structures over Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)\n   and HTTP(s)
    is a widely used, de-facto standard for messaging between\n   elements of provisioning
    systems.  Therefore the combination of SOAP\n   and HTTP(s) as a transport protocol
    for SPPF is a natural fit.  The\n   obvious benefits include leveraging existing
    industry expertise,\n   leveraging existing standards, and a higher probability
    that existing\n   provisioning systems can be more easily integrated with this\n
    \  protocol.  This document describes the specification for transporting\n   SPPF
    XML structures over SOAP and HTTP(s).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
