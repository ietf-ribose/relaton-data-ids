abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an architectural work that competes with
    the\nIP Fast Re-Route (IPFRR) solution which aims to minimize the network\ndown
    time in the event of equipments failure.  The work provides a\nlayered framework
    based upon which applications such as the domain-\nwide fast convergence may be
    achieved through the transport layer\nfast delivery of failure notifications.\n\t
