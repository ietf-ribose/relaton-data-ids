abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends Directory-Based Information Services
    (DBIS)\n   described in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support ethers and\n
    \  bootparams databases.\n\n   The database schemas SHALL be backwards compatible
    with the Network\n   Information Service [NIS] but stored within [X.500] entries
    so that\n   they may be resolved with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n
    \  [RFC4510].\n\n   An ethers database maps 48-bit Ethernet addresses to IP addresses
    or\n   host names, and bootparams maps hosts to boot-time kernel parameters.\n\n
    \  This document describes LDAP object classes and attributes required\n   to
    extend hosts entries [draft-bannister-dbis-hosts-00] to support\n   parameters
    for ethers and bootparams maps.\n\t </p>\n      "
