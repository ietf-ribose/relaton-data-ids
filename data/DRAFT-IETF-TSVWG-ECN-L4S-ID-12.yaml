abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines the identifier to be used on IP
    packets\n   for a new network service called low latency, low loss and scalable\n
    \  throughput (L4S).  L4S uses an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)\n   scheme
    that is similar to the original (or 'Classic') ECN approach.\n   'Classic' ECN
    marking was required to be equivalent to a drop, both\n   when applied in the
    network and when responded to by a transport.\n   Unlike 'Classic' ECN marking,
    for packets carrying the L4S\n   identifier, the network applies marking more
    immediately and more\n   aggressively than drop, and the transport response to
    each mark is\n   reduced and smoothed relative to that for drop.  The two changes\n
    \  counterbalance each other so that the throughput of an L4S flow will\n   be
    roughly the same as a non-L4S flow under the same conditions.\n   Nonetheless,
    the much more frequent control signals and the finer\n   responses to them result
    in much more fine-grained adjustments, so\n   that ultra-low and consistently
    low queuing delay (typically sub-\n   millisecond on average) becomes possible
    for L4S traffic without\n   compromising link utilization.  Thus even capacity-seeking
    (TCP-like)\n   traffic can have high bandwidth and very low delay at the same
    time,\n   even during periods of high traffic load.\n\n   The L4S identifier defined
    in this document distinguishes L4S from\n   'Classic' (e.g. TCP-Reno-friendly)
    traffic.  It gives an incremental\n   migration path so that suitably modified
    network bottlenecks can\n   distinguish and isolate existing traffic that still
    follows the\n   Classic behaviour, to prevent it degrading the low queuing delay
    and\n   low loss of L4S traffic.  This specification defines the rules that\n
    \  L4S transports and network elements need to follow to ensure they\n   neither
    harm each other's performance nor that of Classic traffic.\n   Examples of new
    active queue management (AQM) marking algorithms and\n   examples of new transports
    (whether TCP-like or real-time) are\n   specified separately.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
