abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Verified Hello (VHLO) is an SMTP extension for managing authorizationby
    policy, as done for whitelisting messages. The VHLO command verbprovides for weak
    authentication of SMTP clients and policynegotiation.Policies and reputation are
    being increasingly used to identifymessages worthiness. However, they are currently
    enforced byrejecting SMTP transactions, or discarding messages. Feedback isscarce,
    also because reply codes are difficult to interpretautomatically. Negotiation
    is not provided for. VHLO is designed sothat servers can provide feedback to their
    clients about whichvouching services or authentication methods they require.Credentials
    can also be negotiated on the fly, in order to allowclients to learn whether messages
    will be whitelisted by thereceiving server before actually transmitting them.
    Negotiation andfeedback are intended to ease rapid diffusion of popular reputationsystems
    and authentication methods. A IANA register is defined forextending the set of
    available methods.The VHLO command is similar to EHLO, but accepts a series ofparameters.
    The sender communicates the mail domain name of theorganization on whose behalf
    it operates, along with any vouchingservices (VBR) for its reputation. On the
    other hand, the sendinghost's affiliation with that mail domain is checked by
    DNS lookups(MX, PTR, or SPF) or using DKIM. DNSBLs and Greylisting are alsoconsidered.Weakly
    authenticated clients enjoy an intermediate level of trust:they have no relying
    privileges, but may attempt to deliver mail tolocal users, are whitelisted from
    some filters, and may receive DSNsand feedback-loop abuse reports as needed. However,
    failing tosuccesfully negotiate VHLO authentication does not preclude aclient's
    ability to relay mail: It may relay as usual; that is tosay, without knowing whether
    the credentials it tries to provide haveany meaning for the receiving server.</p>"
