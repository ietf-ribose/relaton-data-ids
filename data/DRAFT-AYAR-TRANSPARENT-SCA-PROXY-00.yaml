abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft complements the work of MPTCP by defining a TCP
    Splitter/\n   Combiner Architecture (SCA) that enables non-MPTCP-capable single-\n
    \  homed hosts to benefit from the multiple paths within Internet by\n   means
    of performance enhancing proxies (PEPs) placed in the access\n   networks.\n\n
    \  SCA Proxies (SCAPs) make use of multiple paths in a way which is\n   completely
    transparent to end-hosts.  Since the existence of the\n   SCAPs is shielded from
    the TCP end-points, they can be deployed in\n   the Internet as well as on the
    end-systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
