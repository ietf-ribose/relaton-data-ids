abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft documents the Web Cache Coordination Protocol (WCCP)\nV1.0.
    This protocol is used (a) to associate a single router with one\nor more web-caches
    for the purposes of transparent redirection of HTTP\ntraffic, and (b) to allow
    one of the web-caches to dictate how the\nrouter distributes transparently-redirected
    traffic across the\nassociated web-caches.\nThis draft describes the interactions
    between a router and one or more\nweb-caches. It does not describe the interactions
    between a group of\nassociated web-caches or those between a web-cache and a web-server.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
