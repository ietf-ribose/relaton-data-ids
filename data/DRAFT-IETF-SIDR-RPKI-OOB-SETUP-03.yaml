abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note describes a simple out-of-band protocol to ease setup
    of\n   the RPKI provisioning and publication protocols between two parties.\n
    \  The protocol is encoded in a small number of XML messages, which can\n   be
    passed back and forth by any mutually agreeable secure means.\n\n   This setup
    protocol is not part of the provisioning or publication\n   protocol, rather,
    it is intended to simplify configuration of these\n   protocols by setting up
    relationships and exchanging BPKI keying\n   material.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
