abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses most common scenarios of connecting
    an\n   enterprise network to multiple ISPs using an address space assigned\n   by
    an ISP.  The problem of enterprise multihoming without address\n   translation
    of any form has not been solved yet as it requires both\n   the network to select
    the correct egress ISP based on the packet\n   source address and hosts to select
    the correct source address based\n   on the desired egress ISP for that traffic.\n
    \  [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming] proposes a solution to\n   this
    problem by introducing a new routing functionality (Source\n   Address Dependent
    Routing) to solve the uplink selection issue and\n   using Router Advertisements
    to influence the host source address\n   selection.  While the above-mentioned
    document focuses on solving the\n   general problem and on covering various complex
    use cases, this\n   document describes how the solution proposed in\n   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming]
    can be adopted for limited\n   number of common use cases.  In particular, the
    focus is on scenarios\n   where an enterprise network has two Internet uplinks
    used either in\n   primary/backup mode or simultaneously and hosts in that network
    might\n   not yet properly support multihoming as described in [RFC8028].\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
