abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There is a need to be able to quantify and report the performance
    of\nnetwork applications and the network service in handling user data.\nThis
    performance data provides information essential in validating\nservice level agreements,
    fault isolation as well as early warnings\nof greater problems.  This document
    describes IPFIX Information\nElements related to performance measurement of network
    based\napplications.  In addition, to the performance information several\nnon-metric
    information elements are also included to provide greater\ncontext to the reports.
    \ The measurements use audio/video\napplications as a base but are not restricted
    to these class of\napplications.\n\t </p>\n      "
