abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>TMMH is a `universal' hash function suitable for message\nauthentication
    in the Wegman-Carter paradigm, as in the Stream\nCipher Security Transform.  It
    is simple, quick, and especially\nappropriate for Digital Signal Processors and
    other processors with\na fast multiply operation, though a straightforward implementation\nrequires
    storage equal in length to the largest message to be\nhashed.\n\t </p>\n      "
