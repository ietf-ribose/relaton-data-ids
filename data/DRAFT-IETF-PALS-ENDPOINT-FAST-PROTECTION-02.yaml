abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a fast mechanism for protecting pseudowires\n
    \  against egress endpoint failures, including egress attachment circuit\n   failure,
    egress PE failure, multi-segment PW terminating PE failure,\n   and multi-segment
    PW switching PE failure.  Operating on the basis of\n   multi-homed CE, redundant
    PWs, upstream label assignment and context\n   specific label switching, the mechanism
    enables local repair to be\n   performed by the router upstream adjacent to a
    failure.  The router\n   can restore a PW in the order of tens of milliseconds,
    by rerouting\n   traffic around the failure to a protector through a pre-established\n
    \  bypass tunnel.  Therefore, the mechanism can be used to reduce\n   traffic
    loss before global repair reacts to the failure and the\n   network converges
    on the topology changes due to the failure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
