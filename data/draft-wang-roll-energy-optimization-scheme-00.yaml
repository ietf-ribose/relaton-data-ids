abstract:
- content: "<p>Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are composed of devices that have
    constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power). It is obvious
    that conserving energy is especially important in the LLNs. This document is aimed
    at proposing an efficient and effective scheme to optimize the energy in the process
    of seeking the DAG root node.</p>"
