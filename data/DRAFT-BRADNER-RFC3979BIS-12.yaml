abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR),
    such as\n   patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are\n
    \  designed to ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as\n   much
    information as possible about any IPR constraints on a technical\n   proposal
    as early as possible in the development process. The\n   policies are intended
    to benefit the Internet community and the\n   public at large, while respecting
    the legitimate rights of IPR\n   holders.  This document sets out the IETF policies
    concerning IPR\n   related to technology worked on within the IETF.  It also describes\n
    \  the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.  This document\n   updates
    RFC 2026 and, with RFC 5378, replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026.\n   This document
    also obsoletes RFC 3979 and RFC 4879.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
