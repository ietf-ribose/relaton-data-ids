abstract:
- content: "<p>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include query
    capabilities to find the list of domains related to a set of entities matching
    a given search pattern. Even if such capabilities, commonly referred as reverse
    search, respond to some needs not yet readily fulfilled by the current Whois protocol,
    they have raised concerns from two perspectives: server processing impact and
    data privacy. Anyway, the impact of the reverse queries on RDAP servers processing
    is the same as the standard searches and it can be reduced by implementing policies
    to deal with large result sets, while data privacy risks can be prevented by RDAP
    access control functionalities. This document describes RDAP query extensions
    that allow clients to request a reverse search based on the domains- entities
    relationship.</p>"
