abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Designing a routing protocol for large low-power and lossy
    networks\n   (LLNs), consisting of thousands of constrained nodes and unreliable\n
    \  links, presents new challenges.  The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-\n   power
    and Lossy Networks (RPL), have been developed by the IETF ROLL\n   Working Group
    as a preferred routing protocol to provide IPv6 routing\n   functionality in LLNs.
    \ Unfortunately, the currently available\n   security services in RPL will not
    protect against a compromised\n   internal node that can construct and disseminate
    fake messages.\n   Therefore, in RPL special security care must be taken when
    the\n   Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root is updating\n
    \  the Version Number by which reconstruction of the routing topology\n   can
    be initiated.  The same care also must be taken to prevent an\n   internal attacker
    (compromised DODAG node) to publish decreased Rank\n   value, which causes a large
    part of the DODAG to connect to the DODAG\n   root via the attacker and give it
    the ability to eavesdrop or\n   manipulate a large part of the network traffic.
    \ In this document, a\n   new security service is described that prevents any
    misbehaving DODAG\n   node from illegitimately increasing the Version Number or
    publish\n   illegitimately decreased Rank values.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
