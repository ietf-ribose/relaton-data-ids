abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RADIUS specifications have used data types for two decades,
    without\n   defining them as managed entities.  During this time, RADIUS\n   implementations
    have named the data types, and have used them in\n   attribute definitions.  This
    document updates the specifications to\n   match established practice.  We do
    this by naming the data types\n   defined in RFC 6158, which have been used since
    at least RFC 2865.\n   We provide an IANA registry for the data types, and update
    the RADIUS\n   Attribute Type registry to include a \"Data Type\" field for each\n
    \  attribute.  Finally, we recommend that authors of RADIUS\n   specifications
    use these types in preference to existing practice.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
