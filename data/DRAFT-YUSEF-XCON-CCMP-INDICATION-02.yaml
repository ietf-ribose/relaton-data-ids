abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol document
    defines\n   away for a client to discover a conference control server that\n   supports
    CCMP. However, it does not define a way for a client\n   involved in a conference
    to determine if the conference focus\n   supports CCMP. This information would
    allow a CCMP-enabled client\n   that joins a conference using SIP to also register
    for the XCON\n   conference event package and take advantage of CCMP operations
    on the\n   conference.\n\n   This draft describes few options to address the above
    limitation with\n   the pros and cons for each approach.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
