abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When setting up a real-time communication session, there may
    be a\n   need to indicate preference for which media and modality (spoken,\n   written
    or signed) to use for language communications or a need to\n   indicate preference
    for receiving the same language content\n   simultaneously in two modalities.
    \ This document defines the\n   semantics for grouping media for such purposes
    in the Session\n   Description Protocol (SDP).  The semantics defined in this
    document\n   are based on the SDP Grouping Framework.  Applications are for\n
    \  example negotiation the most suitable common modality or modalities\n   for
    language communications in a real-time session.  The indications\n   are specified
    for the sending and receiving direction separately.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
