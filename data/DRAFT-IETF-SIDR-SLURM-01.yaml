abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a global\n
    \  authorization infrastructure that allows the holder of Internet\n   Number
    Resources (INRs) to make verifiable statements about those\n   resources.  Network
    operators, e.g., Internet Service Providers\n   (ISPs), can use the RPKI to validate
    BGP route origination\n   assertions.  In the future, ISPs also will be able to
    use the RPKI to\n   validate the path of a BGP route.  Some ISPs locally use BGP
    with\n   private address space or private AS numbers (see RFC6890).  These\n   local
    BGP routes cannot be verified by the global RPKI, and SHOULD be\n   considered
    invalid based on the global RPKI (see RFC6491).  The\n   mechanisms described
    below provide ISPs with a way to make local\n   assertions about private (reserved)
    INRs while using the RPKI's\n   assertions about all other INRs.\n\n\t </p>\n
