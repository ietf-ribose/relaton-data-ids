abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends Directory-Based Information Services (DBIS) described
    in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support hosts, networks, netmasks, protocols,
    rpc and services databases. The database schemas SHALL be backwards compatible
    with the Network Information Service [NIS] but stored within [X.500] entries so
    that they may be resolved with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510].
    A hosts database maps hostnames to IP addresses, networks map network names to
    network numbers, netmasks map network numbers to netmasks, protocols map network
    protocol names to protocol numbers, rpc maps Remote Procedure Call [RFC1057] program
    names to RPC program numbers and services map network service names to port numbers
    and protocols. This document describes configuration maps [draft-bannister-dbis-
    mapping-00] for hosts, networks, protocols, rpc and services, and database entries
    referenced by those maps.</p>"
