abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This informational memo contains a description of somemeasurements
    from early DiffServ (DS) experiments that used apreliminary version of IBM's DiffServ
    implementation on an IBMrouter over an egress T1/E1 PPP interface. The service
    levelspecification (SLS) may be configured on the router or optionallycontrolled
    by an LDAP-accessible policy repository. Themeasurements were intended to examine
    the behavior of a mixtureof Expedited Forwarding (EF) traffic, Assured Forwarding
    (AF)traffic and Best Effort (BE) traffic on a congested E1 link. Therouter code
    includes an LDAP client that communicates with apolicy server to obtain the policies
    that control the amount ofresources configured for the DiffServ classes.The diagrams
    referred to in this memo are available in thepostscript version of this memo.Changes
    from -00 versionAdded the details of the buffering setup, a discussion of ananomaly
    in the AF delay results, added an additional measurementpoint related to this
    anomaly, updated author list, addedacknowledgements, and miscellaneous editorial
    comments.</p>"
