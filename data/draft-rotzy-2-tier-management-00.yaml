abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a two-tier resource management model for differentiated
    services networks. Following the approach taken by the Internet routing architecture,
    we propose that bilateral service agreements are made for aggregate border-crossing
    traffic between neighboring administrative domains. We also propose that administrative
    domains individually make their own decision on strategies and protocols to use
    for internal resource management and QoS support, both to meet internal client
    needs and to fulfill external commitments. We sketch out one specific realization
    of this two-tier model by having a Bandwidth-Broker (BB) as the resource manager
    for each domain and a BB-to-BB protocol, equivalent to BGP in routing, for inter-domain
    resource management. We believe that this two-tier resource management model matches
    the direction of, and complement the work by, the diffserv effort. We also expect
    this two-tier model to scale well in the global, heterogeneous Internet. Note:
