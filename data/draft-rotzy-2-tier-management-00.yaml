abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft proposes a two-tier resource management model fordifferentiated
    services networks. Following the approach taken bythe Internet routing architecture,
    we propose that bilateral serviceagreements are made for aggregate border-crossing
    traffic betweenneighboring administrative domains. We also propose thatadministrative
    domains individually make their own decision onstrategies and protocols to use
    for internal resource management andQoS support, both to meet internal client
    needs and to fulfillexternal commitments. We sketch out one specific realization
    of this two-tier model byhaving a Bandwidth-Broker (BB) as the resource manager
    for eachdomain and a BB-to-BB protocol, equivalent to BGP in routing, forinter-domain
    resource management. We believe that this two-tierresource managementmodel matches
    the direction of, and complement the work by, thediffserv effort. We also expect
    this two-tier model to scale wellin the global, heterogeneous Internet. Note:
