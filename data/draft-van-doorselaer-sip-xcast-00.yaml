abstract:
  content: "<p>Explicit Multicast (xcast) is a multicast scheme that uses anexplicit
    list of destinations instead of one logical multicastaddress. Explicit Multicast
    complements the existing multicastschemes in that it can efficiently support very
    large numbers ofdistinct (small) multicast groups and thus can play an importantrole
    in making multicast practical for applications such asmultiparty IP telephony,
    various conferencing &amp; collaborativeapplications, multiparty networked games,
    etc...This document explains how multiparty IP telephony conferencesmaking use
    of xcast can be established by SIP carrying SDP. Someopen issues will be identified
    and discussed. Possible extensions toSIP and SDP to streamline the use of xcast
    will be suggested aswell.</p>"
