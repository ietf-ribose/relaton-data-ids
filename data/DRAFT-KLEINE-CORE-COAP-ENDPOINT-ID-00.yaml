abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is an application
    layer\n   protocol for constrained devices (e.g.low power, few memory) and\n   networks
    (e.g. lossy, low bandwidth) which relies on UDP on the\n   transport layer.  With
    CoAP it is often the case, that message\n   exchanges need to extend the common
    request/response pattern, e.g.\n   for seperate responses.  This holds, e.g. for
    CON requests that are\n   confirmed by the server with an empty ACK and answered
    later with a\n   seperate response.  According to the CoAP specification the request/\n
    \  response matching is realized using a unique pair of server address\n   and
    token per client.\n\n   Due to the mobile nature of some devices. e.g. smartphones,
    they are\n   often assigned new IP addresses because of a network change.  Thus,\n
    \  the IP address of a CoAP server might change during an ongoing\n   conversion.
    \ This draft proposes a method to assign each\n   communication partner with an
    identifier (endpoint ID) which replaces\n   the IP address as (partial) key to
    relate requests and responses.\n\n   Besides the common seperate responses, the
    proposed method is also\n   useful to handle IP address changes, e.g.  during
    an ongoing\n   observation ([observe]) or a blockwise transfer ([block]).\n\n\n\t
