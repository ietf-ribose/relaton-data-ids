abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Working Group Secretary's role was succinctly defined in
    RFC\n   2418. However, this role has greatly evolved and increased both in\n   value
    and scope, since the writing of RFC 2418. This document updates\n   RFC 2418 by
    providing a new definition of the Working Group\n   Secretary's role. This document
    also provides a compilation of good\n   practices and general guidelines regarding
    the fulfilment of the\n   role.\n\n   This document is intended for established
    Working Group Secretaries,\n   individuals motivated by taking up that role, or
    anyone else simply\n   interested in understanding better the Working Group Secretary's\n
    \  role. This document may also be useful for Working Group Chairs to\n   better
    appreciate and help develop the value of Working Group\n   Secretaries.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
