abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 has two different mechanisms for dynamic/automatic host\n
    \  configuration: SLAAC and DHCPv6.  These two mechanisms allow for the\n   configuration
    of IPv6 addresses and a number of network parameters.\n   While there is overlap
    in the parameters that can be configured via\n   these two protocols, different
    implementations support only subsets\n   of such parameters with either mechanism,
    or have no support for\n   DHCPv6 at all.  This document analyzes a problem that
    arises from\n   this situation, and mandates that all host implementations support\n
    \  RFC 6105 (DNS options for SLAAC) and the stateless DHCPv6\n   functionality
    in RFC 3315.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
