    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) is found in [HIER].However, support of multiple client
    layer networks and addressseparation as allowed by the Automatically Switched
    Optical Network(ASON) architecture [G.8080] are not covered by [HIER]. Thisinternet
    draft describes additional requirements to consider for theuse of LSP hierarchy
    in ASON networks.</p>"
