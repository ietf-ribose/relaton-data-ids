abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes the steps and challenges of sharing documents\nbetween
    persons, using internet-connected servers. We investigate the\nsituation where
    a document exists on a server to which the sender has\naccess through some software
    application, but the recipient(s) don't.\nAll recipient(s) do, however, have access
    to software applications that\nrun on least one other server.\n\nWe discuss existing
    and proposed methods for the sender to initiate the\ncommunication, for each recipient
    to become aware of the sender's intent\nto share a document, for each recipient
    to access the document directly,\nfor the document contents to be transmitted
    to server(s) to which the\nrecipient(s) have access, for the sender to make and
    announce changes in\nthe document after it was initially sent, and for the recipient(s)
    to\ncommunicate comments and proposed changes to the document back to the\nsender.\n\nWe
    also discuss how semantics of the document may be communicated,\nand how versioning
    conflicts may then in some cases be resolved\nprogrammatically. Given that users
    of personal servers don't all run\nthe same compatible software on their server,
    the sending application\nneeds to discover which application-level protocols are
    supported by the\nreceiving application(s).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
