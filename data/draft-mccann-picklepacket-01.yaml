abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the Pickle Packet, a message that can be
    usedto coordinate the opening of a transport connection with variousmiddleboxes
    that may lie on the path. It contains the DNS names ofboth the initiator and the
    responder of the connection and someauthentication data. Because the authentication
    data uses public keycryptography, any middlebox can independently authenticate
    theinitiator and make a policy decision whether to allow or deny theflow based
    on the DNS names. The Pickle Packet allows formiddleboxes to establish state such
    as firewall pinholes or securityassociations that can be used to filter out unwanted
    traffic.</p>"
