abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a means of multiplexing RTP streams
    having\n   different media types within a single transport connection and how
    to\n   represent this multiplexing option in SDP.  This mechanism is an\n   alternative
    to the BUNDLE and SHIM proposals currently under active\n   consideration in AVTCORE.
    \ Instead of adding an extra multiplexing\n   header as in SHIM to allow multiple
    RTP sessions within a single\n   transport connection, or using the payload type
    field to separate\n   different media streams within a single RTP session, this
    document\n   describes how to partition the existing SSRC space to create RTP\n
    \  subsessions from a single RTP session.  A filter can be used to\n   identify
    each RTP subsession for different QoS handling as necessary.\n   RTP subsessions
    can be treated like RTP sessions with a few\n   restrictions.  In particular,
    SSRC mapping may be needed when\n   forwarding RTP streams into an RTP subsession
    to avoid SSRC\n   conflicts, but there are few use cases in which this limitation
    is a\n   concern and RTP subsessions can be disabled if necessary.\n\n\t </p>\n
