abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Endpoint Name Resolution Protocol (ENRP) is designed to work in\nconjunction
    with Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP) [ASAP]. ENRP when combined with ASAP
    provdes a fault tolerant data transfer mechanism\nover IP networks. ASAP uses
    a name-based addressing model which\nisolates a logical communication endpoint
    from its IP address(es),\nthus effectively eliminating the binding between the
    communication\nendpoint and its physical IP address(es) which normally constitutes
    a\nsingle point of failure.\n\nThe fault tolerant server pooling is gained by
    combining the two parts,\nnamely ASAP and the Endpoint Name Resolution Part (ENRP).
    \ ASAP\nprovides the user interface for name to address translation, load\nsharing
    management, and fault management.  ENRP defines the fault\ntolerant name translation
    service.\n\t </p>\n      "
