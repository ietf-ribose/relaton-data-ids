abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) has
    been recently standardized as the de facto solution for routing in the context
    of the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. RPL, along with other standards,
    has provided a baseline framework for IoT that has helped advance communications
    in the world of embedded resource-constrained networks. However, RPL still suffers
    from issues that may limit its efficiency such as the absence of an efficient
    load-balancing primitive. To address this problem, a novel load- balancing scheme
    is introduced that ensures a fair distribution of traffic among nodes while minimizing
    overhead</p>"
