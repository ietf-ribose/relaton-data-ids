abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo discusses how routers can 'leak' routing information
    learned from one routing domain into another routing domain.                                                                                                  Although
    this memo is not an official product of the Router Requirements working group,
    it is being published as an Internet Draft because it is required reading for
    those who wish to actively participate in the Router Requirements sessions during
    the IETF meeting in Atlanta.\n\t </p>\n      "
