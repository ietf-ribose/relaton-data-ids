abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This  document  describes  the   associativity-based   long-lived\nrouting
    (ABR) protocol for ad hoc mobile networks. It is a simple\nand bandwidth-efficient
    distributed routing protocols which  does\nnot attempt to consistently maintain
    routing information in every\nnode. In an ad hoc wireless network where mobile
    hosts are acting\nas  routers  and  where  routes  are  made inconsistent by mobile\nhosts'
    movement, we propose an Associativity-based routing scheme\nwhere  a  route  is
    \ selected based on nodes having associativity\nstates that imply periods of spatial,
    \ temporal,  connection  and\nsignal  stability. In this manner, the routes selected
    are likely\nto  be  long-lived  and  hence  there  is  no  need  to   restart\nfrequently,
    \  resulting  in  higher  attainable  throughput.  Our\nproposed protocol is based
    on source-initiated on-demand routing.\nRoute  requests  are  broadcast  on a
    per-need basis. To discover\nshorten the route discovery time when the association
    property is\nviolated,  the  localized-  query  and quick-abort mechanisms are\nrespectively
    incorporated  into  the  protocol.  The  association\nproperty  also  allows  the
    \ integration of ad hoc routing into a\nbase station oriented wireless  LAN  environment,
    \ providing  the\nfault  tolerance  in  times  of base station failures. This
    draft\nwill describe the protocol functions and information about packet\nheaders
    and routing tables.\n\t </p>\n      "
