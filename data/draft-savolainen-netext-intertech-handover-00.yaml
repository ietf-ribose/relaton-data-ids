abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network based mobility managementprotocol
    which provides IP mobility service to a host in a way whichis transparent to the
    host itself. This document analyses thescenarios in which a multi-interfaced Mobile
    Node roams in a ProxyMobile IPv6 domain which consists of access networks that
    are ofdifferent types. In order to support session continuity as theMobile Node
    moves between access networks within the PMIP6 domain,the Mobile Node either needs
    to use host based Mobile IP or beenhanced with various capabilities described
    in this document.</p>"
