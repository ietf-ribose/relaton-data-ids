abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies Neighbor Discovery optimized for 6LoWPAN.\nThe
    6LoWPAN format allows IPv6 to be used over very low-power, low-\nbandwidth wireless
    networks often making use of extended multihop\ntopologies.  However, the use
    of standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery\nover 6LoWPAN networks has several problems.
    \ Standard Neighbor\nDiscovery was not designed for wireless links, the standard
    IPv6 link\nconcept and heavy use of multicast makes it inefficient.  This\ndocument
    spefies a new mechanism allowing efficient Duplicate Address\nDetection over entire
    6LoWPAN networks.  In addition it specifies\nprefix and context dissemination
    for use with router advertisements,\nallows for stateless address assignment,
    and the use of Neighbor\nDiscovery Proxy.\n\t </p>\n      "
