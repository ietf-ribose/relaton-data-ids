  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the conventions for using the HSS/LMS
    hash-\n   based signature algorithm with the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption\n
    \  (COSE) syntax.  The HSS/LMS algorithm is one form of hash-based\n   digital
    signature; it is described in RFC 8554.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
