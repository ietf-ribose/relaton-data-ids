abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for popular IP-within-IP
    tunnels\n   is currently recommended to be set to 1500 (or less) minus the length\n
    \  of the encapsulation headers when static MTU determination is used.\n   This
    requires the tunnel ingress to either fragment any IP packet\n   larger than the
    MTU or drop the packet and return an ICMP Packet Too\n   Big (PTB) message.  Concerns
    for operational issues with Path MTU\n   Discovery (PMTUD) point to the possibility
    of MTU-related black holes\n   when a packet is dropped due to an MTU restriction.
    \ The current\n   \"Internet cell size\" is therefore stuck at 1500 bytes (i.e.,
    the\n   minimum MTU configured by the vast majority of links in the\n   Internet),
    but the desired end state is full accommodation of MTU\n   diversity.  This document
    therefore presents a method to boost the\n   tunnel MTU to larger values.\n\n\t
