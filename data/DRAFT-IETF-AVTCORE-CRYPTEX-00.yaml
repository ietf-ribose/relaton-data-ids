abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   While the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) provides\n
    \  confidentiality for the contents of a media packet, a significant\n   amount
    of metadata is left unprotected, including RTP header\n   extensions and contributing
    sources (CSRCs).  However, this data can\n   be moderately sensitive in many applications.
    \ While there have been\n   previous attempts to protect this data, they have
    had limited\n   deployment, due to complexity as well as technical limitations.\n\n
    \  This document proposes a new mechanism to completely encrypt header\n   extensions
    and CSRCs as well a simpler signaling mechanism intended\n   to facilitate deployment.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
