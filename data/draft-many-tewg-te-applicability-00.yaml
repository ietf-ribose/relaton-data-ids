abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the applicability of Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) to traffic engineering in IP networks. Special considerations for deployment
    of MPLS for traffic engineering in operational contexts are discussed and the
    limitations of the MPLS approach to traffic engineering are highlighted. This
    document is intended for the Internet informational track.</p>"
