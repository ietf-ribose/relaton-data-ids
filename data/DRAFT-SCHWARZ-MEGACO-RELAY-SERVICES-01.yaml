abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the terminology and gives a network model
    for\ndifferent strategies concerning Voiceband Data (VBD) transport services.\nThe
    purpose of this effort is to set the reference space for describing\nand evaluating
    Megaco/H.248 signaling procedures. Primary scope are\nvoiceband data services,
    typically inherent part in voice-over-packet\nnetworks (e.g., like Internet Telephony).\nMotivation:\nVBD
    calls typically start out as a voice call. The modems on the VBD\ndevices at the
    Termination detect the switch to VBD (like facsimile) and\nfax modem or data modem
    transmission begins. With the development of\nVoice over IP, many CODECs have
    been developed which are optimized for\nthe transmission and reception of voice.
    In creating these CODECs, VBD\ntransport may not reliably be used over the same
    transmission channel.\nIn an effort to optimize the transmission of VBD, specialized
    protocols\n(e.g., T.38, or V.150) have been developed to provide a more reliable\ntransport,
    minimize bandwidth usage, etc.\n\t </p>\n      "
