- content: "<p>Some IPv4 multicast datagrams should not be routed, either within an
    administrative domain or between administrative domains. A list of those restrictions
    is supplied here. These restrictions SHOULD be respected by IPv4 multicast applications
    and included in network device access control lists. IANA should permanently reserve
    certain address ranges.</p>"
