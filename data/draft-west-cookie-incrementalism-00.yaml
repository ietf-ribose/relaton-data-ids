abstract:
  content: <p>This document proposes two changes to cookies inspired by the properties
    of the HTTP State Tokens mechanism proposed in [I-D.west-http-state-tokens]. First,
    cookies should be treated as "SameSite=Lax" by default. Second, cookies that explicitly
    assert "SameSite=None" in order to enable cross-site delivery should also be marked
    as "Secure".</p>
