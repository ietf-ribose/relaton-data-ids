abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines a new disposition type (early-session) for
    theContent-Disposition header field in SIP. The treatment of'early-session' bodies
    is similar to the treatment of 'sessionbodies. That is, they follow the offer/answer
    model. Their onlydifference is that session descriptions whose disposition type
    is'early-session' are used to establish early media sessions withinearly dialogs,
    as opposed to regular sessions within regular dialog</p>"
