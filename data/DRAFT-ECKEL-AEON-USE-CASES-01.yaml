abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes application enabled open networking
    use\n   cases.  Application enabled open networking (AEON) is a framework in\n
    \  which applications explicitly signal their flow characteristics to\n   the
    network.  This provides network nodes with visibility of the\n   application flow
    characteristics, which enables them to apply the\n   correct flow treatment and
    provide feedback to applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
