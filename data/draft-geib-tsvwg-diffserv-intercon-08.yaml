abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a limited and well defined set of DiffServ PHBs
    and codepoints to be applied at (inter)connections of two separately administered
    and operated networks. Many network providers operate MPLS using Treatment Aggregates
    for traffic marked with different DiffServ PHBs, and use MPLS for interconnection
    with other networks. This document offers a simple interconnection approach that
    may simplify operation of DiffServ for network interconnection among providers.</p>"
