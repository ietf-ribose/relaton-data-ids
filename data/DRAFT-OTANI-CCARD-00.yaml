abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes basic ideas and data components of\n
    \  'Capability Card,' which is a kind of attribute certificates designed\n   from
    the standpoint of a secure communication framework on the\n   Internet. Similar
    to the SPKI certificates, a capability card can be\n   used to grant a person
    particular access privileges to resources like\n   WWW pages, IRC channels, and
    message boxes.  In addition, it can\n   carry a variety of descriptive information
    about the issuer, the\n   resources, and the privileges specified in it.  A capability
    card is\n   written in XML, which is becoming a standard format rapidly for the\n
    \  internet data exchange. Consequently, users can handle various\n   information
    in capability cards visually with an XML viewer.  This is\n   a fairly desirable
    feature for the existing internet services.\n \n   In this document, following
    the motivation and the basic concepts,\n   the elements of XML DTD of capability
    cards are described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
