abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The DNS has long been used to publish lists of IPv4 address ranges
    inblacklists and whitelists. The size of the IPv6 address space makesthe entry-per-IP
    approach used for IPv4 lists impractical. A newtechnique for publishing IP address
    ranges is described. It isintended to permit efficient publishing and querying,
    and to havegood DNS cache behavior.</p>"
