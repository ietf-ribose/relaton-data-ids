abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS has long been used to publish lists of IPv4 address ranges
    in blacklists and whitelists. The size of the IPv6 address space makes the entry-per-IP
    approach used for IPv4 lists impractical. A new technique for publishing IP address
    ranges is described. It is intended to permit efficient publishing and querying,
    and to have good DNS cache behavior.</p>"
