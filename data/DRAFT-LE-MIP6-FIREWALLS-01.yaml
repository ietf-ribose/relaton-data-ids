abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     Firewalls are an integral aspect of a majority of IP networks
    today\n     given the state of security issues, threats and vulnerabilities to\n
    \    data networks. IP networks today are predominantly based on IPv4\n     technology
    and hence firewalls have been designed for these\n     networks. IPv6 networks
    are growing at a slow rate. Firewalls for\n     IPv6 networks are still maturing
    and in development.\n     The IETF has recently standardized Mobile IPv6 which
    adds mobility\n     support to IPv6. Given the fact that Mobile IPv6 is a recent\n
    \    standard, most firewalls available for IPv6 networks today do not\n     support
    Mobile IPv6.\n     Unless firewalls are aware of Mobile IPv6 protocol details,
    these\n     security devices will hamper large-scale deployment of the\n     protocol.
    This document presents in detail some of the issues that\n     people deploying
    IPv6 networks which include firewalls should\n     consider when expanding the
    scope to support Mobile IPv6 as well.\n     The issues are not only applicable
    to firewalls protecting\n     corporate networks, but are also applicable in 3G
    mobile networks\n     such as GPRS/UMTS and cdma2000 networks where packet filters
    are\n     implemented in the GGSN in GPRS/UMTS networks and the PDSN in\n     cdma2000
    networks.\n     The goal of this Internet draft is to highlight the issues with\n
    \    firewalls and Mobile IPv6 and act as an enabler for further\n     discussion.
    Issues identified here can be solved by developing\n     appropriate solutions
    in the MIP6 WG.\n\t </p>\n      "
