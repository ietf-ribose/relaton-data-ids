abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is an addendum to Version 1 of RSVP (Resource\n
    \  ReSerVation Protocol) as defined in the proposed standard [RFC2205].\n   The
    flow label, one of the new header fields of the IPv6 protocol,\n   allows improvements
    to resource reservation protocols on IPv6 capable\n   networks.  Utilization of
    the flow label simplifies packet\n   classification and optimizes packet processing
    in routers along the\n   transport path.\n \n   The main objectives of this document
    are to specify the proper usage\n   of the IPv6 flow label and to promote its
    support within RSVP.  This\n   memo defines extensions required to the Version
    1 specification and\n   additional processing rules needed to ensure correct operation.\n
    \  Rather than simply presenting the specification with no\n   justification,
    we have tried to present the benefits of adopting the\n   flow label within RSVP
    for IPv6.  This addendum does not have any\n   effect on the implementation or
    usage of RSVP for IPv4.\n\t </p>\n      "
