abstract:
  content: "<p>National Bibliography Numbers, NBNs, are used by the national libraries
    and other organizations in order to identify various resources such as digitized
    monographs. Generally, NBNs are applied to resources that do not have an established
    (standard) identifier system of their own. A URN (Uniform Resource Names) namespace
    for NBNs was established in 2001 in RFC 3188. Since then, several European national
    libraries have implemented URN:NBN-based systems. This document replaces RFC 3188
    and defines how NBNs can be supported within the updated URN framework. A revised
    namespace registration (version 4) compliant to the RFC 3406bis draft is included.</p>"
