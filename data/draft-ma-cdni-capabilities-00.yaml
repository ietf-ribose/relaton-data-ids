abstract:
- content: "<p>The interconnection of Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) is predicated
    on the ability of downstream CDNs (dCDNs) to handle end- user requests in a functionally
    equivalent manner to the upstream CDN (uCDN). The uCDN must be able to assess
    the ability of the dCDN to handle individual requests. A CDN interconnection (CDNI)
    interface is needed to facilitate the advertisement of capabilities by the dCDN
    to the uCDN. This document describes an approach to implementing a CDNI capabilities
    advertisement interface.</p>"
