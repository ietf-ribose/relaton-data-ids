abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Pip is an internet protocol intended as the replacement for IP
    version 4.  The Pip header defines source and destination ID fields whose primary
    function it is to identify the source and destination of a Pip packet.  While
    Pip systems treat the IDs as flat for the purpose of identification, it is useful
    to have hierarchical structure in the ID for other purposes, such as for doing
    a reverse DNS lookup on the ID.  This internet-draft defines the structure of
    Pip IDs.\n\t </p>\n      "
