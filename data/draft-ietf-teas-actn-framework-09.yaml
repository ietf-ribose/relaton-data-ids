abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic Engineered networks have a variety of mechanisms to facilitate
    the separation of the data plane and control plane. They also have a range of
    management and provisioning protocols to configure and activate network resources.
    These mechanisms represent key technologies for enabling flexible and dynamic
    networking. Abstraction of network resources is a technique that can be applied
    to a single network domain or across multiple domains to create a single virtualized
    network that is under the control of a network operator or the customer of the
    operator that actually owns the network resources. This document provides a framework
    for Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN).</p>"
