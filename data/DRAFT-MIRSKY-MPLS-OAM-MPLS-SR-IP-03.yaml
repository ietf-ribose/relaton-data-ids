abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment routing uses source routing paradigm to traffic engineering\n
    \  by specifying segments a packet traverses through the network.  MPLS\n   Segment
    Routing applies that paradigm to an MPLS data plane-based\n   networks.  SR-MPLS
    over IP uses MPLS label stack as a source routing\n   instruction set and uses
    IP encapsulation/tunneling such as MPLS-in-\n   UDP as defined in RFC 7510 to
    realize a source routing mechanism\n   across MPLS, IPv4, and IPv6 data planes.
    \ This document describes\n   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance operations
    in SR-MPLS\n   over IP environment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
