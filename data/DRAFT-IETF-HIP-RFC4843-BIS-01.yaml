abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document introduces Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash\nIdentifiers
    (ORCHID) as a new, experimental class of IPv6-address-\nlike identifiers.  These
    identifiers are intended to be used as\nendpoint identifiers at applications and
    Application Programming\nInterfaces (API) and not as identifiers for network location
    at the\nIP layer, i.e., locators.  They are designed to appear as application\nlayer
    entities and at the existing IPv6 APIs, but they should not\nappear in actual
    IPv6 headers.  To make them more like vanilla IPv6\naddresses, they are expected
    to be routable at an overlay level.\nConsequently, while they are considered non-routable
    addresses from\nthe IPv6 layer point-of-view, all existing IPv6 applications are\nexpected
    to be able to use them in a manner compatible with current\nIPv6 addresses.\n\nThis
    document requests IANA to allocate a temporary prefix out of the\nIPv6 addressing
    space for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash\nIdentifiers.  By default, the prefix
    will be returned to IANA in\n2014, with continued use requiring IETF consensus.\n\t
