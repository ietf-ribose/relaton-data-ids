abstract:
- content: "<p>Babel is a routing protocol based on the distance-vector algorithm
    augmented with mechanisms for loop avoidance and starvation avoidance. In this
    document, we argue that there exist niches where Babel is useful and that are
    not adequately served by more mature protocols.</p>"
