abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies Binomial congestion control At Receivers
    for\nMulticast (BARM). BARM is a single rate multicast congestion control\nprotocol
    for streaming media applications in the best effort Internet\nenvironment. Combining
    aspects of window-based and rate-based congestion\ncontrol, the protocol shifts
    most of the congestion control mechanisms\nto multicast receivers. A congestion
    window is maintained and updated\nby each receiver independently according to
    TCP-friendly binomial\nalgorithm, and is converted to the expected sending rate
    which is then\nfed back to the sender if permitted. To suppress feedback implosion,
    a\nrepresentative receiver is selected among receivers and a distributed\nsuppression
    mechanism is used. BARM has good TCP-friendliness,\nsmoothness, scalability, and
    acceptable responsiveness.\n\t </p>\n      "
