abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Service Registration Protocol for DNS-Based Service Discovery\n
    \  uses the standard DNS Update mechanism to enable DNS-Based Service\n   Discovery
    using only unicast packets.  This eliminates the dependency\n   on Multicast DNS
    as the foundation layer, which greatly improves\n   scalability and improves performance
    on networks where multicast\n   service is not an optimal choice, particularly
    802.11 (Wi-Fi) and\n   802.15.4 (IoT) networks.  DNS-SD Service registration uses
    public\n   keys and SIG(0) to allow services to defend their registrations\n   against
    attack.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
