abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   PIM Flooding Mechanism and Source Discovery (PFM-SD) is a mechanism\n
    \  for source discovery within a PIM domain.  PIM signaling over BIER\n   has
    been defined, allowing for BIER to interoperate with PIM.  This\n   document defines
    PFM-SD over BIER, such that PFM-SD can be used by\n   PIM in a PIM domain to discover
    sources that are reachable via BIER.\n   Also, this document provides PFM-SD extensions
    to discover the BIER\n   ingress router closest to the source.  This can be used
    by BIER\n   overlays, such as PIM signaling over BIER, to determine which router\n
    \  to signal.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
