abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In [Awduche] the MPLS Traffic Engineering control plane was applied\nto
    the creation of light paths (optical circuits). Due to the general\nhierarchical
    capabilities of MPLS, and the flexibility of the label \nswitching paradigm the
    same techniques used to apply the MPLS control \nplane to the optical layer can
    be used to apply it to the SONET/SDH \npath layer and in fact any form of circuit
    switching. This note \ndiscusses advantages of such an approach and some of the
    issues \ninvolved in its application. \n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
