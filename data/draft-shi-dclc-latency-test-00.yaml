abstract:
- content: "<p>We test the influence of the queue length, packet size and so on to
    the forwarding latency of the typical access switch, which is meant to set off
    our efforts in studying the relationship between the queuing length and the transport
    performance of some latency- sensitive applications in a DC network.</p>"
