abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as \"service\n
    \  mapping\", to express association of overlay routes with underlay\n   routes
    using BGP.  The document describes a framework for classifying\n   underlay routes
    into transport planes, and mapping service routes to\n   specific transport plane.
    \ It specifies BGP protocol procedures that\n   enable dissimination of such service
    mapping information that may\n   span across administrative domains.  It makes
    it possible to\n   advertise multiple tunnels to the same destination.\n\n   A
    new BGP transport address family is defined for this purpose that\n   uses RFC-4364
    technology and follows RFC-8277 NLRI encoding.  This\n   new address family is
    called \"Classful Transport\".\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
