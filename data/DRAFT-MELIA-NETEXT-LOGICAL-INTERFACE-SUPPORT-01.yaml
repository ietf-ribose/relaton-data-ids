abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A Logical Interface is a software semantic internal to the host\noperating
    system.  This semantic is available in all popular\noperating systems and is used
    in various protocol implementations.\nThe Logical Interface support is desirable
    on the mobile node\noperating in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, for leveraging various\nnetwork-based
    mobility management features such as inter-technology\nhandoffs, multihoming and
    flow mobility support.  This document\nexplains the operational details of Logical
    Interface construct and\nthe specifics on how the link-layer implementations hide
    the physical\ninterfaces from the IP stack and from the network nodes.\nFurthermore,
    this document identifies the applicability of this\napproach to various link-layer
    technologies and analyses the issues\naround it when used in context with various
    mobility management\nfeatures.\n\t </p>\n      "
