abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the metrics and methodologies for measuring\n
    \  performance of SDN controllers. SDN controllers have been implemented\n   with
    many varying designs, in order to achieve their intended network\n   functionality.
    Hence, in this document the authors take the approach\n   of considering an SDN
    controller as a black box, defining the metrics\n   in a manner that is agnostic
    to protocols and network services\n   supported by controllers. The intent of
    this document is to provide a\n   standard mechanism to measure the performance
    of all controller\n   implementations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
