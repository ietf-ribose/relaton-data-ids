abstract:
- content: "<p>The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is a family of hardware and
    firmware security specifications, as well as open-source reference implementations,
    to help device makers and chip manufacturers build best-practice security into
    products. Devices that are PSA compliant are able to produce attestation tokens
    as described in this memo, which are the basis for a number of different protocols,
    including secure provisioning and network access control. This document specifies
    the PSA attestation token structure and semantics. The PSA attestation token is
    a profiled Entity Attestation Token (EAT). This specification describes what claims
    are used in an attestation token generated by PSA compliant systems, how these
    claims get serialized to the wire, and how they are cryptographically protected.</p>"
