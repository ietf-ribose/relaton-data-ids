abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When network address translation (NAT) is used in an address
    resource\n   restricted environment, or when a lot of users are located under
    a\n   NAT device, IP addresses and port resources may be eaten up, and this\n
    \  affects user experiences very negatively.  This situation can be\n   greatly
    mitigated by tweaking mapping behavior and session timer\n   handling in NAT functions.
    \ This document proposes two extensions for\n   optimizing NAT IP address and
    port resources in address resource\n   restricted environments.  One extension
    enables simultaneous use of a\n   NAT external port for different transport sessions,
    and the other\n   makes use of a TCP timestamp for TIME_WAIT assassination.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
