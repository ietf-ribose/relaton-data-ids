abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A Generic Associated Channel (G-ACH) has been defined as an extensionof
    the pseudowire Associated Channel Header (ACH) to enable therealization of a control/communication
    channel associated withMultiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths
    (LSPs),MPLS pseudowires (PWs), MPLS LSP segments, and MPLS sections betweenadjacent
    MPLS-capable devices.The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of the
    MPLSarchitecture that identifies elements of the MPLS toolkit that may becombined
    to build a carrier grade packet transport network based onMPLS packet switching
    technology.This document describes how the G-ACH may be used to provide theinfrastructure
    that forms part of the Management CommunicationNetwork (MCN) and a Signaling Communication
    Network (SCN).Collectively, the MCN and SCN may be referred to as the DataCommunication
    Network (DCN). The document explains how MCN and SCNpackets are encapsulated,
    carried on the G-ACH, and demultiplexed for</p>"
