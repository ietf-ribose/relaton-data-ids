abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
    is used\n   for recording and collecting operational and telemetry information.\n
    \  Specifically, IOAM allows telemetry data to be pushed into data\n   packets
    while they traverse the network.  This document introduces a\n   new IOAM option
    type called the Direct Export (DEX) option, which is\n   used as a trigger for
    IOAM data to be directly exported or locally\n   aggregated without being pushed
    into in-flight data packets.  The\n   exporting method and format are outside
    the scope of this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
