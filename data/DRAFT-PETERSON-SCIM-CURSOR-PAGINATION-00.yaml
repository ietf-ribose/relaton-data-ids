abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol\n
    \  supports the retrieval of core identity resources such as users and\n   groups.
    \ In order to avoid overwhelming the SCIM client or service\n   provider, SCIM
    defines index and count pagination query parameters\n   that can be used \"page
    through\" large numbers of resources.  For some\n   SCIM service providers there
    are advantages in implementing cursor-\n   based pagination as an alternative
    to index-based pagination.  This\n   document defines a simple extension to the
    SCIM protocol and core\n   schema to assure interoperability of SCIM implementations
    that need\n   to realize the advantages cursor-based pagination.\n\n\t </p>\n
