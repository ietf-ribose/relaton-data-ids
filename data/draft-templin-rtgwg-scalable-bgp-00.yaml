abstract:
- content: "<p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) has well-known limitations in terms
    of the numbers of routes that can be carried and stability of the routing system.
    This is especially true when mobile nodes frequently change their network attachment
    points, which in the past has resulted in excessive announcements and withdrawals
    of de-aggregated prefixes. This document discusses a means of accommodating scalable
    de-aggregation of IPv6 prefixes for overlay networks using BGP.</p>"
