abstract:
  content: <p>This document extends PASSporT, a token for conveying cryptographically-signed
    information about personal communications, to include rich data that can be rendered
    to users, such as a human- readable display name comparable to the "Caller ID"
    function common on the telephone network. The element defined for this purpose
    is extensible to include related information about calls that helps people decide
    whether to pick up the phone.</p>
