abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, Information-Centric networking (ICN) becomes the
    hot spot\n   to meet the new requirements accessing a large amount information\n
    \  through networks. ICN exists congestion which isn't well solved.\n   The congestion
    control protocols in IP network aren't suitable for\n   ICN transport, so we provide
    a new congestion control protocol-RRCP.\n   RRCP based on XCP and ICN transport
    characteristics raises a\n   receiver-driven, router-feedback, multi-request windows
    and timeout\n   mechanisms. RRCP shows efficient, fair and stable via simulation\n
    \  results.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
