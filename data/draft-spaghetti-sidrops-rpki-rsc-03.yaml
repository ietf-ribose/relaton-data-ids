abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) profile for
    a general purpose listing of checksums (a 'checklist'), for use with the Resource
    Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). The objective is to allow an attestation, in
    the form of a listing of one or more checksums of arbitrary digital objects (files),
    to be signed "with resources", and for validation to provide a means to confirm
    a specific Internet Resource Holder produced the signed checklist. The profile
    is intended to provide for the signing of a checksum listing with an arbitrary
    set of Internet Number Resources.</p>
