abstract:
  content: "<p>Mailbox names often represent the names of human users. Many of theseusers
    throughout the world have names that are not normally representedby the users
    with just the ASCII repertoire of characters, and wouldtherefore like to use their
    real names in their mailbox names. Thisprotocol describes how mail clients can
    be enhanced to display mailboxnames in non-ASCII characters through the use of
    a new RFC 2822 headerfield called 'Address-map'.</p>"
