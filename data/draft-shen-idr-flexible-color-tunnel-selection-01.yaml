abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses color-based tunnel selection for BGP payload
    prefixes. It defines a set of extended mapping modes, and describes how to use
    them to construct tunnel selection schemes for flexible tunnel selection. Tunnel
    selection schemes can be implemented as policies on routers performing tunnel
    selection, or signaled by next hop routers or a central controller by using the
    BGP extensions specified in this document.</p>"
