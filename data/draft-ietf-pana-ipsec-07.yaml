abstract:
- content: "<p>PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) is a
    protocol for authenticating clients to the access network using IP based protocols.
    The PANA protocol authenticates the client and also establishes a PANA security
    association between the PANA client and PANA authentication agent at the end of
    a successful authentication. This document discusses the details for establishing
    an IPsec security association using the PANA security association for enabling
    IPsec based access control.</p>"
