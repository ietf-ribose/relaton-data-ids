abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-protocol Label Switching - Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile
    of the MPLS protocol that is used in packet switched transport networks and operated
    in a similar manner to other existing transport technologies (e.g., OTN), as described
    in RFC5921. This document specifies YANG models for MPLS-TP, which have not been
    covered by existing models so far. The gap analysis with current relevant traffic-engineering
    (TE) and MPLS models is also included.</p>"
