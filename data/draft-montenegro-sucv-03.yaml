abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document addresses the identifier ownership problem. Itdoes
    so by using characteristics of Statistic Uniqueness andCryptographic Verifiability
    (SUCV) of certain entities whichthis document calls SUCV Identifiers (SUCV ID's).
    This notealso proposes using these SUCV characteristics in relatedentities called
    SUCV Addresses in order to severely limitcertain classes of denial of service
    attacks and hijackingattacks. SUCV addresses are particularly applicable to solve
    the'address ownership' problem that severely undermines confidencein mechanisms
    like Binding Updates in Mobile IP for IPv6.</p>"
