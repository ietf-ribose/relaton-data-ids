abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Flow Specification is an n-tuple consisting of several matching\n
    \  criteria that can be applied to IP traffic.  Application-aware\n   Networking
    (APN) is a framework, where APN data packets convey APN\n   attribute (incl.  APN
    ID and/or APN Parameters).  The dynamic Flow\n   Spec mechanism for APN is designed
    for the new applications of\n   traffic filtering in an APN domain as well as
    the traffic control and\n   actions on the policy enforcement points in this domain.
    \ These\n   applications require coordination among the ASes within a service\n
    \  provider.\n\n   This document specifies a new BGP Flow Spec Component Type
    in order\n   to support APN traffic filtering.  The match field is the APN ID.
    \ It\n   also specifies traffic filtering actions to enable the creation of\n
    \  the APN ID in the outer tunnel encapsulation when matched to the\n   corresponding
    Flow Spec rules.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
