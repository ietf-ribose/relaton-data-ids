abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a simple means for automated updating
    of\n   DNSSEC trust anchors.  This mechanism allows the trust anchor\n   maintainer
    to monitor the progress of the migration to the new trust\n   anchor, and so predict
    the effect before decommissioning the existing\n   trust anchor.\n\n   It is primarily
    aimed at the root DNSSEC trust anchor, but should be\n   applicable to trust anchors
    elsewhere in the DNS as well.\n\n   [ Ed note - informal summary: One of the big
    issues with rolling the\n   root key is that it is unclear who all is using RFC5011,
    who all has\n   successfully fetched and installed the new key, and, most\n   importantly,
    who all will die when the old key is revoked.  A\n   secondary problem is that
    the response sizes suddenly increase,\n   potentially blowing the MTU limit.  This
    document describes a method\n   that is basically CDS, but for the root key (or
    any other trust\n   anchor).  Unlike the CDS record though, this record lives
    at a\n   special name - by querying for this name, the recursive exposes its\n
    \  list of TAs to the auth server (signalling upstream) . This allows\n   the
    TA maintainer to predict how many, and who all will break.  It\n   also allows
    the pre-publication of a key before using it, and so\n   avoids the need to double
    response sizes...]\n\n   [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional
    background\n   information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings,\n
    \  etc.  They will be removed before publication.]\n\n   [ This document is being
    collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-trust-management.
    \ The\n   most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be\n
    \  available here.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]\n\n\t </p>\n
