abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a profile for compressing Datagram Congestion
    Control Protocol DCCP/IP using the Efficient Protocol Independent Compression
    (EPIC) [2] scheme. The RObust Header Compression [1] scheme is designed to compress
    packet headers over error prone channels. It is built around an extensible core
    framework that can be tailored to compress new protocol stacks by adding additional
    ROHC profiles. DCCP [3] is a relatively new protocol and has not yet entered the
    process of wide implementation. It is intended to provide a unified congestion
    control interface to the end user applications. It should offer the same unreliable
    transport as UDP does, and on the other hand, include mechanisms for congestion
    avoidance and control. This profile describes a new profile for ROHC which will
    allow DCCP/ IP headers to be compressed.</p>"
