abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architecture, an SDN\n
    \  controller establishes flow paths.  An SDN controller provides global\n   optimization
    of paths by controlling all managed switches.  However,\n   long flow setup time
    and failure recovery problems arise due to\n   control overhead of an SDN controller.
    \ Segment routing provides\n   source routing function by designating an explicit
    path.  SDN and\n   segment routing can be combined to provide both global optimization\n
    \  and performance enhancement.  In this document, we illustrate SDN\n   segment
    routing use cases of flow setup, failure recovery, Content\n   Distribution Network(CDN),
    and dual homing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
