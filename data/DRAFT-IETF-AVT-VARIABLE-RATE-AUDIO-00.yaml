abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo discusses the problems of audio codecs with variable
    \n   external sampling rates.  Historically, for audio codecs, the RTP \n   timestamp
    frequency was chosen to match the sampling rate of the \n   audio codec.  However,
    this choice is nowadays more difficult to \n   justify, because of the advent
    of audio codecs (and, even more \n   important, practical use cases) that support
    multiple sample rates \n   and the switch between the sample rates during the
    lifetime of an \n   RTP session.  This Internet draft addresses the problem by
    \n   suggesting that RTP Payload RFCs for such codecs to utilize a \n   single,
    high, unified RTP timestamp frequency.\n\t </p>\n      "
