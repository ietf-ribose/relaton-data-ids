abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a protocol to identify a host with a provider independent address.
    It is useful to identify a host uniquely in a multihomed environment where each
    host gets associated with more than one provider assigned addresses. By means
    of associating a host with a provider independent address, customers/customer
    networks will be able to retain their number even after changing their service
    provider(s).</p>"
