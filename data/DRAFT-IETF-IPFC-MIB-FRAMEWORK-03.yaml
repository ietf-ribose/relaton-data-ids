abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses technical issues and requirements for
    the\nmanagement information base (MIB) for Fibre Channel and storage\nnetwork
    applications.  This document is likely to be expanded to\ninclude management of
    specific Fibre Channel device types in the\nfuture. The purpose is to have an
    overall structure and view of\nFibre Channel MIBs for consistency and interoperability.
    This\ndocument does not try to cover the details of each individual MIB.\nThis
    is an initial draft document, which will evolve and expand\nover time. It is the
    intent of this document to produce a coherent\ndescription of a framework for
    various MIB development which was\nand is being considered by the working group.
    \ Selection of\nspecific approaches, making choices regarding engineering tradeoffs,\nand
    detailed protocol specification, are outside of the scope of\nthis framework document.\n\t
