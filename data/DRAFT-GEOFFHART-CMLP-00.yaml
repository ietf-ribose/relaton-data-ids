abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>CMLP is proposed as a tool System and Network Administrators can
    use to\nrapidly identify maintenance work performed on local and remote\nnetworked
    hosts including routers, switches, servers, and firewalls as\nwell as other networked
    devices.  The primary drivers for creation\nof CMLP are improving network availability
    and decreasing restoral time\nthrough rapid identifiation of change activity in
    the enterprise network\nenvironment.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
