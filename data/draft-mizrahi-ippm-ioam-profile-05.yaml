abstract:
- content: "<p>In Situ Operations, Administration and Maintenance (IOAM) is used for
    monitoring network performance and for detecting traffic bottlenecks and anomalies.
    This is achieved by incorporating IOAM data into in- flight data packets. This
    document introduces the concept of use case-driven IOAM profiles. An IOAM profile
    defines a use case or a set of use cases for IOAM, and an associated set of rules
    that restrict the scope and features of the IOAM specification, thereby limiting
    it to a subset of the full functionality. The motivation for defining profiles
    is to limit the scope of IOAM features, allowing simpler implementation, verification,
    and interoperability testing in the context of specific use cases that do not
    require the full functionality of IOAM.</p>"
