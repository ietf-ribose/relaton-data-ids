abstract:
  content: "<p>This specification defines a format of structured access tokens that
    are issued by the authorization server and received by the resource server in
    the OpenID Connect protocol. By using this format, the authorization server and
    the resource server can be easily separated and the validation of the access token
    can be performed offline.</p>"
