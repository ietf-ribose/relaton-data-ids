abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface
    (GSS-\n   API) is often mistaken for a bloated framework.  The GSS-API is\n   really
    several things: a basis for formal descriptions of application\n   authentication
    protocols (what happens when), a pattern for actual\n   programming APIs, a set
    of constraints and requirements for generic\n   security mechanisms, and concrete
    programming APIs.  Only the first\n   of these is relevant to Internet application
    protocols.\n\n   This document describes simplified and minimized profiles of
    the GSS-\n   API for two purposes: explaining its use, whether in standards\n
    \  specifications or actual applications, and specifying sub-sets of the\n   API
    for a) newcomers to the API, b) application developers that wish\n   to use it
    but not have to link the whole thing into their\n   applications.\n\n\t </p>\n
