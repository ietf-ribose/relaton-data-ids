abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a new technique\n
    \  for inter-domain federation of SIP calls.  ViPR makes use of the PSTN\n   as
    an introduction mechanism to verify the correctness of mappings\n   from phone
    numbers to domains.  The PSTN introduction mechanism can\n   also be used as a
    technique for blocking spam - a SIP caller is only\n   authorized when its calling
    domain has previously called that same\n   number over the PSTN.  This document
    describes an extension to SIP\n   which enables authorization of SIP calls based
    on a prior PSTN\n   introduction.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
