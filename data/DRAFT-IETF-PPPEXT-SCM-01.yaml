abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method
    for\n   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.\n \n
    \  This document introduces a new PPP feature called Semi Connected\n   Mode.
    When both sides of a point-to-point link agree to use Semi Con-\n   nected Mode,
    either side can transparently disconnect and re-\n   establish a circuit-switched
    connection without having to reconfigure\n   the point-to-point link each time.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
