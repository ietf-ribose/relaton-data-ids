abstract:
- content: "<p>Pervasive Monitoring (PM) attacks on the privacy of Internet users
    is of serious concern to both the user and the operator communities. RFC7258 discussed
    the critical need to protect users' privacy when developing IETF specifications
    and also recognized making networks unmanageable to mitigate PM is not an acceptable
    outcome; an appropriate balance is needed. This document discusses current security
    and network operations and management practices that may be impacted by the shift
    to increased use of encryption to help guide protocol development in support of
    manageable and secure networks.</p>"
