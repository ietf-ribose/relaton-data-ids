abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines distributed mobility anchoring in terms of the
    different configurations, operations and parameters of mobility functions to provide
    different IP mobility support for the diverse mobility needs in 5G Wireless and
    beyond. A network or network slice may be configured with distributed mobility
    anchoring functions according to the needs of mobility support. In the distributed
    mobility anchoring environment, multiple anchors are available for mid-session
    switching of an IP prefix anchor. To start a new flow or to handle a flow not
    requiring IP session continuity as a mobile node moves to a new network, the flow
    can be started or re-started using a new IP address configured from the new IP
    prefix which is anchored to the new network. For a flow requiring IP session continuity,
    the anchoring of the prior IP prefix may be moved to the new network. The mobility
    functions and their operations and parameters are general for different configurations.
    The mobility signaling may be between anchors and nodes in the network in a network-based
    mobility solution. It may also be between the anchors and the mobile node in a
    host-based solution. The mobile node may be a host, but may also be a router carrying
    a network requiring network mobility support.</p>"
