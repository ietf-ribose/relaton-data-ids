abstract:
  content: "<p>This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol(LDAP)
    to support server side current time matching.Matching of time-stamp attribute
    values against an LDAP server'scurrent time offers advantages for example in case
    third partyproducts' LDAP client configuration directives (e.g. LDAP filterstatements)
    do not offer support to dynamically rewrite/replace afilter's assertion value
    for each request. Using the matching rulesdefined in this document the client
    is able to provide a constantmatching rule assertion value to trigger the server
    side comparisonof the given/stored 'Generalized Time' syntax based attribute valueagainst
    the LDAP server's current time.Therefore this document specifies four matching
    rules and twodedicated assertion syntaxes to be used in conjuntion with the wellknown
    'Generalized Time' syntax based attribute values.</p>"
