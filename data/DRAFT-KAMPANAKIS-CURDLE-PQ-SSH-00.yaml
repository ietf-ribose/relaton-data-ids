abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines hybrid key exchange methods based on
    classical\n   ECDH key exchange and post-quantum key encapsulation schemes.  These\n
    \  methods are defined for use in the SSH Transport Layer Protocol.  It\n   also
    defines post-quantum public key authentication methods based on\n   post-quantum
    signature schemes.  These methods are defined for use in\n   the SSH Authentication
    Protocol.\n\nNote\n\n   EDNOTE: The goal of this draft is to start the standardization
    of PQ\n   algorithms in SSH early to mitigate the potential record-and-harvest\n
    \  later with a quantum computer attacks.  This draft is not expected to\n   be
    finalized before the NIST PQ Project has standardized PQ\n   algorithms.  After
    NIST has standardized then this document will\n   replace TBD1, TBD3 with the
    appropriate algorithms and parameters\n   before proceeding to ratification.\n\n
    \  EDNOTE: Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the IETF\n   WG
    Mailing List or in the GitHub repository which contains the draft:\n   https://github.com/csosto-pk/pq-ssh/issues
    .\n\n   *Change Log* [EDNOTE: Remove befor publicaton].\n\n   draft-kampanakis-curdle-pq-ssh-00\n
