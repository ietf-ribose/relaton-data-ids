abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discuss the relationships between the Internet architecture
    and the ability of people to exercise their right to freedom of assembly and association
    online. The Internet increasingly mediates our lives, our relationships and our
    ability to exercise our human rights. As a forum, it provides a global public
    space despite being built on predominantly private infrastructure. Since Internet
    protocols play a central role in the management, development and use of the Internet,
    the relation between protocols and the aforementioned rights should be analyzed
    and any adverse impacts should be mitigated.</p>"
