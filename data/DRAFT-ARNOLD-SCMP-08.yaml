abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Simple Commerce Messaging Protocol (SCMP) is a general-purpose
    \nelectronic commerce message protocol for secure, real-time \ncommunication of
    a set of data from a sending agent's application \nto a receiving agent's server.
    Additionally the response by the \nreceiving agent's server to the sending agent
    is the reply from the \nrequest represented by the set of data in the message's
    payload. The \nintent of this protocol is to define a method where trading partners
    \ncan perform on-line business requests in an environment where the sending partner
    is fully authenticated, and the message cannot be repudiated.\n\t </p>\n      "
