abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A 'fast timeout' occurs if the retransmission timer expires, and\nafterwards
    the TCP sender receives the duplicate ACK that would have\ntriggered a fast retransmit
    of the oldest outstanding segment. In\nthis case, staying in slow start is an
    unnecessarily drastic response\nto the congestion indication. Instead, we believe
    it is safe to back\nout of the slow start phase but instead go into the fast recovery\nphase.
    One benefit of this approach is that the potentially following\nduplicate ACKs
    can be exploited for advanced loss recovery\nalgorithms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
