abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The subtle way in which the IPv6 and IPv4 protocols co-exist
    in\n   typical networks, together with the lack of proper IPv6 support in\n   popular
    Virtual Private Network (VPN) products, may inadvertently\n   result in VPN traffic
    leaks.  That is, traffic meant to be\n   transferred over an encrypted and integrity
    protected VPN connection\n   may leak out of such connection and be sent in the
    clear on the local\n   network towards the final destination.  This document discusses
    some\n   scenarios in which such VPN leakages may occur as a result of\n   employing
    IPv6-unaware VPN software.  Additionally, this document\n   offers possible mitigations
    for this issue.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
