abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The ALTO working group provides guidance to P2P applications, whichhave
    to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates, thatare able to provide
    a desired resource. This guidance shall be basedon parameters that affect performance
    and efficiency of the datatransmission between the hosts, e.g., the topological
    distance. Theultimate goal is to improve performance (or Quality of Experience)
    inthe application while reducing resource consumption in the underlyingnetwork
    infrastructure.The present document addresses the case of ALTO transactionsinvolving
    a peers connected via a mobile core network. It proposesspecific scopes and use
    cases for mobile core networks and as a firststep, properties of paths and endpoints
    that allow to facilitate ALTOtransaction within such a scope.</p>"
