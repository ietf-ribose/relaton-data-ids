abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NAT444 is an IPv4 extension technology being considered by
    Service\n   Providers to continue offering IPv4 service to customers while\n   transitioning
    to IPv6.  This technology adds an extra Carrier-Grade\n   NAT (\"CGN\") in the
    Service Provider network, often resulting in two\n   NATs.  CableLabs, Time Warner
    Cable, and Rogers Communications\n   independently tested the impacts of NAT444
    on many popular Internet\n   services using a variety of test scenarios, network
    topologies, and\n   vendor equipment.  This document identifies areas where adding
    a\n   second layer of NAT disrupts the communication channel for common\n   Internet
    applications.  This document was updated to also include\n   Dual-Stack Lite impacts.\n\n\t
