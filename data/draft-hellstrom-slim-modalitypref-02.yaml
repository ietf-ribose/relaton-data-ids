abstract:
- content: "<p>When negotiating language for a real-time session, users may have very
    specific preferences for using one modality (spoken, written or signed) over other
    possible but less preferred modalities. This specification introduces indication
    of modality preference to be used in session negotiation in combination with an
    earlier speified mechanism for language preference negotiation.</p>"
