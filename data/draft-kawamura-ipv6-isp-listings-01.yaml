abstract:
  content: "<p>There are many web sites that list IPv6 enabled service providers,
    orattempt to categorize the IPv6 capability of ISPs. While theseopinions are helpful,
    there is no standard criteria used by thesites, so it is difficult to compare
    the results. This documentsurveys current listings, and proposes a set of guidelines
    that couldbe taken into consideration by theses sites, or by anyone looking toevaluate
    an ISP's IPv6 capability. This guideline can also be usedas a checklist by ISPs
    planning activation of IPv6 in their network.</p>"
