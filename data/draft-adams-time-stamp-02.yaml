abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the format of the data returned by a TimeStamp
    Authority and the protocols to be used when communicating with it.The time stamping
    service can be used as a Trusted Third Party (TTP) asone component in building
    reliable non-repudiation services (see[ISONR]). In order to reduce the amount
    of trust required of a TSA weintroduce (in Appendix C) the optional Temporal Data
    Authority (TDA)whose function is to provide further corroborating evidence of
    the timecontained in the token. We also give an example of how to place asignature
    at a particular point in time, from which the appropriatecertificate status information
    (e.g. CRLs) may be checked.</p>"
