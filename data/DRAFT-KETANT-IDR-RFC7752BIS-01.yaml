abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a number of environments, a component external to a network
    is\n   called upon to perform computations based on the network topology and\n
    \  current state of the connections within the network, including\n   Traffic
    Engineering (TE) information.  This is information typically\n   distributed by
    IGP routing protocols within the network.\n\n   This document describes a mechanism
    by which link-state and TE\n   information can be collected from networks and
    shared with external\n   components using the BGP routing protocol.  This is achieved
    using a\n   new BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) encoding\n   format.
    \ The mechanism is applicable to physical and virtual IGP\n   links.  The mechanism
    described is subject to policy control.\n\n   Applications of this technique include
    Application-Layer Traffic\n   Optimization (ALTO) servers and Path Computation
    Elements (PCEs).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
