abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a simple, incremental, network-based protocol
    to implement separation of Internet addresses into Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs)
    and Routing Locators (RLOCs). This mechanism requires no changes to host stacks
    and no major changes to existing database infrastructures. The proposed protocol
    can be implemented in a relatively small number of routers. This proposal was
    stimulated by the problem statement effort at the Amsterdam IAB Routing and Addressing
    Workshop (RAWS), which took place in October 2006.</p>"
