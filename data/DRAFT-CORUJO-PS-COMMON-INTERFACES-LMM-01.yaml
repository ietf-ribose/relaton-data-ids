abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo is a problem statement on the use of link events
    for\n   enhanced handover control in network based localized mobility\n   management.
    \ Starting from existing solutions for fast link detection\n   the document aims
    at discussing possibilities to extend with a 2.5\n   layer the interface between
    MN and AR for handover control.  The\n   document also presents a set of considerations
    and identifies\n   conditions where a layer 2.5 based interface offers significant\n
    \  advantages compared to a pure layer three solution.  The document\n   addresses
    separately scenarios for Localized Mobility Management and\n   scenarios involving
    interactions between PMIP and CMIP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
