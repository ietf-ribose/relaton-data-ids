abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There is a great deal of concern over the security of routing
    systems\nwithin the Internet, particularly in relation to the Border Gateway\nProtocol
    [BGP], which is used to provide routing information between\nautonomous systems.
    This document proposes a system where the origin\nof any advertisement within
    BGP can be verified and authenticated,\npreventing the advertisement of prefix
    blocks by unauthorized\nnetworks, and verifying that the final destination in
    the path is\nactually within the autonomous system to which the packets are being\nrouted.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
