abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes operational requirement and several \n
    \  considerations for ENUM-based softswitch, which can route a call \n   between
    2 Korean VoIP carriers during the ENUM pre-commercial trial \n   hosted by National
    Internet Development Agency of Korea(NIDA) in 2006. \n   This experience can be
    one of interim solution to maintain stability \n   of on-going commercial softswitch
    system while initial stage of ENUM \n   service that does not have sufficient
    data.\n\t </p>\n      "
