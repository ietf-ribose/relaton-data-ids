abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPFv3 [RFC5340] defines an option field for router-LSAs known as a
    R-bit. If the R-bit is clear, an OSPFv3 router can participate in OSPF topology
    distribution without acting as a forwarder to forward the transit traffic. In
    such cases, an OSPF router would only accept traffic intended for local delivery.
    This draft defines R-bit functionality for OSPFv2 defined in [RFC2328].</p>"
