abstract:
- content: "<p>This document states requirements for a standardized SIP registration
    mechanism for multiple addresses of record, the mechanism being suitable for deployment
    by SIP service providers on a large scale in support of small to medium sized
    PBXs. The requirements are for a solution that can, as a minimum, support AORs
    based on E.164 numbers. This work is being discussed on the martini@ietf.org mailing
    list.</p>"
