abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents tcpcrypt, a TCP extension for\n   cryptographically
    protecting TCP connections.  Tcpcrypt maintains the\n   confidentiality of data
    transmitted in TCP connections against a\n   passive eavesdropper.  Additionally,
    applications that perform\n   authentication can obtain end-to-end confidentiality
    and integrity\n   guarantees by tying authentication to tcpcrypt Session ID values.\n\n
    \  The extension defines a new TCP option, CRYPT, which is designed to\n   provide
    compatible interworking with TCPs that do not implement\n   tcpcrypt.  The CRYPT
    option allows hosts to negotiate the use of\n   tcpcrypt and establish shared,
    secret encryption keys.  These keys\n   are then used with an authenticated-encryption
    mode to protect both\n   the confidentiality and the integrity of transmitted
    application\n   data.  Tcpcrypt is designed to require relatively low overhead,\n
    \  particularly at servers, so as to be useful even in the case of\n   servers
    accepting many TCP connections per second.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
