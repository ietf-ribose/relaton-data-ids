abstract:
- content: "<p>We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to determine
    if an end-to-end Internet path can meet predefined transport performance targets
    by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to successive subpaths. The subpath-at-a-time
    tests are designed to accurately detect if any subpath will prevent the full end-to-end
    path from meeting the specified target performance. Each IP diagnostic test consists
    of a precomputed traffic pattern and a statistical criteria for evaluating packet
    delivery. The IP diagnostics tests are based on traffic patterns that are precomputed
    to mimic TCP or other transport protocol over a long path but are independent
    of the actual details of the subpath under test. Likewise the success criteria
    depends on the target performance and not the actual performance of the subpath.
    This makes the measurements open loop, eliminating nearly all of the difficulties
    encountered by traditional bulk transport metrics. This document does not fully
    define diagnostic tests, but provides a framework for designing suites of diagnostics
    tests that are tailored the confirming the target performance. By making the tests
    open loop, we eliminate standards congestion control equilibrium behavior, which
    otherwise causes every measured parameter to be sensitive to every component of
    the system. As an open loop test, various measurable properties become independent,
    and potentially subject to an algebra enabling several important new uses. Interim
