abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
    guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of
    candidates capable of providing a desired resource. ALTO is realized by a client-server
    protocol. This document establishes a well-known IP address for the ALTO service
    and specifies how ALTO clients embedded in the resource consumer can use it to
    access the ALTO service.</p>"
