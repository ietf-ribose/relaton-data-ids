abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the management of versioning within the NFSv4
    family of protocols. It covers the creation of minor versions, the addition of
    OPTIONAL features to existing minor versions, and the correction of flaws in features
    already published as Proposed Standards. The rules for minor versioning set out
    in this document supersede the multiple sets of minor versioning rules in RFC3530
    and RFC5661.</p>"
