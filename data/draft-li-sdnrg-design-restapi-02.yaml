abstract:
- content: "<p>As stated in ONF SDN Architecture WG Charter [Arc2013], in the SDN
    architecture, the control and data planes are decoupled, network intelligence
    and state are logically centralized, and the underlying network infrastructure
    is abstracted from the applications. As a result, network operators gain programmability,
    automation, and network control, enabling them to build highly scalable, flexible
    networks that readily adapt to changing business needs. In this architecture,
    the Northbound API provides interfaces to the external components where applicable.
    As REST architectural style has gained more popularity in implementing loosely-coupled
    systems, RESTful services are becoming the style of choice for SDN Northbound
    API and gaining increasingly importance in SDN architecture, for example, the
    Floodlight [Floodlight] has a Northbound API based on REST. However, despite the
    recent advances made on RESTful web services, there is a lack of guidelines for
    designing RESTful networking protocols and communication web services, especially
    based on the Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA) that further refines the REST
    principles. Many networking protocols that claim to be REST APIs are not hypertext
    driven as prescribed by REST. This situation can lead to REST networking APIs
    that are not as scalable, extensible, maintainable, and interoperable as promised
    by REST. This document describes the key rules and design patterns for the SDN
    Northbound API in a truly RESTful manner, based on our experiences with REST API
    designs in general and SDN Northbound API design in particular. The rules and
    the design patterns illustrate the solutions to the common API problems in REST
    API designs, using the network virtualization API of OpenStack as an example.</p>"
