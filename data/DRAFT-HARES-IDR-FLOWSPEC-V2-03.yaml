abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP flow specification version 1 (FSv1) defined in RFC 8955,
    RFC\n   8956, and RFC 9117 describes the distribution of traffic filter\n   policy
    (traffic filters and actions) distributed via BGP.  Multiple\n   applications
    have used BGP FSv1 to distribute traffic filter policy.\n   These applications
    include the following: mitigation of denial of\n   service (DoS), enabling traffic
    filtering in BGP/MPLS VPNs,\n   centralized traffic control of router firewall
    functions, and SFC\n   traffic insertion.\n\n   During the deployment of BGP FSv1
    a number of issues were detected\n   due to lack of consistent TLV encoding for
    rules for flow\n   specifications, lack of user ordering of filter rules and/or
    actions,\n   and lack of clear definition of interaction with BGP peers not\n
    \  supporting FSv1.  Version 2 of the BGP flow specification (FSv2)\n   protocol
    addresses these features.  In order to provide a clear\n   demarcation between
    FSv1 and FSv2, a different NLRI encapsulates\n   FSv2.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
