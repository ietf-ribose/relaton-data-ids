abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes an abstract application programming interface,
    API, to the transport layer that enables the selection of transport protocols
    and network paths dynamically at runtime. This API enables faster deployment of
    new protocols and protocol features without requiring changes to the applications.
    The specified API follows the Transport Services Architecture by providing asynchronous,
    atomic transmission of messages. It is intended to replace the traditional BSD
    sockets API as the common interface to the transport layer, in an environment
    where endpoints could select from multiple interfaces and potential transport
    protocols.</p>"
