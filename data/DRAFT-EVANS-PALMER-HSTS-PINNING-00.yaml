abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes an extension to the HTTP Strict Transport\n
    \  Security specification allowing web host operators to instruct UAs to\n   remember
    (\"pin\") hosts' cryptographic identities for a given period\n   of time.  During
    that time, UAs will require that the host present a\n   certificate chain including
    at least one public key whose fingerprint\n   matches one or more of the pinned
    fingerprints for that host.  By\n   effectively reducing the scope of authorities
    who can authenticate\n   the domain during the lifetime of the pin, we hope pinning
    reduces\n   the incidence of man-in-the-middle attacks due to compromised\n   Certification
    Authorities and other authentication errors and\n   attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
