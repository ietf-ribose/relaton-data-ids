abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to generate a stateless IPv6 host interface
    identifier based on host geographic location information. This method can guarantee
    the uniqueness and stability of the address generated within a certain geographical
    range. The method is similar to mechanism introduced in RFC 7217, but remains
    stable within an adjustable geographical area.</p>"
