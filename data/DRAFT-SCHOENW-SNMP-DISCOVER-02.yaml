abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The third version of the Simple Network Management Protocol
    (SNMP)\n   assumes that a manager knows the identifier of a remote SNMP protocol\n
    \  engine (the so called snmpEngineID) in order to retrieve or\n   manipulate
    objects maintained locally on the remote engine.  This\n   document introduces
    a well-known localEngineID and a discovery\n   mechanism which can be used to
    learn the engine identifier of a\n   remote SNMP protocol engine.  The proposed
    mechanism is independent\n   of the features provided by SNMP security models
    and may also be used\n   by other protocol interfaces providing access to managed
    objects.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
