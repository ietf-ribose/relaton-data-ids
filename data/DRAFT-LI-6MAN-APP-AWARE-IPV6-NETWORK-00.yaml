abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A multitude of applications are carried over the network, which
    have\n   varying needs for network bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet\n   loss,
    etc.  Some applications such as online gaming and live video\n   streaming have
    very demanding network requirements thereof require\n   special treatments in
    the network.  However, in current networks, the\n   network and applications are
    decoupled, that is, the network is not\n   aware of the applications' requirements
    in a finer granularity.\n   Therefore, it is difficult to provide truly fine-granular
    traffic\n   operations for the applications and guarantee their SLA requirements.\n\n
    \  This document proposes a new framework, named Application-aware IPv6\n   Networking,
    and also the solution to guarantee SLA for applications,\n   which makes use of
    IPv6 extensions header in order to convey the\n   application related information
    including its requirements along with\n   the packet to the network so to facilitate
    the service deployment and\n   network resources adjustment.  Then, it defines
    the application-aware\n   options which can be used in the different IPv6 extension
    headers for\n   the purpose.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
