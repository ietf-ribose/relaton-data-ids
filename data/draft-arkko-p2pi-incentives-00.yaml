abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Several papers in the May 2008 P2PI workshop have argued that thereis
    a need to build new protocol mechanisms to accommodate peer-to-peer traffic in
    networks in the most efficient way and with minimalimpact to other traffic. This
    paper presents an analysis of suchsolutions from the point of view of the incentives
    of the differentparties involved in peer-to-peer traffic. The paper concludes
    thatit is essential to understand the incentives in order to have adeployable
    solution.</p>"
