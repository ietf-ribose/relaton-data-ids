abstract:
- content: "<p>Spoken language is human nature. An IDN system that users want is always
    closely associated with linguistic issues. To represent a symbol of a script consistently,
    recognizable and easily accessible for widest acceptance around the world has
    been the wish of many Internet engineers. For sensible, thus consistent and lasting
    IDN Domain Name identifiers, these symbols have to be indexed on their phonetics,
    which is the basic element of linguistics. A joint effort from Unicode Consortium,
    Library of Congress, The International Phonetic Association and IETF IDN working
    group is necessary to codify transliteration scheme.</p>"
