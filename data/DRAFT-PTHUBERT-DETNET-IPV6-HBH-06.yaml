abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 8938, the Deterministic Networking Data Plane Framework
    relies on\n   the 6-tuple to identify an IPv6 flow.  But the full DetNet operations\n
    \  require also the capabilities to signal meta-information such as a\n   sequence
    within that flow, and to transport different types of\n   packets along the same
    path with the same treatment, e.g.,\n   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
    packets and/or multiple\n   flows with fate and resource sharing.  This document
    introduces new\n   IPv6 options that signal that path and redundancy information
    to the\n   intermediate DetNet relay and forwarding nodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
