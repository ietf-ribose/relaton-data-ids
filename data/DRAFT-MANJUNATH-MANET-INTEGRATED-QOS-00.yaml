abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Meeting the agreed service quality in a mobile ad hoc network
    \nis tough and addressed in [RFC1677]. A mechanism is provided \nin [RFC2501].
    In this draft, usage of an integrated algorithm \nis described. The fading RF
    channels introduce the harmful \nself-similarity in to the traffic. To counter
    the same, another \nself-similar controlling mechanism may be inserted for the
    better \nwireless network performance and optimal resource utilization. \n\t </p>\n
