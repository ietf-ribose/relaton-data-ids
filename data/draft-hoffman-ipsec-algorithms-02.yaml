abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The IKEv2 protocol [IKEv2] relies on security algorithms to provideprivacy
    and authentication between the initiator and responder. Thereare many such algorithms
    available, and two IKEv2 systems cannotinteroperate unless they are using the
    same algorithms. This documentspecifies an initial set of algorithms for registration
    with IANA, andspecifies which are mandatory to implement. This document also specifiesoptional
    suites of algorithms and attributes that can be used tosimplify the administration
    of IKEv2.</p>"
