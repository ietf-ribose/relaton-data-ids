abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC 1123 and RFC 1536.  This document
    strongly\n   encourages the operational practice of permitting DNS messages to
    be\n   carried over TCP on the Internet as a Best Current Practice.  Such\n   encouragement
    is aligned with the implementation requirements in RFC\n   7766.  The use of TCP
    includes both DNS over unencrypted TCP, as well\n   as over an encrypted TLS session.
    \ The document also considers the\n   consequences with this form of DNS communication
    and the potential\n   operational issues that can arise when this Best Current
    Practice is\n   not upheld.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
