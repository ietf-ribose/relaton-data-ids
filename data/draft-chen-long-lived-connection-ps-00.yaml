  content: "\t <t>This memo describes issues encountered by a long-lived TCPconnection.
    Long-lived TCP connections are served for severalapplications, which are quite
    popularly used in our daily life, suchas chat and messaging(MSN, Skype). Others
    are computer-to-computercommunications, which are also demanding at long-lived
    TCPconnection. Issues such as network resources consumption happen whenthere are
    frequent keepalive message has been transmittedperiodically. Moreover, other issues
    are occurring during long TCPconnection, such as TCP congestion, TCP connection
    recovery.Depending on raised issues, protocol optimization could be consideredto
    optimize network quality.</p>"
