abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes issues encountered by a long-lived TCP connection.
    Long-lived TCP connections are served for several applications, which are quite
    popularly used in our daily life, such as chat and messaging(MSN, Skype). Others
    are computer-to-computer communications, which are also demanding at long-lived
    TCP connection. Issues such as network resources consumption happen when there
    are frequent keepalive message has been transmitted periodically. Moreover, other
    issues are occurring during long TCP connection, such as TCP congestion, TCP connection
    recovery. Depending on raised issues, protocol optimization could be considered
    to optimize network quality.</p>"
