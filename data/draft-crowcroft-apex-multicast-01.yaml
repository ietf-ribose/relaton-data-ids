abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This is a memo that presents an approach to do application layermulticast.
    Our intention is to present a design that produces a treedistribution structure
    within the existing design structure of APEXand BEEP. It is not our intention
    to present a design that replacesmulticast at the network layer. Where the need
    exists (and inscenarios where it would seem symbiotic), we would find itconstructive
    to integrate the two technologies and perspective (i.e.,application later and
    network layer multicast).</p>"
