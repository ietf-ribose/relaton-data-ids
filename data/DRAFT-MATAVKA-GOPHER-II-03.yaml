abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Gopher protocol is over twenty years old.  Changing practices
    and\n   unofficial extensions have caused Gopher as currently used to differ,\n
    \  but remain largely compatible with, the technical specifications\n   first
    established in its first informational document, *The Internet\n   Gopher Protocol
    (a distributed document search and retrieval\n   protocol)*, known as *RFC 1436*.
    \ Therefore, this document attempts\n   to establish a contemporary specification
    of the Gopher\n   communications protocol, departing as little as possible from
    current\n   practice.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
