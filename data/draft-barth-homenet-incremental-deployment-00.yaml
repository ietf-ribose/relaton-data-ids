abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an incremental approach towards deploying HNCP
    and routing protocols in home networks. Its aim is to provide a minimal, forward-compatible
    transitional extension to HNCP to promote testing, deployment and adoption of
    homenet technology while the IGP decision and standardization process is not yet
    finalized.</p>"
