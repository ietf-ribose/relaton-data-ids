abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 1264 was written during what was effectively a completely different
    time in the life of the Internet. It prescribed rules to protect the Internet
    against new routing protocols that may have various undesirable properties. In
    today's Internet, there are so many other pressures against deploying unreasonable
    protocols that we believe that existing controls suffice, and the RFC 1264 rules
    just get in the way. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
