abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The common thinking for the last 10+ years has been to say that
    dual\nstack was the answer to IPv6 transition and that most things would be\nconverted
    to dual stack way before we ran out of IPv4.  Well, it has\nnot happened.  We
    are going to run out of IPv4 addresses soon, way\nbefore any significant IPv6
    deployment will have occured.  However,\nthe quasi totality of the Internet and
    most of the computers in the\nhome are still IPv4-only.  Several distributed NAT
    architectures,\nbased on different possible flavors of a carrier-grade NAT, are\npresented
    as solutions to maintain some form of connectivity between\nthose home environments
    and the legacy Internet.\n\t </p>\n      "
