abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Many protocols in the Internet Protocol suite use packetencapsulations.
    This runs into the danger of forming a tunnel loop.Since each tunnel entry point
    encapsulates the inner packet with atunnel packet header that contains a new hop
    count, a packet enteringa tunnel loop may be routed infinitely, consuming network
    resources.Although there exist methods to cause a packet in a tunnel loop to bediscarded
    eventually, it would be more desirable to detect thepresence of a tunnel loop
    and act accordingly. This draft exploresthe possibility for tunnel entry points
    to detect the presence of atunnel loop by using an extra identifier tagged to
    the outer packetheader.</p>"
