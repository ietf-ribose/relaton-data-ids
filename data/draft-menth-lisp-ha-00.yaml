abstract:
- content: "<p>Hybrid access (HA) allows simultaneous usage of multiple access links.
    Advantages are increased bandwidth and improved resilience. This document presents
    LISP Hybrid Access (LISP-HA), a mechanism to provide HA based on LISP technology.
    The document discusses potential changes needed to perform dynamic load-balancing
    and per packet load-balancing, which both increase the efficiency of HA. To that
    end, modified usage of some fields in the LISP header is proposed. Discussed use
    cases include the bundling of multiple access technologies for mobile devices
    and residential access routers. Additionally, we provide some considerations how
    LISP-HA can be deployed by providers.</p>"
