    TLS protected channel before invoking an operation described by the URL. This
    document defines extension to both 'HTTP' and 'HTTPS' schemes that tells the client
    to perform Simple Authentication and Security Layer [SASL] authentication according
    to SASL in HTTP 1.1 [HTTP-SASL] before invoking an operation described by the
    HTTP URL.</p>"
