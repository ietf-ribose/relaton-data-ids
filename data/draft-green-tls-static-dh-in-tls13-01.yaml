abstract:
- content: "<p>Unlike earlier versions of TLS, current drafts of TLS 1.3 have instead
    adopted ephemeral-mode Diffie-Hellman and elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman as the
    primary cryptographic key exchange mechanism used in TLS. This document describes
    an optional configuration for TLS servers that allows for the use of a static
    Diffie-Hellman private key for all TLS connections made to the server. Passive
    monitoring of TLS connections can be enabled by installing a corresponding copy
    of this key in each monitoring device.</p>"
