abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The growing SIP message size and the ensuing IP fragmentation,\n
    \  scalability and performance efficiencies gained by multiplexing SIP\n   sessions
    over fewer reliable transport connections, efficient use of\n   security certificates
    etc.  are engendering widespread use of\n   connection-oriented protocols for
    SIP transport.  A variety of SIP\n   transport related issues are currently being
    discussed in the IETF\n   including connection reuse, persistent connections,
    outbound\n   connection flows, SIP over SCTP, NAT traversal, and SIP/TCP race\n
    \  conditions.  This document attempts to unify these techniques by\n   describing
    practical guidelines for implementers and takes a broad\n   stroke at defining
    SIP Connection Management.  We hope to abstract\n   the diverse connection techniques
    into a few generic connection\n   characteristics, which then help define a few
    common connection\n   models and use cases.\n\t </p>\n      "
