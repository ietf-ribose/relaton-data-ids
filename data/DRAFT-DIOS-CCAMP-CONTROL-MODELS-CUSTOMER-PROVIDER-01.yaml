abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Different kinds of relationships can be established among\n
    \  interconnected Traffic Engineered Networks.  In particular, this\n   document
    focuses on the case where there is a client-server relation\n   between the network
    domains.  The domain interconnection is a policy\n   and administrative boundary.
    \ This informational document collects\n   current terminology and provides a
    taxonomy for the posible control\n   plane based operation models.\n\n   Each
    control model defines, on the one hand, the level of information\n   that the
    domain acting as client receives by control plane means from\n   the domain acting
    as server and, on the other hand, the control model\n   will determine what can
    be requested from the client domain to the\n   server domain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
