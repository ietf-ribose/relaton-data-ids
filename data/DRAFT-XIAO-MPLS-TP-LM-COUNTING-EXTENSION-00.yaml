abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Packet loss measurement for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)\nPseudoWires,
    Label Switched Paths, and Sections, is an important\nOperation, Administration
    and Maintenance (OAM) function of the\nMPLS-TP.  When this OAM function is performed,
    counting the\ntransmitted and received packets at both the source MEP and the
    sink\nMEP needs to be activated at first.  This document specifies OAM\npackets
    and protocol mechanism to facilitate the counting activation\nand deactivation
    at the sink MEP, and leave out the unnecessary\nmanagement configuration at the
    sink MEP when the MPLS-TP connection\nis bidirectional or there exists an out-of-band
    return path.\n\t </p>\n      "
