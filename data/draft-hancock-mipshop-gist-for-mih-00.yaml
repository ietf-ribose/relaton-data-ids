abstract:
- content: "<p>The MIPSHOP working group is working on common functionality necessary
    for the support of media independent handover (MIH) protocols, initially focussing
    on the architectures being developed with the 802.21 working group of the IEEE.
    A problem statement draft describing the context and scope of the common functionality
    is already in progress, and a second draft has been prepared that describes the
    main protocol design issues that have to be taken into consideration. Although
    the common functionality (relating to transport and security requirements) is
    mainly standard, there is still a significant element of protocol design to integrate
    them with the MIH service itself, including in particular secure peer discovery
    and capability negotiation. This draft presents a solution for the common protocol
    functionality based on the use of the General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST)
    protocol, which has been developed in the NSIS working group. GIST can already
    satisfy the bulk of the protocol requirements in its current form, and this draft
    explains how this existing GIST functionality fits into the MIH problem space.
    The main special requirements for MIH relate to signalling node discovery and
    message routing, and this draft outlines three options for supporting these requirements
    within the GIST framework</p>"
