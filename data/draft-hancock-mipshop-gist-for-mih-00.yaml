abstract:
  content: "<p>The MIPSHOP working group is working on common functionalitynecessary
    for the support of media independent handover (MIH)protocols, initially focussing
    on the architectures being developedwith the 802.21 working group of the IEEE.
    A problem statement draftdescribing the context and scope of the common functionality
    isalready in progress, and a second draft has been prepared thatdescribes the
    main protocol design issues that have to be taken intoconsideration. Although
    the common functionality (relating totransport and security requirements) is mainly
    standard, there isstill a significant element of protocol design to integrate
    them withthe MIH service itself, including in particular secure peer discoveryand
    capability negotiation. This draft presents a solution for thecommon protocol
    functionality based on the use of the GeneralInternet Signaling Transport (GIST)
    protocol, which has beendeveloped in the NSIS working group. GIST can already
    satisfy thebulk of the protocol requirements in its current form, and this draftexplains
    how this existing GIST functionality fits into the MIHproblem space. The main
    special requirements for MIH relate tosignalling node discovery and message routing,
    and this draftoutlines three options for supporting these requirements within
    theGIST framework</p>"
