abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The ITU-T has defined an architecture and requirements for operating\nan
    Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON).\n\nThe Generalized Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) protocol suite\nis designed to provide a control plane
    for a range of network\ntechnologies including optical networks such as time division\nmultiplexing
    (TDM) networks including SONET/SDH and Optical Transport\nNetworks (OTNs), and
    lambda switching optical networks.\n\nThe requirements for GMPLS routing to satisfy
    the requirements of\nASON routing, and an evaluation of existing GMPLS routing
    protocols\nare provided in other documents.  This document defines extensions
    to\nthe OSPFv2 Link State Routing Protocol to meet the requirements for\nrouting
    in an ASON.\n\nNote that this work is scoped to the requirements and evaluation\nexpressed
    in RFC 4258 and RFC 4652 and the ITU-T Recommendations\ncurrent when those documents
    were written.  Future extensions of\nrevisions of this work may be necessary if
    the ITU-T Recommendations\nare revised or if new requirements are introduced into
    a revision of\nRFC 4258.\n\t </p>\n      "
