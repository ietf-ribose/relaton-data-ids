abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols. It describes the use of information
    provided by Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) services, such
    as the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), to dynamically update
    user-to-group mappings in the View-Based Access Control Model (VACM). Comments
    are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at isms@ietf.org.</p>"
