abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP)
    \npackage containing the MoveConnection command which was originally \nproposed
    in RFC 2705 [4]. The MoveConnection command can move an \nMGCP connection from
    one endpoint in a media gateway to another \nendpoint in the same gateway. This
    can be very useful in order to \nsupport redirection of media streams across endpoints
    in a media \ngateway. \n\t </p>\n      "
