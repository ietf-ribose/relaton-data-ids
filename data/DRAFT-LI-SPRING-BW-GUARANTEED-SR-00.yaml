abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document proposes the bandwidth-guaranteed segment for
    the\n   segment routing which can be used to provide the bandwidth-guaranteed\n
    \  segment routing path to satisfy the QoS requirement of the service.\n   Accordingly
    the forwarding mechanisms and the procedures of the\n   control plane are explained
    for the bandwidth-guaranteed segment.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
