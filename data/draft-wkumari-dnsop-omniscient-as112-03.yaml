abstract:
- content: "<p>The AS112 Project loosely coordinates Domain Name System (DNS) servers
    to which DNS zones corresponding to private use addresses are delegated. Queries
    for names within those zones have no useful responses in a global context. The
    purpose of this project is to reduce the load of such junk queries on the authoritative
    name servers that would otherwise receive them, and instead direct the load to
    name servers operated within the AS112 project. Due to the loosely-coordinated
    nature of the project, adding and dropping zones from the AS112 servers is difficult.
    This document proposes a mechanism by which AS112 name servers could answer authoritatively
    for all possible zones. This eliminates the add/drop problem, changing it to a
    matter of delegation within the DNS and requiring no operational changes on the
    servers themselves. This document updates RFC 6304.</p>"
