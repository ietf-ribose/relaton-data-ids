abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently new usecases have emerged requiring higher scalability of
    delivery for interactive realtime applications and much lower latency for streaming
    applications and a combination thereof. draft-jennings- moq-quicr-arch specifies
    architectural aspects of QuicR, a media delivery protocol based on publish/subscribe
    metaphor and Relay based delivery tree, that enables a wide range of realtime
    applications with different resiliency and latency needs. This specification defines
    the protocol aspects of the QuicR architecture.</p>"
