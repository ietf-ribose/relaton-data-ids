abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RBridges provide frame forwarding service to layer2 switches
    or end\n   stations at the edge of TRILL campus.  As defined in [RFC6325], when\n
    \  there are multiple RBridges attached to the same LAN segment, only\n   one
    edge RBridge is allowed to be the frame forwarder of a specific\n   VLAN in order
    to avoid potential frame duplication and loops in the\n   TRILL campus.  However,
    in some application scenarios, for example an\n   end station is multi-homed to
    multiple RBridges needs to improve the\n   resiliency and increase the available
    network bandwidth of the\n   connection.  This means all those RBriges attached
    to the end station\n   can act as the frame forwarders of a specific VLAN.  This
    kind of\n   active-active connection violates the definition above.  Frame\n   duplication
    and forwarding loops may happen and it may cause the\n   flip-flopping of the
    egress RBridge nickname associated to the MAC\n   address of such an end station
    in remote RBridges' forwarding tables.\n   The Reverse Path Forwarding Check does
    not work as well, which has\n   been addressed in [CMT].  This document proposes
    the concept of\n   Virtual RBridge, along with the pseudo-nickname configuration
    for\n   this Virtual RBridge, to address the above problems in accompany with\n
    \  [CMT].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
