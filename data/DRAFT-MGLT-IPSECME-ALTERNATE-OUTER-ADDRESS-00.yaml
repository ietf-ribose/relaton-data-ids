abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Current IKEv2 protocol has been designed to establish VPNs
    with the\n   same outer IP addresses as those used for the IKEv2 channel.  This\n
    \  describes the alternate outer IP address extension, and IKEv2\n   extension
    that enables the VPN End User to negotiate a VPN on\n   different interfaces as
    those used for the IKEv2 channel.\n\n   Thus, this extension makes possible a
    VPN End User with multiple\n   interfaces to set an IPsec tunnel on each interface
    with a Security\n   Gateway by using a single IKEv2 channel instead of using an
    IKEv2\n   channel per interface.  Similarly, for distributed Security Gateways,\n
    \  it also makes possible to split the IKEv2 and IPsec traffic on\n   different
    interfaces.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
