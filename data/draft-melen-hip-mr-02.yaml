abstract:
- content: "<p>This drafts defines a moving network support for HIP enabled hosts.
    The protocol uses asymmetric authentication and symmetric authorization. The solution
    presented in this draft is based on delegation of signalling rights between mobile
    nodes and mobile routers that results in route optimization between end-hosts.</p>"
