abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobility solutions at the IP layer have been specified in the
    IETF\n   for IPv4 and IPv6.  These solutions include host and network based\n
    \  mobility.  All of the mobility protocols enable IP session continuity\n   by
    providing the mobile host with an IP address or prefix that\n   remains constant
    even as the host moves and attaches to different\n   access networks and points
    of attachment.  Mobile hosts are anchored\n   at a gateway via a tunnel and the
    address/prefix provided to the host\n   via the gateway remains unchanged across
    mobility events.  All IP\n   sessions initiated or terminated at a mobile host
    are anchored via\n   the gateway.  A gateway centric approach raises certain concerns
    in\n   terms of cost and efficiency.  A mobility model wherein the mobility\n
    \  functions are distributed is a way of alleviating the concerns of a\n   gateway
    centric approach.  This document considers ways to alleviate\n   anchored mobility
    issues with approaches that could be considered in\n   a deployment.\n\n\t </p>\n
