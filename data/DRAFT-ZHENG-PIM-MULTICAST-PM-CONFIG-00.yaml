abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft introduces a new type of PIM Join Attribute which
    carries \n   measurement configuration TLVs, which are used for multicast \n   performance
    monitoring. It is based on [RFC5384], and specifies \n   additional procedures
    to process the Multicast Performance \n   Monitoring Configuration (M-PMC) attribute
    to implement automatic \n   performance monitoring configuration on multicast
    forwarding tree. \n\t </p>\n      "
