abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes Hierarchical SDN (HSDN), an architectural\n
    \  solution to scale the Data Center (DC) and Data Center Interconnect\n   (DCI)
    networks to support tens of millions of physical underlay\n   endpoints, while
    efficiently handling both ECMP and any-to-any end-\n   to-end Traffic Engineered
    (TE) traffic. HSDN achieves massive scale\n   using surprisingly small forwarding
    tables in the network nodes and\n   brings key simplifications in the control
    plane as well. The HSDN\n   forwarding architecture is based on four main concepts:
    1. Dividing\n   the DC and DCI in a hierarchically-partitioned structure; 2.\n
    \  Assigning groups of Underlay Border Nodes in charge of forwarding\n   within
    each partition; 3. Constructing HSDN MPLS label stacks to\n   identify the endpoints
    according to the HSDN structure; and 4.\n   Forwarding using the HSDN MPLS labels.\n\n\t
