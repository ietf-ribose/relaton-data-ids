abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a high-level overview architecture for\n
    \  building overlay networks in NVO3.  The architecture is given at a\n   high-level,
    showing the major components of an overall system.  An\n   important goal is to
    divide the space into individual smaller\n   components that can be implemented
    independently and with clear\n   interfaces and interactions with other components.
    \ It should be\n   possible to build and implement individual components in isolation\n
    \  and have them work with other components with no changes to other\n   components.
    \ That way implementers have flexibility in implementing\n   individual components
    and can optimize and innovate within their\n   respective components without requiring
    changes to other components.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
