abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Today, with the rapid rise of home networking, there is an increasingneed
    for simplified mechanisms for IPv4 address allocation within multi-segment networks
    connected by a single router. This issue can arise, forexample, in the case of
    a home network supporting 802.11 wireless aswell as Ethernet.In multi-segment
    small networks connected by a single router, it may bedesirable to provide for
    consistent IPv4 addressing in the case wherethe small network has not been assigned
    a routable IPv4 address prefix.This draft describes how this problem may be solved
    throughimplementation of a mini-DHCP server within the router. The router mayeither
    be disconnected from the Internet, in which case the hosts on themultiple segments
    will only be able to reach other, or the router mayoffer Internet connectivity
    via Network Address Translation (NAT), oranother suitable mechanism, such as RSIP.</p>"
