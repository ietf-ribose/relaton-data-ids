abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a protocol that may be used as replacement\n
    \  for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).\n\n   The protocol allows changing
    the lower-layer address (such as IP\n   address) or even a change or the lower-layer
    protocol (e.g. from IPv4\n   to IPv6) in the middle of the connection.\n\n   Use
    cases are private peer-to-peer applications (such as computer\n   games) or mobile
    communication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
