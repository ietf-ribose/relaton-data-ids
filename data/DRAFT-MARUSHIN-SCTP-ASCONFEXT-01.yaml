abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes extensions to the Stream Control Transmission\nProtocol(SCTP)
    [RFC2960] and the \"Dynamic Address Reconfiguration\"\n[draft-ietf-tsvwg-addip-sctp].
    \ In this proposal, we propose changes\nto the way ASCONF's are handled and bundled
    to allow multiple\nASCONF's to be sent during times of disconnected connectivity.
    \ This\nthen allows a method which allows the retransmit of multiple ASCONF\nchunk
    within a single packet to better support reliable handover.\n\t </p>\n      "
