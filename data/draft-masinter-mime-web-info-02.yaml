abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes some of the ways in which parts of the MIMEsystem,
    originally designed for electronic mail, have been used inthe Web, and some of
    the ways in which those uses have resulted indifficulties. Given this background
    and justification, this documentthen goes on to outline requirements for changes
    to MIME registriesand practices for their use within W3C and IETF, in order to
    addressthose difficulties. Within IETF, it is expected that a companionBest Current
    Practice document will make specific changes to theInternet Media Types and Charset
    registries, among others.</p>"
