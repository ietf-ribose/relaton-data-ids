abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is
    to\n   bridge the gap between network and applications by provisioning\n   network
    related information in order to allow applications to make\n   network informed
    decisions.  The present draft extends the ALTO cost\n   information so as to broaden
    the decision possibilities of\n   applications to not only decide 'where' to connect
    to, but also\n   'when'.  This is useful to applications that need to schedule
    their\n   data transfers and connections and have a degree of freedom to do so.\n
    \  ALTO guidance to schedule application traffic can also efficiently\n   help
    for load balancing and resources efficiency.  Besides, the ALTO\n   Cost Calendar
    allows to schedule the ALTO requests themselves and\n   thus to save a number
    of ALTO transactions.\n\n   This draft proposes new capabilities and attributes
    on filtered cost\n   maps and endpoint costs enabling an ALTO Server to provide
    \"Cost\n   Calendars\".  These capabilities are applicable to time-sensitive ALTO\n
    \  metrics.  With ALTO Cost Calendars, an ALTO Server exposes ALTO Cost\n   Values
    in JSON arrays where each value corresponds to a given time\n   interval.  The
    time intervals as well as other Calendar attributes\n   are specified in the IRD
    and ALTO Server responses.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
