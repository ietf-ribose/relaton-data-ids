abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as \"service\n
    \  mapping\", to express association of overlay routes with underlay\n   routes
    satisfying a certain SLA, using BGP.  The document describes a\n   framework for
    classifying underlay routes into transport classes, and\n   mapping service routes
    to specific transport class.  The transport\n   class maps to a desired SLA.\n\n
    \  It specifies BGP protocol procedures that enable dissimination of\n   such
    service mapping information that may span multiple co-operating\n   administrative
    domains.  These domains may be administetered by the\n   same provider or closely
    co-ordinating provider networks.\n\n   It makes it possible to advertise multiple
    tunnels to the same\n   destination address, thus avoiding need of multiple loopbacks
    on the\n   egress node.\n\n   A new BGP transport layer address family (SAFI 76)
    is defined for\n   this purpose that uses RFC-4364 technology and follows RFC-8277
    NLRI\n   encoding.  This new address family is called \"BGP Classful\n   Transport\",
    aka BGP CT.\n\n   It carries transport prefixes across tunnel domain boundaries
    (e.g.\n   in Inter-AS Option-C networks), parallel to BGP LU (SAFI 4) . It\n   dissiminates
    \"Transport class\" information for the transport prefixes\n   across the participating
    domains, which is not possible with BGP LU.\n   This makes the end-to-end network
    a \"Transport Class\" aware tunneled\n   network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
