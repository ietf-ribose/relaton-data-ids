abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document we first identify the (neighbor-AS based)
    Group Best\n   Paths for an address prefix as the sufficient subset that can be\n
    \  advertised by a BGP route reflector or a BGP confederation ASBR to\n   eliminate
    the MED-type route oscillations in a network.  We then\n   propose a BGP extension
    to support the advertisement of the Group\n   Best Paths by a route reflector
    or a confederation ASBR.  The\n   extension also allows the advertisement of all
    the paths in a group\n   that survive the MED comparison, thus achieving the same
    routing\n   consistency as the full IBGP mesh.  The proposed mechanisms are\n
    \  designed such that the vast majority of the BGP speakers in a network\n   need
    only minor software changes in order to deploy the mechanisms.\n\t </p>\n      "
