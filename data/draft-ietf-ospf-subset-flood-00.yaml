abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a method for limiting the flooding of OSPF LSAs to
    a configurable subset of the network topology. The following OSPF properties are
    maintained: (1) routers are omitted from the routing calculation until their link-state
    databases are synchronized and (2) links must be bidirectional before they can
    be used in the calculation. Backward-compatibility with unmodified OSPF routers
    is also provided.</p>"
