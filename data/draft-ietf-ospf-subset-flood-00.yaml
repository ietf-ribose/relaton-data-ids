abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo defines a method for limiting the flooding of OSPF LSAs
    toa configurable subset of the network topology. The following OSPFproperties
    are maintained: (1) routers are omitted from the routingcalculation until their
    link-state databases are synchronized and(2) links must be bidirectional before
    they can be used in thecalculation. Backward-compatibility with unmodified OSPF
    routers isalso provided.</p>"
