abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF Meeting Network has become integral to the success
    of any\n   physical IETF meeting.  Building such a network, which provides\n   service
    to thousands of heavy users and their multitude of devices,\n   spread throughout
    the event venue, with very little time for setup\n   and testing is a challenge.
    \ This document provides a set of\n   requirements, derived from hard won experience,
    as an aid to anyone\n   involved in designing and deploying such future networks.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
