abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the usage of Router Fingerprint\n   Authentication
    (RFA) with public keys as a potential peer\n   authentication method with KARP
    pair wise and group Key Management\n   Protocols (KMPs).  The advantage of RFA
    is, it neither requires out-\n   of-band, mutually agreeable symmetric keys nor
    a full PKI based\n   system (trust anchor or CA certificates) for mutual authentication
    of\n   peers with KARP KMP deployments.  Usage of Router Fingerprints give a\n
    \  significant operational improvement from symmetric key based systems\n   and
    yet provide a secure authentication technique.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
