abstract:
- content: "<p>A generic Key Management API that can be used not only for IP Security
    [Atk95a] [Atk95b] [Atk95c] but also for other network security services is presented
    in this document. This API has been implemented by the author inside 4.4-Lite
    BSD as part of NRL's freely distributable and usable IPv6 and IPsec implementation.
    [AMPMC96] It is documented here for the benefit of others who might also adopt
    and use the API, thus providing increased portability of key management applications
    (e.g. a Photuris daemon).</p>"
