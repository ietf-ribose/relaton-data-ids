abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This note describes a new IPsec option called Encapsulating\nSecurity
    Variable Payload (ESVP) that allows a variable but\ncontiguous portion of the
    payload received from upper protocol\nlayers to be encrypted/authenticated between
    the two end-points of\na security association.  The remaining portion of the payload
    is\nleft in the clear.  The upper layer payload contains the upper\nlayer protocol
    headers and data.  The decision about which\nportions of the payload should be
    available as cleartext is taken\nonly by the end-points of the security association.
    \ By leaving a\ncertain portion of the payload as cleartext, ESVP provides the\noption
    of encrypting and decrypting an IPsec ESVP datagram at\nother protocol layers
    to allow limited and secure access to the\ncleartext data at these protocol layers.
    \ These layers could be\nterminated inside the network for providing network-based
    value\nadded services and performance optimizations.  These network-based\nvalue
    added services and performance optimizations include policy\nimplementation and
    QoS based on packet classification, TCP\nperformance enhancement in the case of
    wireless networks and\nfirewall services.\n\t </p>\n      "
