abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Existing traffic engineering related link attribute advertisements\n
    \  have been defined and are used in RSVP-TE deployments.  Since the\n   original
    RSVP-TE use case was defined, additional applications (e.g.,\n   Segment Routing
    Traffic Engineering, Loop Free Alternate) have been\n   defined which also make
    use of the link attribute advertisements.  In\n   cases where multiple applications
    wish to make use of these link\n   attributes the current advertisements do not
    support application\n   specific values for a given attribute nor do they support
    indication\n   of which applications are using the advertised value for a given\n
    \  link.  This document introduces new link attribute advertisements\n   which
    address both of these shortcomings.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
