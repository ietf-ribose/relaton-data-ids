abstract:
- content: "<p>In particular networks such as those used by financial institutions,
    network performance criteria such as latency are becoming as critical to data
    path selection. However cost is still an important consideration. This leads to
    a situation where path calculation involves multiple metrics an more complex objective
    functions. When using GMPLS control plane, the ingress node may need to request
    remote node to perform path computation or expansion. In such cases, ingress node
    needs to convey the required objective function to the remote node, to enable
    it to perform the desired path computation. Similarly, there are cases the ingress
    needs to indicate a TE metric bound for a loose segment that is expanded by a
    remote node. This document defines extensions to the RSVP-TE Protocol to allow
    an ingress node to request the required objective function for the path computation,
    as well as a metric bound to influence route computation decisions at a remote
    node(s).</p>"
