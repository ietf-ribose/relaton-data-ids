abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The high link speed (100Gb/s) in Data Centers (DC) are making
    network\n   transfers complete faster and in fewer RTTs.  The short data bursts\n
    \  requires low latency while longer data transfer require high\n   throughput.
    \ This document describes the current state of flow\n   control and congestion
    handling in the DC using RoCEv2 and suggests\n   new directions for faster congestion
    control.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
