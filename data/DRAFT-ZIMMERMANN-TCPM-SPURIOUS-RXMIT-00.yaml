abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Spurious Retransmission Detection (SRD) algorithm allows
    a TCP\n   sender to always detect if it has entered loss recovery\n   unnecessarily.
    \ It requires that both the TCP Echo option defined in\n   [I-D.zimmermann-tcpm-echo-option],
    and the SACK option [RFC2018] be\n   enabled for a connection.  The SRD algorithm
    makes use of the fact\n   that the TCP Echo option, used in conjunction with the
    SACK feedback,\n   can be used to completely eliminate the retransmission ambiguity
    in\n   TCP.  Based on the reflected data contained in the first acceptable\n   ACK
    that arrives during loss recovery, it decides whether loss\n   recovery was entered
    unnecessarily.  The SRD mechanism further\n   enables improvements in loss recovery.
    \ This includes a TCP\n   enhancement to detect and quickly resend lost retransmissions.\n\n\t
