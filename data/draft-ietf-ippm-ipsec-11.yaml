abstract:
- content: "<p>The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and Two-Way Active
    Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) security mechanisms require that both the client
    and server endpoints possess a shared secret. This document describes the use
    of keys derived from an IKEv2 security association (SA) as the shared key in OWAMP
    or TWAMP. If the shared key can be derived from the IKEv2 SA, OWAMP or TWAMP can
    support certificate-based key exchange; this would allow for more operational
    flexibility and efficiency. The key derivation presented in this document can
    also facilitate automatic key management.</p>"
