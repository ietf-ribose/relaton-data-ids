abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Shim6 protocol provides for locator agility while satisfying
    the\n'first, do no harm' security requirements.  This document outlines\nthree
    rather orthogonal sets of extensions to Shim6.  The first one\nis how to procide
    complete separation between identifiers and\nlocators.  The second one is how
    to allow routers to rewrite the\nlocators in the shim6 packets as a way to provide
    traffic engineering\ninformation to the hosts.  The third one is the outline of
    a simple\nextension to allow shim6, with a CGA upper-layer ID, to operate using\nIPv4
    addresses as locators.\n\nThe purpose of this outline is to stimulate discussions.\n\t
