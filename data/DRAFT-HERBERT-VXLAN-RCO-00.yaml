abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification describes remote checksum offload for VXLAN.\n
    \  Remote checksum offload is a mechanism that provides checksum offload\n   of
    transport checksums in encapsulated packets using rudimentary\n   offload capabilities
    found in most Network Interface Card (NIC)\n   devices. The outer UDP checksum
    is enabled on transmit and, with some\n   additional meta data, a receiver is
    able to deduce the checksum to be\n   set in an encapsulated packet. Effectively
    this offloads the\n   computation of the inner checksum which can be a significant\n
    \  performance optimization. Enabling the UDP checksum has the\n   additional
    advantage that it covers more of the packet including the\n   IP pseudo header
    and virtual network identifier.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
