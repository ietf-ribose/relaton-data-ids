abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In Internet telephony, end systems can take a large role in providingservices,
    especially in networks without pre-configuredinfra-structure, such as peer-to-peer
    networks. Since we believethat end system services differ in their requirements
    from networkservices, we define a new service creation scripting language calledthe
    Language for End System Services (LESS). LESS inherits mancharacteristics from
    the Call Processing Language (CPL). It containscommands and events for direct
    user interaction and the control ofmedia applications. This document defines the
    basic elements of LESSand several commonly used LESS extensions.</p>"
