abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Network security incidents such as Denial of Service (DoS), system\n
    \   compromises, worms, and viruses typically result in the loss of\n    service,
    data, and resources both human and system.  Security\n    incidents can be detrimental
    to the health of the network as a\n    whole.  Network Providers (NP) need to
    be equipped and ready to\n    assist in tracing security incidents with tools
    and procedures in\n    place before the occurrence of an attack.  This paper proposes
    a\n    proactive inter-network communication method to integrate existing\n\n
    \   tracing mechanisms across NP boundaries to identify the source(s)\n    of
    an attack. The various methods implemented to detect and trace\n    attacks must
    be coordinated on the NPs network as well as provide a\n    communication mechanism
    across network borders.  It is imperative\n    that NPs have quick communication
    methods defined to enable\n    neighboring NPs to assist in tracking a security
    incident across\n    the Internet.  This proposal integrates current incident
    detection\n    and tracing practices for network traffic, which could be extended\n
    \   for security incident handling.  Policy guidelines for handling\n    incidents
    are recommended and can be agreed upon by a consortium\n    using the defined
    protocol and extended to each NP's clients.\n\t </p>\n      "
