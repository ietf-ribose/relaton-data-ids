abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a process experiment under RFC 3933 that temporarily
    updates the criteria for qualifying volunteers to participate in the IETF Nominating
    Committee. It therefore also updates the criteria for qualifying signatories to
    a community recall petition. The purpose is to make the criteria more flexible
    in view of increasing remote participation in the IETF and a reduction in face-to-face
    meetings. The experiment is of fixed duration and will apply to one, or at most
    two, consecutive Nominating Committee cycles, starting in 2021. This document
    temporarily varies the rules in RFC 8713.</p>"
