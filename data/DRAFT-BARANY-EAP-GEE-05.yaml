abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a general\n
    \  authentication protocol that supports multiple authentication methods\n   and
    typically runs directly over data link layers without requiring\n\n   IP.  EAP
    can be used for different types of authentication, where\n   multiple providers
    provide different services.  However, EAP itself\n   does not have the ability
    to differentiate between multiple EAP\n   conversations between a peer and an
    authenticator.  This document\n   specifies the 3GPP2 Generic EAP Encapsulation
    (GEE) protocol for\n   differentiating between multiple EAP conversations between
    a peer and\n   an authenticator.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
