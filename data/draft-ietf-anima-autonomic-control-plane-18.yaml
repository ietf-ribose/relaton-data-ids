abstract:
- content: <p>Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which depends
    on some addressing and routing. This Autonomic Management and Control Plane should
    ideally be self-managing, and as independent as possible of configuration. This
    document defines such a plane and calls it the "Autonomic Control Plane", with
    the primary use as a control plane for autonomic functions. It also serves as
    a "virtual out-of-band channel" for Operations Administration and Management (OAM)
    communications over a network that is secure and reliable even when the network
    is not configured, or misconfigured.</p>
