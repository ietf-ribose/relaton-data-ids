abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the usage of Router Fingerprint\n   Authentication
    (RFA) with public keys.  This can be used as a peer\n   authentication method
    with KARP Key Management Protocol (KMP).  KARP\n   KMP automates key negotiation
    for securing TCP-based pairwise Routing\n   Protocols (RPs) like BGP, LDP.  The
    advantage of RFA is, neither it\n   requires out-of-band, mutually agreeable symmetric
    keys nor a full\n   PKI based system (trust anchor or CA certificates) for mutual\n
    \  authentication of the peers with KARP KMP deployments.  Usage of\n   Router
    Fingerprints give a significant operational improvement from\n   symmetric key
    based systems and yet provide a secure authentication\n   technique.\n\n\t </p>\n
