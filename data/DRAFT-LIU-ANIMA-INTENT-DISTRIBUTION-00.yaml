abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the requirements of distributing intent\n
    \  information in an autonomic network.  Ideally, the intent may be\n   generated/injected
    at an arbitrary autonomic node and be distributed\n   among the whole autonomic
    domain.  Then this document resolves the\n   distribution requirements into protocol
    design requirements.\n   Specifically, this document introduces a solution which
    is some\n   extension based on the Anima signalling protocol (GDNP, Generic\n
    \  Discovery and Negotiation Protocol).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
