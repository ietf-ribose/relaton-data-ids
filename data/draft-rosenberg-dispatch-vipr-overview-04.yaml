abstract:
  content: <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has seen widespread deploymentwithin
    individual domains, typically supporting voice and videocommunications. Though
    it was designed from the outset to supportinter-domain federation over the public
    Internet, such federation hasnot materialized. The primary reasons for this are
    the complexitiesof inter-domain phone number routing and concerns over security.This
    document reviews this problem space, outlines requirements, andthen describes
    a new model and technique for inter-domain federationwith SIP, called Verification
    Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR).ViPR addresses the problems that have prevented
    inter-domainfederation over the Internet. It provides fully distributed inter-domain
    routing for phone numbers, authorized mappings from phonenumbers to domains, a
    new technique for automated VoIP anti-spam, andprivacy of number ownership, all
    while preserving the trapezoidalmodel of SIP.LegalThis documents and the information
