abstract:
- content: "<p>Softwire working group is currently discussing both encapsulation and
    translation based stateless IPv4/IPv6 solutions in order to be able to provide
    IPv4 connectivity to customers in an IPv6 only environment. The purpose of this
    document is to describe some use cases that would take advantage of a translation
    based solution, by highlighting the operational benefits that a translation based
    approach would allow.</p>"
