abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent explosive growth of content delivery/distribution networks (CDNs)
    and their interconnection are causing unintended repetition of content storage
    in the same dCDN. This can be avoided by using a suitable de-duplication mechanism.
    This document explores the scenarios which create the problem, and then discusses
    the approaches to eliminate the duplicated transmission of the same content from
    uCDN(s) to dCDN in CDNi networks. To implement the optimization, some enhancement
    to the CDNi metadata model and interface is required. We realize that for business-specific
    purposes the same content may be encrypted/packaged with different keys for different
    providers. The impact of DRM (Digital Rights Management) technology on de- duplication
    will be discussed in a future version of this draft.</p>"
