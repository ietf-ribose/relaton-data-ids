abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes several Network Address Translator
    (NAT)\n   traversal techniques that was considered to be used by Real-time\n   Streaming
    Protocol (RTSP).  Each technique includes a description on\n   how it would be
    used, the security implications of using it and any\n   other deployment considerations
    it has.  There are also disussions on\n   how NAT traversal techniques relates
    to firewalls and how each\n   technique can be applied in different use cases.
    \ These findings\n   where used when selecting the NAT traversal for RTSP 2.0
    standardized\n   in the MMUSIC WG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
