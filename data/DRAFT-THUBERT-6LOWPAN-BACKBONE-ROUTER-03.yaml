abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some LLN subnets are expected to scale up to the thousands
    of nodes\n   and hundreds of routers.  This paper proposes an IPv6 version of
    the\n   Backbone Router concept that enables such a degree of scalability\n   using
    a high speed network as a backbone to the subnet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
