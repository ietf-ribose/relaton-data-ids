abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a new TCP loss detection algorithm called
    RACK\n   (\"Recent ACKnowledgment\").  RACK uses the notion of time, instead of\n
    \  packet or sequence counts, to detect losses, for modern TCP\n   implementations
    that can support per-packet timestamps and the\n   selective acknowledgment (SACK)
    option.  It is intended to replace\n   the conventional DUPACK threshold approach
    and its variants, as well\n   as other nonstandard approaches.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
