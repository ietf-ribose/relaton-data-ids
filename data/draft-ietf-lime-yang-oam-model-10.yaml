abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a base YANG Data model for connection oriented
    OAM protocols. It provides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs
    for such protocols. The model presented here can be extended to include technology
    specific details. This guarantees uniformity in the management of OAM protocols
    and provides support for nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions
    at different levels through a unified interface)</p>"
