abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The maxage-vary-cookie HTTP response Cache-Control extension allowsan
    origin server to instruct caches to serve a stale response if theDate header field-value
    received with the response is greater than aspecified date-valued request cookie.
    It can be used to implement asimple view consistency mechanism for read/write
    applications whileextending freshness lifetimes, reducing latency, bandwidth usage,
    andorigin server load in some situations.</p>"
