abstract:
- content: "<p>The maxage-vary-cookie HTTP response Cache-Control extension allows
    an origin server to instruct caches to serve a stale response if the Date header
    field-value received with the response is greater than a specified date-valued
    request cookie. It can be used to implement a simple view consistency mechanism
    for read/write applications while extending freshness lifetimes, reducing latency,
    bandwidth usage, and origin server load in some situations.</p>"
