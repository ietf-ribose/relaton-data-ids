abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document recommends improved DNS [RFC1034] [RFC1035] resolver\n
    \  behavior with respect to the processing of Name Server (NS) resource\n   record
    sets (RRset) during iterative resolution.  When following a\n   referral response
    from an authoritative server to a child zone, DNS\n   resolvers should explicitly
    query the authoritative NS RRset at the\n   apex of the child zone and cache this
    in preference to the NS RRset\n   on the parent side of the zone cut.  Resolvers
    should also\n   periodically revalidate the child delegation by re-quering the
    parent\n   zone at the expiration of the TTL of the parent side NS RRset.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
