abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a specialized, dynamic routing protocol
    for\n   Clos and fat-tree network topologies optimized towards minimization\n
    \  of configuration and operational complexity.  The protocol\n\n      deals with
    no configuration, fully automated construction of fat-\n      tree topologies
    based on detection of links,\n\n      minimizes the amount of routing state held
    at each level,\n\n      automatically prunes and load balances topology flooding
    exchanges\n      over a sufficient subset of links,\n\n      supports automatic
    disaggregation of prefixes on link and node\n      failures to prevent black-holing
    and suboptimal routing,\n\n      allows traffic steering and re-routing policies,\n\n
    \     allows loop-free non-ECMP forwarding,\n\n      automatically re-balances
    traffic towards the spines based on\n      bandwidth available and finally\n\n
    \     provides mechanisms to synchronize a limited key-value data-store\n      that
    can be used after protocol convergence to e.g.  bootstrap\n      higher levels
    of functionality on nodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
