abstract:
- content: "<p>The selection of a downstream CDN by an upstream CDN is based on multi-dimensional
    criteria such as the number of hops, the performance of the connections between
    the user-agent and downstream CDNs, the availability of downstream CDNs resources
    and business policies. Various protocols, such as BGP or ALTO, may be used by
    a downstream CDN to expose content routing information and interconnection preferences
    to an upstream CDN. This draft specifies the parameters of an ALTO session between
    two interconnected CDNs.</p>"
