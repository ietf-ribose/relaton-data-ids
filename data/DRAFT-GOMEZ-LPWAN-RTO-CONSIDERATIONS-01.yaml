abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies are characterized
    by\n   very low physical layer bit and message transmission rates.\n   Moreover,
    a response to a message sent by an LPWAN device may often\n   only be received
    after a significant delay.  As a result, Round-Trip\n   Time (RTT) values in LPWAN
    are often (sometimes, significantly)\n   greater than typical default values of
    Retransmission TimeOut (RTO)\n   algorithms.  Furthermore, buffering at network
    elements such as radio\n   gateways may interact negatively with LPWAN technology
    transmission\n   mechanisms, potentially exacerbating RTTs by up to several orders
    of\n   magnitude.  This document provides guidance for RTO settings in\n   LPWAN,
    and describes an experimental dual RTO algorithm for LPWAN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
