abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages source routing. A node steers a packet
    through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by prepending the packet
    with an SR header. A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service-based.
    SR allows to enforce a flow through any topological path and service chain while
    maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node of the SR domain. The Segment
    Routing architecture can be directly applied to the MPLS dataplane with no change
    on the forwarding plane. It requires minor extension to the existing link-state
    routing protocols. This document outline a BGP-LS extension for exporting BGP
    egress point topology information (including its peers, interfaces and peering
    ASs) in a way that is exploitable in order to compute efficient Egress Point Engineering
    policies and strategies.</p>"
