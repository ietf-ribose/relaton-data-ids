abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of competing methods for integrating legacy remote access
    user authentication into IPsec have been proposed, resulting in confusion as to
    which method(s) might be best for solving the problems at hand. This document
    briefly compares these proposals in an effort to clarify the relative standing
    of each with respect to the problem space and requirements.</p>"
