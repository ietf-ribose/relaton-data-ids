abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An increasing number of hosts access the Internet via multiple\n
    \  interfaces or, in IPv6 multi-homed networks, via multiple IPv6 prefix\n   configurations.\n\n
    \  This document describes a way for hosts to identify such means,\n   called
    Provisioning Domains (PvDs), with Fully Qualified Domain Names\n   (FQDN).  Those
    identifiers are advertised in a new Router\n   Advertisement (RA) option and,
    when present, are associated with the\n   set of information included within the
    RA.\n\n   Based on this FQDN, hosts can retrieve additional information about\n
    \  their network access characteristics via an HTTP over TLS query.\n   This allows
    applications to select which Provisioning Domains to use\n   as well as to provide
    configuration parameters to the transport layer\n   and above.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
