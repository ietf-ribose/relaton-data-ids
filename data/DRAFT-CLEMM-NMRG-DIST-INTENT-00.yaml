abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents existing definitions of the Intent,
    Policy,\n   and Service Models concepts, analyses their differences and\n   commonalities,
    and how the concepts relate to one another.  The\n   document is intended to clarify
    the different concepts and converge\n   towards a common and shared understanding,
    and then use this\n   foundation to guide further definition of valid research
    and\n   engineering problems and their solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
