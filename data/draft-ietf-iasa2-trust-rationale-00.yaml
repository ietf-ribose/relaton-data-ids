abstract:
- content: "<p>The IASA 2.0 changes will have an impact on the IETF Trust because
    members of the IET Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) IAOC, which is being
    phased out, have served as Trustees of the IETF Trust. This discussion document
    provides background on the current IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect
    of the rules in the founding documents during a transition to a new arrangement,
    and provides a rationale for the update.</p>"
