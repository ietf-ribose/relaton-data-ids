abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Recent years have seen electronic mail becomes the first mode
    of \ncommunication. Electronic mail allows users to exchange information \nusing
    different formats such as files, pictures, videos and text \nmessages. Electronic
    mail is quicker and faster than other modes of \ncommunication but it generates
    more problems, such as email bombing, \nemail virus, email spoofing, anonymous
    email, relaying email and in \nparticular spam email. \nThis Internet Draft aims
    at solving or reducing the above problems \nby proposing a new transfer protocol,
    Authenticated Mail Transfer \nProtocol. Authenticated Mail Transfer Protocol is
    a second modified \nversion of the current transfer protocol, Simple Mail Transfer
    \nProtocol. It identifies a sender, differentiates a server from a \nuser, changes
    the electronic mail structure and improves the \nelectronic mail transaction.
