abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanismsare\n
    \  critical building blocks in network operations that are used for\n   service
    assurance, fulfillment, or service diagnosis,\n   troubleshooting, and repair.
    \ The current practice is that many\n   technologies rely on their own OAM protocols
    that are exclusive to a\n   given layer.  There is little consolidation of OAM
    in either data\n   plane or management plane nor well-documented inter-layer OAM\n
    \  operations.  Vendors and Operators dedicate significant resources and\n   effort
    through the whole OAM life-cycle each time when a new\n   technology is (to be)
    introduced.  This is even exacerbated when\n   dealing with integration of OAM
    across multiple technologies.\n\n   This document describes the problem space
    and defines an architecture\n   for the generic and integrated OAM with a focus
    of multi-layer and\n   cross-layer considerations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
