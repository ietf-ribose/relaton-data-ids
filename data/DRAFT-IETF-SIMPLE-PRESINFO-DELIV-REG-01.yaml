abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A Presence service implemented using SIMPLE has some constraints
    for\ndelivering presence information to devices with low data processing\ncapabilities,
    small display, and limited battery power. Other\nlimitations can be caused by
    the interface between the terminal and\nthe network, i.e. if presence information
    is delivered over radio\nlinks with high latency and low bandwidth. This memo
    presents\nrequirements for a solution that can aid to reduce the impacts of\nthese
    constrains and helps to increase efficiency.\n\t </p>\n      "
