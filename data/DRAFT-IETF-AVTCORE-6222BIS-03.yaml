abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Name (CNAME) is a\n
    \  persistent transport-level identifier for an RTP endpoint.  While the\n   Synchronization
    Source (SSRC) identifier of an RTP endpoint may\n   change if a collision is detected
    or when the RTP application is\n   restarted, its RTCP CNAME is meant to stay
    unchanged, so that RTP\n   endpoints can be uniquely identified and associated
    with their RTP\n   media streams.\n\n   For proper functionality, RTCP CNAMEs
    should be unique within the\n   participants of an RTP session.  However, the
    existing guidelines for\n   choosing the RTCP CNAME provided in the RTP standard
    are insufficient\n   to achieve this uniqueness.  RFC 6222 was published to update
    those\n   guidelines to allow endpoints to choose unique RTCP CNAMEs.\n   Unfortunately,
    later investigations showed that some parts of the new\n   algorithms were unnecessarily
    complicated and/or ineffective.  This\n   document addresses these concerns and
    replaces RFC 6222.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
