abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to include trust into the ASTM
    Remote ID\n   specification defined in ASTM F3411-19 under a Broadcast Remote
    ID\n   (RID) scenario.  It defines a few different message schemes (based on\n
    \  the Authentication Message) that can be used to assure past messages\n   sent
    by a UA and also act as an assurance for UA trustworthiness in\n   the absence
    of Internet connectivity at the receiving node.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
