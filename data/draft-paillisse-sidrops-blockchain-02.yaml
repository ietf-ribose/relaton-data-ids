abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes how blockchain technology can be used to secure
    the allocation, delegation and binding to topological information of the IP address
    space. The main outcomes of the analysis are that blockchain is suitable in environments
    with multiple distrusting parties and that Proof of Stake is a potential candidate
    for a consensus algorithm.</p>"
