abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines extensions to One-way Active Measurement\n
    \  Protocol (OWAMP), Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP), and\n   Simple
    Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) to implement\n   performance measurement
    on every member link of a Link Aggregation\n   Group (LAG).  With the measured
    metrics of each member links of a\n   LAG, it enables operators to enforce performance
    metric based traffic\n   steering policy among the member links.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
