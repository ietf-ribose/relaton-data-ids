abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Intent and Intent-Based Networking (IBN) are taking the industry
    by\n   storm.  At the same time, IBN-related terms are often used loosely\n   and
    inconsistently, in many cases overlapping and confused with other\n   concepts
    such as \"Policy.\"  This document clarifies the concept of\n   \"Intent\" and
    provides an overview of the functionality that is\n   associated with it.  The
    goal is to contribute towards a common and\n   shared understanding of terms,
    concepts, and functionality that can\n   be used as the foundation to guide further
    definition of associated\n   research and engineering problems and their solutions.\n\n
    \  This document is a product of the IRTF Network Management Research\n   Group
    (NMRG).  It reflects the consensus of the RG, receiving reviews\n   and explicit
    support from many members.  It is published for\n   informational purposes.\n\n\t
