abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes the use of IPSec [KeAt98a-c] for secure access
    to\nprotected networks by authorized users connected to the Internet.  An\nexample
    target scenario is a corporate employee on the road accessing\nresources on his
    company's Intranet. It addresses firewall traversal,\nuser authentication, data
    confidentiality and the use of private\naddress spaces (the latter impacts routing
    and name lookups).  A\ncomparison to other mechanisms such as those based on Layer-2\ntunneling
    or session layer security, is also included.\n \n   This memo draws upon several
    ideas from [Dora97,Mosk98] and would not\n   have been possible without the contributions
    of the IETF working\n   groups on IP Security (IPSec) and Network Address Translation
    (NAT).\n\t </p>\n      "
