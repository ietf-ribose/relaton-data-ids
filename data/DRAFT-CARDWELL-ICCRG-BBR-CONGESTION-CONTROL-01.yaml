abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the BBR congestion control algorithm.
    \ BBR\n   (\"Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time\") uses recent\n
    \  measurements of a transport connection's delivery rate, round-trip\n   time,
    and packet loss rate to build an explicit model of the network\n   path.  BBR
    then uses this model to control both how fast it sends\n   data and the maximum
    volume of data it allows in flight in the\n   network at any time.  Relative to
    loss-based congestion control\n   algorithms such as Reno [RFC5681] or CUBIC [RFC8312],
    BBR offers\n   substantially higher throughput for bottlenecks with shallow buffers\n
    \  or random losses, and substantially lower queueing delays for\n   bottlenecks
    with deep buffers (avoiding \"bufferbloat\").  BBR can be\n   implemented in any
    transport protocol that supports packet-delivery\n   acknowledgment.  Thus far,
    open source implementations are available\n   for TCP [RFC793] and QUIC [RFC9000].
    \ This document specifies version\n   2 of the BBR algorithm, also sometimes referred
    to as BBRv2 or bbr2.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
