abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The GRE specification contains a Key field, which MAY contain a
    valuethat is used to identify a particular GRE data stream. Thisspecification
    defines a new Mobile IP extension that is used toexchange the value to be used
    in the GRE Key field. This extensionfurther allows the Mobility Agents to setup
    the necessary protocolinterfaces prior to receiving the mobile's traffic. The
    newextension option allows a foreign agent to request GRE tunnelingwithout disturbing
    the Home Agent behavior specified for Mobile Ipv4.GRE tunneling provides an advantage
    that allows operator's privatehome networks to be overlaid and allows the HA to
    provide overlappinghome addresses to different subscribers. When the tuple &lt;
    Care ofAddress, Home Address and Home Agent Address &gt; is the same acrossmultiple
    subscriber sessions, GRE tunneling will provide a means forthe FA and HA to identify
    data streams for the individual sessionsbased on the GRE key. In the absence of
    this key identifier, thedata streams cannot be distinguished from each other,
    a significantdrawback when using IP-in-IP tunneling.</p>"
