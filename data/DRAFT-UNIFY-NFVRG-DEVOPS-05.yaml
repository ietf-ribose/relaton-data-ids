abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Carrier-grade network management was optimized for environments
    built\n   with monolithic physical nodes and involves significant deployment,\n
    \  integration and maintenance efforts from network service providers.\n   The
    introduction of virtualization technologies, from the physical\n   layer all the
    way up to the application layer, however, invalidates\n   several well-established
    assumptions in this domain. This draft opens\n   the discussion in NFVRG about
    challenges related to transforming the\n   telecom network infrastructure into
    an agile, model-driven\n   environment for communication services. We take inspiration
    from data\n   center DevOps on the simplification and automation of management\n
    \  processes for a telecom service provider software-defined\n   infrastructure
    (SDI). A number of challenges associated with\n   operationalizing DevOps principles
    at scale in software-defined\n   telecom networks are identified in relation to
    three areas related to\n   key programmable management processes.\n\n\t </p>\n
