abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to provision an optical connection through optical
    networks,\n   a combination of path continuity, resource availability, and\n   impairment
    constraints must be met to determine viable and optimal\n   paths through the
    network.  The determination of appropriate paths is\n   known as Impairment-Aware
    Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA)\n   for WSON, while it is known as
    Impairment-Aware Routing and Spectrum\n   Assigment (IA-RSA) for SSON.\n\n   This
    document provides a YANG data model for the impairment-aware TE\n   topology in
    optical networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
