abstract:
- content: "<p>When running routing protocols such as BGP or RSVP-TE, two routers
    need to exchange routing messages in a unicast (one-to-one) fashion. In order
    to authenticate these messages using symmetric cryptography, a secret key needs
    to be established. This document defines a Router Key Management Protocol (RKMP)
    for establishing and managing such keys for routing protocols.</p>"
