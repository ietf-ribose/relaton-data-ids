abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document has been written to capture the design rationale
    for\n   the draft-00 version of BGPSEC protocol specification (I-D.ietf-sidr-\n
    \  bgpsec-protocol-00).  It lists the decisions that have been made in\n   favor
    of or against each design choice, and presents brief summaries\n   of the arguments
    that aided the decision process.  A similar document\n   can be published in the
    future as the BGPSEC design discussions make\n   further progress and additional
    design considerations are discussed\n   and finalized.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
