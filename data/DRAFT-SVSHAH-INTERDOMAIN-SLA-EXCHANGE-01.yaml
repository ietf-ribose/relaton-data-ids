abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network administrators typically provision QoS policies for
    their\n   application traffic (such as voice, video etc) based on SLAs with\n
    \  their providers and translating those SLAs to vendor specific\n   provisioning
    language.  Both learning of SLA, either thru SLA\n   documents or via some other
    out of band method, and translating them\n   to vendor specific provisioning language
    is a complex, many times\n   manual, process and prone to errors.  This draft
    proposes an in-band\n   method of SLA signaling which can help to simplify some
    of the\n   complexities.  An optional transitive BGP attribute proposed in this\n
    \  document intends to signal SLA details in-band, across administrative\n   boundaries
    (considered as Autonomous Systems (AS)), and thus\n   simplify/speed-up some of
    the complex tasks.\n\n   Though the use-case with the proposed attribute is explicitly
    defined\n   in this document, purpose of this attribute is not limited to this\n
    \  use-case only.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
