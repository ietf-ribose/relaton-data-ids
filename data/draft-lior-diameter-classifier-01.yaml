abstract:
  content: "<p>Many Diameter applications require to classify packets. Diameterbase
    protocols provides an IP Filter Rule type and a QoS Filter Ruletype that is being
    used to classify packets. However, because thesetypes were defined for specific
    uses and defined in ways that arehard to extend and therefore are not generally
    applicable for thoseapplications that require packet classifiers.This document
    describes a set of Diameter types that are useful tocreate packet classifiers.
    The packet classier type can be used byvarious applications to express packet
    classifiers that best matchthe application's specific needs.</p>"
