abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Diameter applications require to classify packets. Diameter base
    protocols provides an IP Filter Rule type and a QoS Filter Rule type that is being
    used to classify packets. However, because these types were defined for specific
    uses and defined in ways that are hard to extend and therefore are not generally
    applicable for those applications that require packet classifiers. This document
    describes a set of Diameter types that are useful to create packet classifiers.
    The packet classier type can be used by various applications to express packet
    classifiers that best match the application's specific needs.</p>"
