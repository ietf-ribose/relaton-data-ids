abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a syntax for encoding DNS Resource Records
    in\n   XML, and a schema to define that syntax written in XML Schema.  It\n   can
    be used to represent all DNS RDATA.  This can be used by diverse\n   applications
    as a common format.\n\n   DNS Resource Records are represented as XML elements
    with the name of\n   the element taken from the mnemonic used to represent the
    DNS\n   Resource Record in presentation format.  The RDATA is represented as\n
    \  XML attributes or content of the element.  The attribute names are\n   taken
    from the RDATA field names specified in the normative RFC.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
