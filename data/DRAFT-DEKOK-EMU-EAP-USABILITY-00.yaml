abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines methods which enable simpler deployment
    of TLS-\n   based EAP methods.  It defines new certificate fields, and uses\n
    \  existing certificate fields in order describe new methods for\n   bootstrapping
    security.  The methods defined here change TLS-based\n   EAP supplicant configuration
    from a complex and insecure process to\n   one that is automated, and is essentially
    trivial.  These methods are\n   still, however, compatible with existing standards
    and practices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
