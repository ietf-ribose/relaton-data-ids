abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As each global IPv4 address will be shared among more and more\ncustomers,
    and as more and more NATs will be deployed in ISP\ninfrastructures, the lack of
    end-to-end transparency and the limited\nscalability of some NATs are likely to
    cause increasing difficulties\nto customers and to ISPs.  This document introduces
    IPv4-IPv6\ncoexistence scenarios where IPv4 addresses are shared with good\nscalability
    and, in favorable configurations, with full IPv4 end-to-\nend transparency.  For
    this, the key tool is the Stateless Address\nMapping (SAM) of draft-despres-SAM-00,
    with in particular its\nextended IPv4 addressing (IPv4E) in which port prefixes
    are used as\nIPv4 address extensions.  For each considered scenario, Static\nAddress
    Mappers (SAMs) are deployed at scenario specific places.\n\t </p>\n      "
