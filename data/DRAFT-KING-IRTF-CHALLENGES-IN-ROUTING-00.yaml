abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify
    an\n   interface on a network device.  Routing protocols have been developed\n
    \  based on the assumption that a destination address has this semantic.\n\n   Many
    proposals have been made to add semantics to IPv6 addresses.\n   These proposals
    may set the meaning of an address within the scope of\n   a limited domain, or
    suggest an address semantic that is meaningful\n   at specific points in the network
    (such as the source and\n   destination), but which can continue to be used without
    special\n   interpretation at transit points.  Such proposals include providing\n
    \  semantics specific to mobile networks, multicast traffic, different\n   device
    types, different underlying connectivity, hierarchical\n   connectivity, geographic
    location, application or network function\n   usage, or connectivity requirements.\n\n
    \  Some new IP address semantics may have implications for how network\n   routing
    is performed.  Some proposals might not be supported by\n   existing routing protocols
    and so would require changes.  Other\n   proposals might enable advanced routing
    features or offer benefits in\n   scaling and management of routing systems.\n\n
    \  This document presents a brief survey of technologies related to IP\n   address
    semantic proposals and describes the challenges to the\n   existing routing system
    that they present.  It then summarises the\n   opportunities for research into
    new or modified routing protocols to\n   make use of new address semantics.\n\n
    \  This document is presented as research to clarify and understand the\n   issues
    without directly proposing technical solutions that are ready\n   for productisation
    or deployment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
