abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an XML-based protocol for passing location\n
    \  information to a server that returns emergency service contact URIs.\n   It
    is intended to fit within a larger framework of standards.\n   Specifically, it
    presumes the existence of a URI scheme appropriate\n   for signalling that emergency
    service is required and distinguishing\n   among emergency services if appropriate.
    \ It also presumes that an\n   entity requesting this response will be able to
    handle the URIs\n   returned as input to appropriate handlers.\n\t </p>\n      "
