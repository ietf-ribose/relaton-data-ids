abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Shell protocol (SSH) [RFC4251] is widely used for purposes
    including secure remote administration, file transfer using SFTP and SCP, and
    encrypted tunneling of TCP connections. Because it is based on TCP, SSH suffers
    similar problems as are motivating the HTTP protocol to transition its transport
    to UDP-based QUIC [QUIC]. These include: unauthenticated network intermediaries
    can trivially disconnect SSH sessions; SSH connections are lost when mobile clients
    change IP addresses; and performance limitations in OS-based TCP stacks. This
    memo leverages QUIC to provide a UDP-based transport to SSH sessions with full
    backward compatibility, after completing the initial SSH key exchange.</p>"
