abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Service providers (ISPs) are interested in reducing the use of
    IPv4\nin their internal networks because of the anticipated exhaustion of\nthe
    IPv4 address space.  Softwires Network Address Translation (SNAT)\ncombines IPv4
    NAT and IPv4-in-IPv6 softwires to carry IPv4 traffic\nthrough the ISP network
    that uses only IPv6 service.  Multiple\nsubscribers are multiplexed through a
    single external global IPv4\naddress, reducing the total number of IPv4 addresses
    in use by the\nISP to support Internet traffic to those subscribers.\n\t </p>\n
