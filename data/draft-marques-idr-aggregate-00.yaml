abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a mechanism which allows more-specific IP address
    prefixes to be aggregated when they are topologically equivalent or less preferable
    than a less-specific advertisement. It is designed to allow multi-homed sites
    to use "Provider Aggregatable" (PA) addresses and obtain both redundancy and local
    traffic optimizations when using multiple service providers.</p>
