abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Is the concept of Domain Names owned by the DNS protocol or
    does the\n   DNS protocol exist to support the Domain Names concept?  This\n   question
    has become pertinent in light of proposals to use Domain\n   Names in protocols
    in ways incompatible with the DNS protocol and the\n   operational environment
    built to runthe protocol.  This document\n   looks first at the early record in
    the RFC series and then expands to\n   survey how Domain Names are used in protocols
    and reaches the\n   conclusion that Domain Names are independent of the DNS, and
    further,\n   that there might be a need to clarify the definition of Domain Names\n
    \  to reinforce that notion.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
