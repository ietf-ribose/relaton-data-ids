abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes a mechanism named "CCNinfo" that discovers
    information about the network topology and in-network cache in Content-Centric
    Networks (CCN). CCNinfo investigates: 1) the CCN routing path information per
    name prefix, 2) the Round-Trip Time (RTT) between the content forwarder and consumer,
    and 3) the states of in-network cache per name prefix. CCNinfo is useful to understand
    and debug the behavior of testbed networks and other experimental deployments
    of CCN systems. This document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric Networking
    Research Group (ICNRG). This document represents the consensus view of ICNRG and
    has been reviewed extensively by several members of the ICN community and the
    RG. The authors and RG chairs approve of the contents. The document is sponsored
    under the IRTF and is not issued by the IETF and is not an IETF standard. This
    is an experimental protocol and the specification may change in the future.</p>'
