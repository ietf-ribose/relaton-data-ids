abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies FTP commands to download thumbnails of remote
    images, remove entire directory trees, request the amount of storage space available
    to the user, and to request the size of a remote directory and its contents. The
    commands are designed to reduce the number of server / client exchanges, provide
    information that was not previously available, and to reduce bandwidth requirements
    for some higher level operations.</p>"
