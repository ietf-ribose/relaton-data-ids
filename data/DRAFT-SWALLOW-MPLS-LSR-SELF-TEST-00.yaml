abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a means of self test for a Label-Switched\nRouter
    (LSR) to verify that its dataplane is functioning for certain\nkey Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) applications including\nunicast forwarding based on LDP
    [LDP] and traffic engineering tunnels\nbased on [RSVP-TE].  A new Loopback FEC
    type is defined to allow an\nupstream neighbor to assist in the testing at very
    low cost.  MPLS\nEcho Request and MPLS Echo Reply messages [LSP-Ping] messages
    are\nextended to do the actually probing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
