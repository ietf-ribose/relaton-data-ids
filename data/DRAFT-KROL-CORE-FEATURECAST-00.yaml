abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents Featurecast, a group communication service
    in\n   which addressing and routing are based on node features defined as\n   predicates.
    \ For instance, one can send a packet to the address\n   composed of features
    [ temperature and Room D ] to reach all nodes\n   with a temperature sensor located
    in Room D. Each node constructs its\n   address from the set of its features and
    disseminates the features in\n   the network so that intermediate nodes can build
    routing tables.\n   With Featurecast, a node can send a packet to a set of nodes
    matching\n   given features.  Featurecast fits into IPv6 address field without
    any\n   additional headers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
