abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol, specified
    in RFC 7285, defines several services that return various metrics describing the
    costs between network endpoints. This document defines a new service that allows
    an ALTO Client to retrieve several cost metrics in a single request for an ALTO
    filtered cost map and endpoint cost map. In addition, it extends the constraints
    to further filter those maps by allowing an ALTO Client to specify a logical combination
    of tests on several cost metrics.</p>"
