abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Hosts experiencing rapid link-layer changes may require efficient
    IPconfiguration change detection procedures than traditional fixedhosts. DNA is
    defined as the process by which a host collectsappropriate information and detects
    the identity of its currentlyattached link to ascertain the validity of its IP
    configuration.This document details best current practice for Detecting NetworkAttachment
    in IPv6 hosts using existing Neighbor Discoveryprocedures. Since there is no explicit
    link identification mechanismin the existing Neighbor Discovery for IP Version
    6, the documentdescribes implicit mechanisms for identifying the current link.</p>"
