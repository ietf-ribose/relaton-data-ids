abstract:
- content: "<p>To mitigate the IPv6 header overhead in edge networks, this draft proposes
    to use short hierarchical addresses excluding the network prefix within edge networks.
    An edge network can be further organized into a hierarchical architecture containing
    one or more levels of networks. The border routers for each hierarchical level
    are responsible for address augmenting and pruning when a packet leaves or enter
    a lower level network. Specifically, the top-level border routers convert the
    internal IP header to and from the standard IPv6 header. This draft presents an
    incrementally deployable scheme allowing packet header to be effectively compressed
    in edge networks without affecting the network interoperability.</p>"
