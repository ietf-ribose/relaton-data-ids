abstract:
- content: "<p>A common setting in emerging applications (e.g., data-intensive science
    applications, flexible inter-domain routing, multi-domain service function chaining)
    is that the traffic from a source to a destination traverses multiple networks
    domains. Such multi-domain applications can benefit from network information exposure
    using ALTO. This document summarizes the benefits of using such multi- domain
    information and discusses the ALTO design issues for gathering it. Besides, it
    also presents key design requirements to be addressed in order to realize the
    proposal of providing multi-domain information by ALTO services. Finally, another
    important objective of this document is to begin discussions into the ALTO WG
    concerning potential new items to be considered for the re-charter.</p>"
