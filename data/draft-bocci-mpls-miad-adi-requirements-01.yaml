abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies requirements for indicators in the MPLS label
    stack to support ancillary data that exists below the label stack. This work is
    the product of the IETF MPLS Open Design Team. Requirements are derived from a
    number of new proposals for additions to the MPLS label stack to allow forwarding
    or other processing decisions to be made, either by a transit or terminating LSR,
    based on application data that may be in or below the bottom of the label stack.</p>"
