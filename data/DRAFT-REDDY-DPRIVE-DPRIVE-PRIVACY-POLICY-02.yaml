abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Users want to control how their DNS queries are handled by
    DNS\n   servers so they can configure their system to use DNS servers that\n   comply
    with their privacy and DNS filtering expectations.\n\n   This document defines
    a mechanism for a DNS server to communicate its\n   privacy statement URL and
    filtering policy to a DNS client.  This\n   communication is cryptographically
    signed to attest to its\n   authenticity.  By evaluating the DNS privacy statement,
    filtering\n   policy and the signatory, the user can choose a DNS server that
    best\n   supports their desired privacy and filtering policy.  This token is\n
    \  particularly useful for DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers that\n   are
    either public resolvers or are discovered on the local network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
