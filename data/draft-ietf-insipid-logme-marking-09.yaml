abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP networks use signaling monitoring tools to diagnose user reported
    problems and for regression testing if network or user agent software is upgraded.
    As networks grow and become interconnected, including connection via transit networks,
    it becomes impractical to predict the path that SIP signaling will take between
    user agents, and therefore impractical to monitor SIP signaling end-to-end. This
    document describes an indicator for the SIP protocol which can be used to mark
    signaling as being of interest to logging. Such marking will typically be applied
    as part of network testing controlled by the network operator and not used in
    normal user agent signaling. However, such marking can be carried end-to-end including
    the originating and terminating SIP user agents, even if a session originates
    and terminates in different networks.</p>"
