abstract:
  content: "<p>Most Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandatethe
    use of the Control Word (CW) in order to better emulate theservices for which
    the encapsulations have been defined. However,some encapulations treat the Control
    Word as optional. As a result,implementations of the CW, for encapsulations for
    which it isoptional, vary by equipment manufacturer, equipment model and serviceprovider
    network. Similarly, Virtual Circuit ConnectivityVerification (VCCV) supports three
    Control Channel (CC) types andmultiple Connectivity Verification (CV) Types. This
    flexibility hasled to reports of interoperability issues within deployed networksand
    associated drafts to attempt to remedy the situation. Thissurvey of the PW/VCCV
    user community was conducted to determineimplementation trends. The survey and
    results is presented herein.</p>"
