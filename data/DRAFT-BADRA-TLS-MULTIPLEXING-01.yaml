abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the most widely deployed\n
    \  protocol for securing network traffic.  It provides mutual\n   authentication,
    data confidentiality and integrity, key generation\n   and distribution, and security
    parameters negotiation.  However,\n   missing from the protocol is a way to multiplex
    single-application\n   multiple-stream applications that commonly use parallel
    connections\n   to the same logical and/or physical server application data.\n\n
    \  This document describes a mechanism to multiplex single-application\n   multiple-stream
    over TLS.  It extends TLS to multiplex parallel\n   connections of a given application
    over a single TLS session,\n   avoiding additional delay related to the TLS/TCP
    session/connection\n   setup.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
