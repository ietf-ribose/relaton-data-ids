abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the use of LDP in establishing VPNs for
    transporting traffic that needs to be classified based on application flows. This
    document proposes extensions to existing LDP for establishing end-to-end VPN LSPs
    for transporting traffic meant for specific destination addresses and applications
    from specific applications. This document proposes to use a Flow FEC element,
    which contains the Layer 3 and transport information which is used for identifying
    the flow. The flow is mapped onto the appropriate VPN LSP.</p>"
