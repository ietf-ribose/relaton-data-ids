abstract:
  content: "<p>During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 both protocols will be usedsimultaneously.
    Most nodes will support both protocols and will beable to communicate via both
    IPv4 and IPv6 transport. Problems arisewhen a node only supports IPv4 and it wants
    to communicate with anode that only supports IPv6. Translation between the two
    IPprotocols might be needed in some cases. This memo discusses theproblems involved
    in translation between IPv4 and IPv6.</p>"
