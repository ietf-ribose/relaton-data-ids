abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This informational document defines and explains the specification
    of\n   the queue protection algorithm used in DOCSIS 3.1.  It is believed\n   this
    algorithm will be useful in scenarios other than DOCSIS.  A\n   shared low latency
    queue relies on the non-queue-building behaviour\n   of every traffic flow using
    it.  However, some flows might not take\n   such care, either accidentally or
    maliciously.  If a queue is about\n   to exceed a threshold level of delay, the
    queue protection algorithm\n   can rapidly detect the flow(s) most likely to be
    responsible.  It can\n   then prevent selected packets of these flows (or whole
    flows) from\n   harming the queuing delay of other traffic in the low latency
    queue.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
