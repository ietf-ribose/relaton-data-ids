abstract:
- content: "<p>A novel mobility management approach is described in [I-D.auge-dmm-hicn-mobility],
    that leverages routable location- independent identifiers (IDs) and an Information-Centric
    Networking (ICN) communication model integrated in IPv6, (also referred to as
    Hybrid ICN, hICN, [I-D.muscariello-intarea-hicn]. Such approach belongs to the
    category of pure ID-based mobility management schemes whose objective is (i) to
    overcome the limitations of traditional locator-based solutions like Mobile IP,
    (ii) to remove the need for a global mapping system as the one required by locator-
    identifier separation solutions like LISP [I-D.ietf-lisp-introduction] or ILA
    [I-D.herbert-intarea-ila]. ID-based networking as proposed by ICN architectures
    allows to disentangle forwarding operations from changes of network location,
    hence removing tunnels and user plane or control plane anchors. In virtue of its
    anchorless property, we denote this approach as hICN- AMM (hICN Anchorless Mobility
    Management) hereinafter. This document discusses hICN-AMM deployment options and
    related tradeoffs in terms of cost/benefits. Particular attention is devoted to
    the insertion in the recently proposed 5G Service Based Architecture under study
    at 3GPP where an hICN-AMM solution might present a more efficient alternative
    to the traditional tunnel-based mobility architecture through GTP-U.</p>"
