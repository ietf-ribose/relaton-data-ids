abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use
    constants\n   to identify various protocol parameters.  To ensure that the values\n
    \  used in these fields do not have conflicting uses, and to promote\n   interoperability,
    their allocation is often coordinated by a central\n   authority.  For IETF protocols,
    that role is filled by the Internet\n   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).\n\n
    \  To make assignments in a given namespace prudently, IANA needs\n   guidance
    describing the conditions under which new values should be\n   assigned, as well
    as when and how modifications to existing values\n   can be made.  This document
    defines a framework for the documentation\n   of these guidelines by specification
    authors, in order to assure that\n   the guidance given to IANA is clear and addresses
    the various issues\n   that are likely in the operation of a registry.\n\n   This
    is the third edition, and obsoletes RFC 5226.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
