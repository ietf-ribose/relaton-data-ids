abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol in its various versions combines\n
    \  concepts of both an application and transport-layer protocol.  As\n   this
    group contemplates employing alternate transport protocols\n   underneath HTTP,
    this document attempts to delineate the boundaries\n   between these functions
    to define a shared vocabulary in discussing\n   the revision and/or replacement
    of one or more of these components.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
