abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a fully-specified FEC scheme for the\nSupercharged
    forward error correction code.  Supercharged codes are\ndesigned for use on the
    erasure channel.  Coding for the erasure\nchannel commonly arises for data transmission
    over the internet, where\nlower layers either successfully deliver packets or
    fail to deliver\nthem.  Coding is required to insure that data is not lost, even
    if\npackets are lost at the lower layers.  Error free reception is\nimportant
    for multimedia applications, such as streaming, where it may\nnot be possible
    to correct an error in time by any other means.  Coding\ninsures that lost packets
    can be recovered.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
