abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Nowadays, the underlying network infrastructure grows in scale
    and\n   complexity, which make it challenging for network operators to manage\n
    \  and configure the network.  Deploying policy or configuration based\n   on
    an abstract view of the underlying network is much better than\n   manipulating
    each individual network element, however, in this case,\n   the policy and configuration
    cannot be recognized by the network\n   elements.  This document describes guidelines
    for mapping said\n   abstract configuration and policy into device-level configuration
    and\n   the way in which such models will be processed by software to produce\n
    \  configuration details for actual devices.  The Simplified Use of\n   Policy
    Abstractions (SUPA) framework overview, exemplary mechanism\n   for exchanging
    service polices among the different elements\n   participating in their deployment
    and enforcement, and primary\n   procedures of mapping are described.  Moreover,
    an exemplary mapping\n   scenario is provided to illustrate the defined mechanism.\n\n\t
