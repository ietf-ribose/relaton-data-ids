abstract:
- content: "<p>The document discusses the usage and applicability of BGP as the control
    plane for multiple SDWAN scenarios. The document aims to demonstrate how the BGP-based
    control plane is used for large-scale SDWAN overlay networks with little manual
    intervention. SDWAN edge nodes are commonly interconnected by multiple types of
    underlay networks owned and managed by different network providers.</p>"
