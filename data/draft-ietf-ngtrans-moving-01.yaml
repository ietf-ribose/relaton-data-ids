abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an analysis of the requirements to support mobility
    in a dual stack network. In this document, combinations of IPv4, IPv6, and dual
    stack mobile node moving in IPv4, IPv6, and dual stack networks are listed and
    the requirements to support mobility under different network and mobile node configurations
    are investigated. This document aims to reassess next generation transition (NGTRANS)
    tools from the point of view of mobility.</p>"
