abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to facilitate the multi-protocol management
    coexistence and interworking for networks that are managed using the ISO/CCITT
    Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) and networks that are managed using
    the Internet Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). This document defines
    the end-to-end security architecture, services, and mechanisms for use with ISO/CCITT-Internet
    proxies. This document also contains the ISO/CCITT GDMO definition and registration
    of the SNMP Parties MIB, derived from the Internet SNMP Parties MIB [RFC1447]
    according to the procedures defined in 'Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT
    GDMO MIBs' [IIMCIMIBTRANS].</p>"
