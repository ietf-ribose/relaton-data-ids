abstract:
  content: "<p>Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) have increasedthe use of
    sensing technologies for IoT applications. However,monitoring sensor nodes is
    still a challenging issue indistributed remote environments, especially wireless
    environments.Different from conventional centralized mechanism, Fog Computingbecomes
    an essential role in a scalable IoT system. Fog Node cancontrol and monitor its
    subdomain's devices and perform aggregationtasks to support the central server
    at the cloud. Since nodefault detection can strongly affect the performance and
    accuracyin most IoT analysis applications, fault detection mechanismshould be
    integrated into IoT Networks. Accordingly, thesefault nodes could be detected
    and replaced by others availablenodes in the same domain for the analysis by a
    distributedfault detection and node replacement mechanism based on theirsensory
    values in a considered domain.</p>"
