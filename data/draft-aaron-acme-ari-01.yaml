abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how an ACME server may provide hints to ACME
    clients as to when they should attempt to renew their certificates. This allows
    servers to mitigate load spikes, and ensures clients do not make false assumptions
    about appropriate certificate renewal periods. Current Implementations Draft note:
    this section will be removed by the editor before final publication. Let's Encrypt's
    Staging environment (available at [lestaging], source at [boulder]) implements
    this draft specification.</p>"
