abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an Internet Protocol (IP) multicast routing
    protocol suitable for dynamic network environments including mobile wireless.
    To handle high dynamics, this routing mechanism uses redundant forwarding, based
    upon the Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) approach of [RFC6621], while converging
    to regular multicast distribution trees where or when the network becomes relatively
    stable. The rationale is that intermittent connectivity directly affects the ability
    of routers to synchronize on their view of the network, thus making it difficult
    to converge on efficient distribution trees, while network wide broadcast may
    be prohibitively expensive for relatively sparse groups. A hybrid approach, called
    Elastic Multicast, is specified which dynamically switches between limited scope
    broadcast and tree path forwarding independently at each node. The trees created
    during stable periods and portions of the network are pruned from the SMF efficient
    flooding mesh.</p>"
