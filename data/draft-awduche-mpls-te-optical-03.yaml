abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes an approach to the design of control planesfor
    optical crossconnects (OXCs), which leverages existing controlplane techniques
    developed for MPLS Traffic Engineering. Theproposed approach combines recent advances
    in MPLS trafficengineering control plane constructs with OXC technology to: (1)provide
    a framework for real-time provisioning of optical channels inautomatically switched
    optical networks, (2) foster the expediteddevelopment and deployment of a new
    class of versatile OXCs, and (3)allow the use of uniform semantics for network
    management andoperations control in hybrid networks consisting of OXCs and labelswitching
    routers (LSRs). The proposed approach is particularlyadvantageous for OXCs intended
    for data-centric opticalinternetworking systems. In such environments, it will
    help tosimplify network administration. This approach also paves the wayfor the
    eventual incorporation of DWDM multiplexing capabilities inIP routers.</p>"
