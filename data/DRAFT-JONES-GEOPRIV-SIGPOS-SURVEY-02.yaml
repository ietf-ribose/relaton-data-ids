abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Location Information Servers rely on signal surveys to create
    a\n   signal map allowing for subsequent device location determination.\n   This
    document describes a method by which a Survey Device is able to\n   provide indoor
    location related measurement data to a LIS for\n   positioning purposes.  Location
    related measurement information\n   comprises observations concerning properties
    related to the position\n   of a Survey Device and the radio, electromagnetic,
    and other\n   observable environmental measures as perceived by the Survey Device.\n
    \  These measurements could be data about Wi-Fi signals, Bluetooth\n   signals,
    barometric pressure, or any other environmental measurement\n   which could sent
    to a LIS for subsequent processing to help determine\n   the location of devices
    that later enter the venue.  A basic set of\n   location-related measurements,
    data rights disclosure and location\n   types are defined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
