abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SDN and NFV have been creating paradigm shifts across major service
    providers,\ngovernments, and industries. In most recent months, these two novel
    frameworks created jitters\nand excitements across major academic institutions
    and communities of practice. While these\nare considered disruptive to major network
    infrastructures operating on status quo, SDN and\nNFV nonetheless bring network
    resiliency, scalability, manageability, and, most\nimportantly, lower long-term
    operational expenditures.\n\nThey create opportunities for  innovation that engage
    key players from networks,\nsecurity, and software to develop new software controllers,
    APIs, networks, and technologies.\n\nThis document aims to propose a formal security
    architecture that overarches important\naspects of SDN and NFV 's frameworks.\n\nThe
    architecture can be elaborated and modified as these two frameworks mature over\ntime.
