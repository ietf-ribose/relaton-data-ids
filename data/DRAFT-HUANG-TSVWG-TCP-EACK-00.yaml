abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>TCP may experience asymmetric bi-directional performance and poor
    \nover all performance when acknowledgments (ACKs) are sent by \nseparate packets
    instead of being piggybacked by data packets.  \nBetween two TCP end points, when
    two-way traffic flows do not share \nthe same TCP connection, the increase of
    traffic volume in one \ndirection consumes more bandwidth in the reverse direction
    by \ngenerating more separate ACK packets, potentially causing more \ncongestions
    in the reverse direction.\n\nAn Extended Acknowledgment (EACK) mechanism can help
    overcome these\nlimitations.  The receiving TCP sends back EACK packets to the
    sender\ninforming the sender of data, including data of the current TCP \nconnection
    and data of other eligible connections, that have been\nreceived.  EACK thus reduces
    the need for separate ACK packets and\nimproves the bi-directional symmetry and
    over all throughput.\n\nThis memo proposes an implementation of EACK and discusses
    its \nrelated issues.\n\t </p>\n      "
