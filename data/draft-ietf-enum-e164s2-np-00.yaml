abstract:
  content: "<p>This document contains a text version of the Number PortabilitySupplement
    (11/98) to ITU-T Recommendation E.164 (The internationalpublic telecommunication
    numbering plan, 05/97) [2]. ThatSupplement [3] defined terminology for number
    portability within anE.164 numbering scheme; identified formats, call flows,architectures,
    and routing approaches for some methods; and gaveexamples of some processes needed
    to implement number portability.A January 2000 workshop on IP-Telecomms interworking
    (focused onnumbering, naming, addressing, and routing) identified issues to beaddressed
    by the IETF and/or the ITU [4]. This Supplement was notedas a document related
    to a joint IETF/ITU issue on E.164 numberportability. A text version was posted
    on the ITU's web site inMarch 2000 and notified to the itu+ietf and enum mailing
    lists.This Internet Draft is being submitted to support work of the ENUM(Telephone
    Number Mapping) Working Group on impacts of local numberportability on a DNS-based
    architecture and protocols for mapping atelephone number to a set of attributes
    (e.g., URLs) [5].</p>"
