abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS (Domain Name System), which was designed as a network resource
    naming layer, is not able to serve today's Internet users naming needs anymore.
    Attempts to change the DNS to adapt to those needs, such as the IDN (Internationalized
    Domain Name) IETF effort, are not only proving themselves unsatisfactory in many
    ways, they are also limited by the nature of DNS itself.</p>"
