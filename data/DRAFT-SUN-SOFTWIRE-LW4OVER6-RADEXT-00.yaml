abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   lightweight 4over6(lw4over6) [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is
    an\n   extension to DS-Lite in which the amount of state maintained in\n   lwAFTR
    has been reduced to per-subscriber-level.  The lwB4 needs to\n   be provisioned
    with the public IPv4 address and port set it is\n   allowed to use.  The DHCPv4
    over DHCPv6 Transport [I.D-ietf-dhc-\n   dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] and Dynamic Host
    Configuration Protocol (DHCP)\n   Option for Port Set [I.D-sun-dhc-port-set-option]
    can be used for\n   lwB4 to provison with the public IPv4 address and port set.\n\n
    \  However, in many networks, the configuration information may be\n   stored
    in Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers\n   while user configuration
    is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway\n   (BNG).  This document defines a Remote
    Authentication Dial In User\n   Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries lightweight
    4over6\n   configuration information from AAA server to BNG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
