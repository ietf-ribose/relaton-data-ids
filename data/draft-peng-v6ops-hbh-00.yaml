abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the processing of the Hop-by-Hop Options Header
    in today's routers in the aspects of standards specification, common implementations,
    and default operations. This document outlines the reasons why the Hop-by-Hop
    Options Header is rarely utilized in current networks. In addition, this document
    describes why the HBH could be used as a powerful mechanism allowing deployment
    and operations of new services requiring a more optimized way to leverage network
    resources of an infrastructure. The Hop-by-Hop Options Header is taken into consideration
    as a valuable container for carrying the information facilitating the introduction
    of new services. The desired, and proposed, processing behavior of the HBH and
    the migration strategies towards it are also suggested.</p>"
