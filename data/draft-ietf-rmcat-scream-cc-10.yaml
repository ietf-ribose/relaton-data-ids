abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a rate adaptation algorithm for conversational
    media services such as video. The solution conforms to the packet conservation
    principle and uses a hybrid loss and delay based congestion control algorithm.
    The algorithm is evaluated over both simulated Internet bottleneck scenarios as
    well as in a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system simulator and is shown to achieve
    both low latency and high video throughput in these scenarios.</p>"
