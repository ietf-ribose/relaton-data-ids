abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A new type of key is defined to address the problems of\n    performance
    in large delegeted zones and issues of liability of\n    registrars with regards
    to the storing of public keys belonging\n    to zone cuts.  This new key type
    also brings DNSSEC more in line\n    with the DNS treatment of zone cuts and speeds
    recovery in\n    handling key exposure.\n \n    The new type of key is a referral
    record that is stored, signed,\n    at the parent zone's place for the delegation
    point.  A resolver\n    receiving this record is being informed that there are
    genuine\n    public keys at the child's authoritative name servers.  The\n    parent
    no longer needs to store the child's public keys locally.\n\t </p>\n      "
