abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   While the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) provides\n
    \  confidentiality for the contents of a media packet, a significant\n   amount
    of metadata is left unprotected, including RTP header\n   extensions and contributing
    sources (CSRCs).  However, this data can\n   be moderately sensitive in many applications.
    \ While there have been\n   previous attempts to protect this data, they have
    had limited\n   deployment, due to complexity as well as technical limitations.\n\n
    \  This document defines Cryptex as a new mechanism that completely\n   encrypts
    header extensions and CSRCs and uses simpler signaling with\n   the goal of facilitating
    deployment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
