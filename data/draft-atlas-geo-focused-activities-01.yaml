abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has a variety of activities beyond those that are part of
    the standards process. IETF activities that aren't part of the standards process
    are still quite useful for the IETF mission. Some of these activities, such as
    IETF hackathons, tutorials, and mentoring, occur at in-person meetings. There
    has been and continues to be interest in having such activities located in different
    geographical areas. The document defines how the IETF organizes our Geographically-
    Focused Activities. It is intended for eventual publication as a BCP but this
    is currently an initial strawman proposal based upon the existing variety of experience
    with the experimental activities in this space over the past several years.</p>"
