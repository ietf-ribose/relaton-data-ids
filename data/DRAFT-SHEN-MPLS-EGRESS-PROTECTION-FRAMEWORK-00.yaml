abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a fast reroute framework for protecting
    MPLS\n   tunnels and the IP/MPLS services carried by them against egress\n   router
    failures.  The framework relies on local detection and local\n   repair to be
    performed by the router upstream adjacent to a failure.\n   The router can restore
    traffic in the order of tens of milliseconds,\n   by rerouting it to a protector
    through a pre-established bypass\n   tunnel.  Therefore, the mechanism can be
    used to reduce traffic loss\n   before global repair reacts to the failure and
    control plane\n   protocols converge on the topology changes due to the failure.\n\n\t
