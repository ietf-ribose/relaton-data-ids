abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Transport Services system enables applications to use transport\n
    \  protocols flexibly for network communication and defines a protocol-\n   independent
    Transport Services Application Programming Interface\n   (API) that is based on
    an asynchronous, event-driven interaction\n   pattern.  This document serves as
    a guide to implementation on how to\n   build such a system.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
