abstract:
  content: "<p>The SSM model is appeared in order to overcome the problems of deployment
    of IP multicast. However, a real commercial deployment of SSM have to offer some
    security services. Our work proposes anarchitecture, called S-SSM, for securing
    the SSM model. S-SSMdefines two mechanisms for access control and content protection.The
    first one is carried out through subscriber authentication andaccess permission.
    As for the second, it is realized through themanagement of a unique key, called
    the channel key, k_ch, sharedamong the sender and subscribers.</p>"
