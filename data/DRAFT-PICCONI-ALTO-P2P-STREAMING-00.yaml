abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) service aims
    at\nproviding applications with information about the network to optimize\ntheir
    traffic. Peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming is one of such\n applications which
    can benefit from ALTO. We have recently designed a\nnew scheme to minimize inter-domain
    traffic in P2P live streaming\napplications without impacting video quality. In
    this draft we\nbriefly describe our solution, and we discuss the implications
    of the\ntype of information provided by the ALTO service on overlay\nconstruction.\n\t
