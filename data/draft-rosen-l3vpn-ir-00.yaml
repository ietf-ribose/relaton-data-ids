abstract:
- content: <p>RFCs 6513, 6514, and other RFCs describe procedures by which a Service
    Provider may offer Multicast VPN service to its customers. These procedures create
    point-to-multipoint (P2MP) or multipoint-to- multipoint trees across the Service
    Provider's backbone. One type of P2MP tree that may be used is known as an "Ingress
    Replication (IR) tunnel". In an IR tunnel, a parent node need not be "directly
    connected" to its child nodes. When a parent node has to send a multicast data
    packet to its child nodes, it does not use layer 2 multicast, IP multicast, or
    MPLS multicast to do so. Rather, it makes n individual copies, and then unicasts
    each copy, through an IP or MPLS unicast tunnel, to exactly one child node. While
    the prior MVPN specifications allow the use of IR tunnels, those specifications
    are not always very clear or explicit about how the MVPN protocol elements and
    procedures are applied to IR tunnels. This document updates RFCs 6513 and 6514
    by adding additional details that are specific to the use of IR tunnels.</p>
