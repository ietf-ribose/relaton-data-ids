abstract:
- content: "<p>The present document focuses on the MPLS Fast Reroute many-to-one solution.
    It defines on the one hand, a specific PLR behavior for the dynamic setup of bypass
    LSPs, and on the other hand a distributed bypass LSP path computation mechanism,
    taking into account the possibility to share protection resources. It proposes
    ISIS-TE/OSPF-TE and RSVP-TE extensions required to support the described functionality.</p>"
