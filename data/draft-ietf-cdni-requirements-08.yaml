abstract:
- content: "<p>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are frequently used for content delivery.
    As a result of significant growth in content delivered over IP networks, existing
    CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure. Many Network Service Providers
    and Enterprise Service Providers are also deploying their own CDNs. To deliver
    contents from the Content Service Protect (CSP) to end users, the contents may
    traverse across multiple CDNs. This creates a need for interconnecting (previously)
    standalone CDNs so that they can collectively act as a single delivery platform
    from the CSP to the end users. The goal of the present document is to outline
    the requirements for the solution and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI working
    group.</p>"
