abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transparent MPTCP Proxy(TMPP) is an introduced network-based\n
    \  function, which is under MPTCP architecture.  It can help two MPTCP-\n   unaware
    hosts enjoy multipath support, and can be extensively used\n   both in the access
    networks and operators' networks.  Meanwhile, in\n   MPTCP architecture with TMPP,
    TMPP needs to modify the received\n   packets and transmit them again(just like
    gateway in NAT\n   environment).  In this document, we also discuss the guarantee
    for\n   data transfer on TMPP's side.  The consideration of data transfer can\n
    \  be expanded to the MPTCP architecture with proxy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
