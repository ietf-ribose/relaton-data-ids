abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a method of algorithmic load balancing
    for\n   IPv6 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) traffic.  It\n   enables
    multiple, cooperating servers to decide which one should\n   service a client,
    without exchanging any information beyond initial\n   configuration.  The server
    selection is based on the servers hashing\n   client DHCP Unique Identifiers (DUIDs)
    when multiple DHCPv6 (DHCPv6)\n   servers are available to service DHCPv6 clients.
    \ The proposed\n   technique provides for efficient server selection when multiple\n
    \  DHCPv6 servers offer services on a network without requiring any\n   changes
    to existing DHCPv6 clients.  The same method is proposed to\n   select the target
    server of a DHCPv6 relay.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
