abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In some application scenarios it may be desirable to send multiple\n
    \  differently encoded versions of the same Media Source in independent\n   Source
    Packet Streams.  This is called Simulcast.  This document\n   discusses the best
    way of accomplishing Simulcast in RTP and how to\n   signal it in SDP.  A solution
    is defined by making three extensions\n   to SDP, and using RTP/RTCP identification
    methods to relate RTP\n   Source Packet Streams.  The first SDP extension consists
    of two new\n   session level SDP attributes that express capability to send or\n
    \  receive Simulcast Source Packet Streams, respectively.  The second\n   SDP
    extension introduces an SDP media level attribute that groups and\n   identifies
    a selected set of media level parameters for a specific\n   direction, called
    a media configuration.  The third SDP extension\n   describes how to group such
    media configurations on SDP session or\n   media level for Simulcast purposes.\n\n\t
