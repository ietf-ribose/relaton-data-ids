abstract:
- content: <p>This memo introduces the "Opportunistic Security" (OS) protocol design
    pattern. Protocol designs based on OS depart from the established practice of
    employing cryptographic protection against both passive and active attacks, or
    no protection at all. As a result, with OS at least some cryptographic protection
    should be provided most of the time. For example, the majority of Internet SMTP
    traffic is now opportunistically encrypted. OS designs remove barriers to the
    widespread use of encryption on the Internet. The actual protection provided by
    opportunistic security depends on the advertised security capabilities of the
    communicating peers. This document promotes designs in which cryptographic protection
    against both passive and active attacks can be rolled out incrementally as new
    systems are deployed, without creating barriers to communication.</p>
