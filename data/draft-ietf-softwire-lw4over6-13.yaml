abstract:
- content: <p>Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) (RFC 6333) describes an architecture for transporting
    IPv4 packets over an IPv6 network. This document specifies an extension to DS-Lite
    called "Lightweight 4over6", which moves the Network Address and Port Translation
    (NAPT) function from the centralized DS-Lite tunnel concentrator to the tunnel
    client located in the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). This removes the requirement
    for a Carrier Grade NAT function in the tunnel concentrator and reduces the amount
    of centralized state that must be held to a per-subscriber level. In order to
    delegate the NAPT function and make IPv4 address sharing possible, port-restricted
    IPv4 addresses are allocated to the CPEs.</p>
