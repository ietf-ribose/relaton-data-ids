abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of this draft is to describe an information model
    for\nrepresenting MPLS traffic engineering policies. RFC 2702,\n'Requirements
    for Traffic Engineering over MPLS', is used as a basis\nfor determining the types
    of information that need to be represented\nin such an information model. The
    latter document describes the\nfunctional capabilities required to implement policies
    that\nfacilitate efficient and reliable network operations in an MPLS\ndomain.
    The information model described in this draft attempts to\ncapture the information
    required to enable the functional\ncapabilities described in RFC 2702. This information
    model could be\nused by a management system to optimize network performance through\nthe
    necessary network provisioning actions.\nAn overview of policy-based management
    is given in this document,\nalong with a description of the relationship of this
    work to other\ninformation models that are being defined in the IETF Policy\nFramework
    working group. This is followed by a detailed description\nof the information
    model, and a number of examples illustrating its\nuse.\n\t </p>\n      "
