abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS zone transfers are transmitted in clear text, which gives\n
    \  attackers the opportunity to collect the content of a zone by\n   eavesdropping
    on network connections.  This document specifies use of\n   DNS Stateful Operations
    to enable a subscribe/publish mechanism for\n   zone transfers reducing the over
    head introduced by NOTITY/SOA\n   interactions prior to zone transfer request.
    \ This additionally\n   prevents zone contents collection via passive monitoring
    of zone\n   transfers by restricting XFR using DSO to require TLS.\n\n\t </p>\n
