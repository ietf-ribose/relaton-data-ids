abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines two media types for representing
    sets of\n   links and a link relation type for referring to sets of links.  The\n
    \  media types can be used to represents links in a standalone fashion,\n   in
    one case in the native format as used in the HTTP \"Link\" header\n   field, and
    in the other case in a JSON-based format.  The link\n   relation type can be used
    to point at a resource that provides a set\n   of links.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
