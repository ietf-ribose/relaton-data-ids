abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC8250 describes an optional Destination Option (DO) header embedded
    in each packet to provide sequence numbers and timing information as a basis for
    measurements. As this data is sent in clear- text, this may create an opportunity
    for malicious actors to get information for subsequent attacks. This document
    defines PDMv2 which has a lightweight handshake (registration procedure) and encryption
    to secure this data. Additional performance metrics which may be of use are also
    defined.</p>"
