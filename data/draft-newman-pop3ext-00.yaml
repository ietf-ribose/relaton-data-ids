abstract:
- content: "<p>The POP3 protocol [POP3] includes a number of optional commands and
    some useful protocol extensions have also been published. Currently these optional
    features and extensions can only be detected by probing. This has resulted in
    some clients including manual configuration options for POP3 server capabilities.</p>"
