abstract:
- content: "<p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) can be used to monitor paths
    between node. Seamless BFD (S-BFD) provides a simplified mechanism which is suitable
    for monitoring of paths that are setup dynamically and on a large scale network.
    This draft describes a method to simplify the implementation of S-BFD over SRv6
    by using SRH.flag to instruct the S-BFD peer node to do reverse operation of SRv6
    SID list.</p>"
