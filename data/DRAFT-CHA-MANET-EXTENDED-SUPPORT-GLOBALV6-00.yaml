abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes how to provide enhanced Internet connectivity\nto
    mobile ad hoc networks. To achieve this goal, we borrow the\nconcept of Mobile
    IPv6 and make the most use of available multiple\ngateways. Specifically, our
    scheme makes a global address being used\nby Upper layer reachable by peer Internet
    node by registering another\nglobal address as a locator with corresponding gateway
    for the\naddress being cared while the gateway can not obtain host route\ninformation
    for the cared address because of frequent partitions.\nWe introduce stateful auto-configuration
    for acquisition of global\naddress in mobile ad-hoc networks because it can avoid
    duplicate\naddress problem and help prevent traffics from going outside a manet\nor
    unnecessary control traffic by route discovery of reactive routing\nprotocols
    from being issued. In addition, it can support for our\nscheme since our scheme
    requires some security guarantee to register\na locator with a gateway as Mobile
    IPv6 requires for Binding Updates.\n\nBasically, our extended support and stateful
    configuration of global\naddress are devised to extend AODV, but the concept is
    also\napplicable for proactive routing protocols such as OLSR, TBRPF.\nFurther,
    our extended support can be useful for a mobile node(MN) in\nMobile IPv6 to maintain
    its reachability from the Internet by\nutilizing multi-hop manet extension as
    a virtual link since it can\nhelp determine intelligently when current CoA should
    be changed and\nBinding Update with new CoA be performed while it can make the\ncurrent
    CoA reachable from Internet even when the GW which assigned\nthe CoA is not reachable
    from the manet node any more.\n\t </p>\n      "
