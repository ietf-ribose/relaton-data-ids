abstract:
- content: "<p>In network protocol exchanges it is often useful for one end of a communication
    to know whether the other end is in an intended operating state. This document
    provides an architectural overview of the entities involved that make such tests
    possible through the process of generating, conveying, and evaluating evidentiary
    claims. An attempt is made to provide for a model that is neutral toward processor
    architectures, the content of claims, and protocols.</p>"
