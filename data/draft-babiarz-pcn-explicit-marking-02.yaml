abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the simulation setups and results for testing
    the Three State PCN Marking approach. Simulations done to date, demonstrate that
    the three state PCN marking approach has certain ability to support admission
    control and flow termination of real- time application flows at the congestion
    point(s) of the PCN-enabled network. The real-time traffic used in the simulation
    covers voice and video traffic with large and small numbers of flows. Conventions
    used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].</p>
