abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft specifies IP mobility support protocol for moving
    network\n   including mobile nodes (MNs) over Proxy Mobile IPv6 network by\n   introducing
    a new functional entity, mobile MAG (mMAG) on the moving\n   network. The mMAG
    takes charges of MN's movement detection, binding\n   update on behalf of MNs
    as a mobile access gateway (MAG) does in\n   PMIPv6 infrastructure. This protocol
    also supports IP session\n   continuity for a mobile node to move between mobile
    network and fixed\n   MAG. This protocol does not require any modification or
    extension on\n   the MN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
