abstract:
- content: "<p>The Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol defines
    a standard communication and control mechanism through which a Control Element
    (CE) can control the behavior of a Forwarding Element (FE). This document captures
    the experience of implementing the ForCES protocol and model. Its aim is to help
    others by providing examples and possible strategies for implementing the ForCES
    protocol. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
    published for informational purposes.</p>"
