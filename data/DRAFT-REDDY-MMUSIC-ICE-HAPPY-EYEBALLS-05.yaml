abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides guidelines on how to make ICE [RFC5245]\n
    \  conclude faster in IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack scenarios where broken paths\n   exist.
    \ This will lead to more sustained IPv6 deployment as users\n   will no longer
    have an incentive to disable IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
