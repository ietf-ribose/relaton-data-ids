abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the characteristics of link layer technologies
    that are used at constrained node networks and typical use cases of IPv6 over
    networks of resource-constrained nodes. In addition to IEEE 802.15.4, various
    link layer technologies such as BLE, ITU-T G.9959 (Z-Wave), DECT-ULE, MS/TP, NFC,
    and LTE MTC are widely used at constrained node networks for typical services.
    Based on these link layer technologies, IPv6 over networks of resource- constrained
    nodes has various and practical use cases. To efficiently implement typical services,
    the applicability and consideration of several design spaces are described.</p>"
