- content: "<p>This document tries to summarize the different problem areas in the
    MMOX field and proposed an approach to build interoperability from the bottom
    up starting with a flexible foundation. It also aims at identifying problem spaces
    which are more general than the virtual worlds field and also touch on problems
    found in today's social networks.</p>"
