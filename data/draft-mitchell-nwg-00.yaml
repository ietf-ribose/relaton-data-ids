abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Trusted Platform Module, for the past decade, has shown potentialto
    improve computer security. However, there is growing concerns thatthe Trusted
    Platform Module, and its related technologies might bechallenging for Forensic
    Investigators to acquire and analyze certaindigital evidence. For example, if
    the key evidence is encrypted, andcryptographically bound to a set of platform
    characteristics, thenthose characteristics must exist on the platform (that is
    being usedto decrypt the evidence) before the evidence can be decrypted.As a result,
    it is believed that if a suspect cryptographicallybound the evidence to the platform
    characteristics, and thosecharacteristics in some way got changed, then it might
    not bepossible to decrypt the potential evidence.For this reason, we explored
    how Trusted Platform Module and itsrelated technologies might support digital
    forensic analysis within a trusted enterprise network.</p>"
