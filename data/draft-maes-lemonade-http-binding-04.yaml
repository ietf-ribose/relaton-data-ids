abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of the LEMONADE work to define extensions to the IMAPv4 Rev1
    protocol [RFC3501] and SMTP that provide optimizations in a variety of settings,
    the this document describes an alternative, optional binding for IMAPv4 and SMTP
    showing how HTTP can be used to transfer commands and responses. This binding
    is intended to facilitate the use of IMAP and SMTP in deployments involving a
    variety of intermediaries. A binding to SOAP is also provided.</p>"
