abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285]\n
    \  is to bridge the gap between network and applications by providing\n   network
    related information to non-priviledged, application-level\n   clients.  This allows
    applications to make informed decisions, for\n   example when selecting a target
    host from a set of candidates.\n\n   Therefore an ALTO Server provides network
    and cost maps to its\n   clients.  However, those maps can be very large, and
    portions of\n   those maps may change frequently (cost maps in particular).\n\n
    \  This draft presents a method to provide incremental updates for these\n   maps.
    \ The goal is to reduce the load on the ALTO Client and Server\n   by transmitting
    just the updated portions of those maps.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
