abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network operators require NAT devices to log events like creation
    and\n   deletion of translations and information about the resources that the\n
    \  NAT device is managing.  The logs are essential in many cases to\n   identify
    an attacker or a host that was used to launch malicious\n   attacks and for various
    other purposes of accounting.  Since there is\n   no standard way of logging this
    information, different NAT devices\n   log the information using proprietary formats
    and hence it is\n   difficult to expect a consistent behavior.  The lack of a
    consistent\n   way to log the data makes it difficult to write the collector\n
    \  applications that would receive this data and process it to present\n   useful
    information.  This document describes the formats for logging\n   of NAT events.\n\n\t
