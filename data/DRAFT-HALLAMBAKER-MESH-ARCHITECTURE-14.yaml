abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an end-to-end secure\n
    \  infrastructure that makes computers easier to use by making them more\n   secure.
    \ The Mesh provides a set of protocol and cryptographic\n   building blocks that
    enable encrypted data stored in the cloud to be\n   accessed, managed and exchanged
    between users with the same or better\n   ease of use than traditional approaches
    which leave the data\n   vulnerable to attack.\n\n   This document provides an
    overview of the Mesh data structures,\n   protocols and examples of its use.\n\n
    \  [Note to Readers]\n\n   Discussion of this draft takes place on the MATHMESH
    mailing list\n   (mathmesh@ietf.org), which is archived at\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=mathmesh.\n\n
    \  This document is also available online at\n   http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-mesh-\n
