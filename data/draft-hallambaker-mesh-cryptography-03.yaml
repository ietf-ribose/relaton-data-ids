abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an infrastructure that facilitates
    the exchange of configuration and credential data between multiple user devices
    and provides end-to-end security. This document describes the cryptographic algorithm
    suites used in the Mesh and the implementation of Multi-Party Encryption and Multi-Party
    Key Generation used in the Mesh. [Note to Readers] Discussion of this draft takes
    place on the MATHMESH mailing list (mathmesh@ietf.org), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=mathmesh.
    This document is also available online at http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-mesh-
