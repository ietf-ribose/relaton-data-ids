abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a profile of the QUIC protocol and the HTTP/3
    mapping that facilitates the transfer of HTTP resources over multicast IP using
    the QUIC transport as its framing and packetisation layer. Compatibility with
    the QUIC protocol's syntax and semantics is maintained as far as practical and
    additional features are specified where this is not possible.</p>"
