abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document records a format whereby a network operator can
    publish\n   a mapping of IP address prefixes to simplified geolocation\n   information,
    colloquially termed a geolocation \"feed\".  Interested\n   parties can poll and
    parse these feeds to update or merge with other\n   geolocation data sources and
    procedures.  This format intentionally\n   only allows specifying coarse level
    location.\n\n   Some technical organizations operating networks that move from
    one\n   conference location to the next have already experimentally published\n
    \  small geolocation feeds.\n\n   This document describes a currently deployed
    format.  At least one\n   consumer (Google) has incorporated these feeds into
    a geolocation\n   data pipeline, and a significant number of ISPs are using it
    to\n   inform them where their prefixes should be geolocated.\n\n   [RFC Ed -
    Please remove publication: The IETF Meeting network\n   currently publishes a
    feed in this format at:\n   https://noc.ietf.org/geo/google.csv -- this has significantly
    cut\n   down on the number of \"Gah!  Why does the network believe I'm in\n   Montreal,
    that was last meeting!  How am I supposed to find a pub?!\"\n   complaints.  A
    number of other meeting networks, including RIPE and\n   ICANN publish this information
    as well, see below. ]\n\n   [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional
    background\n   information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings,\n
    \  etc.  They will be removed before publication.]\n\n   [ This document is being
    collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/google/self-published-geo
    . The most recent\n   version of the document, open issues, etc should all be
    available\n   here.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]\n\n\t </p>\n
