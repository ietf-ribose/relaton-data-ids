abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are facing problems wherecongestion
    prevents full utilization of the path between sender andreceiver at today's \"broadband\"
    speeds. ISPs desire to control thecongestion, which often appears to be caused
    by a small number ofusers consuming a large amount of bandwidth. Building out
    morecapacity along all of the path to handle this congestion can beexpensive;
    and network operators have sought other ways to managecongestion. The current
    mechanisms all suffer from difficultymeasuring the congestion (as distinguished
    from the total traffic).The ConEx Working Group is designing a mechanism to make
    congestionalong any path visible at the Internet Layer. This documentdiscusses
    this mechanism.</p>"
