abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo describes a SMIv2 MIB module for a device implementingbridging
    functions with Quality-of-Service mechanisms similar to thosedescribed for the
    Differentiated Services Architecture [DSARCH] whichare described in detail by
    the Differentiated Services Router ConceptualModel [MODEL]. A MIB module for routers,
    the Diffserv MIB [DSMIB], hasbeen developed that uses this model. The MIB module
    defined in this memois designed to work in conjunction with that module: it defines
    usagefor objects in that module and defines some new objects specific to MAC-layer
    bridges (a.k.a. Layer-2 switches). Specifically, if defineslayer-2 classifier
    and packet marking functionality.</p>"
