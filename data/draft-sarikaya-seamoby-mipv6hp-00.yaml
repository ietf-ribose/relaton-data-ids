abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical Paging
    (HMIPv6HP), an IP host alerting protocol which is an extension to Hierarchical
    Mobile IPv6. The extension allows a mobile node to enter a power saving dormant
    mode during which its location is known with coarse accuracy defined by a paging
    area. In the visited domain only the paging mobility anchor point (PMAP) is responsible
    for keeping the binding cache entries for dormant mobile nodes and, it re- establishes
    the downlink routes on demand by means of paging. Paging is initiated by the paging
    agent (PA) and the access routers in paging areas and does not involve periodic
    layer 3 messages to be sent except for time-slot based paging which is optional
    and is to be used on links with no support for layer 2 paging. The protocol works
    with layer 2 paging areas if they are supported.</p>"
