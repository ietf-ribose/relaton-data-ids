abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes the general problem of encrypting the
    Server\n   Name Identification (SNI) TLS parameter.  The proposed solutions hide\n
    \  a Hidden Service behind a fronting service, only disclosing the SNI\n   of
    the fronting service to external observers.  The draft lists known\n   attacks
    against SNI encryption, discusses the current \"co-tenancy\n   fronting\" solution,
    and presents requirements for future TLS layer\n   solutions.\n\n   In practice,
    it may well be that no solution can meet every\n   requirement, and that practical
    solutions will have to make some\n   compromises.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
