abstract:
- content: "<p>The Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) Network Programming framework
    enables a network operator or an application to specify a packet processing program
    by encoding a sequence of instructions in the IPv6 packet header. Each instruction
    is implemented on one or several nodes in the network and identified by an SRv6
    Segment Identifier in the packet. This document defines the SRv6 Network Programming
    concept and specifies the base set of SRv6 behaviors that enables the creation
    of interoperable overlays with underlay optimization.</p>"
