abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes the Data reAchaBility BasEd Routing (DABBER)\n
    \  protocol.  DABBER aims to provide a name-based routing solution to\n   support
    the operation of Information-centric Networking frameworks in\n   opportunistic
    wireless networks.  By \"opportunistic wireless\n   networks\" it is meant multi-hop
    wireless networks where finding an\n   end-to-end path between any pair of nodes
    at any moment in time may\n   be a challenge.  The goal is to assist in better
    defining\n   opportunities for the transmission of Interest packets in a store-\n
    \  carry-and-forward manner, based on a proactive approach.  The\n   document
    describes how to integrate DABBER in a networking node that\n   implements some
    ICN approach, such as Named-Data Networking (NDN) or\n   Content Centric Networking
    (CCN), along with the specification of the\n   proactive approach based on the
    dissemination of name-prefix\n   information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
