abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document gives a brief comparison of DECADE and CDNi,
    two\n   working groups on content delivery.  CDNi aims at overcoming the\n   limited
    resource and footprints of a single CDN by interconnecting\n   multiple CDNs.
    \ While DECADE is mainly concerned with reducing the\n   last-mile bandwidth bottleneck
    and inter-domain traffics with in-\n   network storage.  This in-network storage
    can also be utilized by\n   Content Service Providers (CSPs) as a CDN, whose footprints
    be across\n   multiple Internet Service Providers (CSPs).  In this sense, DECADE\n
    \  can also be a possible approach to overcome the limited footprints of\n   a
    single CDN.  This document attempts to gain some understanding on\n   the relationship
    of these two solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
