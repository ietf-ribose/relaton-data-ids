abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Current password storage methods predominantly use cryptographic
    hash\n   functions in order to avoid storing users' passwords in clear text.\n
    \  Unfortunately, recent advancements in hardware design (notably GPUs)\n   allow
    an attacker to try millions or even billions of password\n   guesses per second
    which makes \"decryption\" of simple passwords\n   feasible in short amounts of
    time.\n\n   This document describes a password storage scheme that incorporates\n
    \  public key encryption in order to slow down password verification.\n   Since
    public key algorithms are several orders of magnitude slower\n   than hash functions,
    the result makes it much harder for an attacker\n   to discover users' passwords
    from the stored, encrypted format.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
