abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Two Dimensional IP (TwoD-IP) routing, a new
    Internet routing architecture which makes forwarding decisions based on both source
    address and destination address. This presents a fundamental extension from the
    current Internet, which makes forwarding decisions based on the destination address,
    and provides shortest single-path routing towards destination. Such extension
    provides rooms to solve fundamental problems of the past and foster great innovations
    in the future. We present the TwoD-IP routing framework and its two underpinning
    schemes. The first is a new hardware-based forwarding table structure for TwoD-IP,
    FIST, which achieves line-speed lookup with acceptable storage space. The second
    is a policy routing protocol that flexibly diverts traffic.</p>"
