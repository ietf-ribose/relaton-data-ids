abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS SRV RRs of a domain implicitly specify servers and port numbers
    corresponding to the domain. By combining URLs and SRV RRs, no port numbers have
    to be specified explicitly in URLs, even if non-default port numbers are used,
    which makes URLs more concise for port based virtual and real hosting, where port
    based real hosting means that multiple servers sharing an IP address are distinguished
    by port numbers to give service for different URLs, which is the case for port
    forwarded servers behind NAT and servers with realm specific IP.</p>"
