abstract:
- content: "<p>Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) permits an organization which is
    creating or handling email to indicate its involvement with the handling process.
    It defines a set of cryptographically signed header fields in a manner analagous
    to that of DKIM. Assertion of responsibility is validated through a cryptographic
    signature and by querying the Signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate
    public key. Changes in the message that might break DKIM can be identified through
    the ARC set of header fields.</p>"
