abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A load balancer that does not terminate TLS may wish to provide
    some\n   information to the backend server, in addition to forwarding TLS\n   data.
    \ This draft proposes a protocol between load balancers and\n   backends that
    enables secure, efficient delivery of TLS with\n   additional information.  The
    need for such a protocol has recently\n   become apparent in the context of split
    mode ESNI.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
