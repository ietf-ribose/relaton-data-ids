abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A method is described by which a Device is able to provide
    location-\n   related measurement data to a LIS within a request for location\n
    \  information.  Location-related measurement information are\n   observations
    concerning properties related to the position of a\n   Device, which could be
    data about network attachment or about the\n   physical environment.  When a LIS
    generates location information for\n   a Device, information from the Device can
    improve the accuracy of the\n   location estimate.  A basic set of location-related
    measurements are\n   defined, including common modes of network attachment as
    well as\n   assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
