abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. A node steers
    a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called "segments". A segment
    can represent topological or service based instructions. A segment can further
    be associated with a set of network resources used for executing the instruction.
    Such a segment is called resource-aware segment. Resource-aware Segment Identifiers
    (SIDs) may be used to build SR paths with a set of reserved network resources.
    In addition, a group of resource-aware SIDs may be used to build SR based virtual
    underlay networks, which have customized network topology and resource attributes
    required by one or a group of customers and/or services. Such virtual networks
    are the SR instantiations of Virtual Transport Networks (VTNs). This document
    describes a suggested use of resource-aware SIDs to build SR based VTNs.</p>
