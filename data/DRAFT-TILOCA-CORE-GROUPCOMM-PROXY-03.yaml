abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operations performed by a forward-proxy\n
    \  or reverse-proxy, when using the Constrained Application Protocol\n   (CoAP)
    in group communication scenarios.  Such CoAP proxy processes a\n   single request,
    sent by a CoAP client over unicast, and distributes\n   the request over IP multicast
    to a group of CoAP servers.  It then\n   collects the individual responses from
    these CoAP servers and sends\n   these responses to the CoAP client such that
    the client is able to\n   distinguish the responses and their origin servers through
    addressing\n   information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
