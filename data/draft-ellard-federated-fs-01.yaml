abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes and lists the functional requirements of a federated
    file system and defines related terms. Our intent is to use this draft as a starting
    point and refine it, with input and feedback from the file system community and
    other interested parties, until we reach general agreement. We will then begin,
    again with the help of any interested parties, to define standard, open federated
    file system protocols that satisfy these requirements and are suitable for implementation
    and deployment.</p>"
