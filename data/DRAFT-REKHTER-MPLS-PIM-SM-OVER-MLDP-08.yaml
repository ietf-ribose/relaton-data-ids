abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When IP multicast trees created by PIM-SM in Any Source Multicast\n
    \  (ASM) mode need to pass through an MPLS domain, it may be desirable\n   to
    map such trees to Point-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths. This\n   document
    describes how to accomplish this in the case where such\n   Point-to-Multipoint
    Label Switched Paths are established using mLDP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
