abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The residential gateway is a device that has become an integral
    part\nof home networking equipment.  Discovering a Location Information\nServer
    (LIS) is a necessary part of acquiring location information\nfor location-based
    services.  However, discovering a LIS when a\nresidential gateway is present poses
    a configuration challenge,\nrequiring a method that is able to work around the
    obstacle presented\nby the gateway.\n\nThis document describes a solution to this
    problem.  The solution\nprovides alternative domain names as input to the LIS
    discovery\nprocess based on the network addresses assigned to a Device.\n\t </p>\n
