abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For a client to access a particular resource on the Web, a
    server\n   must expend a certain amount of computational effort to respond to\n
    \  the request.  In some cases this computational effort is sizeable and\n   the
    server may want to only respond to certain clients.  For example,\n   in a distributed
    denial-of-service attack, a server may require all\n   clients to expend a certain
    amount of resources via a client-run\n   proof-of-work algorithm to throttle the
    number of incoming requests\n   to a more manageable number.  This document details
    a new\n   authentication scheme for HTTP that may be used to request and\n   transmit
    proofs in HTTP headers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
