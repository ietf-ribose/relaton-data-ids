abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes how to declare in a JSON Web Token (JWT)
    that the presenter of the JWT possesses a particular proof-of- possession key
    and how the recipient can cryptographically confirm proof of possession of the
    key by the presenter. Being able to prove possession of a key is also sometimes
    described as the presenter being a holder-of-key.</p>"
