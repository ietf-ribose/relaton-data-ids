abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document we collected requirements for TLP evolution.
    These\n   requirements are the consequence of removing obstacles of TLP\n   evolution.
    This results in a higher variety of expected TLP\n   implementations and lower
    trust level in these. Confidentiality of\n   communication and security is more
    and more important. Middleboxes\n   which today are one of the obstacles of the
    evolution shall be taken\n   into account and incentivized to cooperate in the
    future landscape.\n   Resulting from the requirements we propose areas for further\n
    \  investigation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
