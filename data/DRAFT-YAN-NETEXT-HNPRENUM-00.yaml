abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), the Mobile Node
    (MN) is\n       assigned a 64-bit Home Network Prefix (HNP) during the initial\n
    \      attachment for the Home Address (HoA) configuration. During the\n       movements
    of MN, this prefix is unchanged and then it's unnecessary\n       for the MN to
    reconfigure the HoA. In this way, the handover is\n       transparent at the IP
    and above layers of the MN. However, the\n       current protocol does not specify
    the related operation to support\n       the MN to timely receive the new HNP
    and configure the new HoA when\n       its allocated HNP changes. In this draft,
    this problem is discussed\n       and a possible solution is proposed based on
    some simple extensions\n       of the basic PMIPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
