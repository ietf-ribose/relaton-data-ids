abstract:
- content: "<p>The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) defined in
    this document provides the mechanisms to create, change and delete objects related
    to centralized conferences, including participants, their media and their roles.
    The protocol relies on web services and SIP event notification as its infrastructure,
    but can control conferences that use any signaling protocol to invite users. CCMP
    is based on the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), with the data necessary
    for the interactions specified via Web Services Description Language (WSDL).</p>"
