abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document summarizes the data model designed at the IETF
    99\n   Hackathon and is intended to grow in to a definition of general XML\n   SACM
    statements (and later JSON and CBOR, respectively) for virtually\n   every kind
    of Content Element (e.g. software identifiers, assessment\n   guidance/results,
    ECA Policy rules, VDD, etc.).  The SACM Statement\n   data structure is based
    on the Information Element (IE) definitions\n   provided by the SACM Information
    Model.  The initial Content Element\n   type transferred are YANG Subscribed Notification
    acquired via YANG\n   push.  In combination with the Origin Metadata Annotation
    defined in\n   draft-ietf-netmod-revised-datastores the data model defined in
    this\n   document will ultimately be able to express collected endpoint\n   characteristics,
    imperative guidance that define and orchestrate\n   assessment instructions, and
    also the declarative guidance for\n   endpoint attributes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
