abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the subject of numerous\n
    \  specifications that have been produced by the IETF.  It can be\n   difficult
    to locate the right document, or even to determine the set\n   of Request for
    Comments (RFC) about SIP.  Don't Panic!  This\n   specification serves as a guide
    to the SIP RFC series.  It lists the\n   specifications under the SIP umbrella,
    briefly summarizes each, and\n   groups them into categories.\n\t </p>\n      "
