abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the mechanism of wVegas (weighted Vegas),\n
    \  which is a delay-based congestion control for MPTCP. The current\n   congestion
    control algorithm of MPTCP, LIA, achieves only course-\n   grained load balancing,
    since it is based on packet loss event. On\n   the contrary, wVegas adopts packet
    queuing delay as congestion\n   signals, thus achieving fine-grained load balancing.
    Compared with\n   loss-based algorithms, wVegas is more sensitive to the changes
    of\n   network congestion and thus achieves more timely traffic shifting and\n
    \  quicker convergence. WVegas has been implemented in the Linux Kernel\n   and
    is part of the UCLouvain's MPTCP implementation now.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
