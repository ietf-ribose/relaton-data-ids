abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a rate adaptation algorithm for conversational\n
    \  media services such as video.  The solution conforms to the packet\n   conservation
    principle and uses a hybrid loss and delay based\n   congestion control algorithm.
    \ The algorithm is evaluated over both\n   simulated Internet bottleneck scenarios
    as well as in a Long Term\n   Evolution (LTE) system simulator and is shown to
    achieve both low\n   latency and high video throughput in these scenarios.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
