abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document defines a new BGP SAFI with a new NLRI in order
    to\n   advertise a SD-WAN edge node's capabilities in establishing SD-WAN\n   overlay
    tunnels with other SD-WAN nodes through third party\n   untrusted networks. The
    goal is for SD-WAN network to scale,\n   enabling SD-WAN overlay tunnels among
    large number of SD-WAN nodes\n   to be established with few provisioning needed,
    and allow services\n   to be carried by different SD-WAN tunnels based on user
    specified\n   criteria.\n\n   A \"SD-WAN\" tunnel refers to a point-to-point IPsec
    overlay path\n   between two end-points that can aggregate multiple different
    types\n   of underlay networks. An \"end-point\" is referring to a port on a SD-\n
    \  WAN node throughout this document.\n\n   This document specifies new sub-TLVs
    for the SD-WAN Tunnel\n   Encapsulation Attribute.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
