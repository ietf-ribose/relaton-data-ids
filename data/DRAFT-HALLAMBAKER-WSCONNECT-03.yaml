abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   JSON Service Connect (JCX) is a JSON/REST Web Service that
    may be\n   used to establish and maintain a 'connection binding' of a device to\n
    \  an account held with a Web Service Provider.  Multiple connection\n   bindings
    may be established under the same account to support\n   multiple devices and/or
    multiple users of a single device.  A\n   connection binding permits a device
    to securely connect to one or\n   more services offered by the Web Service Provider
    with support for\n   protocol and protocol version agilty and fault tollerance.\n\n
    \  The protocol is presented as a HTTP/JSON Web Service and uses the\n   HTTP
    session continuation mechanism for authentication of transaction\n   messages
    and supports negotiation of a HTTP session continuation\n   mechanism context
    for the established endpoint connections.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
