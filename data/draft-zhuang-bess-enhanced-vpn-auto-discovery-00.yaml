abstract:
- content: "<p>All kinds of VPN technologies have been widely deployed to bear different
    services. As new applications develop, there proposes the requirement of auto-discovery
    of Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN) and enhanced auto-discovery requirements
    for other VPN technologies which already have the auto-discovery mechanisms. This
    document identifies the possible applications and these auto- discovery requirements.
    Accordingly this document defines a new BGP NLRI, called the BGP-VPN-INSTANCE
    NLRI to satisfy the requirement of auto-discovery of BGP VPN instance and a new
    type of the extended community, called the Import Route Target which can be applied
    for auto-discovery mechanisms of multiple VPN technologies.</p>"
