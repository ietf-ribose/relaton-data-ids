abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the core concepts of the Content Centric\n
    \  Networking (CCNx) architecture and presents a network protocol based\n   on
    two messages: Interests and Content Objects.  It specifies the set\n   of mandatory
    and optional fields within those messages and describes\n   their behavior and
    interpretation.  This architecture and protocol\n   specification is independent
    of a specific wire encoding.\n\n   The protocol also uses a Control message called
    an InterestReturn,\n   whereby one system can return an Interest message to the
    previous hop\n   due to an error condition.  This indicates to the previous hop
    that\n   the current system will not respond to the Interest.\n\n   This document
    is a product of the Information Centric Networking\n   research group (ICNRG).\n\n\t
