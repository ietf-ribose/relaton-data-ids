abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Appendix A of the IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) document
    in\n   RFC 4862 discusses Loopback Suppression and DAD.  However, RFC 4862\n   does
    not settle on one specific automated means to detect loopback of\n   Neighbor
    Discovery (ND of RFC 4861) messages used by DAD.  Several\n   service provider
    communities have expressed a need for automated\n   detection of looped backed
    ND messages used by DAD.  This document\n   includes mitigation techniques and
    then outlines the Enhanced DAD\n   algorithm to automate detection of looped back
    IPv6 ND messages used\n   by DAD.  For network loopback tests, the Enhanced DAD
    algorithm\n   allows IPv6 to self-heal after a loopback is placed and removed.\n
    \  Further, for certain access networks the document automates resolving\n   a
    specific duplicate address conflict.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
