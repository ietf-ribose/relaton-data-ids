abstract:
- content: "<p>The Universally Unique Identifier is a suitable standard for, as the
    name suggests, uniquely identifying entities in a symbol space large enough that
    the identifiers do not collide. Many formal grammars, however, are too restrictive
    to permit the use of UUIDs in their canonical representation (described in RFC
    4122 and elsewhere), despite it being useful to do so. This document specifies
    an alternative compact representation for UUIDs that preserves some properties
    of the canonical form, with three encoding varietals, to fit these more restrictive
    contexts.</p>"
