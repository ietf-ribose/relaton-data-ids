abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document formulates a plan of a phased transition to a
    state\n   where RPKI repositories and Relying Party software performing RPKI\n
    \  Validation will use the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP)\n   [RFC8182]
    as the only mandatory to implement access protocol.\n\n   The first objective
    is to make RRDP the preferred access protocol,\n   and require rsync as a fallback
    option only.  This will greatly\n   reduce the operational burden and concerns
    for RPKI repository\n   operators.\n\n   In phase 0, today's deployment, RRDP
    is supported by most, but not\n   all Repositories, and most but not all RP software.\n\n
    \  In the proposed phase 1 RRDP will become mandatory to implement for\n   Repositories,
    in addition to rsync.  This phase can start as soon as\n   this document is published.\n\n
    \  Once the proposed updates are implemented by all Repositories phase 2\n   will
    start.  In this phase RRDP will become mandatory to implement\n   for all RP software,
    and rsync will be required as a fallback option\n   only.\n\n   It should be noted
    that although this document currently includes\n   descriptions and updates to
    RFCs for each of these phases, we may\n   find that it will be beneficial to have
    one or more separate\n   documents for these phases, so that it might be more
    clear to all\n   when the updates to RFCs take effect.\n\n   Furthermore, this
    document currently includes an early discussion of\n   a future objective, which
    would be to change the RPKI standards such\n   that names in RPKI objects are
    no longer tightly coupled to rsync.\n   By using transport independent names and
    validation, we will obtain\n   the agility needed to phase out rsync altogether
    and/or introduce\n   other future access protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
