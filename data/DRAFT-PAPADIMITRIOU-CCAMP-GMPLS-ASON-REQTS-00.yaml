abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocol has been defined
    to\ncontrol different switching technologies as well as different\napplications.
    These include support for requesting TDM connections\nincluding SONET/SDH and
    Optical Transport Networks (OTNs).\nThis document concentrates on the signaling
    aspects of the GMPLS\nsuite of protocols. It identifies the features to be covered
    by the\nsignalling protocol to support the capabilities of an Automatically\nSwitched
    Optical Network (ASON). This document provides a problem\nstatement and additional
    requirements on the GMPLS signaling\nprotocol to support the ASON functionality.\n\t
