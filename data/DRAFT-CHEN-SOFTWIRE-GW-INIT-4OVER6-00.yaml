abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Gateway-Initiated 4over6 (GI-4over6) is a variant of 4over6\n
    \  mechanisms which include Public 4over6\n   ([I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6])
    and Lightweight 4over6\n   ([I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite]), and it's
    designed to\n   satisfy the certain tunnel-based access scenario.  The GI-4over6\n
    \  extends the On-Link Client Relay Agent (LCRA) that is defined in\n   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6]
    and thus makes it enabled to help\n   gateway device perform 4over6 CE function
    described in\n   [I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6], and lwB4 function described
    in\n   [I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite], while the public IPv4\n   addresses
    (and available ports) are assigned to the end hosts that\n   behind the gateway
    device.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
