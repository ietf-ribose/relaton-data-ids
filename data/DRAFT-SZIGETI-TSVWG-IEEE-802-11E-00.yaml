abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As internet traffic is increasingly sourced-from and destined-to\n
    \  wireless endpoints, it is crucial that Quality of Service be aligned\n   between
    wired and wireless networks; however, this is not always the\n   case by default.
    \ This is due to the fact that two independent\n   standards bodies provide QoS
    guidance on wired and wireless networks:\n   specifically, the IETF offers design
    recommendations for wired IP\n   networks, while a separate and autonomous standards-body,
    the IEEE,\n   administers the standards for wireless 802.11e networks.  The purpose\n
    \  of this document is to propose a set Differentiated Services Code\n   Point
    (DSCP) to IEEE 802.11e User Priority (UP) mappings to reconcile\n   the design
    recommendations offered by these two standards bodies,\n   and, as such, to optimize
    wired-and-wireless interconnect QoS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
