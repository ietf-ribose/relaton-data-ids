abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a grouping mechanism for RTP media
    streams\n   that can be used to specify relations between media streams within\n
    \  different RTP sessions as well as within a single RTP session.\n\n   This mechanism
    is used to signal the association between the RTP\n   concept of SSRC and the
    WebRTC concept of \"media stream\" / \"media\n   stream track\" using SDP signaling.\n\n
    \  This document is an input document for discussion.  It should be\n   discussed
    in the MMUSIC WG list, mmusic@ietf.org.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
