abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model that can be used for communication
    between customers and network operators to deliver agile, assured IP connectivity,
    overlay VPN service, which is also referred to as SD-WAN VPN Service. This model
    provides an abstracted view of the SD-WAN service configuration components. It
    will be up to the management system to take this model as input and use specific
    configuration models to configure the different network elements to deliver the
    service. How the configuration of network elements is done is out of scope for
    this document.</p>"
