abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent progress of the Optical Transport Network (OTN) has
    introduced\n   new signal types (i.e., ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex) and new\n
    \  Tributary Slot granularity (1.25Gbps).\n\n   Since equipments deployed prior
    to recently defined ITU-T\n   recommendations only support 2.5 Gbps Tributary
    Slot granularity and\n   ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 containers, the compatibility problem
    should be\n   considered. In addition, a Higher Order ODU (HO ODU) link may not\n
    \  support all the types of Lower Order ODU (LO ODU) signals defined by\n   the
    new OTN standard because of the limitation of the devices at the\n   two ends
    of a link. In these cases, the control plane is required to\n   run the capability
    discovering functions for the evolutive OTN.\n\n   This document describes the
    extensions to the Link Management\n   Protocol (LMP) needed to discover the capability
    of HO ODU link,\n   including the granularity of Tributary Slot to be used and
    the LO ODU\n   signal types that the link can support.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
