abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Security (DNSSEC) NSEC resource record (RR) is intended to
    be used to provide authenticated denial of existence of DNS owner names and types;
    however, it also permits any user to obtain a listing of all DNS owner names in
    a zone. This can accomplished via successive DNS queries for all NSEC RRs in that
    zone.</p>"
