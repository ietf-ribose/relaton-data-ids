abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Routing Bridges (RBridges) implement the TRansparent Interconnection\n
    \  of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol which provide a transparent least-\n   cost
    frame routing in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies,\n   while also
    inherently providing loop mitigation.  As RBridges are\n   deployed in real-world
    situations, operators will need tools for\n   debugging problems that arise.  This
    document specifies a set of\n   RBridge features for operations, administration,
    and maintenance\n   (OAM) purposes in RBridge campuses.  The features specified
    in this\n   document include tools for traceroute, ping, and error reporting.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
