abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes an information exchange protocol which enables
    IP nodes (hosts or routers) to associate various kinds of 'flow' with 'datalink
    connections'.  By performing such an information exchange between adjacent nodes,
    some of functions performed in the routers (e.g., classification of datagrams
    with regard to output interface and/or requesting service class) would be able
    to be carried out without (or before) analyzing each datagram but by referring
    to a datalink connection ID which conveys the datagram. This facilitates the routers
    to provide high-throughput and QoS-supported services much more efficiently.\n\t
