abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Portions of the radio spectrum that are assigned to a particular
    use\n   but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are\n   defined
    as \"white space.\"  The concept of allowing additional\n   transmissions (which
    may or may not be licensed) in white space is a\n   technique to \"unlock\" existing
    spectrum for new use.  This document\n   includes the problem statement for the
    development of a protocol to\n   access a database of whitespace information followed
    by use cases and\n   requirements for that protocol.  Finally, requirements associated\n
    \  with the protocol are presented.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
