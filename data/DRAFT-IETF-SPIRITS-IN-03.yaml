abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes INAP parameters (IN information and its
    encoding) which the SPIRITS protocol can transport from the PSTN into the IP network.
    \ \nThe SPIRITS protocol is a protocol through which PSTN can request actions
    (services) to be carried out in the IP network in response to events occurring
    within the PSTN/IN. These services include, but are not limited to: Incoming Call
    Notification (Internet Call Waiting), Internet Caller-Id Delivery, and Internet
    Call Forwarding ('Follow Me').  \nThis draft outlines, what INAP parameters are
    of immediate interest \nto SPIRITS, how they may be extracted and encoded for
    use within \nthe SPIRITS domain.  INAP is used as an example protocol to  \nclarify
    the SPIRITS message encoding process.  \nThis Internet-Draft has been written
    in response to the SPIRITS WG Chairs' call for SPIRITS Protocol proposals.  It
    may be viewed as being a direct contribution to the Informational RFC on the SPIRITS
    protocol parameters.  \nAmong other contributions, this I-D is based on:  \no
    Informational RFC2995, 'Pre-SPIRITS implementations' \no SPIRITS Architecture,
    presented in draft-ietf-spirits-architecture-02, \nRFC 3136 \no SPIRITS Protocol
    Requirements, presented in draft-ietf-spirits-reqs-04, current candidate for Informational
    RFC.  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
