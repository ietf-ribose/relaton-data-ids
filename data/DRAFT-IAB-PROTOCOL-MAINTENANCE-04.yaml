abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The robustness principle, often phrased as \"be conservative
    in what\n   you send, and liberal in what you accept\", has long guided the design\n
    \  and implementation of Internet protocols.  The posture this statement\n   advocates
    promotes interoperability in the short term, but can\n   negatively affect the
    protocol ecosystem over time.  For a protocol\n   that is actively maintained,
    the robustness principle can, and\n   should, be avoided.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
