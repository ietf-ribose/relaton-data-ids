abstract:
- content: "<p>Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is a suite of protocol
    extensions to MPLS to make it generally applicable, to include, for example, control
    of non packet-based switching, and particularly, optical switching. One consideration
    is to use GMPLS protocols to upgrade the control plane of optical transport networks.
    This document illustrates this process by describing those extensions to GMPLS
    protocols that are aimed at controlling Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) or
    Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) networks. SDH/SONET networks make good
    examples of this process for a variety of reasons. This document highlights extensions
    to GMPLS-related routing protocols to disseminate information needed in transport
    path computation and network operations, together with (G)MPLS protocol extensions
    required for the provisioning of transport circuits. New capabilities that an
    GMPLS control plane would bring to SDH/SONET networks, such as new restoration
    methods and multi-layer circuit establishment, are also discussed. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
