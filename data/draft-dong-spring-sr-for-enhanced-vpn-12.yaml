abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. A node steers
    a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called "segments". A segment
    can represent topological or service based instructions. A segment can further
    be associated with network resources allocated for executing the instruction.
    Such a segment is called resource-aware SID. Resource-aware SIDs may be used to
    build SR paths with a set of reserved network resources. In addition, resource-aware
    SIDs may be used to build SR based virtual underlay networks, which can provide
    the customized network topology and resource attributes required by different
    customers and/or services. Such virtual networks are called SR based Virtual Transport
    Networks (VTNs). The SR based VTNs can be used as the underlay network to enable
    services with required topology and resource characteristics. This document describes
    a suggested use of resource-aware SIDs to build SR based VTNs.</p>
