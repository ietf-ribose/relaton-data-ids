abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft proposes a new mechanism for multipoint-to-multipoint(mp2mp)
    communication in IP networks, namely Connectionless Multicast(CLM). Instead of
    a group address, a list of member addresses isencoded in the data packets.The
    traditional Host Group Model [DEER] for IP multicast requires aglobally unique
    address for each session. To support this model,multicast routing protocols create
    state per group in the routers.Like any connection oriented protocol, it suffers
    from scalabilityproblems in backbone networks where the number of groups to bemaintained
    can be huge. CLM does not have this problem, andadditionally has some other advantages.
    Its limitation lies in thenumber of members per multicast session, not in the
    number ofsessions. CLM will not replace the traditional multicast model. CLMoffers
    an alternative for mp2mp communication in the cases thattraditional multicast
    becomes problematic.The pros and cons of CLM are described and suggestions are
    made toalleviate the disadvantages. Furthermore different modes ofoperation are
    described: an end-to-end mode in close conjunction withSIP (Session Initiation
    Protocol [HAND]), as well as an interworkingmode with PIM-SM and Simple Multicast.
    Both IPv4 and IPv6 areconsidered.</p>"
