abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a timing model for Deterministic Networking
    (DetNet), so that existing and future standards can achieve the DetNet quality
    of service features of bounded latency and zero congestion loss. It defines requirements
    for resource reservation protocols or servers. It calls out queuing mechanisms,
    defined in other documents, that can provide the DetNet quality of service.</p>"
