- content: "<p>In the not too distant future, signals carried between two endpoints
    will be transmitted in an all-optical domain over a multi-hop path. Such transparent
    networks consist of photonic switches, optical add/drop multiplexers, optical
    amplifiers, optical regenerators, and fiber.</p>"
