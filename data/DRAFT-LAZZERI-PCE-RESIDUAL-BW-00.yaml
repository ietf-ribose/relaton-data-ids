abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     The ability of a hierarchy of PCEs to compute accurate end-to-end\n
    \  paths across multiple domains is recognized as an important\n   requirement
    in many applications.\n      This document describes extensions to the PCE Communication\n
    \  Protocol (PCEP) in order to provide new path-related bandwidth\n   metrics,
    which a PCC, like a H-PCE (either stateful or stateless),\n   can use from an
    erstwhile path computation to deploy multiple LSPs\n   (having the same end-points
    and constraints) without additional\n   requests, until either the remaining bandwidth
    along that path is\n   all allocated or a deployment fails.\n      This information
    would also be beneficial for implementing\n   abstractions of the domain topology,
    building the abstract\n   connectivity incrementally, based only on really used
    constraints,\n   as soon as path computation results are returned.\n\n\t </p>\n
