abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol
    (EAP) \nmechanism for authorization information exchange. EAP TLV is a \nContainer
    type for EAP messages. This mechanism describes an EAP TLV \nfor exchange of authorization
    related information which can take \nplace within the EAP framework and allows
    an authentic user to \nprovide the network with additional information in order
    to \ndetermine which Internet Service is being requested.  This mechanism \nmay
    be chained after any EAP-Authentication mechanism.\n\t </p>\n      "
