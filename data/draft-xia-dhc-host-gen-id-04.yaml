abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a procedure for configuring hosts' IPv6 address
    which the prefix is assigned from a DHCPv6 server through DHCPv6 protocol while
    the interface identifiers are independently generated by the hosts. The method
    is applicable to Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA), and other host-generated
    IPv6 addresses.</p>"
