abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With more and more enterprises using cloud based services,
    the\n   distances between the user and the applications are growing.  For\n   multiple
    applications such as High Performance Computing and\n   Electronic Financial markets,
    the response times are critical as is\n   packet loss, while other applications
    require more throughput.  For\n   example, financial or trading companies are
    very focused on end-to-\n   end private pipe line delay optimizations that improve
    things 2-3 ms.\n   Delay, jitter, loss and SLA (Service Level Agreement) are key\n
    \  parameters that these \"high value\" customers use to select a private\n   pipe
    line provider.  This document extends RSVP-TE protocol to\n   promote SLA experince
    of delay and packet loss application.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
