abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Pairing-based cryptography, a subfield of elliptic curve\n
    \  cryptography, has received attention due to its flexible and\n   practical
    functionality.  Pairings are special maps defined using\n   elliptic curves and
    it can be applied to construct several\n   cryptographic protocols such as identity-based
    encryption, attribute-\n   based encryption, and so on.  At CRYPTO 2016, Kim and
    Barbulescu\n   proposed an efficient number field sieve algorithm named exTNFS
    for\n   the discrete logarithm problem in a finite field.  Several types of\n
    \  pairing-friendly curves such as Barreto-Naehrig curves are affected\n   by
    the attack.  In particular, a Barreto-Naehrig curve with a 254-bit\n   characteristic
    was adopted by a lot of cryptographic libraries as a\n   parameter of 128-bit
    security, however, it ensures no more than the\n   100-bit security level due
    to the effect of the attack.  In this\n   memo, we list the security levels of
    certain pairing-friendly curves,\n   and motivate our choices of curves.  First,
    we summarize the adoption\n   status of pairing-friendly curves in standards,
    libraries and\n   applications, and classify them in the 128-bit, 192-bit, and
    256-bit\n   security levels.  Then, from the viewpoints of \"security\" and \"widely\n
    \  used\", we select the recommended pairing-friendly curves considering\n   exTNFS.\n\n\t
