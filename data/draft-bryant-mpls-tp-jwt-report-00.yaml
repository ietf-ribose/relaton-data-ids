abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC archives the report of the IETF - ITU-T Joint Working Team
    (JWT) on the application of MPLS to transport networks. The JWT recommended of
    Option 1: The IETF and the ITU-T jointly agree to work together and bring transport
    requirements into the IETF and extend IETF MPLS forwarding, OAM (Operations, Administration,
    and Management), survivability, network management and control plane protocols
    to meet those requirements through the IETF Standards Process. This RFC is available
    in ASCII (which contains a summary of the slides) and in PDF (which contains the
    summary and a copy of the slides). This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
