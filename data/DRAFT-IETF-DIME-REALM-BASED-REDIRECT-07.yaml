abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Diameter protocol allows a Diameter redirect agent to specify
    one\n   or more individual hosts to which a Diameter message may be\n   redirected
    by an upstream Diameter node.  However, in some\n   circumstances an operator
    may wish to redirect messages to an\n   alternate domain without specifying individual
    hosts.  This document\n   specifies a mechanism by which this can be achieved.
    \ New\n   applications may incorporate this capability by reference to the\n   present
    document.\n\n   This memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC6733 with respect
    to\n   the usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time\n   AVPs.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
