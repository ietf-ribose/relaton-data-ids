abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft specifies a configuration workflow to enable enterprise\n
    \  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks to solicit the capability\n   set
    of a SIP service provider network.  The capability set can\n   subsequently be
    used to configure features and services on the\n   enterprise edge element, such
    as a Session Border Controller (SBC),\n   to ensure smooth peering between enterprise
    and service provider\n   networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
