abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) association signaling
    can be\n   used to bind two unidirectional LSPs into an associated bidirectional\n
    \  LSP.  When an associated bidirectional LSP is co-routed, the reverse\n   LSP
    follows the same path as its forward LSP.  This document\n   describes Fast Reroute
    (FRR) procedures for both single-sided and\n   double-sided provisioned associated
    bidirectional LSPs.  The FRR\n   procedures are applicable to co-routed and non
    co-routed LSPs.  For\n   co-routed LSPs, the FRR procedures can ensure that traffic
    flows on\n   co-routed paths in the forward and reverse directions after a failure\n
    \  event.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
