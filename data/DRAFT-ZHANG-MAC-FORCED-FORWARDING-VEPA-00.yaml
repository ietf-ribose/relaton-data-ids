abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MAC Forced Forwarding discards ARPing messages exchanged within
    a\n   Customer Premises Network (CPN). When Virtual Ethernet Port\n   Aggregator
    (VEPA) is deployed in the CPN, this kind of discarding may\n   cause a connectivity
    problem.\n\n   This document analyzes the cause of this connectivity problem and\n
    \  suggests interfaces should be classified to avoid the this problem.\n\n\t </p>\n
