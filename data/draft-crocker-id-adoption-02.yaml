abstract:
- content: <p>The productive output of IETF working groups is documents, as mandated
    by the working group's charter. When a working group is ready to develop a particular
    document it usually "adopts" it as a working group draft. The document that a
    working group adopts and then develops further is based on initial input at varying
    levels of maturity. An initial working group draft might be a document already
    in wide use, or it might be a blank sheet, wholly created by the working group,
    or it might represent any level of maturity in between. This document discusses
    the process of creating formal working group drafts that are targeted for publication.</p>
