abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes our experiences from designing and implementing
    a large-scale local area network management system using mainly NETCONF. We designed
    the data models for device configurations and implemented NETCONF client to centrally
    control multiple devices of various vendors. The document provides insight on
    strong and weak points of current NETCONF approach. The document also makes some
    recommendations about NETCONF and future network management protocols.</p>"
