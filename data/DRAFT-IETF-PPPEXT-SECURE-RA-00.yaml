abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>L2TP protocol is a virtual extension of PPP across IP network\ninfrastructure.
    L2TP makes possible for an access concentrator(LAC)\nto be near remote clients,
    while allowing PPP termination server\n(LNS) to be located in enterprise premises.
    L2TP allows an\nenterprise to retain control of RADIUS data base, which is used\nto
    control Authentication, Authorization and Accountability (AAA)\nof dial-in users.
    The objective of this document is to extend\nsecurity characteristics of IPsec
    to remote access users, as they\ndial-in through the Internet. This is accomplished
    without creating \nnew protocols and using the existing practices of Remote Access
    and\nIPsec. Specifically, the document proposes three new RADIUS \nparameters
    for use by the LNS node, acting as Secure Remote Access \nServer (SRAS) to mandate
    network level security between remote \nclients and the enterprise. The document
    also discusses limitations \nof the approach.\n\t </p>\n      "
