abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a methodology for measuring sustained TCP throughput
    performance in an end-to-end managed network environment. This memo is intended
    to provide a practical approach to help users validate the TCP layer performance
    of a managed network, which should provide a better indication of end-user application
    level experience. In the methodology, various TCP and network parameters are identified
    that should be tested as part of the network verification at the TCP layer.</p>"
