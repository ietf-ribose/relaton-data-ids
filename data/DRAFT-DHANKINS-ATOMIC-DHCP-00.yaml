abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Most protocol developers ask themselves if a protocol will
    work, or\n   work efficiently.  These are important questions, but another less\n
    \  frequently considered is wether the proposed protocol changes present\n   themselves
    barriers to adoption by deployed software (more\n   importantly, needlessly so).\n\n
    \  This document seeks to provide information on the challenges to DHCP\n   Option
    software implementers, and in doing so to provide guidance to\n   prospective
    DHCP Option authors to help them produce options that are\n   easily adoptable.\n\n\t
