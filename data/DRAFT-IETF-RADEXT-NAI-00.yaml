abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to provide roaming services, it is necessary to have
    a\n   standardized method for identifying users.  This document defines the\n
    \  syntax for the Network Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity\n   submitted
    by the client during network authentication.  \"Roaming\" may\n   be loosely defined
    as the ability to use any one of multiple Internet\n   Service Providers (ISPs),
    while maintaining a formal, customer-vendor\n   relationship with only one.  Examples
    of where roaming capabilities\n   might be required include ISP \"confederations\"
    and ISP-provided\n   corporate network access support.  This document is a revised
    version\n   of RFC 4282 [RFC4282], which addresses issues with international\n
    \  character sets, as well as a number of other corrections to the\n   previous
    document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
