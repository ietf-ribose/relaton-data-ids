abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies 6rd's multicast component so that IPv6
    hosts can\n   receive multicast data from IPv6 servers.  In the 6rd encapsulation\n
    \  solution, multicast communication is completely integrated into the\n   6rd
    tunnel.  In the 6rd translation solution, the protocol is based\n   on proxying
    MLD at the 6rd Customer Edge router interworking the MLD\n   messages to IGMP
    messages and sending them upstream through a network\n   which supports IPv4 multicast.
    \ The 6rd Border Relay is a multicast\n   router and interworks the IGMP to MLD
    for onward propasgation toward\n   the IPv6 multicast source.  IPv6 Multicast
    data received at 6rd\n   Border Relay is translated into IPv4 multicast data and
    and delivered\n   through the IPv4 multicast tree downstream to the 6rd Customer
    Edge.\n   The latter translates it back to IPv6 multicast data then delivers it\n
    \  to the hosts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
