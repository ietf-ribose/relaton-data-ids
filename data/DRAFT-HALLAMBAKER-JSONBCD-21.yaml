abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Three binary encodings for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
    are\n   presented.  JSON-B (Binary) is a strict superset of the JSON encoding\n
    \  that permits efficient binary encoding of intrinsic JavaScript data\n   types.
    \ JSON-C (Compact) is a strict superset of JSON-B that supports\n   compact representation
    of repeated data strings with short numeric\n   codes.  JSON-D (Data) supports
    additional binary data types for\n   integer and floating-point representations
    for use in scientific\n   applications where conversion between binary and decimal\n
    \  representations would cause a loss of precision.\n\n   This document is also
    available online at\n   http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-jsonbcd.html.\n\n\t
