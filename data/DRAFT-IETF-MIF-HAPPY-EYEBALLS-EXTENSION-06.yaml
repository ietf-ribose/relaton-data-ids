abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently the interface selection in multi-interface environment
    is\n   exclusive - only one interface can be used at the time, frequently\n   needing
    manual intervention.  Happy Eyeballs in MIF would make the\n   selection process
    smoother by using the connectivity checks over a\n   pre-filtered interfaces according
    to defined policy.  This would\n   choose the fastest interface with an automatic
    fallback.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
