abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a framework for certificate management interactions
    between an Internet Number Resource issuer ("issuer") and an Internet Number Resource
    recipient ("subject") through the specification of a protocol for interaction
    between the two parties. The protocol supports the transmission of requests from
    the subject, and corresponding responses from the issuer encompassing the actions
    of certificate issuance, certificate revocation, and certificate status information
    reports. This protocol is intended to be limited to the application of Internet
    Number Resource Certificate management and is not intended to be used as part
    of a more general certificate management framework. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
