abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The demands on the networking infrastructure are growing\n
    \  exponentially; the drivers are bandwidth hungry rich media\n   applications,
    inter data center communications etc. In this context,\n   it is important to
    optimally use the bandwidth in the service\n   provider backbone networks which
    extensively use LAG/ECMP techniques\n   for bandwidth scaling. This internet draft
    describes the issues faced\n   in the service provider backbone in the context
    of LAG/ECMP and\n   formulates best practice recommendations for managing the
    bandwidth\n   efficiently in the service provider backbone.\n\nInternet-Draft
    \  Best Practices for Optimal LAG/ECMP Component Link\n          Utilization in
    Provider Backbone networks      September 2012\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
