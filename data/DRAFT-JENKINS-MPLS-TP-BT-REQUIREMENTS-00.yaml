abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document outlines BT's requirements for MPLS-TP features
    based\non our current thinking for how we may utilise functionality being\ndefined
    as part of the MPLS-TP standardisation effort within our\nexisting deployed MPLS
    networks.\n\nThis document is not intended to describe all future requirements
    for\nMPLS-TP features, only for those features that we have a currently\ndefined
    requirement for today and which we would like to see priority\nbe given to them
    when specifying and standardising MPLS-TP within\nIETF.  These features are required
    in order to enable us to enhance\nlive, revenue generating services.\n\t </p>\n
