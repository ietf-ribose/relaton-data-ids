abstract:
- content: <p>This memo formally defines the overall email address maximum length
    to 254 characters (octets); Relaxes local-part limitation set by RFC 821/2821/5321;
    Obsoletes domain-part limitation set by RFC 821/2821/5321; AND Uses the mechanism
    described in RFC 1869 to define an extension with keyword "EAML" to the SMTP service
    whereby an SMTP server can declare that it is capable of handling longer email
    addresses.</p>
