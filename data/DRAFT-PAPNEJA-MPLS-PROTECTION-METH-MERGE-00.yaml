abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft provides the methodology for benchmarking MPLS Protection
    \nmechanisms especially the failover time of local protection (MPLS Fast \nReroute
    as defined in RFC-4090). The failover to a backup tunnel could \nhappen at the
    headend of the primary tunnel or a midpoint and the backup \ncould offer link
    or node protection. It becomes vital to benchmark the \nfailover time for all
    the cases and combinations. The failover time \ncould also greatly differ based
    on the design and implementation and by \nfactors like the number of prefixes
    carried by the tunnel, the routing \nprotocols that installed these prefixes (IGP,
    BGP...), the number of \nprimary tunnels affected by the event that caused the
    failover, number \nof primary tunnels the backup protects and type of failure,
    the physical \nmedia  type  on  which  the  failover  occurs  etc.  All  the  required
    \nbenchmarking criteria and benchmarking topology required for measuring \nfailover
    time of local protection is described Conventions used in this \ndocument \n\t
