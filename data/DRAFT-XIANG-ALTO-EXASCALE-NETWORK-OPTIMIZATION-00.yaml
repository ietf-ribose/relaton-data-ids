abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Massive datasets continue to be acquired, simulated, processed
    and\n   analyzed by globally distributed scientific collaborations, and the\n
    \  volume of this data is growing exponentially.  These datasets need to\n   be
    exchanged through a global network infrastructure.  Applications\n   that manages
    the transfer of such massive data volumes can benefit\n   substantially from the
    utilization of network information, and more\n   directly from network-resident
    services that optimize and load\n   balance network usage among multiple transfer
    requests, and\n   coordinate the network use with the use of other resources such
    as\n   computing and storage.\n\n   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) protocol can\n   provide via extensions such network information, to both
    users and\n   proactive network management services where applicable, with the
    goal\n   of improving both application performance and network resource\n   utilization,
    leading to greater overall efficiency of the science\n   programs' workflows.\n\n
    \  This document introduces an Exascale Dataset Transfer Orchestrator\n   (EDTO),
    which is a data transfer scheduling service for exascale\n   science networks.
    \ EDTO provides simple APIs for users to submit,\n   update and delete data transfer
    requests and to monitor the status of\n   each transfer, along with local and
    global network and site state\n   information in real-time.  EDTO collects network
    information from\n   multiple ALTO services utilizing proposed topology extensions
    and\n   leverages emerging SDN control capabilities to orchestrate the\n   scheduling
    of multiple large dataset transfers, leading to improved\n   data transfer latency
    and reliability as well as more efficient\n   utilization of limited network resources.\n\n\t
