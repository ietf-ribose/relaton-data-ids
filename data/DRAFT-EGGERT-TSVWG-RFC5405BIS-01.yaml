abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing\n
    \  transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms.\n   Because congestion
    control is critical to the stable operation of the\n   Internet, applications
    and other protocols that choose to use UDP as\n   an Internet transport must employ
    mechanisms to prevent congestion\n   collapse and to establish some degree of
    fairness with concurrent\n   traffic.  They may also need to implement additional
    mechanisms,\n   depending on how they use UDP.\n\n   This document provides guidelines
    on the use of UDP for the designers\n   of applications, tunnels and other protocols
    that use UDP.\n   Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but the document\n
    \  also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes,\n   reliability,
    checksums, and middlebox traversal.\n\n   If published as an RFC, this document
    will obsolete RFC5405.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
