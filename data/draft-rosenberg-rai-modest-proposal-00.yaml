abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has become widely deployed
    onthe Internet, covering a wide range of usages from toll bypass toinstant messaging,
    from service provider to enterprise. However, itsrealization in actual deployments
    differs in important ways from thespecifications. This has created a gulf between
    existing and ongoingstandards work, and real live deployments. This document argues
    thatthe RAI area should focus on solving real world interoperabilityissues and
    address real world functional gaps.</p>"
