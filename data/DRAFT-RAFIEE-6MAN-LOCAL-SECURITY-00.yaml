abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are currently some mechanisms available to mitigate attacks
    in\n   local networks. The purpose of this document is to compare these\n   mechanisms
    and offer some recommendations regarding the\n   implementations and deployments
    of these mechanisms. Then it focuses\n   on the deployment of one of the promising
    approach in local security,\n   i.e., Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND) [RFC3971].\n\n\n\n\t
