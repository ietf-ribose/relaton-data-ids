    packages for Megaco/H.248 [2][3]. These packages define alternative signalling
    for ringing, add the capability for distinctive call waiting tones, and address
    support of functionality for enhanced telephony services, such as CLASS signaling
    services [4] and ETSI defined display services [5] [6] [7].</p>"
