abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The period of IPv4/IPv6 transisation will last for a long time.\nDifferent
    phases of IPv4/IPv6 transisation have different scenarioes\nand requirements thus
    need different solutions.  In the early stage\nof IPv4/IPv6 transisation, sicne
    the majority of the Internet\nresources locate in the IPv4 Internet, the main
    communication type of\nthe IPv4/IPv6 transition is v6 to v4 which is the IPv6
    clients iniate\ncommunication to the IPv4 servers.  At the later stage of the
    IPv4/\nIPv6 transisation, the servers may locate in the IPv6 network/\nInternet,
    in this scenario, there is a need for the legacy IPv4\nclient to iniate communication
    to the IPv6 servers.  This document\nanalyses the problems of v4 to v6 communication
    and discusses a\nsolution called PNAT-Lite.\n\t </p>\n      "
