abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies requirements for algorithms that make ICE connectivity
    checks more responsive by reducing delays in dual-stack host ICE connectivity
    checks when there is a path failure for the address family preferred by the application
    or by the operating system. As IPv6 is usually preferred, the procedures in this
    document helps avoid user-noticeable delays when the IPv6 path is broken or excessively
    slow.</p>"
