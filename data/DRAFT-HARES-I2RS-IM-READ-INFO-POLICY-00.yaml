abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Interface to the routing system (I2RS) specifies a new
    interface\n   that a client (I2RS client) can utilize to interface to the routing\n
    \  system.  Some applications that utilize the services of I2RS client\n   may
    require a specific set of data in response to network events or\n   conditions
    based on pre-established rules.  In order to reduce the\n   data flow through
    the network, the I2RS client needs to signal the\n   I2RS agent to filter some
    of the collected data or events prior to\n   transmission to the i2rs client.
    \ This functionality is necessary to\n   meet the requirements I2RS enabled services
    which include service-\n   layer routing improvements, and control of traffic
    flows and exit\n   points.\n\n   This document introduces a read-only I2RS RIB
    policy Informational\n   Model that provides filters for the reads and notifications
    from the\n   I2RS RIB Info Model (IM).  This model utilizes a generic information\n
    \  model (IM) for policy templates that is extensible and hierarchical.\n   These
    templates support the features described by the I2RS\n   architectural model.\n\n\t
