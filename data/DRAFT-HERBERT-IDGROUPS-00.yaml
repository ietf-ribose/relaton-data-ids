abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes a means to create logical identifier groups
    to\n   manage identifiers in a mapping system for identifier-locator\n   protocols.
    An identifier group consists of identifiers that have\n   similar properties in
    the context of the mapping system. Identifier\n   groups facilitate bulk operations
    on the mapping system that would\n   affect multiple identifiers. A primary use
    case for this is to\n   facilitate mobility of devices that are associated with
    possibly\n   thousands or even millions of identifiers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
