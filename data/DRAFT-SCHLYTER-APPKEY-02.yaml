abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a new DNS RR type for applications to
    store\npublic keys in.  Experience with DNSSEC has indicated that mixing DNS\nkeys
    and application keys is a bad idea in many regards.  The new RR\nexpands certain
    fields based on experience from early DNSSEC\ndeployment.\n\t </p>\n      "
