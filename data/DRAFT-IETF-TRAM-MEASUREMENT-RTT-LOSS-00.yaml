abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A host with multiple interfaces needs to choose the best interface\n
    \  for communication.  Oftentimes, this decision is based on a static\n   configuration
    and does not consider the path characteristics, which\n   may affect the user
    experience.\n\n   This document describes a mechanism for an endpoint to measure
    the\n   path characteristics fractional loss and RTT using Session Traversal\n
    \  Utilities for NAT (STUN) messages.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
