abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A means of provisioning OATH shared secret OTP parameters based
    on \nthe XKMS protocol is described. The techniques used may be extended \nto
    support XKMS registration of symmetric keys for other \ncryptographic protocols.
    It is hoped that publication of this note \nwill allow others to make use of the
    same architectural approach as a \nstarting point for future proposals. \n        \nThis
    work is a joint effort by the members of OATH (Initiative for \nOpen AuTHentication)
    to specify an algorithm that can be freely \ndistributed to the technical community.
    The authors believe that a \ncommon and shared specification will facilitate adoption
    of two-\nfactor authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability \ncommercial
    and open-source implementations. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
