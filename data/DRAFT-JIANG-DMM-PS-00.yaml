abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Due to the limitation of sub-optimal routing, reliability and\n
    \  scalability problems in the centralized mobility management approach,\n   distributed
    mobility management approaches are developed to resolve\n   those problems. However,
    the proposed distributed mobility management\n   approaches also bring some new
    problems. This document mainly\n   introduces two kinds of approaches classified
    by the control plane\n   management mode and proposes the new problems should
    be resolved in\n   the future.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
