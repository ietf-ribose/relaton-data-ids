abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a hierarchical IP addressing scheme that
    provides\n   end-to-end host connectivity across routing realms with overlapping\n
    \  address space. PAID agents are routers that connect an internal\n   private
    network to the global public Internet. The PAID agents'\n   public IP addresses
    augment the locally significant private addresses\n   to form globally unique
    binary IP addresses for private hosts. This\n   extends the IPv4 address space
    and allows Internet hosts to use\n   private instead of public IP addresses for
    global Internet\n   communication. The proposal does not need any changes to the
    current\n   routing infrastruture but requires an extension to the end hosts'\n
    \  network socket descriptors and the domain name system.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
