abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multi-Topologies (MTs) can be used for computing different
    paths for\n   unicast traffic, multicast traffic, different classes of service\n
    \  based on flexible criteria, or an in-band network management\n   topology.
    \ This document proposes the multi-topology segment for\n   segment routing.  MRT
    FRR using multi-topology segment is described\n   as the use case to explains
    the procedures of the forwarding plane\n   and the control plane for multi-topology
    segment..\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
