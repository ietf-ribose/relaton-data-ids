abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo presents a set of TCP extensions to improve performance\n
    \  over large bandwidth*delay product paths and to provide reliable\n   operation
    over very high-speed paths.  It defines new TCP options for\n   scaled windows
    and timestamps, which are designed to provide\n   compatible interworking with
    TCP's that do not implement the\n   extensions.  The timestamps are used for two
    distinct mechanisms:\n   RTTM (Round Trip Time Measurement) and PAWS (Protect
    Against Wrapped\n   Sequences).  Selective acknowledgments are not included in
    this memo.\n\n   This memo updates and obsoletes RFC-1323 [Jacobson92d].\n\t </p>\n
