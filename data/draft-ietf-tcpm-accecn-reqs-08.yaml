abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where network
    nodes can mark IP packets, instead of dropping them, to indicate congestion to
    the endpoints. An ECN-capable receiver will feed this information back to the
    sender. ECN is specified for TCP in such a way that it can only feed back one
    congestion signal per Round-Trip Time (RTT). In contrast, ECN for other transport
    protocols, such as RTP/UDP and SCTP, is specified with more accurate ECN feedback.
    Recent new TCP mechanisms (like Congestion Exposure (ConEx) or Data Center TCP
    (DCTCP)) need more accurate ECN feedback in the case where more than one marking
    is received in one RTT. This document specifies requirements for an update to
    the TCP protocol to provide more accurate ECN feedback.</p>"
