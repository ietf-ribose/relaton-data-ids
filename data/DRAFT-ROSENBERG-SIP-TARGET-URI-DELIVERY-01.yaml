abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxy receives a request\n
    \  targeted at a URI identifying a user or resource it is responsible\n   for,
    the proxy translates the URI to a registered or configured\n   contact URI of
    an agent representing that user or resource.  In the\n   process, the original
    URI is removed from the request.  Numerous use\n   cases have arisen which require
    this information to be delivered to\n   the user agent.  This document describes
    these use cases and defines\n   an extension to the History-Info header field
    which allows it to be\n   used to support those cases.\n\t </p>\n      "
