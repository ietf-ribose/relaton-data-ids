abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a \"manifest\" for use in the Resource
    Public Key\n   Infrastructure (RPKI).  A manifest is a signed object (file) that\n
    \  contains a listing of all the signed objects (files) in the\n   repository
    publication point (directory) associated with an authority\n   responsible for
    publishing in the repository.  For each certificate,\n   Certificate Revocation
    List (CRL), or other type of signed objects\n   issued by the authority that are
    published at this repository\n   publication point, the manifest contains both
    the name of the file\n   containing the object and a hash of the file content.
    \ Manifests are\n   intended to enable a relying party (RP) to detect certain
    forms of\n   attacks against a repository.  Specifically, if an RP checks a\n
    \  manifest's contents against the signed objects retrieved from a\n   repository
    publication point, then the RP can detect \"stale\" (valid)\n   data and deletion
    of signed objects.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
