abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NFS version 4 (NFSv4) introduces the use of file delegations
    to\n   improve the ability of clients to cache file data and to provide\n   locks
    in certain sharing environments without performing a round-trip\n   communication
    to the server.  Directory caching in NFSv4, however, is\n   similar to previous
    versions and generates unnecessary revalidation\n   traffic to maintain consistency
    weaker than delegations can provide.\n   This document addresses the issues involved
    in providing a directory\n   delegation mechanism and specifies a new operation,
    REQUEST_DELEGA-\n   TION, to enable directory delegations.\n\t </p>\n      "
