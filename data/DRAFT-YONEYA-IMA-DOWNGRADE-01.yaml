    and mail headers.  The Internationalized eMail Address (IMA)\nis implemented by
    allowing UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail\nheaders.  To deliver IMA
    through IMA incompliant environment, some\nsort of converting mechanism (i.e.
    downgrading) is required.  This\ndocument describes requirements for downgrading,
    SMTP session\ndowngrade, header downgrade and implementation consideration.\n\n\t
