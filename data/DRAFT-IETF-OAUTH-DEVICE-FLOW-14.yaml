abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This OAuth 2.0 authorization flow is designed for devices that
    either\n   lack a browser to perform a user-agent based OAuth flow, or are\n   input-constrained
    to the extent that requiring the user to input a\n   lot of text (like their credentials
    to authenticate with the\n   authorization server) is impractical.  It enables
    OAuth clients on\n   such devices (like smart TVs, media consoles, digital picture
    frames,\n   and printers) to obtain user authorization to access protected\n   resources
    without using an on-device user-agent, provided that they\n   have an Internet
    connection.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
