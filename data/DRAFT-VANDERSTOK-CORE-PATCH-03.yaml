abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The existing Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) PUT method
    only\n   allows a complete replacement of a resource.  This does not permit\n
    \  applications to perform partial resource modifications.  In case of\n   resources
    with larger or complex data, or in situations where a\n   resource continuity
    is required, replacing a resource is not an\n   option.  Several applications
    using CoAP will need to perform partial\n   resource modifications.  This proposal
    adds new CoAP methods, PATCH\n   and iPATCH, to modify an existing CoAP resource
    partially.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
