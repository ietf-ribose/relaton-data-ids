abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that\n
    \  provides optimal multicast forwarding through a \"BIER domain\" without\n   requiring
    intermediate routers to run explicit tree-building protocol\n   or to maintain
    multicast-related, per-flow state.  IGP protocols are\n   extended to carry BFR-Id
    and other encapsulation informations that\n   are used by traditional path computing
    algorithm using link metric\n   for a loop-free best path selection.\n\n   This
    document defines a constrained based path selection using IGP\n   flexible Algorithm
    for BIER.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
