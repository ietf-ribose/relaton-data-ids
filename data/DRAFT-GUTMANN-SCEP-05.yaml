abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Simple Certificate Enrolment Protocol\n
    \  (SCEP), a PKI protocol that leverages existing technology by using\n   CMS
    (formerly known as PKCS #7) and PKCS #10 over HTTP.  SCEP is the\n   evolution
    of the enrolment protocol sponsored by Cisco Systems, which\n   enjoys wide support
    in both client and server implementations, as\n   well as being relied upon by
    numerous other industry standards that\n   work with certificates.\n\n\t </p>\n
