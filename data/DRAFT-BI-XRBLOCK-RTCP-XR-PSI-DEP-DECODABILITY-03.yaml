abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An MPEG2 Transport Stream (TS) is a standard container format
    used in\n   the transmission and storage of multimedia data.  Unicast/Multicast\n
    \  MPEG2 TS over RTP is widely deployed in IPTV systems.  This document\n   defines
    an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block\n   that allows the
    reporting of MPEG2 TS decodability statistics metrics\n   related to transmissions
    of MPEG2 TS over RTP.  The metrics specified\n   in the RTCP XR Block are related
    to Program specific information\n   carried in MPEG TS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
