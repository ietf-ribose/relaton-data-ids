abstract:
- content: "<p>To protect user data and privacy, Internet transport protocols have
    supported payload encryption and authentication for some time. Such encryption
    and authentication is now also starting to be applied to the transport protocol
    headers. This helps avoid transport protocol ossification by middleboxes, while
    also protecting metadata about the communication. Current operational practice
    in some networks inspect transport header information within the network, but
    this is no longer possible when those transport headers are encrypted. This document
    discusses the possible impact when network traffic uses a protocol with an encrypted
    transport header. It suggests issues to consider when designing new transport
    protocols, to account for network operations, prevent network ossification, and
    enable transport evolution, while still respecting user privacy.</p>"
