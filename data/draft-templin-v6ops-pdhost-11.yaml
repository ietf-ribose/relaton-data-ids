abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which then
    use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks. This document
    considers the case of hosts that act like routers to receive delegated prefixes
    that they can use for their own sub- delegation and/or multi-addressing purposes.</p>"
