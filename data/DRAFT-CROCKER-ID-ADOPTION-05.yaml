abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The productive output of an IETF working group is documents,
    as\n   mandated by the working group's charter.  When a working group is\n   ready
    to develop a particular document, the most common mechanism is\n   for it to \"adopt\"
    an existing document as a starting point.  The\n   document that a working group
    adopts and then develops further is\n   based on initial input at varying levels
    of maturity.  An initial\n   working group draft might be a document already in
    wide use, or it\n   might be a blank sheet, wholly created by the working group,
    or it\n   might represent any level of maturity in between.  This document\n   discusses
    how a working group typically handles the formal documents\n   that it targets
    for publication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
