abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a way to synchronise existing trust anchors\nautomatically
    between a child zone and its parent.  The protocol can\nbe used for other Resource
    Records that are required to delegate from\na parent to a child such as NS and
    glue records.  The synchronization\nallows for a third party to be involved, thus
    the protocol is\nsuitable for both cases, whether you have to communicate to the\nregistry
    or to the registrar.\n\t </p>\n      "
