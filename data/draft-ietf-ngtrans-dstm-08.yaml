abstract:
  content: "\t <t>During the initial deployment of IPv6, hosts in native IPv6 networkswill
    need to maintain connectivity with hosts and/or applications whocan only be reached
    through IPv4. The Dual Stack Transition Mechanism(DSTM) provides a method to assure
    this connectivity based on the useof IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnels and the temporal allocation
    of a globalIPv4 address to hosts requiring such communication. This documentdefines
    the processes and architecture required for this transitionmechanism.</p>"
