abstract:
- content: "<p>Federated authentication has so far been typically associated with
    Web-based services, but there is growing interest in the application of federated
    authentication for non-Web services. The goal of this document is to document
    a selection of the wide variety of contexts whose user experience could be improved
    through the use of technologies based on the ABFAB architecture and specifications.</p>"
