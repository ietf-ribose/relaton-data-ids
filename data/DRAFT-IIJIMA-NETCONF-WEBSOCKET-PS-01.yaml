abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo proposes transporting NETCONF over WebSocket\n   protocol[I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol].
    \ The use of HTTP and\n   Web-based applications are increasing with the emergence
    of advanced\n   drawing technologies and cloud computing.  IT management systems\n
    \  supporting browser-based interface are getting common.  It's natural\n   for
    network management systems to support Web-based interface.\n   Currently, however,
    few network management protocols support the\n   transportation over HTTP.  Although
    NETCONF[RFC6241] was defined to\n   be sent over SOAP/HTTPS[RFC4743], it was excluded
    from the options of\n   realizing notification mechanism[RFC5277] since HTTP lacks
    bi-\n   directional capabilty.  At present, WebSocket protocol, the update of\n
    \  HTTP with bi-directional capability, is available.  This memo\n   describes
    the way NETCONF is sent over WebSocket protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
