abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Zero round trip operation in TLS relies on a client knowing
    about a\n   server configuration prior to establishing a connection.  TLS\n   provides
    a mechanism for a server to provide a configuration during a\n   handshake so
    that subsequent connections can send encrypted data in\n   its first flight of
    messages.  This document defines a format for\n   this configuration information
    that can be used outside of TLS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
