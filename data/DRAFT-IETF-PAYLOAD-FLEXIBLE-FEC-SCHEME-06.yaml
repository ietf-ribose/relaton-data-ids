abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward
    Error\n   Correction (FEC) packets that are generated by the non-interleaved\n
    \  and interleaved parity codes from a source media encapsulated in RTP.\n   These
    parity codes are systematic codes, where a number of FEC repair\n   packets are
    generated from a set of source packets.  These repair\n   packets are sent in
    a redundancy RTP stream separate from the source\n   RTP stream that carries the
    source packets.  RTP source packets that\n   were lost in transmission can be
    reconstructed using the source and\n   repair packets that were received.  The
    non-interleaved and\n   interleaved parity codes which are defined in this specification\n
    \  offer a good protection against random and bursty packet losses,\n   respectively,
    at a cost of decent complexity.  The RTP payload\n   formats that are defined
    in this document address the scalability\n   issues experienced with the earlier
    specifications including RFC\n   2733, RFC 5109 and SMPTE 2022-1, and offer several
    improvements.  Due\n   to these changes, the new payload formats are not backward
    compatible\n   with the earlier specifications, but endpoints that do not implement\n
    \  this specification can still work by simply ignoring the FEC repair\n   packets.\n\n\t
