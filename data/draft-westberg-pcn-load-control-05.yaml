abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There is an increased interest of simple and scalable resourceprovisioning
    solution for Diffserv network. The Load Control PCN(LC-PCN) addresses the following
    issues:o Admission Control for real time data flows in stateless DiffservDomainso
    Flow Termination: Termination of flows in case of exceptionalevents, such as severe
    congestion after re-routing.Admission control in a Diffserv stateless domain can
    be performedusing two methods:o Admission Control based on data marking, whereby
    in congestionsituations the data packets are marked to notify the PCN-egress-node
    that a congestion occurred on a particular PCN-ingress-nodeto PCN-egress-node
    path.o Probing, whereby a probe packet is sent along the forwarding pathin a network
    to determine whether a flow can be admitted basedupon the current congestion state
    of the networkThe scheme provides the capability of controlling the traffic load
    inthe network without requiring signaling or any per-flow processing inthe PCN-interior-nodes.
    The complexity of Load Control is kept to aminimum to make implementation simple.
    LC-PCN can support theingress-egress-aggregate (i.e., trunk/pipe) bandwidth managementmodel
    as well as the HOSE bandwidth management model.</p>"
