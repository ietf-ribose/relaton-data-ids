abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OAuth 2.0 authorization requests from native apps should only
    be made\n   through external user-agents such as the system browser (including\n
    \  via an in-app browser tab).  This specification details the security\n   and
    usability reasons why this is the case, and how native apps and\n   authorization
    servers can implement this best practice.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
