abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.tissa-lime-yang-oam-model] defines a Generic YANG data model for
    Layer independent OAM Management. This document proposes additional extension
    to this YANG model which is complementary to the one defined in the [I-D.tissa-lime-yang-oam-model].The
    extension include generic notification and generic rpc command for Unified Management
    Plane OAM to be used within IETF in a layer independent manner. The generic notification
    and rpc command described in this document can be applied to various network technologies
    and includes technology independent configuration data and state data.</p>"
