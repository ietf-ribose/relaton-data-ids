abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of various ways to tunnel IPv6 packets
    over IPv4 networks. It covers mechanisms in current use, touches on several mechanisms
    that are now only of historic interest, and discusses some newer tunnel mechanisms
    that are not (yet) widely used at the time of publication. The goal of the document
    is helping people with an IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling need to select the mechanisms
    that may apply to them.</p>"
