abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As networks are moving towards flat architectures, a distributed\n
    \  approach is needed to mobility management.  This document presents a\n   use
    case distributed mobility management protocol called Distributed\n   Mobility
    Management for Wi-Fi.  The protocol is based on mobility\n   aware virtualized
    routing system with software-defined network\n   support.  Routing is in Layer
    2 in the access network and in Layer 3\n   in the core network.  Smart phones
    access the network over IEEE\n   802.11 (Wi-Fi) interface and can move in home,
    hotspot and enterprise\n   buildings.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
