abstract:
- content: "<p>The ACME protocol provides a means for hosts to automatically request
    and obtain X.509 certificates from certificate authorities. Certification authorities
    which implement ACME may also choose to implement the CAA DNS record, which allows
    a domain to communicate issuance policy to CAs. The CAA specification alone allows
    a domain to define policy with CA-level granularity. However, the CAA specification
    also provides facilities for extension to admit more granular, CA-specific policy.
    This specification defines such a parameter.</p>"
