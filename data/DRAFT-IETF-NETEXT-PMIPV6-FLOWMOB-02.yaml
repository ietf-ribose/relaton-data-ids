abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node to connect to the same
    Proxy\n   Mobile IPv6 domain through different interfaces.  However, the\n   ability
    of movement of selected flows from one access technology to\n   another is missing
    in the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol.  This\n   document describes enhancements
    to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol\n   that are required to support network based
    flow mobility over\n   multiple physical interfaces.\n\n   This document assumes
    that the mobile node implements the logical\n   interface model, therefore allowing
    the support of traffic flows on\n   different physical interfaces regardless of
    the assigned prefixes on\n   these physical interfaces.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
