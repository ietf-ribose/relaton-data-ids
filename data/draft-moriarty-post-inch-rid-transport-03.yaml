abstract:
- content: "<p>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a common
    XML format for document exchange, and Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) defines
    extensions to IODEF intended for the cooperative handling of security incidents
    within consortia of network operators and enterprises. This document specifies
    a transport protocol for RID based upon the passing of RID messages over HTTP/TLS
    (Transport Layer Security). This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
