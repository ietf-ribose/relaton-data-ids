abstract:
- content: "<p>Information about the behavior of the stream that will be transmitted
    in the near future will allow for better management of queues in the router and
    thus improve QoS and reduce the potential for a serious overload. Such information
    is often available in the transmitter. The proposed IP option allows for the sending
    of information about forthcoming traffic from the transmitter to the intermediate
    nodes.</p>"
