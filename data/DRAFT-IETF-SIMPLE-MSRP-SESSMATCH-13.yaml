abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an MSRP extension, Connection Establishment
    for\n   Media Anchoring (CEMA).  Support of the extension is optional.  MSRP\n
    \  endpoints can implement the extension in order to allow MSRP\n   communication
    in networks where Middleboxes anchor the MSRP\n   connection, without the need
    for the Middleboxes to enable MSRP B2BUA\n   functionality in most cases.  The
    document also defines a Session\n   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] attribute,
    a=msrp-cema, that can\n   be used by MSRP endpoints to indicate support of the
    CEMA extension.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
