abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network nodes may discard packets if they are unable to process\n
    \  protocol headers of packets due to processing constraints or limits.\n   When
    such packets are dropped, the sender receives no indication so\n   it cannot take
    action to address the cause of discarded packets. This\n   specification defines
    several new ICMPv6 errors that can be sent by a\n   node that discards packets
    because it is unable to process the\n   protocol headers. A node that receives
    such an ICMPv6 error may be\n   able to modify what it sends in future packets
    to avoid subsequent\n   packet discards.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
