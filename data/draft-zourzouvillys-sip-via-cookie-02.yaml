abstract:
  content: "<p>This document addresses a vulnerability in publicly accessible SIPservers
    (servers includes both UASes and proxies) that enables themto be used as an amplifier
    in an untracable reflected denial ofservice attack. The amplification ratio is
    between 1:10 to over1:350 in both packets and bytes.As a proposed solution, a
    mechanism for stateless cookie exchangebetween a SIP server and client to ensure
    that a public SIP serverthat wishes to accept SIP requests from hosts over datagram
    can notbe used as an amplifier for a denial of service attack. This bringsSIP
    over datagram transports (such as UDP) in line with TCP in termsof routability
    to the source IP address.</p>"
