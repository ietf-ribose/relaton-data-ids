abstract:
- content: "<p>The current OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as defined
    in the OSPF standards is vulnerable to both inter-session and intra- session replay
    attacks when its uses manual keying. Additionally, the existing cryptographic
    authentication schemes do not cover the IP header. This omission can be exploited
    to carry out various types of attacks. This draft proposes changes to the authentication
    sequence number mechanism that will protect OSPFv2 from both inter-session and
    intra- session replay attacks when its using manual keys for securing its protocol
    packets. Additionally, we also describe some changes in the cryptographic hash
    computation so that we eliminate most attacks that result because OSPFv2 does
    not protect the IP header.</p>"
