abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an update to RFC 5681 to address issues that
    arise when TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where the sending
    rate is limited by the application rather than the congestion window. It updates
    TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart quickly following either an idle or rate-limited
    interval. This method is expected to benefit applications that send rate-limited
    traffic using TCP, while also providing an appropriate response if congestion
    is experienced. It also evaluates the Experimental specification of TCP Congestion
    Window Validation, CWV, defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that RFC 2861 sought
    to address important issues, but failed to deliver a widely used solution. This
    document therefore recommends that the status of RFC 2861 is moved from Experimental
    to Historic, and that it is replaced by the current specification. NOTE: The standards
    status of this WG document is under review for consideration as either Experimental
    (EXP) or Proposed Standard (PS). This decision will be made later as the document
    is finalised.</p>"
