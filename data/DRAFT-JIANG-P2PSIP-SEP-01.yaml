abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the Service Extensible Protocol (SEP),
    which\n   is the peer protocol spoken between P2PSIP Overlay peers to share\n
    \  information and organize the P2PSIP Overlay Network.  SEP uses a\n   flexible
    forwarding mechanism to avoid congestion in the Overlay.  It\n   also proposes
    a general service discovery method and a built-in NATtraversal mechanism.  By
    using these methods, SEP tries to improve\n   the success rate and reduce the
    latency of the transaction.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
