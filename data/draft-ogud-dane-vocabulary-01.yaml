abstract:
- content: "<p>There is no standard terminology as how to talk about use of DNS in
    various application contexts, this document goal is to facilitate creation of
    such a vocabulary/taxonomy. This document started out as proposal for specific
    word usage for specifications of adding DANE like technology by different protocols/
    services. DANE is a method for specifying in DNS records acceptable keys/certificates
    for application servers. The terms defined in this document should be applicable
    to all uses of service specification that uses DNS records.</p>"
