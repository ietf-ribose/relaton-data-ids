abstract:
  content: "\t <t>As has been noticed, there is exists a huge deployment problem withglobal,
    interdomain IPv6 multicast: Protocol Independent Multicast -Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)
    Rendezvous Points (RPs) have no way ofcommunicating the information about multicast
    sources to othermulticast domains, as there is no Multicast Source Discovery Protocol(MSDP),
    and the whole interdomain Any Source Multicast model isrendered unusable; SSM
    avoids these problems. This memo outlines away to embed the address of the RP
    in the multicast address, solvingthe interdomain multicast problem. The problem
    is three-fold: specifyan address format, adjust the operational procedures andconfiguration
    if necessary, and modify PIM-SM implementations ofthose who want to join or send
    to a group (Designated Routers) orprovide one (Rendezvous Points). In consequence,
    there would be noneed for interdomain MSDP, and even intra-domain RP configurationcould
    be simplified. This memo updatres RFC 3306.</p>"
