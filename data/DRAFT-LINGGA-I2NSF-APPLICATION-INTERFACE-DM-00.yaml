    model\n   for the Application Interface between an Interface to Network\n   Security
    Functions (I2NSF) Analyzer and Security Controller in an\n   I2NSF system in a
    Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) environment.\n   The information model
    and YANG data model is based on the I2NSF\n   Consumer-Facing Interface for enabling
    feedback delivery based on the\n   information received from the Network Security
    Function (NSF).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
