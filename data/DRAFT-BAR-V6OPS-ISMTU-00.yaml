abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ISATAP tunnel MTU is currently recommended to be set to
    1480 or\n   less.  This is to avoid IPv4 fragmentation within the tunnel, but\n
    \  requires the ISATAP tunnel ingress interface to drop any IPv6 packet\n   larger
    than 1480 bytes and return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB)\n   message.  Concerns
    for operational issues with both IPv4 and IPv6\n   Path MTU Discovery point to
    the possibility of MTU-related black\n   holes when a packet is dropped due to
    an MTU restriction, so dropping\n   packets is considered highly undesirable.
    \ Fortunately, the \"Internet\n   cell size\" is 1500 bytes, i.e., the minimum
    MTU configured by the\n   vast majority of links in the Internet.  This document
    therefore\n   presents a method to boost the ISATAP MTU to 1500 bytes.\n\n\t </p>\n
