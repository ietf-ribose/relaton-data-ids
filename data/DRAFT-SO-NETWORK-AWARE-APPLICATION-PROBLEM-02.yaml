abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Data Centers offer various application services to end-users such
    as\nvideo gaming, cloud computing and others. Since the data centers used\nto
    provide application services are distributed geographically around\na network,
    many decisions made in the control and management of\napplication services, such
    as where to instantiate another service\ninstance or to which server a new client
    is assigned, should be made\nwith the knowledge of the underlying network resources
    availability\nand the application resources conditions.\n\nCurrently such decisions
    are made with very little or no information\nconcerning the underlying network
    used to deliver those services.\nHence such decisions are inherently sub-optimal.
    In addition the lack\nof network awareness may result in not meeting the end-user\napplication
    service objectives.\n\t </p>\n      "
