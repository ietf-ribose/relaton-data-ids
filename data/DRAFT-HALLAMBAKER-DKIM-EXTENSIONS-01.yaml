    defined for the policy 'this zone never sends mail'.  The NULL Key\nAlgorithm
    is defined to simplify management of large zones where most\nmail is signed but
    with important exceptions.  The X509 key record\nextension allows the location
    from which an X.509v3 certificate for\nthe key specified in the record may be
    obtained.\n\t </p>\n      "
