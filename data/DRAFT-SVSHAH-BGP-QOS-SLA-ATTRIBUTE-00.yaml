abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Out-of-band manual learning of SLA details and provisioning
    them in\n   general can be complex work for network administrators.  For example,\n
    \  Enterprise network administrators not only have to know what is their\n   SLA,
    for voice, video etc application traffic, with their Provider,\n   but they also
    require translating application groups to Classifier\n   groups as per provider's
    definition as well translate SLA to vendor\n   specific provisioning language.
    \ An in-band method of QoS signaling\n   can help to simplify some of the complexities.
    \ An optional\n   transitive BGP attribute proposed in this document intends to
    signal\n   SLA details in-band, across administrative boundaries (considered as\n
    \  Autonomous Systems (AS)), and thus simplify/speed-up some of the\n   complex
    tasks.\n\n   Though the use-case with the proposed attribute is explicitly defined\n
    \  in this document, purpose of this attribute is not limited to this\n   use-case
    only.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
