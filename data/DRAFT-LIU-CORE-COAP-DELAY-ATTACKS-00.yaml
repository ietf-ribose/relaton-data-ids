abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Various attacks including delay attacks have become a topic
    in the\n   security of Internet of Things (IoT) especially for the constrained\n
    \  nodes utilizing sensors and actuators which connect and interact with\n   the
    physical world.  [I-D.mattsson-core-coap-actuators] describes\n   several serious
    delay attacks, discusses tougher requirements and\n   then recommends mechanisms
    to mitigate the attacks.  It also\n   specifies some disadvantages with the mechanisms.
    \ This document\n   proposes alternative mechanisms that address some of the\n
    \  disadvantages\n\n\t </p>\n      "
