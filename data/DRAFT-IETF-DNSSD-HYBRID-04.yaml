abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely link-local\n
    \  Multicast DNS enables discovery of services that are on the local\n   link,
    but not (without some kind of proxy or similar special support)\n   discovery
    of services that are outside the local link.  Using a very\n   large local link
    with thousands of hosts facilitates service\n   discovery, but at the cost of
    large amounts of multicast traffic.\n\n   Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery
    using purely Unicast DNS is\n   more efficient and doesn't require excessively
    large multicast\n   domains, but requires that the relevant data be available
    in the\n   Unicast DNS namespace.  This can be achieved by manual DNS\n   configuration
    (as has been done for many years at IETF meetings to\n   advertise the IETF Terminal
    Room printer) but this is labor\n   intensive, error prone, and requires a reasonable
    degree of DNS\n   expertise.  The Unicast DNS namespace can be populated with
    the\n   required data automatically by the devices themselves, but that\n   requires
    configuration of DNS Update keys on the devices offering the\n   services, which
    has proven onerous and impractical for simple devices\n   like printers and network
    cameras.\n\n   Hence, to facilitate efficient and reliable DNS-Based Service\n
    \  Discovery, a compromise is needed that combines the ease-of-use of\n   Multicast
    DNS with the efficiency and scalability of Unicast DNS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
