abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Postcard-Based Telemetry (PBT) allows network OAM applications
    to\n   collect telemetry data about any user packet.  Unlike the E2E and\n   trace
    modes in in-situ OAM (IOAM), PBT does not require user packets\n   to carry the
    telemetry data, but directly exports the telemetry data\n   from the data collecting
    node to a collector through separated OAM\n   packets called postcards.  Two variations
    of PBT are described: one\n   requires inserting an instruction header to user
    packets to guide the\n   data collection and the other only marks the user packets
    or\n   configure the flow filter to invoke the data collection.  PBT\n   provides
    a complement to IOAM and address several implementation and\n   deployment challenges
    of it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
