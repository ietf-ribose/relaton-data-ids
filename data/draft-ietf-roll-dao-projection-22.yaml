abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends RFC 6550, RFC 6553, and RFC 8138 to enable a
    RPL Root to install and maintain Projected Routes within its DODAG, along a selected
    set of nodes that may or may not include self, for a chosen duration. This potentially
    enables routes that are more optimized or resilient than those obtained with the
    classical distributed operation of RPL, either in terms of the size of a Routing
    Header or in terms of path length, which impacts both the latency and the packet
    delivery ratio.</p>"
