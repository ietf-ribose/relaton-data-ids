abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a noticeable trend towards network requirements, behaviours\n
    \  and semantics that are specific to a limited region of the Internet\n   and
    a particular set of requirements.  Policies, default parameters,\n   the options
    supported, the style of network management and security\n   requirements may vary.
    \ This document reviews examples of such\n   limited domains and emerging solutions,
    and develops a related\n   taxonomy.  It then briefly discusses the standardization
    of protocols\n   for limited domains.  Finally, it shows the needs for a precise\n
    \  definition of limited domain membership and for mechanisms to allow\n   nodes
    to join a domain securely and to find other members, including\n   boundary nodes.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
