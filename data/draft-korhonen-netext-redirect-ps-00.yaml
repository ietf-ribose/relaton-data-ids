abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document discusses a Proxy Mobile IPv6 mobility sessionredirection
    functionality at the Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocollevel. The redirection functionality
    would allow a Local MobilityAnchor to redirect the Mobile Access Gateway during
    the Proxy BindingUpdate and Acknowledgement exchange to an alternative Local MobilityAnchor.
    The benefit of redirection at the protocol level is that itremoves the dependence
    on having such functionality provided by theAuthentication, Authorization and,
    Accounting elements or the DomainName System in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 Domain. Furthermore,
    doing theredirection at the base protocol level reduces the amount ofsignaling,
    unnecessary costly setup of mobility sessions andunnecessary costly interactions
    with backend systems.</p>"
