abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The path vector extension [I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector] has extended\n
    \  the original ALTO protocol [RFC7285] with the ability to represent a\n   more
    detailed view of the network, containing not only end-to-end\n   metrics but also
    information about shared bottlenecks.\n\n   However, the view computed by straw
    man algorithms can contain\n   redundant information and result in unnecessary
    communication\n   overhead.  The situation gets even worse when certain ALTO extensions\n
    \  are enabled, for example, the incremental update extension\n   [I-D.ietf-alto-incr-update-sse]
    which continuously pushes data\n   changes to ALTO clients.  Redundant information
    can trigger\n   unnecessary updates.\n\n   In this document, an algorithm is described
    which can effectively\n   reduce the redundancy in the network view while still
    providing the\n   same information as in the original path vectors.  The algorithm
    is\n   fully compatible with the path vector extension and has several by-\n   products
    which can be leveraged by other extensions to achieve better\n   performances.\n\n\n\t
