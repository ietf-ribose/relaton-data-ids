abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the core security features of the NFSv4\n
    \  family of protocols, applying to all minor versions.  The discussion\n   includes
    the use of security features provided at the RPC transport\n   level.\n\n   This
    preliminary version of the document, is intended, in large part,\n   to result
    in working group discussion regarding NFSv4 security issues\n   and identify issues
    on which the working group needs to work on\n   achieving consensus.\n\n   When
    published as an RFC, it will supersede the description of\n   security appearing
    in existing minor version specification documents\n   such as RFC 7530 and RFC
    8881.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
