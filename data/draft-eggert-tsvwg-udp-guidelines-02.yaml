abstract:
- content: "<p>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal, message-passing
    transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms. Because congestion
    control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and
    upper-layer protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ
    mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and establish some degree of fairness
    with concurrent traffic. This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for
    the designers of such applications and upper-layer protocols that cover congestion-control
    and other topics, including message sizes and reliability.</p>"
