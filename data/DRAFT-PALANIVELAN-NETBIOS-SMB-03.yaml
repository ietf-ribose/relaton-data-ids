abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\tThe Network Basic I/O System (NetBIOS) NetBIOS was developed
    in\n        the early 1980s to allow applications to communicate over a\n        network.
    The TCP/IP version called NetBIOSoverTCP/IP(NetBT),\n        was developed to
    support communications between symbolically\n        named stations and transfer
    of arbitrary data.NetBT supports all\n        three services (Name, Datagram and
    Session) supported by NetBIOS.\n\n\tThe Server Message Block (SMB) is a presentation
    layer protocol\n        providing file and print sharing functions for LAN Manager,
    and\n        other network operating systems.\n\n\tSMB over NetBT session is not
    clearly explained in the RFCs\n        [Netbios concepts] and [Netbios specification]
    and this document\n        attempts to provide information on this.\n\n        This
    document is intended for documentation purpose and for\n        informational
    use only.This document does not attempt to define\n        a standard, rather
    tries explaining an existing implementation.\n\n        This document puts together
    pieces of information scattered in\n\n        multiple documents and offers a
    single complete documentation\n\n       for this specific application (smb over
    NetBT).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
