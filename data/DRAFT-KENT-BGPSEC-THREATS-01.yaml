abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a threat model for BGP path security\n
    \  (BGPSEC). BGPSEC is assumed to make use of the Resource Public Key\n   Infrastructure
    (RPKI) already developed in the SIDR WG [I-D.ietf-\n   sidr-arch], and thus threats
    and attacks against the RPKI are part of\n   this model. The model assumes that
    BGP path security is achieved\n   through the application of digital signatures
    to AS_Path Info. The\n   document characterizes classes of potential adversaries
    that are\n   considered to be threats, and examines classes of attacks that might\n
    \  be launched against BGPSEC. It concludes with brief discussion of\n   residual
    vulnerabilities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
