abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the increasing interest in the potential use of blockchain\n
    \  systems for virtual assets, there is a need for these assets to have\n   mobility
    across blockchain systems.  An interoperability architecture\n   for blockchain
    systems is needed in order to permit the secure flow\n   of virtual assets between
    blockchain systems, satisfying the\n   properties of transfer atomicity, consistency
    and durability.  The\n   architecture must recognize that there are different
    blockchain\n   systems, and that the interior constructs in these blockchains
    maybe\n   incompatible with one another.  Gateway nodes perform the transfer of\n
    \  virtual assets between blockchain systems while masking the\n   complexity
    of the interior constructs of the blockchain that they\n   represent.\n\n\t </p>\n
