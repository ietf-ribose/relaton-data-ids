abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft presents a technique to securely provision a networking\n
    \  device when it is booting in a factory-default state.  Variations in\n   the
    solution enables it to be used on both public and private\n   networks.  The provisioning
    steps are able to update the boot image,\n   commit an initial configuration,
    and execute arbitrary scripts to\n   address auxiliary needs.  The updated device
    is subsequently able to\n   establish secure connections with other systems.  For
    instance, a\n   device may establish NETCONF [RFC6241] and/or RESTCONF [RFC8040]\n
    \  connections with deployment-specific network management systems.\n\n\t </p>\n
