abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a new architecture on the client-side for
    \nauthentication by EAP. This architecture complements the usual setup \nconsidered
    in EAP by making it become symmetric: the client-side is \ndivided in two parts,
    the Authentication Token and the client, which \nare analogous respectively to
    the Authentication Server and the \nAuthenticator on the server-side. Moreover,
    this document describes a \nframework for the use of Authentication Tokens with
    the EAP protocol. \n \n\t </p>\n      "
