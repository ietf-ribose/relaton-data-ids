abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ITU-T has defined an architecture and requirements for
    operating\n   an Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON).\n\n   The Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocol suite\n   is designed to provide
    a control plane for a range of network\n   technologies including optical networks
    such as time division\n   multiplexing (TDM) networks including SONET/SDH and
    Optical Transport\n   Networks (OTNs), and lambda switching optical networks.\n\n
    \  The requirements for GMPLS routing to satisfy the requirements of\n   ASON
    routing, and an evaluation of existing GMPLS routing protocols\n   are provided
    in other documents.  This document defines extensions to\n   the OSPFv2 Link State
    Routing Protocol to meet the requirements for\n   routing in an ASON.\n\n   Note
    that this work is scoped to the requirements and evaluation\n   expressed in RFC
    4258 and RFC 4652 and the ITU-T Recommendations\n   current when those documents
    were written.  Future extensions of\n   revisions of this work may be necessary
    if the ITU-T Recommendations\n   are revised or if new requirements are introduced
    into a revision of\n   RFC 4258.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
