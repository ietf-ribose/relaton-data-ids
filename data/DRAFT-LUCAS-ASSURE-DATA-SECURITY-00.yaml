abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   aSSURE uses industry standards and best practice to provide
    a\n   secure communications platform for device configuration and life\n   cycle
    management across the entire range of smart devices, from\n   the largest servers
    through to more constrained devices, with\n   minimal human involvement. Based
    on extensions to current standard\n   methods, aSSURE also provides secure end
    to end communication\n   across any network type.\n\n   A new approach allows
    key distribution and encrypted channels to\n   be established between devices
    that support RSA, EC and/or simple\n   shared secrets. For devices that only support
    shared secrets, key\n   derivation algorithms ensure that forward and backward
    compatible\n   secrecy is supported so that secure change of ownership can be\n
    \  obtained. Owners prove ownership via a \"case ID\" known by the\n   manufacturer
    and the \"Trusted Authority\" ID Server but not known\n   by the device.\n\n   aSSURE
    defines end-to-end encryption links, called \"channels\", so\n   that pairs of
    devices communicate with a unique set of encryption\n   keys. These unique keys,
    coupled with the end-to-end encryption,\n   mean communication is both secure
    and private.\n\n   DTLS supports both certificates and pre-shared keys, but does
    not\n   cover key distribution or management. DTLS does not support\n   client-specific
    pre-shared keys because the client cannot identify\n   itself during the handshake.
    Herein are all the APIs required to\n   support key distribution and management
    as well as an extension to\n   the DTLS handshake that allows the client identity
    to be provided.\n\n   aSSURE cleanly integrates with the Open Interconnect Consortium\n
    \  (OIC) architecture. Both use CBOR encoded data with CoAP over UDP\n   and DTLS.
    aSSURE URIs do not collide with OIC URIs and aSSURE\n   channels can be used as
    a secure transport for OIC requests.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
