abstract:
- content: "<p>Ideally, network applications should be able to select an appropriate
    transport solution from among available transport solutions. However, at present,
    there is no agreed-upon way to do this. In fact, there is not even an agreed-upon
    way for a source end host to determine if there is support for a particular transport
    along a network path. This draft addresses these issues, by proposing a Happy
    Eyeballs framework. The proposed Happy Eyeballs framework enables the selection
    of a transport solution that according to application requirements, pre-set policies,
    and estimated network conditions is the most appropriate one. Additionally, the
    proposed framework makes it possible for an application to find out whether a
    particular transport is supported along a network connection towards a specific
    destination or not.</p>"
