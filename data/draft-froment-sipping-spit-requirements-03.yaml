abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) is one of the foreseen futureforms
    of spamming that SIP open-wide networks may have to handle.SPIT also has more
    impact on users than email spam since it is moreintrusive. Email as a store-and-forward
    communication mechanismallows for several filtering mechanisms to be applied to
    the fullcontent before being presented to the user. Session InitiationProtocol
    (SIP) interaction is, in contrast, real-time communicationand therefore does not
    provide much information prior to thetransmission of the content, making it both
    harder to filter and moreannoying to users. The responsibility for filtering,
    blocking calls,or taking any other preventive action can belong to differentelements
    in the call flow and may depend on various factors. Thisdocument discusses the
    requirements to define authorization policiesthat should allow end users or other
    parties to setup anti-SPITpolicies for triggering these actions. These policies
    typicallymatch a particular SIP communication pattern based on a number ofattributes.
    The range of attributes includes information provided,for example, by the SIP
    protocol itself, by the SIP identitymechanism, by information carried within SAML
    assertions or byreputation systems of social networks.</p>"
