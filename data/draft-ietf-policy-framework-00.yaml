abstract:
- content: "<p>This document articulates the requirements and basic framework of a
    policy-based management system for IP networks. It focuses on the storage and
    retrieval of Policy Rules from a repository, for use in the management and operation
    of IP networks. This framework document describes functional components and operational
    characteristics of a system that is intended to be device and vendor independent,
    interoperable and scalable. There are three basic sections of this draft, addressing:
    o the motivation for policy-based management that briefly describes the requirements
    for implementing policy in IP networks; o a reference model that defines a first-level
    functional decomposition of such a framework, and captures the key concepts in
    defining policy tools, Policy Rules, the use of a repository and schema, and the
    mechanisms underlying the definition, storage and retrieval of policies; and o
    a description of each of the functional components, as well as a narrative about
    how a policy system can implement prescribed policies.</p>"
