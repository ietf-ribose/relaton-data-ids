abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document articulates the requirements and basic framework of
    apolicy-based management system for IP networks. It focuses on thestorage and
    retrieval of Policy Rules from a repository, for use inthe management and operation
    of IP networks. This framework documentdescribes functional components and operational
    characteristics of asystem that is intended to be device and vendor independent,interoperable
    and scalable.There are three basic sections of this draft, addressing:o the motivation
    for policy-based management that briefly describesthe requirements for implementing
    policy in IP networks;o a reference model that defines a first-level functionaldecomposition
    of such a framework, and captures the key concepts indefining policy tools, Policy
    Rules, the use of a repository andschema, and the mechanisms underlying the definition,
    storage andretrieval of policies; ando a description of each of the functional
    components, as well as anarrative about how a policy system can implement prescribedpolicies.</p>"
