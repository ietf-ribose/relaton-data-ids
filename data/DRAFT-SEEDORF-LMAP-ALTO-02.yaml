abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the context of Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance\n
    \  (LMAP), measurement results are currently made available to the\n   public
    either at the finest granularity level (e.g. as a list of\n   results of all individual
    tests), or in a very high level human-\n   readable format (e.g. as PDF reports).
    \ This document argues that\n   there is a need for an intermediate way to provide
    access to large-\n   scale network measurement results, flexible enough to enable
    querying\n   of specific and possibly aggregated data.  The Application-Layer\n
    \  Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol, defined with the goal to\n   provide
    applications with network information, seems a good candidate\n   to fulfill such
    a role.  Finally, we describe our methodology for\n   analyzing the United States
    Federal Communication Commission's (FCC)\n   Measuring Broadband America (MBA)
    dataset to derive required topology\n   and cost maps suitable for consumption
    by an ALTO server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
