abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents considerations related to open issues
    with\n   upcoming new communication systems denoted as 5G aiming to set a\n   basis
    for documenting problem space, use-cases, and potential\n   solutions related
    to next-generation network infrastructure.  The\n   draft reviews currently investigated
    topics, including both inputs\n   from IETF and from other SDOs as well as research
    activities.\n   Further the outcome of recent discussions at side sessions during\n
    \  IETF meetings are recaptured to help identifying a starting point for\n   future
    thoughts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
