abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides a guideline for creating civic address\nconsideration
    documents for individual countries, as required by RFC\n4776.  Since civic addresses
    may have a different format in\nindividual countries, such address considerations
    are necessary in\norder to map the civic address elements to the PIDF Location
    Object\n(PIDF-LO) elements.\n\t </p>\n      "
