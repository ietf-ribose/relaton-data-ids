abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the requirements and implementation of a group
    telephony feature commonly known as Bridged Line Appearance (BLA) or Multiple
    Line Appearance (MLA), or Shared Call/Line Appearance (SCA). When implemented
    using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), it is referred to as shared appearances
    of an Address of Record (AOR) since SIP does not have the concept of lines. This
    feature is commonly offered in IP Centrex services and IP-PBX offerings and is
    likely to be implemented on SIP IP telephones and SIP feature servers used in
    a business environment. This feature allows several user agents (UAs) to share
    a common AOR, learn about calls placed and received by other UAs in the group,
    and pick up or join calls within the group. This document discusses use cases,
    lists requirements and defines extensions to implement this feature. This specification
    updates RFC3261 and RFC4235.</p>"
