abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft presents the requirements of burst-level control in
    order \nto improve channel efficiency in optical networks. By processing and \ncontrol
    the finer granularity of burst data, the network can improve \nits utilization
    than the present circuit switching based optical \nnetworks. Implementation issues
    of transmission and switching for \ndata burst are took into consideration.  \n\t
