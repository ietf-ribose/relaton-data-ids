abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Recently there has been interest in using DHCP for configuring
    \nclients accessing the Internet through some form of high-speed \naccess technology
    such as cable or ADSL [DHC-AGENT]. In addition, \nalthough DHCP was initially
    designed for configuring fixed hosts, \nproposals are being made to enhance DHCP
    to support roaming/mobile \nclients [DHC-ENHANCE]. These two trends have put in
    evidence the \nneed for a coupling between AAA and DHCP. Some initial requirements
    \nfor DHCP/AAA have been proposed in [DHC-AAA].\nThis document proposes a different
    model in which AAA procedures are \ninvoked not from a DHCP server but from a
    DHCP relay agent to make \nsure that ALL the Internet Access features supported
    by the PPP model \ncan be replicated in a DHCP based Internet Access environment.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
