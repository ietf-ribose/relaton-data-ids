abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a generic Cognitive Adaptive Module (CAM)that
    can be utilized in conjunction with Mobile Ad hoc Network(MANET) routing protocols.
    The main concept behind CAM is the factthat the provisioning of multimedia communications
    traditionallyrequires routing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees [9]. Such atask
    is NP Complete in MANETs when QoS optimization is subject tomore than one parameter
    [9]. Hence, the provisioning of soft QoSguarantees for effective and efficient
    routing in dynamicenvironments, as specified in [1], is the best alternative.
    However,the latter cannot be optimally achieved by using a single metricbased
    path selection process or routing approach due to variationsin both upper layer
    service QoS requirements and situationalconstraints. CAM provides interfaces to
    routing components such thatprotocols can be segmented into these components and
    can be easilymade configurable and adaptive. For instance, the route selectionprocess
    can be done in an adaptive manner to satisfy therequirements for effective and
    efficient routing. This is achievedby providing interfaces from the CAM core to
    various user definedcomponents (e.g. Repositories Component) such that all componentsand
    component parts (e.g. DYMO reactive routing logic) can inter-communicate.</p>"
