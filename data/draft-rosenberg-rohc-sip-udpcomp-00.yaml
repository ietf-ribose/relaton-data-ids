abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), along with many other IPprotocols
    used for multimedia communications, are UDP-based, textualprotocols engineered
    for bandwidth rich links. As a result, thesemessages have not been optimized for
    message size. With the plannedusage of these protocols in wireless handsets as
    part of 2.5G and 3Gwireless, the large size of these messages is problematic,
    primarilyfor latency reasons. As a result, we propose a protocol shim betweenSIP
    (or any other UDP based protocol meeting our requirements) andUDP in order to
    efficiently compress SIP messages. Preliminaryresults have shown compression gains
    of up to 8:1.</p>"
