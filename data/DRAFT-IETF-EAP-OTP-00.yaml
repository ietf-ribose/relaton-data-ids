abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>EAP is an authentication protocol which supports multiple authentication\nmechanisms.
    EAP typically runs directly over the link layer without\nrequiring IP and therefore
    includes its own support for in-order\ndelivery and re-transmission. While EAP
    was originally developed for use\nwith PPP, it is also now in use with IEEE 802.
    This document defines the\nOne Time Password (OTP) and Generic Token Card EAP
    methods, both of\nwhich provide one-way authentication, but not key generation.
    As a\nresult, the OTP and Generic Token Card methods, when used by themselves,\nare
    only appropriate for use on networks where physical security can be\nassumed.
    These methods SHOULD NOT be used on wireless networks, or over\nthe Internet,
    unless the EAP conversation is protected. This can be\naccomplished using technologies
    such as IPsec or TLS.\n\t </p>\n      "
