abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes SSTP, a protocol architecture that provides
    thesupport of SCCP and TCAP user applications over an IP network. Thepurpose of
    SSTP is to provide a standard tunneling protocol to conveySCCP messages over an
    IP based network. The core part of the SSTParchitecture is the specification of
    the SSTP (Simple SCCP TunnelingProtocol) adaptation layer, that provides adaptation
    between the SCCPlayer already defined in [3] and [4], and the IP family protocols
    IP,UDP, TCP and ICMP. TCP or UDP is used for SCCP class 0 messages. TCP isused
    for SCCP class 1, 2 or 3. SSTP provides similar primitives andparameters to SCCP
    than MTP, and provides seamless connection betweennodes implementing SSTP and
    classical SS7 nodes by means of a SSTPgateway. The design of SSTP is oriented
    to fulfill the requirements ofTCAP user applications running on a WAN.</p>"
