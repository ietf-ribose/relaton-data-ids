abstract:
  content: "<p>This document discusses technical issues and requirements for themanagement
    information base (MIB) for Fibre Channel and storagenetwork applications. This
    document is likely to be expanded toinclude management of specific Fibre Channel
    device types in thefuture. The purpose is to have an overall structure and view
    ofFibre Channel MIBs for consistency and interoperability. Thisdocument does not
    try to cover the details of each individual MIB.This is an initial draft document,
    which will evolve and expandover time. It is the intent of this document to produce
    a coherentdescription of a framework for various MIB development which wasand
    is being considered by the working group. Selection ofspecific approaches, making
    choices regarding engineering tradeoffs,and detailed protocol specification, are
    outside of the scope ofthis framework document.</p>"
