abstract:
- content: <p>This document is a companion document to "SDP Offer/Answer for RTP using
    QUIC as Transport". That document focuses on the description and registration
    of SDP "proto" attribute parameters with IANA, to allow applications that rely
    on SDP Offer/Answer to negotiate the QUIC protocol as an encapsulation for RTP.
    In writing that document, it became obvious that decisions about an appropriate
    SDP description would depend on decisions about the way RTP would be encapsulated
    in QUIC, and different proposals for those encapsulations had made different assumptions.
    Given that none of these proposals have been adopted by an IETF working group
    yet, it's not appropriate to try to base a general-purpose set of "QUIC/RTP" IANA
    registrations on any one of them, so this document includes the questions that
    have come up, and (as discussions progress) suggested answers for those questions.</p>
