abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) linear protection is defined in [RFC6378].
    That however is limited to 1+1 and 1:1 protection and is not able to care that
    the multiple failures are occurred on both working and protection paths. This
    document describes why we need to consider the case for multiple failures, and
    lists some requirements for multi-failure protection (MFP) functionality.</p>"
