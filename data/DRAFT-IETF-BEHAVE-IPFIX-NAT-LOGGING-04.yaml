abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network operators expect NAT devices to log events like creation
    and\n   deletion of translations and information about the resources it is\n   managing.
    \ The logs are essential in many cases to identify an\n   attacker or a host that
    was used to launch malicious attacks and/or\n   for various other purposes of
    accounting.  Since there is no standard\n   way of logging this information, different
    NAT devices log the\n   information using proprietary formats and hence it is
    difficult to\n   expect a consistent behavior.  The lack of a consistent way to
    log\n   the data makes it difficult to write the collector applications that\n
    \  would receive this data and process it to present useful information.\n   This
    document describes the formats for logging of NAT events.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
