abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Due to their critical role in a network, the protection of routing\nequipements
    is crucial, particularly against subversion attacks.  For\nthis purpose, we integrate
    a trusted plane in the network equipments\nrelated to the routing protocols (e.g.
    \ OSPF, BGP, RIP).  This\ntrusted plane is realized by a trusted element embedded
    or connected\nto the network equipment.\n\t </p>\n      "
