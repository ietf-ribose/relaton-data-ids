abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SIP networks use signaling monitoring tools to diagnose user
    reported\n   problems and for regression testing if network or user agent software\n
    \  is upgraded.  As networks grow and become interconnected, including\n   connection
    via transit networks, it becomes impractical to predict\n   the path that SIP
    signaling will take between user agents, and\n   therefore impractical to monitor
    SIP signaling end-to-end.\n\n   This document describes an indicator for the SIP
    protocol which can\n   be used to mark signaling as being of interest to logging.
    \ Such\n   marking will typically be applied as part of network testing\n   controlled
    by the network operator and not used in normal user agent\n   signaling.  However,
    such marking can be carried end-to-end including\n   the originating and terminating
    SIP user agents, even if a session\n   originates and terminates in different
    networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
