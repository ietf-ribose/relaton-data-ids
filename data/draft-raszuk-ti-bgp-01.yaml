abstract:
  content: "\t <t>BGP4 protocol is a well established single standard of an inter-domain
    routing and non-routing information distribution today. Formany applications it
    is also the protocol of choice to disseminatevarious application based information
    intra-domain. It's popularityand it's wide use has been effectively provided by
    it's reliabletransport, session protection as well as loop free build inmechanism.It
    has been observed in both intra-domain as well as inter-domainapplications that
    reliable information distribution is an extremelydesired tool for many services.
    Introduction of MultiprotocolExtensions to BGP even further attracted various
    sorts of newinformation to be carried over BGP4.The observation proves that amount
    and nature of information carriedby BGP increases and diverges from the original
    goal ofinterconnection for IP Internet Autonomous Systems at a rather fastpace.This
    draft proposes BGP to divide information into two broadcategories: Internet routing
    critical and non Internet routingcritical that would also include information
    carried by BGP which isnot related directly to routing. For the purpose of this
    document wewill refer to the latter case as second BGP instance.This draft proposes
    that the current BGP infrastructure will continueto be used to disseminate Internet
    routing related information whilenon routing information or private routing data
    is recommended to becarried by independent transport instance BGP.</p>"
