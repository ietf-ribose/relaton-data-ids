abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC 7450 (AMT) by extending the relay
    discovery\n   process to use a new DNS resource record for source-specific AMT\n
    \  relay discovery when joining source-specific multicast channels.  A\n   multicast
    sender configures a reverse IP DNS zone with the new\n   AMTRELAY RR (defined
    in this document) to advertise a set of relays\n   that can receive and forward
    multicast traffic from that sender\n   inside a unicast AMT tunnel, in order to
    transit non-multicast-\n   capable network segments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
