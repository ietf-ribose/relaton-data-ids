abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an update to CCID-3/4 that addresses parameter-estimation
    problems occurring with TFRC-based DCCP congestion control. The fix uses a recommendation
    made in the original TFRC specification. It avoids the inherent problems of receiver-based
    RTT sampling, by utilising higher-accuracy RTT samples already available at the
    sender. It is integrated into the feature set of DCCP as an end-to-end negotiable
    extension, upward and downward compatible.</p>"
