abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Content delivery includes one or more CDNs and in many instances\n
    \  involves cascaded delegation when handling encrypted data.  The\n   delivery
    of such content over HTTPS though raises credential\n   management issues.  Two
    models of HTTPS delegation can be considered:\n   direct delegation, and \"cascaded\"
    delegation.  While the first model\n   of delegation is addressed by most of the
    work at the IETF, in the\n   latter case, it is up to downstream CDN(s) delivering
    the content to\n   an end-user to present legacy credentials of either the origin
    or of\n   the upstream CDN which delegated the delivery to the aforementioned\n
    \  dCDN.  This document presents updates needed in CDNI Control and\n   Metadata
    interfaces to setup HTTPS delegation between an uCDN and\n   dCDN.\n\n\t </p>\n
