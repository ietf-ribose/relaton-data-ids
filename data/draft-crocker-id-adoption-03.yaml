abstract:
- content: <p>The productive output of IETF working groups is documents, as mandated
    by the working group's charter. When a working group is ready to develop a particular
    document it usually "adopts" it as a working group draft. The document that a
    working group adopts and then develops further is based on initial input at varying
    levels of maturity. An initial working group draft might be a document already
    in wide use, or it might be a blank sheet, wholly created by the working group,
    or it might represent any level of maturity in between. This document discusses
    typicals aspects of a working group's handling of its formal documents, which
    are targeted for publication.</p>
