abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>LRDD (pronounced 'lard') provides a process for obtaining information\nabout
    a resource identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).\nThe 'information
    about a resource' - a resource descriptor - provides\nmachine-readable information
    that aims to increase interoperability\nand enhance interactions with the resource.
    \ LRDD provides a narrow\nand well-defined set of rules for obtaining and processing
    link-based\ndescriptors (found in multiple sources such as HTTP headers, document\nmarkup,
    and resource descriptors) which are often required for\nsecurity and consistent
    client behavior.\n\t </p>\n      "
