abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated bypeer-to-peer
    (P2P) applications used traditionally for file-sharing,and more recently for real-time
    communications and live mediastreaming. Such applications discover a route to
    each other throughan overlay network with little knowledge of the underlying networktopology.
    As a result, they may choose peers based on informationdeduced from empirical
    measurements, which can lead to suboptimalchoices. We refer to this as the Application
    Layer TrafficOptimization (ALTO) problem. In this draft we present a survey ofexisting
    literature on discovering topology characteristics.</p>"
