abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HTTP-Payments describes a mechanism for passing a standardized\n
    \  payment request in the headers of an HTTP 402 response and the\n   expected
    behaviour of HTTP clients that receive such a response.\n\nFeedback\n\n   This
    specification is an early experiment in bringing the work of the\n   W3C Web Payments
    working group to the HTTP protocol.  It is\n   maintained at https://github.com/adrianhopebailie/http-payments
    [1].\n\n   The work is inspired by work in the Interledger community on\n   [HTTP-ILP]\n\n\t
