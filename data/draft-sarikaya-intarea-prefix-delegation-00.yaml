abstract:
  content: "\t <t>According to IPv6 operation in cellular networks, one prefix can
    onlybe assigned to one interface of a mobile node by an access router anddifferent
    mobile nodes can't share a prefix. Managing Per-MNinterface prefixes is likely
    to increase the processing load at theaccess router. Based on the idea that DHCPv6
    servers can manageprefixes as well as addresses, we propose a new technique in
    whichthe access router offloads delegation and release tasks of theprefixes to
    an DHCPv6 server. The access router first requests aprefix for an incoming mobile
    node to the DHCPv6 server. The accessrouter next advertises the prefix information
    to the mobile node witha Router Advertisement message. When the mobile node hands
    off, theprefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server. We also describe how AAAservers
    can help in prefix delegation.</p>"
