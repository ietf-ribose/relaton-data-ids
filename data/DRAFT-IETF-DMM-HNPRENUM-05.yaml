abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification, a Mobile
    Node\n   (MN) is assigned with a Home Network Prefix (HNP) during its initial\n
    \  attachment and the MN configures its Home Address (HoA) with the HNP.\n   During
    the movement of the MN, the HNP remains unchanged to keep\n   ongoing communications
    associated with the HoA.  However, the current\n   PMIPv6 specification does not
    specify related operations when an HNP\n   renumbering is happened.  In this document,
    a solution to support the\n   HNP renumbering is proposed, as an update of the
    PMIPv6\n   specification.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
