abstract:
- content: "<p>The number of ways to subscribe-to (and to unsubscribe-from) e-mail
    mailing lists is as varied as the number of programmers designing mailing list
    software. For some lists, for example, users (un)subscribe by sending a request
    to &lt;listname&gt;-request@host.domain. For others lists the address is majordomo@host.domain
    with the request to (un)subscribe embedded in the message body. Yet others set
    up special hosts to satisfy this need, such as &lt;listname&gt;@list-off.domain.
    In this Internet Draft we offer two new e-mail headers intended to make mailing
    list subscription and unsubscription easier and more uniform: List-Subscribe and
    List-Unsubscribe.</p>"
