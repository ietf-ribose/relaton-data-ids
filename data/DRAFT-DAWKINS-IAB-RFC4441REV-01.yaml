abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides guidance to aid in the understanding
    of\n   collaboration on standards development between Project 802 of the\n   Institute
    of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the\n   Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF).  It is an almost complete\n   rewrite of, and is intended to
    replace, RFC 4441.  The updates\n   reflect changes in the IETF and IEEE, and
    in the relationship between\n   the two organizations, since RFC 4441 was written.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
