abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 6374 defines procedures for packet loss and throughput\n
    \  measurement in MPLS networks.  Some forms of measurement rely on the\n   existence
    of a stream of test messages that flows between measurement\n   points, from which
    the loss and throughput characteristics of the\n   underlying data channel are
    inferred.  This document presents\n   procedures for the establishment and maintenance
    of such test\n   sessions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
