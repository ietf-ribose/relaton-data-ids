abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ANVL (A Name-Value Language) is a simple record syntax based
    on email\n   headers.  An ANVL record is a sequence of data elements ending in
    a\n   blank line.  An element consists of a label, a colon, and an optional\n
    \  value, and a long value may be folded (continued) onto the next line\n   by
    inserting a CRLF and indenting the next line.  A value folded\n   across several
    lines is treated as if the lines were joined on one\n   long line; any line beginning
    with `#' is treated as a \"comment\".\n   Example ANVL record:\n\n         entry:\n
    \        # first draft\n         who:   Gilbert, W.S. | Sullivan, Arthur\n         what:
    \ The Yeomen of\n                the Guard\n         when/created:  1888\n\t </p>\n
