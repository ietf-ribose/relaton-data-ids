abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a password authentication mechanism, called
    \ YAP-SHA-256-TLS-UNIQ, for use in protocols which support Simple\n  Authentication
    and Security Layer (SASL) framework.  The mechanism\n  relies on security services
    provided by a lower layer, such as\n  Transport Layer Security (TLS), to protect
    the authentication\n  exchange, and subsequent application data exchange, from
    common\n  attacks.  The YAP-SHA-256-TLS-UNIQ mechanism can be viewed as an\n  alternative
    to other password-based SASL mechanism, such as PLAIN,\n  CRAM-MD5, and DIGEST-MD5.\n\t
