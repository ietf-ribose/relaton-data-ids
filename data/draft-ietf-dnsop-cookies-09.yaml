abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS cookies are a lightweight DNS transaction security mechanism that
    provides limited protection to DNS servers and clients against a variety of increasingly
    common denial-of-service and amplification / forgery or cache poisoning attacks
    by off-path attackers. DNS Cookies are tolerant of NAT, NAT-PT, and anycast and
    can be incrementally deployed. (Since DNS Cookies are only returned to the IP
    address from which they were originally received, they cannot be used to generally
    track Internet users.)</p>"
