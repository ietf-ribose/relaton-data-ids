abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Deployment experience has demonstrated the value of using the\n
    \  Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) architecture to\n   manage
    resources other than packet forwarding.  In that spirit, the\n   Forwarding Element
    Manager (FEM) is modelled by creating a Logical\n   Functional Block (LFB) to
    represent its functionality.  We refer to\n   this LFB as the FE Configuration
    (FEC) LFB.  A Control Element (CE)\n   that controls a Forwarding Element's (FE)
    resources can also manage\n   its configuration via the FEC LFB.  This document
    introduces the FEC\n   LFB, an LFB that specifies the configuration parameters
    of an FE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
