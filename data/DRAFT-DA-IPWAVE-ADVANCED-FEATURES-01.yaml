abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For future vehicular networks, some advanced features might
    be needed\n   to facilitate use cases as platooning, proximity service awareness,\n
    \  autonomous driving and so forth. Thus, this draft intends to present\n   two
    functions, known as vehicular grouping and socialization, for\n   enabling some
    future-oriented use cases. These two functions could be\n   built upon cross-layer
    identifiers, such as MAC, IP, and ID, which\n   also have potential to formulate
    more value-added services for future\n   vehicular networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
