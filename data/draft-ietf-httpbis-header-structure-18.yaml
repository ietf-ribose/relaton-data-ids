abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a set of data types and associated algorithms
    that are intended to make it easier and safer to define and handle HTTP header
    and trailer fields, known as "Structured Fields", "Structured Headers", or "Structured
    Trailers". It is intended for use by specifications of new HTTP fields that wish
    to use a common syntax that is more restrictive than traditional HTTP field values.</p>
