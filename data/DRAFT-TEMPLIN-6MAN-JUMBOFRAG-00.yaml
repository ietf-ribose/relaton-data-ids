abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) provides a service for\n
    \  transmission of IPv6 packets larger than 65,535 octets known as\n   \"jumbograms\".
    \ Such large packets are not eligible for fragmentation,\n   and the current specification
    forbids the inclusion of a fragment\n   header of any kind.  However, some implementations
    may wish to\n   include an Identification value with each jumbogram; hence this\n
    \  document proposes the transmission of IPv6 jumbograms as \"atomic\n   fragments\".\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
