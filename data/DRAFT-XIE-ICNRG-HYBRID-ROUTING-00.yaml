abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Name-based routing in information-centric networks faces many\n
    \  challenges, one of which is the scalability challenge; in particular,\n   content
    routers may not have sufficiently large FIB to store a large\n   portion of name
    prefixes, even if the latter are aggressively\n   aggregated.  In many ICN designs
    routers have to rely on inefficient\n   mechanisms (e.g., Interest broadcast in
    content-centric networks) in\n   order to route requests.  In this draft, we describe
    a hybrid,\n   reactive routing approach, where we augment the information-centric\n
    \  network design with an Infrastructure Information Base (IIB) to reap\n   the
    benefits of both name-based and infrastructure-based routing.\n   Simulation-based
    evaluations demonstrate that this scheme can\n   significantly improve the network
    scalability by cutting down the\n   number of broadcast packets while maintaining
    the same level of the\n   user-perceived latency.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
