abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, if an internal server and hosts are behind NAT,
    they\n   cannot share a global IP address except adding lots of static NAPT\n
    \  rule configuration.  Because if a server wants to provide a service\n   by
    constant port(i.e. HTTP and FTP) , the destination port of packet\n   sent by
    an external client should not be changed when it crosses NAT.\n   This document
    specifies a new method to assign NAPT global address\n   and port, aiming to solve
    the problem that internal servers and hosts\n   cannot share less global IP addresses.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
