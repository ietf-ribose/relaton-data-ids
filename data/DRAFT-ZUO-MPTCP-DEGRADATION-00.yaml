abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the goals for MPTCP is utilizing multiple paths to perform
    at\n   least as well as the best path in terms of throughput. However, this\n
    \  goal might not be arrived at because of the path asymmetry, which is\n   called
    as the performance-degradation problem of MPTCP in this draft.\n   Some existing
    methods focus on this problem, such as penalizing and\n   opportunistic retransmission,
    which reactively responds to the head-\n   of-line blocking for trying their best
    to send data across all paths.\n   In order to efficiently utilize the capabilities
    of the multiple\n   paths, this draft proposes an approach that proactively selects
    the\n   best path(s) to send data instead of always bonding all paths\n   together.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
