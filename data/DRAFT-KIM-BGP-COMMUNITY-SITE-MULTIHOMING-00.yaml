abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents for a new IPv6 site multihoming scheme
    and its \n   operational requirements. It aims at solving potential deployment
    \n   problems in 'IPv6 Multihoming Support at Site Exit Routers [2]'\n   using
    an application of BGP extended community attribute, called \n   multihomed community.
    In case of link failure in [2], basic \n   operations to support multihoming are
    entirely dependent on \n   functionality of border router in other ISPs. Hence,
    it causes \n   following problems; centralized encapsulation overhead for re-routing,
    packet delivery along un-optimized tunneling session, and losing \n   connectivity
    in case of ISP failure. Also, [2] do not provide any \n   alternative mechanism
    for long-term failure. For above reasons, if \n   the link remains failed for
    a long time, it has a little \n   applicability due to previously mentioned problems.
    In this memo, we \n   propose a new IPv6 site multihoming scheme, which establishes
    \n   multiple direct tunneling sessions between sender's site exit router \n   and
    reachable receiver's site exit router instead of one tunneling \n   session between
    border router and site exit router in [2]. \n   Furthermore, with some additional
    BGP operations, it can preserve \n   connectivity of on-going sessions regardless
    of ISP, intermediate \n   link, as well as directly connected site link failure.
