abstract:
- content: "<p>Some Internet Service Providers desire to be aware of more information
    about each packet, so that packets can be treated differently and efficiently.
    IPv6, with a large address space, allows semantics to be embedded into addresses.
    Routers can easily apply relevant operations accordingly. This document provides
    analysis on how to form semantic prefix and corresponding use cases, and identifies
    the technical requirements to maximize the benefits of the semantic prefix approach.
    It is recommended to use 4~12 bits in prefix for embedded semantics.</p>"
