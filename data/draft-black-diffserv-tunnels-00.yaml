abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft discusses the interaction of Differentiated Services(diffserv)
    [RFC-2474, RFC-2475] with IP tunnels of various forms.The discussion of tunnels
    in the diffserv architecture [RFC-2475]has been found to provide insufficient
    guidance to tunnel designersand implementers. With the aim of providing such guidance,
    thisdocument describes two conceptual models for the interaction ofdiffserv with
    IP tunnels and employs them to explore the resultingconfigurations and combinations
    of functionality. An importantconsideration is how and where diffserv traffic
    conditioning shouldbe performed in the presence of tunnel encapsulation/decapsulation.A
    few simple mechanisms are also proposed that limit the complexitythat tunnels
    would otherwise add to the diffserv trafficconditioning model; these mechanisms
    are also generally useful insituations where more general traffic conditioning
    is inappropriateor unavailable. Security considerations for IPsec tunnels placesome
    limits on possible functionality in some circumstances.WARNING: The current status
    of this draft is highly preliminary; itsmajor purpose is to foster discussion
    within the working group.Above and beyond the usual cautionary notice about not
    relying onInternet-Drafts, implementers are specifically warned thatsignificant
    changes are expected to the contents of this draft.</p>"
