abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The number of mobile users and their traffic demand is expected
    to be\n   ever-increasing in future years, and this growth can represent a\n   limitation
    for deploying current mobility management schemes that are\n   intrinsically centralized,
    e.g., Mobile IPv6 and Proxy Mobile IPv6.\n   For this reason it has been waved
    a need for distributed and dynamic\n   mobility management approaches, with the
    objective of reducing\n   operators' burdens, evolving to a cheaper and more efficient\n
    \  architecture.\n\n   This draft describes multiple solutions for network-based
    distributed\n   mobility management inspired by the well known Proxy Mobile IPv6.\n\n\n\t
