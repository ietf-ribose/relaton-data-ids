abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There can be M2M scenarios where responses from a server against\n
    \  requests from client are redundant. This kind of open-loop exchange\n   (with
    no response path from the server to the client) may be desired\n   to minimize
    resource consumption in constrained systems while\n   updating a bulk of resources
    simultaneously, or updating a resource\n   with a very high frequency. CoAP already
    provides a non-confirmable\n   (NON) mode of message exchange where the server
    end-point does not\n   respond with ACK. However, obeying the request/response
    semantics,\n   the server end-point responds back with a status code indicating\n
    \  \"the result of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request\".\n\n   This
    document introduces a header option for CoAP called 'No-\n   Response'. Using
    this option the client can explicitly tell the\n   server to suppress all responses
    against the particular request.\n   This option also provides granular control
    to enable suppression of\n   a particular class of response or a combination of
    response-classes.\n   This option may be effective for both unicast and multicast\n
    \  requests. This document also discusses a few exemplary applications\n   which
    benefit from this option.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
