abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes an extension to DNS Over HTTPS (DoH) that allows
    hiding client IP addresses via proxying encrypted DNS transactions. This improves
    privacy of DNS operations by not allowing any one server entity to be aware of
    both the client IP address and the content of DNS queries and answers. This experimental
    extension is developed outside the IETF and is published here to guide implementation,
    ensure interoperability among implementations, and enable wide-scale experimentation.</p>"
