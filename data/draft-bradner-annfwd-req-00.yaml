abstract:
- content: "<p>There are a number of situations in the Internet where it would be
    useful to be able to have an application be able to send traffic to a destination
    without revealing the IP address of the destination to the source, or the IP address
    of the source to the destination, or both. One way to do this is to have a network
    resident set of servers which can forward packets, with encryption and decryption
    applied to their source and destination addresses when appropriate. We will call
    this server an anonymizing forwarder.</p>"
