abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document presents an evaluation test suite for the initial
    assess-ment of proposed TCP modifications. The goal of the test suite is toallow
    researchers to quickly and easily evaluate their proposed TCPextensions in simulators
    and testbeds using a common set of well-defined, standard test cases, in order
    to compare and contrast proposalsagainst standard TCP as well as other proposed
    modifications. This testsuite is not intended to result in an exhaustive evaluation
    of a pro-posed TCP modification or new congestion control mechanism. Instead,
    thefocus is on quickly and easily generating an initial evaluation reportthat
    allows the networking community to understand and discuss thebehavioral aspects
    of a new proposal, in order to guide further experi-mentation that will be needed
    to fully investigate the specific aspectsof a new proposal.</p>"
