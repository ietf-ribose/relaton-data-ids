abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an automatic tunneling mechanism for\nproviding
    IPv4 connectivity service to end users over a service\nprovider's IPv6 network.
    \ During the long transition period from IPv4\nto IPv6-only, a service provider's
    network will have to support IPv6,\nbut will also have to maintain some IPv4 connectivity
    for a number of\ncustomers, for both outgoing and incoming connections, and for
    both\nexclusive and shared IPv4 addresses.  The 4rd solution (IPv4 Residual\nDeployment)
    is designed as a lightweight solution for this.\n\nIn some scenarios, 4rd can
    dispense ISPs from supporting any NAT in\ntheir networks.  In some others it can
    be used in parallel with NAT-\nbased solutions such as DS-lite and/or NAT64/DNS4.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
