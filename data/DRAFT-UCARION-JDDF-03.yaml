abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a format, called JSON Data Definition
    Format\n   (JDDF), for describing the shape of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)\n
    \  messages.  Its main goals are to enable code generation from schemas\n   as
    well as portable validation with standardized error indicators.\n   To this end,
    JDDF is strategically limited to be no more expressive\n   than the type systems
    of mainstream programming languages.  This\n   strategic limitation, as well as
    the decision to make JDDF schemas be\n   JSON documents, also makes tooling atop
    of JDDF easier to build.\n\n   This document does not have IETF consensus and
    is presented here to\n   facilitate experimentation with the concept of JDDF.\n\n\t
