abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This proposal allows host configuration to be split between two\ndifferent
    address servers, potentially under different\nadministration.\nThis ability may
    be useful to satisfy specific regulatory,\noperational or business model requirements,
    as well as to\nprovide support for secondary address servers.  This draft\nproposes
    a new DHCP option called the DHCP Next Server option.\nA DHCP server can use this
    option to redirect clients to a\nsecondary server. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
