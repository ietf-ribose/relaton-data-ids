abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are real-time applications requiring deterministic services
    in\n   terms of bandwidth and latency in various industries, such as network\n
    \  based AR/VR (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality), industrial\n   internet.
    \ This document proposes a solution which enhances DiffServ\n   in IPv6 to provide
    end to end bandwidth guaranteed service and\n   latency guaranteed service.\n\n\t
