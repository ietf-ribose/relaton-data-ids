abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operation of IP over tunnel virtual
    links\n   using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO).  AERO interfaces\n
    \  use an IPv6 link-local address format that supports operation of the\n   IPv6
    Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol and links ND to IP forwarding.\n   Prefix delegation
    services are employed to manage the routing system.\n   Dynamic multilink operation,
    mobility management, quality of service\n   (QoS) signaling and route optimization
    are naturally supported\n   through dynamic neighbor cache updates.  Standard
    IP multicasting\n   services are also supported.  AERO is a widely-applicable
    tunneling\n   solution especially well-suited to aviation services, mobile Virtual\n
    \  Private Networks (VPNs) and many other applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
