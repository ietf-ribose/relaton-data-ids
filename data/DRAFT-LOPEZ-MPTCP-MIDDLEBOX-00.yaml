abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As implementation of MPTCP continues to grow, there will be\n
    \  interaction concerns regarding MPTCP sessions relative to the\n   functionality
    of middleboxes, particularly those focused on network-\n   based security.  The
    purpose of this draft is to review this\n   interaction of MPTCp sessions and
    middleboxes, the likely response of\n   middlebox providers in dealing with any
    functional degradation due to\n   MPTCP, and the potential requirements to support
    proxy functionality\n   for MPTCP sessions.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
