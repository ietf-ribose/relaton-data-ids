abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent Discussions within the IETF and in other fora have highlighted\n
    \  differences in interpretation of the set of standards associated with\n   ENUM
    and DDDS, on which it relies.  Specifically, the operation and\n   semantics surrounding
    support for non-terminal NAPTRs has led to some\n   confusion.  This document
    is an attempt to add clarification to non-\n   terminal NAPTR processing.  In
    this, it clarifies RFC3403.  A\n   subsequent document will build on this one
    to extend RFC3761 further,\n   permitting registration of non-terminal Enumservices.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
