abstract:
- content: "<p>Link-state routing protocols suffer from excessive flooding in dense
    network topologies. Dynamic flooding [I-D.ietf-lsr-dynamic-flooding] alleviates
    the problem by decoupling the flooding topology from the physical topology. Link-state
    protocol updates are flooded only on the sparse flooding topology while data traffic
    is still forwarded on the physical topology. This document describes an algorithm
    to obtain a sparse subgraph from a dense graph. The resulting subgraph has certain
    desirable properties and can be used as a flooding topology in dynamic flooding.
    This document discloses the algorithm that we have developed in order to make
    it easier for other developers to implement similar algorithms. We do not claim
    that our algorithm is optimal, rather it is a pragmatic effort and we expect that
    further research and refinement can improve the results. We are not proposing
    that this algorithm be standardized, nor that the working group use this as a
    basis for further standardization work, however we have no objections if the working
    group chooses to do so.</p>"
