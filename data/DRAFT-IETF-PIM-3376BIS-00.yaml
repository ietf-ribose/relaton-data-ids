abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a revised Version 3 of the Internet
    Group\n   Management Protocol, IGMPv3.  IGMP is the protocol used by IPv4\n   systems
    to report their IP multicast group memberships to neighboring\n   multicast routers.
    \ Version 3 of IGMP adds support for source\n   filtering, that is, the ability
    for a system to report interest in\n   receiving packets only from specific source
    addresses, or from all\n   but specific source addresses, sent to a particular
    multicast\n   address.  That information may be used by multicast routing protocols\n
    \  to avoid delivering multicast packets from specific sources to\n   networks
    where there are no interested receivers.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 3376.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
