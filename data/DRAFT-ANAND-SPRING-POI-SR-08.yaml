abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document illustrates a way to integrate a new class of
    nodes and\n   links in segment routing to represent transport/optical networks
    in\n   an opaque way into the segment routing domain.  An instance of this\n   class
    would be optical networks that are typically transport centric\n   by having very
    few devices with the capability to process packets.\n   In the IP centric network,
    this will help in defining a common\n   control protocol for packet optical integration
    that will include\n   optical paths as 'transport segments' or sub-paths as an
    augmentation\n   to packet paths. The transport segment option also defines a
    general\n   mechanism to allow for future extensibility of segment routing into\n
    \  non-packet domains.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
