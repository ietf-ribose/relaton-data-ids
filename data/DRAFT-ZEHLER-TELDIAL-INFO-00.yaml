abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The \"tel\" URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) for Telephone Numbers\n[RFC3966]
    describes resources identified by telephone numbers.  These\nresources specify
    termination points within a public or private\ntelephone network. The termination
    points are a globally or locally\nunique endpoint.  RFC3966 does not address the
    means by which the\ntelephone URI can be used to reach termination point from
    a specific\nnode in the telephone network.\n\nThis document specifies the means
    by which the termination point is\nreached from a specific node in the telephone
    network. This document\nspecifies how to encode the numbers, symbols and pauses
    required to\ntraverse the phone network to reach the termination point in an RFC\n3966
    compliant \"tel\" URI.\n\t </p>\n      "
