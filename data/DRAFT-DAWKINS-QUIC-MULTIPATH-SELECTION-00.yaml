abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In QUIC working group discussions about proposals to use multiple\n
    \  paths, an obvious question came up - given multiple paths, how does\n   QUIC
    select paths to send packets over?\n\n   The answer to that question may inform
    decisions in the QUIC working\n   group about the scope of any multipath extensions
    considered for\n   experimentation and adoption.\n\n   This document is intended
    to summarize aspects of path selection from\n   those contributions and conversations.\n\n
    \  It is recognized that path selection is not the only important open\n   question
    about QUIC Multipath, but other open questions are out of\n   scope for this document.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
