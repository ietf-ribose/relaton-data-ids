abstract:
  content: <p>This document updates the session matching procedure defined insection
    7.3 of RFC 4975, so that an MSRP UA only uses the session-idpart of the MSRP URI
    in order to perform the consistency checks. Theupdate allows intermediate network
    entities (ALGs) to modify theaddress information in the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path
    attribute,without the need for the intermediate to terminate and do thecorrelating
    modifications in the associated MSRP messages.Status of this MemoThis Internet-Draft
