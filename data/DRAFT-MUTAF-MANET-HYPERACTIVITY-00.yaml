abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The optimization offered by reactive routing relies on the\n
    \  observation that under normal activity a host makes a low rate\n   of outgoing
    sessions to new or different hosts, and connections\n   are locally correlated.
    This contrasts the fundamental behavior\n   of address scanning worms that search
    for new hosts to infect at\n   high speeds. Consequently, each infected node will
    frequently\n   flood the network with route request messages targeted at\n   possibly
    non-existing addresses.\n\t </p>\n      "
