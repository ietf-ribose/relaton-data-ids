abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To diagnose performance and connectivity problems, metrics
    on real\n   (non-synthetic) transmission are critical for timely end-to-end\n
    \  problem resolution. Such diagnostics may be real-time or after the\n   fact,
    but must not impact an operational production network. These\n   metrics are defined
    in the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics\n   Destination Option (PDM). The
    base metrics are: packet sequence\n   number and packet timestamp. Other metrics
    may be derived from these\n   for use in diagnostics.  This document specifies
    such metrics, their\n   calculation, and usage.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
