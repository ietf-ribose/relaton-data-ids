abstract:
- content: <p>This draft describes a generic associated channel header (GE-ACH) that
    provides a control channel associated with an MPLS LSP, pseudowire or MPLS section.
    The VCCV ACH defined for PWs in RFC 5085 is generalized to allow a larger set
    of control channel and OAM functions to be used to meet the requirements of packet
    transport and other applications of MPLS. Conventions used in this document The
    key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC-2119 [1].</p>
