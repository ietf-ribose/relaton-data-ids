abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The extension described in this document allows a pair of PEs\n
    \  connected via an Ethernet Pseudowire (PW) to signal via the use of\n   the
    Control Word (CW) whether the Ethernet frame encapsulated is\n   coming from a
    Root AC or a Leaf AC. This allows a PE receiving this\n   frame to decide whether
    it can be forwarded to a Leaf AC or not.\n   Such forward or drop decision is
    an additional filtering action\n   after the MAC-based forwarding decision. This
    applies to both P2P PW\n   and P2MP PW.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
