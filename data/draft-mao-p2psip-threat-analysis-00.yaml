abstract:
  content: "<p>This document provides a threat analysis for peer-to-peer networks,where
    the system relies on each individual peer to route message,store data, and provide
    services. The threats against P2P networkinclude those that target individual
    peers, those that target routingprotocol, those that target identity management,
    and those thattarget stored data. Focusing on distributed hash table based P2Pnetwork,
    we first establish a threat model and perform a triage ofvarious assets in a P2P
    system. We then describe each individualthreat in details, including threat description,
    impact of attack,and possible mitigations. The threats and mitigations are discussedunder
    the context of feasibility and practicality, with the ultimategoal of achieving
    better understanding of the threats for secure P2Psystem design.</p>"
