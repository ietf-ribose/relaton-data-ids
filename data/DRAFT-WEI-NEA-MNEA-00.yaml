abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A method for mutual network endpoint assessment is introduced
    in this\ndocument.  In current NEA requirements, only the assessment performed\nby
    network owner is described.  However, for some applications like\nonline business
    and file sharing, the unilateral assessment is not\nenough to ensure the two communication
    parties are both secure\nEspecially in P2P application, the endpoints perform
    equal\nresponsibility and hence the mutual network endpoint assessment seems\nmore
    necessary. each endpoint may configure its security assessment\npolicy based on
    its own security concerns. .\n\t </p>\n      "
