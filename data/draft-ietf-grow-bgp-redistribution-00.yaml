abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes the redistribution extended community. Thisnew
    extended community allows a router to influence how a specificroute should be
    redistributed towards a specified set of eBGPspeakers. Several types of redistribution
    communities are proposed.The first type may be used to indicate that a specific
    route shouldnot be announced over a specified set of eBGP sessions. The secondtype
    may be used to indicate that the attached route should only beannounced with the
    NO_EXPORT community over the specified set of eBGPsessions and the third type
    may be used to indicate that the attachedroute should be prepended n times when
    announced over a specified setof eBGP sessions.</p>"
