abstract:
- content: "<p>As the Internet has grown, many services with high availability requirements
    have emerged. The requirements of these services have increased the demands on
    the reliability of the infrastructure on which those services rely. Many techniques
    have been employed to increase the availability of services deployed on the Internet.
    This document presents operational experience of wide-scale service distribution
    using anycast, and proposes a series of recommendations for others using this
    approach.</p>"
