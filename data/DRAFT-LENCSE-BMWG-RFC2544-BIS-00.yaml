abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 2544 has defined a benchmarking methodology for network\n
    \  interconnect devices.  We recommend a few upgrades to it for\n   producing
    more reasonable results.  The recommended upgrades can be\n   classified into
    two categories: the application of the novelties of\n   RFC 8219 for the legacy
    RFC 2544 use cases and the following new\n   ones.  Checking a reasonably small
    timeout individually for every\n   single frame in the throughput and frame loss
    rate benchmarking\n   procedures.  Performing a statistically relevant number
    of tests for\n   all benchmarking procedures.  Addition of an optional non-zero
    frame\n   loss acceptance criterion for the throughput measurement procedure\n
    \  and defining its reporting format.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
