abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Universally Unique Identifier is a suitable standard for,
    as the\n   name suggests, uniquely identifying entities in a symbol space large\n
    \  enough that the identifiers do not collide.  The literal\n   representation,
    however, specified in RFC 4122 and elsewhere, cannot\n   be used in conjunction
    with a number of formal grammars where it\n   would be beneficial to do so.  This
    document provides the UUID with\n   two additional representations to make these
    applications possible.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
