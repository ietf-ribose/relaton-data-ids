abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current local repair mechanism, e.g., TI-LFA, allows local
    repair\n   actions on the direct neighbors of the failed node to temporarily\n
    \  route traffic to the destination.  This mechanism could not work\n   properly
    when the failure happens in the destination point or the\n   link connected to
    the destination.  In SRv6 TE, the IPv6 destination\n   address in the outer IPv6
    header could be the dedicated endpoint of\n   the TE path rather than the destination
    of the TE path.  When the\n   endpoint fails, local repair couldn't work on the
    direct neighbor of\n   the failed endpoint either.  This document defines midpoint\n
    \  protection, which enables the direct neighbor of the failed endpoint\n   to
    do the function of the endpoint, replace the IPv6 destination\n   address to the
    other endpoint, and choose the next hop based on the\n   new destination address.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
