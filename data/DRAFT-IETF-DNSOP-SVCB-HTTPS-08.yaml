abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the \"SVCB\" and \"HTTPS\" DNS resource
    record\n   (RR) types to facilitate the lookup of information needed to make\n
    \  connections to network services, such as for HTTP origins.  SVCB\n   records
    allow a service to be provided from multiple alternative\n   endpoints, each with
    associated parameters (such as transport\n   protocol configuration and keys for
    encrypting the TLS ClientHello).\n   They also enable aliasing of apex domains,
    which is not possible with\n   CNAME.  The HTTPS RR is a variation of SVCB for
    use with HTTP [HTTP].\n   By providing more information to the client before it
    attempts to\n   establish a connection, these records offer potential benefits
    to\n   both performance and privacy.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED: This document is being
    collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/MikeBishop/dns-alt-svc\n
    \  (https://github.com/MikeBishop/dns-alt-svc).  The most recent working\n   version
    of the document, open issues, etc. should all be available\n   there.  The authors
    (gratefully) accept pull requests.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
