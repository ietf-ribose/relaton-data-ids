abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Domain Name System (DNS) was designed to return matching
    records\n   efficiently for queries for data that are relatively static.  When\n
    \  those records change frequently, DNS is still efficient at returning\n   the
    updated results when polled, as long as the polling rate is not\n   too high.
    \ But there exists no mechanism for a client to be\n   asynchronously notified
    when these changes occur.  This document\n   defines a mechanism for a client
    to be notified of such changes to\n   DNS records, called DNS Push Notifications.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
