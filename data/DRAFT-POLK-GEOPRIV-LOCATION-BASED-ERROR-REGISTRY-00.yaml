abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document IANA registers a list of GEOPRIV location-specific
    \n   error response indications, to be used by signaling protocols \n   describing
    a location-based error experienced by an intermediary or \n   recipient endsystem.
    \ For example, the registered values here can be\n   placed in a SIP Reason header
    contained within a 424 (Bad Location \n   Information) response, or in a Location-to-Service
    Translation \n   (LoST) query failure, giving specific meaning to the reason for
    the \n   error.  This additional information is to provide the location \n   transmitter
    more granular information about what was wrong with the \n   supplied location
    in the original request message.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
