abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Point to point (P2P) communication between arbitrary IPv6 routers
    and\nhosts in a Low power and Lossy Network (LLN) is a key requirement for\nmany
    applications.  RPL, the IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs,\nconstrains the LLN topology
    to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and\nrequires the P2P routing to take place
    along the DAG links.  Such P2P\nroutes may be significantly suboptimal and may
    lead to traffic\ncongestion near the DAG root.  This document describes a P2P
    route\ndiscovery mechanism complementary to RPL base functionality.  This\nmechanism
    allows an RPL-aware IPv6 router or host to discover and\nestablish on demand one
    or more routes to another RPL-aware IPv6\nrouter or host in the LLN such that
    the discovered routes meet the\nspecified cost criteria.\n\t </p>\n      "
