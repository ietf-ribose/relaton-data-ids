abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to provide IPsec-based flow protection
    (integrity and confidentiality) by means of an Interface to Network Security Function
    (I2NSF) controller. It considers two main well- known scenarios in IPsec: (i)
    gateway-to-gateway and (ii) host-to- host. The service described in this document
    allows the configuration and monitoring of IPsec Security Associations (SAs) from
    a I2NSF Controller to one or several flow-based Network Security Functions (NSFs)
    that rely on IPsec to protect data traffic. The document focuses on the I2NSF
    NSF-facing interface by providing YANG data models for configuring the IPsec databases
    (SPD, SAD, PAD) and IKEv2. This allows IPsec SA establishment with minimal intervention
    by the network administrator. It does not define any new protocol.</p>"
