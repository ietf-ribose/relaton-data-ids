abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The proposed 3GPP's 5G core nextgen architecture (5GC) offers\n
    \  flexibility to introduce new user and control plane function,\n   considering
    the support for network slicing functions, that allows\n   greater flexibility
    to handle heterogeneous devices and applications.\n   In this draft, we provide
    a short description of the proposed 5GC\n   architecture, followed by extensions
    to 5GC's control and user plane\n   to support packet data unit (PDU) sessions
    from information-centric\n   networks.  The value of enabling ICN in 5GC is discussed
    using\n   multiple service scenarios in the context of mobile edge computing\n
    \  such as smart mobility and VR use case, and to enable network\n   services
    such as seamless mobility for ICN sessions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
