abstract:
  content: "<p>This document captures problems and issues discovered on the SIGTRANmailing
    list and at future bakeoffs for IUA [RFC3057]. This document will be updated after
    each bakeoff augmenting the existing draft to include any new issues discovered
    during inter-operability testing. Two basic sets of problems are identified by
    this draft: first, issuesthat need to be addressed when the next revision of IUA
    is created,i.e. issues that should be remembered in a BIS document; second,issues
    that were found that are strictly implementation problems.</p>"
