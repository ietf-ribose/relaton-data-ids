abstract:
  content: "<p>The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is developing thecapability
    to support different communication services on IPMultimedia Subsystem (IMS) as
    a SIP infrastructure, such as push-to-talk over cellular (PoC), Multimedia Telephony
    or IMS messaging. Asthere are different services and is not safe to rely on the
    expressedmedia as a means to identify the requested communication servicebecause
    the media may be used in different communication services,then there is the need
    to have an unambiguous way of identifyingcommunication services and applications
    utilizing the logic ofcommunication services as explicitly as possible. In this
    document,we express the requirements identified by 3GPP to support theidentification
    of communication services and applications on aSession Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    infrastructure and IMS applicationsusing them.</p>"
