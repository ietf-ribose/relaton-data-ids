abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines application service tags that allow service
    \nlocation without relying on rigid domain naming conventions, and DNS \nprocedures
    for discovering servers which provide Mobility Services. \nMobility Services are
    used to assist an MN in handover preparation \n(network discovery) and handover
    decision (network selection). The \nservices addressed by this document are the
    Media Independent \nHandover Services defined in [1].\n\t </p>\n      "
