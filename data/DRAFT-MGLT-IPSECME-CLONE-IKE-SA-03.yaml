abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document considers a VPN End User setting a VPN with a
    security\n   gateway where at least one of the peers has multiple interfaces.\n\n
    \  With the current IKEv2 protocol, the outer IP addresses of the VPN\n   are
    determined by those used by IKEv2 SA.  As a result using multiple\n   interfaces
    requires to set up an IKEv2 SA on each interface, or on\n   each paths if both
    the VPN Client and the security gateway have\n   multiple interfaces.  Setting
    each IKEv2 SA involves authentications\n   which might require multiple round
    trips as well as activity from the\n   VPN User and thus would delay the VPN establishment.
    \ In addition\n   multiple authentications unnecessarily increase the load on
    the VPN\n   client and the authentication infrastructure.\n\n   This document
    presents the Clone IKE SA extension, where an\n   additional IKEv2 SA is derived
    from an existing IKEv2 SA.  The newly\n   created IKEv2 SA is set without the
    IKEv2 authentication exchange.\n   The newly created IKEv2 SA can later be assigned
    to another interface\n   using MOBIKE protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
