abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (SR-TE) supports explicit
    paths\n   using segment lists containing adjacency-SIDs, node-SIDs and binding-\n
    \  SIDs.  The current SR FRR such as TI-LFA provides fast re-route\n   protection
    for the failure of a node along a SR-TE path by the direct\n   neighbor or say
    point of local repair (PLR) to the failure.  However,\n   once the IGP converges,
    the SR FRR is no longer sufficient to forward\n   traffic of the path around the
    failure, since the non-neighbors of\n   the failure will no longer have a route
    to the failed node.  This\n   document describes a mechanism for fast re-route
    protection against\n   the failure of a SR-TE path after the IGP converges.  It
    provides\n   fast re-route protection for an adjacency segment, a node segment
    and\n   a binding segment of the path.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
