abstract:
  content: "<p>This text describes current practice for the command/response protocol
    used in the management of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units and other power
    devices often used in small offices, and in IT installations subject to an erratic
    public power supply. The UPS units typically interface to an Attachment Daemon
    in the system they protect. This daemon is in turn polled by a Management Daemon
    which notifies users and system administrators of power supply incidents, and
    takes system shutdown decisions. The commands and responses described by this
    text are exchanged between the UPS Attachment Daemon and the Management Daemon.
    Current practice leads to weak security and this is addressed in the Security
    and IANA Considerations.</p>"
