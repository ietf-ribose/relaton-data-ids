abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an protocol used to negotiate media
    between\n   browsers or other compatible devices.  This protocol provides the\n
    \  state machinery needed to implement the offer/answer model (RFC\n   3264),
    and defines the semantics and necessary attributes of messages\n   that must be
    exchanged.  The protocol uses an abstract transport in\n   that it does not actually
    define how these messages are exchanged.\n   Rather, such exchanges are handled
    through web-based transports like\n   HTTP or WebSockets.  The protocol focuses
    solely on media negotiation\n   and does not handle call control, call processing,
    or other\n   functions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
