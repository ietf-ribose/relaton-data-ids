abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) specification
    defined two stateful options, IA_NA and IA_TA, but did not anticipate the development
    of additional stateful options. DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation added the IA_PD option,
    which is stateful. Applications that use IA_NA and IA_PD together have revealed
    issues that need to be addressed. This document updates RFCs 3315 and 3633 to
    address these issues.</p>"
