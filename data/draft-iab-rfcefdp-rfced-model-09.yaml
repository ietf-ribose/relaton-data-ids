abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies version 3 of the RFC Editor Model. The model
    defines two high-level tasks related to the RFC Series. First, policy definition
    is the joint responsibility of the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces
    policy proposals, and the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB), which approves such
    proposals. Second, policy implementation is primarily the responsibility of the
    RFC Production Center (RPC) as contractually overseen by the IETF Administration
    Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC). This document obsoletes RFC 8728. This document
    updates RFC 7841, RFC 8729, and RFC 8730.</p>"
