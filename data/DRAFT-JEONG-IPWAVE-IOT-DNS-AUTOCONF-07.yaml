abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for device\n
    \  discovery and service discovery in IP-based vehicular networks.\n   Through
    the device discovery, this document supports the global (or\n   local) DNS naming
    of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, such as\n   sensors, actuators, and in-vehicle
    units.  By this scheme, the DNS\n   name of an IoT device can be autoconfigured
    with the device's model\n   information in wired and wireless target networks
    (e.g., vehicle,\n   road network, home, office, shopping mall, and smart grid).
    \ Through\n   the service discovery, IoT users (e.g., drivers, passengers, home\n
    \  residents, and customers) in the Internet (or local network) can\n   easily
    identify each device for monitoring and remote-controlling it\n   in a target
    network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
