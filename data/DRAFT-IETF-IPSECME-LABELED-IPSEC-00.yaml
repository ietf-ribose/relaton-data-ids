abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines two new Traffic Selector (TS) Types for\n
    \  Internet Key Exchange version 2 to add support for Mandatory Access\n   Control
    (MAC) security labels, also known as \"Labeled IPsec\".  The\n   two new TS Types
    are TS_IPV4_ADDR_RANGE_SECLABEL and\n   TS_IPV6_ADDR_RANGE_SECLABEL, which are
    identical to their non-\n   seclabel namesakes except for the addition of a variable
    length\n   opaque field specifying the security label.  These new Traffic\n   Selector
    Types facilitate negotiating security labels as an\n   additional selector of
    the Security Policy Database to further\n   restrict the type of traffic allowed
    to be send and received over the\n   IPsec SA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
