abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) set up in Multiprotocol Label Switching\n
    \  (MPLS) networks can be used to form Forwarding Adjacency (FA) links\n   that
    carry traffic in those networks.  An FA link can be assigned\n   Traffic Engineering
    (TE) parameters that allow other LSR(s) to\n   include it in their constrained
    path computation.  FA link(s) can be\n   also assigned Segment-Routing (SR) segments
    that enable the steering\n   of traffic on to the associated FA link(s).  The
    TE and SR attributes\n   of an FA link can be advertised using known protocols
    that carry link\n   state information.  This document elaborates on the usage
    of FA\n   link(s) and their attributes in SR enabled networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
