abstract:
- content: "<p>There is an issue with SMTP that RFC 1047 raised in 1988. The time
    between a SMTP client submitting a mail object and the SMTP server responding
    to the request can be arbitrarily long. SMTP addresses this issue by a hack, hoping
    that the SMTP server responds fast enough and the SMTP client waits long enough
    to find out if the submission was successful.</p>"
