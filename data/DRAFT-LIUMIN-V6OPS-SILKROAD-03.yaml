abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The growth of IPv6 networks started mainly using the transport\n
    \  facilities offered by the current Internet. This led to the\n   development
    of several techniques to manage IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels.\n   However, classic tunneling
    methods do not work when the IPv6 \n   candidate node is isolated behind a Network
    Address Translator (NAT)\n   device. We propose here a service, called Silkroad,
    to enable nodes\n   located behind one or several IPv4 NATs to obtain IPv6 connectivity.\n
    \  It can provide IPv6 connectivity through all existing NAT types and\n   does
    not require any update of them. In addition, Silkroad could\n   provide managed
    IPv6 prefixes with path optimized routing directly\n   between clients.\n\t </p>\n
