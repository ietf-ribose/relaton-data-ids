abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end\n
    \  paths within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of\n   topological
    sub-paths, called \"segments\".  These segments are\n   advertised by the link-state
    routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF).  And\n   a segment is identified by a Segment
    Routing ID (SID).  This document\n   proposes a method to reduce the SID configuration
    in a SR domain.\n   Only the selected SR nodes which named Segment Routing Management\n
    \  Nodes (SRMNs) are configured by NMS, while other SRs in the domain\n   need
    zero-SR-configuration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
