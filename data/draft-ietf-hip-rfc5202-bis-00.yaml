abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo specifies an Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) basedmechanism
    for transmission of user data packets, to be used with theHost Identity Protocol
    (HIP).IESG NoteThe following issues describe IESG concerns about this document.
    TheIESG expects that these issues will be addressed when future versionsof HIP
    are designed.In case of complex Security Policy Databases (SPDs) and the co-existence
    of HIP and security-related protocols such as IKE,implementors may encounter conditions
    that are unspecified in thesedocuments. For example, when the SPD defines an IP
    address subnet tobe protected and a HIP host is residing in that IP address area,there
    is a possibility that the communication is encrypted multipletimes. Readers are
    advised to pay special attention when running HIPwith complex SPD settings. Future
    specifications should clearlydefine when multiple encryption is intended, and
    when it should beavoided.</p>"
