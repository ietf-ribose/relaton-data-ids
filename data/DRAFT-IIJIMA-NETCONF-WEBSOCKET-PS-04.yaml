abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo proposes a way of transporting NETCONF over WebSocket\n
    \  protocol.  Web-related technologies are advancing and number of Web-\n   based
    systems are increasing.  Management systems that adopt Web-\n   related technologies
    or that have browser-based management interface\n   are getting common.  It is
    natural to expect that there is a standard\n   network operation and management
    protocol to be used over HTTP.\n   Currently, however, there are few efforts in
    this area.  Although\n   NETCONF[RFC6241] once defined itself to be sent over
    SOAP/\n   HTTPS[RFC4743], supposedly due to unfamiliarity to SOAP or lack of\n
    \  bi-directional capability, such efforts aren't successful\n   enough[I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc4743-rfc4744-to-historic].
    \ But now,\n   WebSocket protocol, the update of HTTP equipped with bi-directional\n
    \  capability, is available[RFC6455].  This memo describes how NETCONF\n   should
    be treated over WebSocket protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
