abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an experimental protocol and new DNS
    Resource\n   Record that can be used to provide a message digest over DNS zone\n
    \  data.  The ZONEMD Resource Record conveys the message digest data in\n   the
    zone itself.  When a zone publisher includes an ZONEMD record,\n   recipients
    can verify the zone contents for accuracy and\n   completeness.  This provides
    assurance that received zone data\n   matches published data, regardless of how
    the zone data has been\n   transmitted and received.\n\n   ZONEMD is not designed
    to replace DNSSEC.  Whereas DNSSEC protects\n   individual RRSets (DNS data with
    fine granularity), ZONEMD protects\n   protects a zone's data as a whole, whether
    consumed by authoritative\n   name servers, recursive name servers, or any other
    applications.\n\n   As specified at this time, ZONEMD is not designed for use
    in large,\n   dynamic zones due to the time and resources required for digest\n
    \  calculation.  The ZONEMD record described in this document includes\n   fields
    reserved for future work to support large, dynamic zones.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
