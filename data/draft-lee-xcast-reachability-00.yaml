  content: "<p>It can be important to know which node has Explicit multicastreceivability
    and routability before sending a large amount of datatraffic in Explicit multicast.
    This document provides how to testthe receivability and routability, in short,
    the reachability ofExplicit multicast packets to a particular node.</p>"
