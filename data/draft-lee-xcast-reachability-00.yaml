abstract:
- content: "<p>It can be important to know which node has Explicit multicast receivability
    and routability before sending a large amount of data traffic in Explicit multicast.
    This document provides how to test the receivability and routability, in short,
    the reachability of Explicit multicast packets to a particular node.</p>"
