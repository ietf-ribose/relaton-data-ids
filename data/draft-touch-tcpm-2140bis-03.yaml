abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes interdependent TCP control blocks, where part of
    the TCP state is shared among similar concurrent or consecutive connections. TCP
    state includes a combination of parameters, such as connection state, current
    round-trip time estimates, congestion control information, and process information.
    Most of this state is maintained on a per-connection basis in the TCP Control
    Block (TCB), but implementations can (and do) share certain TCB information across
    connections to the same host. Such sharing is intended to improve overall transient
    transport performance, while maintaining backward-compatibility with existing
    implementations. The sharing described herein is limited to only the TCB initialization
    and so has no effect on the long-term behavior of TCP after a connection has been
    established.</p>"
