abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an attack model and discusses threats
    for the\n   Web PKI context in which security mechanisms to detect mis-issuance\n
    \  of web site certificates are being developed.  The model provides an\n   analysis
    of detection and remediation mechanisms for both syntactic\n   and semantic mis-issuance.
    \ The model introduces an outline of\n   attacks to organize the discussion.  The
    model also describes the\n   roles played by the elements of the Certificate Transparency
    (CT)\n   system, to establish a context for the model.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
