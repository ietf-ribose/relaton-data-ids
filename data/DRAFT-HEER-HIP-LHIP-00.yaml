abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Lightweight authentication extension
    for\n   the Host Identifier Protocol (LHIP).  The goal of LHIP is to reduce\n
    \  the computational requirements of the Host Identifier Protocol (HIP),\n   thus,
    making its benefits, such as end-host mobility and multihoming,\n   accessible
    to CPU-restricted devices.  LHIP reduces the computational   cost of establishing,
    updating, and closing a HIP association by\n   providing an alternative way of
    signing and verifying HIP control\n   packets which is based on computationally
    inexpensive hash function\n   computations and hash chains.  However, LHIP does
    not provide nor\n   does it aim at providing the same level of security as HIP
    does.\n   Especially, host authentication and payload encryption are not\n   possible.
    \ The LHIP extensions in this draft specify also mechanisms\n   for dynamic transitioning
    between lightweight and full HIP\n   associations on the fly.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
