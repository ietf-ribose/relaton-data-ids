abstract:
  content: "\t <t>STUN (Simple Traversal of UDP for NATS) specifies a mechanism whichenables
    nodes in a private network to determine if they are behind aNAT, to discover their
    remapped address and port, and for many typesof NATs to send UDP traffic through
    them. In addition TCPconnections initiated from the private side of NATs already
    works.This document specifies requirements for a mechanism that enablestraversal
    of expected TCP traffic through all NATs, and traversal ofUDP traffic through
    symmetric NATs.</p>"
