abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This document describes the need for information in the email
    client\n    whether the recieved email was send by telnet to a mail server by
    strangers\n    and a way to configure the email clients to not to show such emails.Emails\n
    \   of financial importance should not be send using this method.SPAMMING is\n
    \   a distraction.If i get 10 SPAM for one authentic email, then i would not\n
    \   be able to pay attention to the authentic email.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
