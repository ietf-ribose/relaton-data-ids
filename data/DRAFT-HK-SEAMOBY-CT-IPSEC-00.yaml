abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are a large number of IP access networks where one may wish
    to \nprovide security for end user traffic, or secure the access network \nfrom
    unauthorized traffic.  One protocol which may be used to \nprovide these services
    is IPSec, which requires a node to establish \na security association with the
    access network in order to obtain \nthese services.  Traditionally, such an association
    is considered \nstatic, however, there are many situations in which the ability
    to \nmove an IPSec security association (SA) from one security gateway \n(SG)
    to another within the access network may be beneficial. \nExamples of this include
    IPSec handover in mobile LANs and PANs, \nload-balancing between IPSec SGs, and
    fail-over applications where \nhigh-availability is required.\n\t </p>\n      "
