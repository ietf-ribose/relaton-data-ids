abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The 6rd tunnel MTU is currently recommended to be set to 1480.
    \ This\n   is to avoid IPv4 fragmentation within the tunnel, but requires the\n
    \  6rd tunnel ingress to drop any IPv6 packet larger than 1480 bytes and\n   return
    an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) message.  Concerns for\n   operational issues with
    both IPv4 and IPv6 Path MTU Discovery point\n   to the possibility of MTU-related
    black holes when a packet is\n   dropped due to an MTU restriction.  Fortunately,
    the \"Internet cell\n   size\" is 1500 bytes (i.e., the minimum MTU configured
    by the vast\n   majority of links in the Internet) so if the 6rd tunnel can be
    made\n   to support at least this size MTU issues are alleviated.  This\n   document
    specifies methods that can be employed to support these\n   larger sizes.\n\n\t
