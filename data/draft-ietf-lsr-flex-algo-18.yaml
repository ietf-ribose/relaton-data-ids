abstract:
- content: "<p>IGP protocols traditionally compute best paths over the network based
    on the IGP metric assigned to the links. Many network deployments use RSVP-TE
    based or Segment Routing based Traffic Engineering to steer traffic over a path
    that is computed using different metrics or constraints than the shortest IGP
    path. This document proposes a solution that allows IGPs themselves to compute
    constraint-based paths over the network. This document also specifies a way of
    using Segment Routing (SR) Prefix-SIDs and SRv6 locators to steer packets along
    the constraint-based paths.</p>"
