abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 is widely used on the internet today and is expected to be deployed
    more as more devices (i.e. home automation) get inter- connected. The IPv6 header
    format allows for the use of Extension Headers (EH). EHs could be chained together
    with very few existing guidelines by the IPv6 protocol on how devices should parse
    them, which open room for security concerns and inconsistencies. This document
    presents guidelines for parsing IPv6 EHs with a goal of providing a common and
    consistent parsing methodology for IPv6 implementers among the industry.</p>"
