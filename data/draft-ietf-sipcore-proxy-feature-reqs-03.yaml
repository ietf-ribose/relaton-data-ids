    defined in RFC 3840 provides a mechanism that allows a SIP message to convey information
    relating to the originator's supported features/ capabilities. This document defines
    requirements for a mechanism that would allow SIP proxies to convey information
    relating to the proxy's supported features/capabilities.</p>
