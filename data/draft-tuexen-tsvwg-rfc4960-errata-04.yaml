abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a compilation of issues found since the publication
    of RFC4960 in September 2007 based on experience with implementing, testing, and
    using SCTP along with the suggested fixes. This document provides deltas to RFC4960
    and is organized in a time based way. The issues are listed in the order they
    were brought up. Because some text is changed several times the last delta in
    the text is the one which should be applied. In addition to the delta a description
    of the problem and the details of the solution are also provided.</p>"
