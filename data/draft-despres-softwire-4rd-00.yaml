abstract:
- content: "<p>During the long transition period from IPv4-only to IPv6-only, networks
    will have not only to deploy the IPv6 service but also to maintain some IPv4 connectivity
    for a number of customers, and this for both outgoing and incoming connections
    and for both customer- individual and shared IPv4 addresses. The 4rd solution
    (IPv4 Residual Deployment) is designed as a lightweight solution for this. It
    applies not only to ISPs have IPv6-only routing networks, but also to those that,
    during early transition stages, have IPv4-only routing, with 6rd to offer the
    IPv6 service, those that have dual- stack routing networks but with private IPv4
    addresses assigned to customers. In some scenarios, 4rd can dispense ISPs from
    supporting any NAT in their infrastructures. In some others it can be used in
    parallel with NAT-based solutions such as DS-lite and/or NAT64/DNS4 which achieve
    better IPv4-address sharing ratios (but at a price of significantly higher operational
    complexity).</p>"
