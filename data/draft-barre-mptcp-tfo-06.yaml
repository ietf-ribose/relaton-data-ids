abstract:
  content: "<p>TCP Fast Open (TFO) is a TCP extension that allows sending data in
    the SYN, instead of waiting until the TCP connection is established. This document
    describes what parts of Multipath TCP must be adapted to support it, and how TFO
    and MPTCP can operate together.</p>"
