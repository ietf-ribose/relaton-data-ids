abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a high-level technical description of
    the xvc\n   video codec.  The xvc video codec is a novel video codec that was\n
    \  released in its first version in September 2017.  This document\n   provides
    some technical information as well as a discussion section\n   around how the
    xvc codec meets the objectives of the NETVC Working\n   Group.  The document also
    includes results comparing a recent\n   revision of xvc with recent revisions
    of AV1 and HM for three\n   different test cases; All-Intra, single pass Random-Access,
    and\n   multi-pass Random-Access.  The average compression gain (BD-rate for\n
    \  PSNR-Y) for xvc ranges from 3% to 20% for the different test cases.\n\n\t </p>\n
