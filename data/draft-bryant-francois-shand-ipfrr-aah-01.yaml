abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IPFRR and loop-free convergence techniques can deal with singletopology
    change events, multiple correlated change events, and insome cases even certain
    uncorrelated events. However, in all casesthere are events which cannot be dealt
    with and the mechanism needsto quickly revert to normal convergence. This is known
    as\"Abandoning All Hope\" (AAH). This document describes the nature ofthe problem,
    and various proposed mechanisms to deal with it.</p>"
