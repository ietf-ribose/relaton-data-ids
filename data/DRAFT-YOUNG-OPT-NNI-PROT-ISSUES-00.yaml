  content: "\n\t <p>Optical path recovery is an important commercial driver behind
    the \ndevelopment and deployment of switched optical networks.  \nTimely fault
    notification for optical path protection purposes \nimposes many requirements
    on control plane signalling. Many of these \nrequirements can be supported by
    IETF protocols, although some are \nin very early phases.\n\t </p>\n      "
