abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As telephone services migrate to the Internet, Internet applications\n
    \  require access to diverse information about telephone numbers.  ENUM,\n   for
    example, applied the DNS to the problem of finding URIs for\n   telephone services
    on the Internet.  The intrinsic limitations in the\n   query/response semantics
    of the DNS, however, have often been\n   strained by the requirements for accessing
    information about\n   telephone numbers.  This document therefore proposes a protocol-\n
    \  independent framework and information model for querying and\n   responding
    to requests concerning telephone numbers and call routing\n   that allows a richer
    expression of both questions and answers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
