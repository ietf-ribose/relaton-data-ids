abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the DNS Proxy that is separated from NAT-PT\n[RFC2766].
    \ NAT-PT was designed to work with DNS Application Level\nGateway.  However [RFC4966]
    pointed out DNS related issues, and\n[RFC2766] was changed to historical state.
    \ This document attempts to\nDNS Proxy specification, removing dependency on NAT-PT
    as well as\nresolving problems pointed in [RFC4966].\n\t </p>\n      "
