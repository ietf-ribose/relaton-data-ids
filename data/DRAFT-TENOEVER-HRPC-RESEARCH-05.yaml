abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The proliferating convolution of Internet and society increases
    the\n   impact of the Internet on the lives of individuals.  Because of this,\n
    \  the design and development of the architecture of the Internet also\n   has
    a growing impact on society.  This has led to an broad\n   recognition that human
    rights [UDHR] [ICCPR] [ICESCR] have a role in\n   the development and management
    of the Internet [HRC2012] [UNGA2013]\n   [NETmundial].  It has also been argued
    that the Internet should be\n   strengthened as a human rights enabling environment
    [Brown].\n\n   This document provides a proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the\n
    \  relation between human rights and Internet protocols, an overview of\n   the
    discussion in technical and academic literature and communities,\n   a proposal
    for the mapping of the relation between human rights and\n   technical concepts,
    and a proposal for guidelines for human rights\n   considerations, similar to
    the work done on the guidelines for\n   privacy considerations [RFC6973].\n\n
