abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes an experimental method for authentication
    and\nkeyexchange in the Secure Shell protocol.\nThe main virtue of the SRP protocol
    [SRP] is that it provides\nauthentication based on a small secret (typically a
    password). It is\nuseful in situations where no authentic host key is known. For
    Secure\nShell, it can be used as a bootstrapping procedure to get the host\nkey
    of a server in a safe way. SRP also provides authentication of\nthe user, which
    means that it might make sense to either skip the\nsecsh 'ssh-userauth'-service
    [SSH-USERAUTH] when using SRP, or allow\nlogin with the 'none' or 'external-keyx'
    method.\n\t </p>\n      "
