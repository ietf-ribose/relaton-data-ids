abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Common Presence and Instant Messaging profile (CPIM) is a
    set of\nsyntax and semantics for instant messaging (IM) and online presence\nservices,
    independent of the underlying transfer infrastructure.  The\nSession Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) negotiates session information for\nmedia streams.  This memo defines
    a BEEP profile, IMSX, for\nexchanging CPIM messages after SIP has performed signalling.\n\t
