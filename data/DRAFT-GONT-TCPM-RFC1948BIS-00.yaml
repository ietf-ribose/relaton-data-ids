abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an algorithm for the generation of TCP\nInitial
    Sequence Numbers (ISNs), such that the chances of an off-path\nattacker of guessing
    the sequence numbers in use by a target\nconnection are reduced.  This document
    is a revision of RFC 1948, and\ntakes the ISN generation algorithm originally
    proposed in that\ndocument to Standards Track.\n\t </p>\n      "
