abstract:
  content: "<p>IPsec suite has been designed to secure communication between twonodes.
    Security is performed at the network layer, and there arealmost no interactions
    between applications and the IPsec layer. Themain motivation of this API is to
    enable any applications to interactwith the IPsec layer and to take advantage
    of the security deployedin IPsec suite. This draft lists applications requirements
    withregard to the IPsec suite, and we tried not to limit the requirementsto today's
    application requirements, but also to consider futureapplications' requirements.
    Applications are associated to differentprivileges, and IPsec layer MUST be protected
    from nasty IPsecmanipulations. This draft is not considering applications privilegesmanagement.
    This draft lists any possible requirements on the IPseclayer an application might
    require.</p>"
