abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A multidimensional array of domain label analysis and extensions
    are \noffered to overcome a number of issues with the DNS and its use to \nlocate
    resources on the Internet. These goals are accomplished by \nproposing a naming
    convention to add labels to domain strings. The \nresult will be a rational relationship
    to the content that will provide \na method for meeting the ever-increasing need
    to expand the namespace, \nwhile providing an efficient search system to access
    content in a user-\nfriendly manner.\n\t </p>\n      "
