abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The WebDAV protocol specification [Goland et al., 1997] defines
    the\n   DELETE, COPY and MOVE methods. However these methods have a scope of\n
    \  a single source resource. It is common for principals to wish to\n   perform
    a DELETE, COPY or MOVE on a collection and all its internal\n   members. This
    specification defines the DELETE-TREE, COPY-TREE and\n   MOVE-TREE methods that
    perform the equivalent of DELETE, COPY and\n   MOVE across a collection and all
    its progeny.\n\t </p>\n      "
