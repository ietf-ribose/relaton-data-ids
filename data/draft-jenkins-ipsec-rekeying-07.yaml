abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses issues associated with the use of protocols
    developed in the IETF's IPsec working group, specifically, RFC 2409 [IKE] and
    RFC 2408 [ISAKMP]. It is expected that the reader is familiar with those documents.
    As stated earlier, this document does not specify standards of any kind, and is
    intended as information for IPsec implementers.</p>"
