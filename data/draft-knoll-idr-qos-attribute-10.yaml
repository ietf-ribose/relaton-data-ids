abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a simple signalling mechanism for inter- domain
    QoS marking using several instances of a new BGP Extended Community. Class based
    packet marking and forwarding is currently performed independently within ASes.
    The new QoS marking community makes the targeted Per Hop Behaviour within the
    IP prefix advertising AS and the currently applied marking at the interconnection
    point known to all access and transit ASes. This enables individual (re-)marking
    and possibly forwarding treatment adaptation to the original QoS class setup of
    the respective originating AS. The extended community provides the means to signal
    QoS markings on different layers, which are linked together in QoS Class Sets.
    It provides inter-domain and cross-layer insight into the QoS class mapping of
    the source AS with minimal signalling traffic.</p>"
