abstract:
- content: "<p>Enterprise and security focused OAuth providers typically want additional
    signals to confirm user presence when users return to previously authorized apps.
    Rather than requiring a full reauthentication, or require enrollment in a mobile
    device management solution, some authorization servers may be willing to accept
    device posture signals from the app, like the fact that device has a lock screen,
    as confirmation of user presence. This document details how OAuth native app clients
    can communicate device posture signals to OAuth providers.</p>"
