abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traffic steering (TS) mechanisms are designed to improve the
    overall\n   utilization of network resources in terms of bandwidth and services,\n
    \  and to optimize traffic flow in terms of latency and jitter through\n   the
    network.  Most existing TS systems require human intervention to\n   monitor and
    manage the assignment of specific paths to specific flows\n   or traffic types,
    reducing the effectiveness of TS.  I2RS, as a near\n   real time programmatic
    interface to the routing system, provides the\n   ability to manage TS systems
    in a more dynamic and iterative way.\n   This document describes several TS use
    cases for I2RS.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
