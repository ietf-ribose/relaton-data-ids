abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPsec series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms
    in order to provide security services. The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
    and the Authentication Header (AH) provide two mechanisms for protecting data
    being sent over an IPsec Security Association (SA). To ensure interoperability
    between disparate implementations, it is necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement
    algorithms to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations
    will have available. This document defines the current set of mandatory-to-implement
    algorithms for ESP and AH as well as specifying algorithms that should be implemented
    because they may be promoted to mandatory at some future time. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
