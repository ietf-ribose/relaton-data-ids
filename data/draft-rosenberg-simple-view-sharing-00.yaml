abstract:
  content: "<p>Presence federation refers to the exchange of presence informationbetween
    systems. One of the primary challenges in presencefederation is scale. With a
    large number of watchers in one domainobtaining presence for many presentities
    in another, the amount ofnotification traffic is large. This document describes
    an extensionto the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event framework, called viewsharing.
    View sharing can substantially reduce the amount oftraffic, but requires a certain
    level of trust between domains. Viewsharing allows the amount of presence traffic
    between domains toachieve the theoretical lower bound on information exchange
    in anypresence system.</p>"
