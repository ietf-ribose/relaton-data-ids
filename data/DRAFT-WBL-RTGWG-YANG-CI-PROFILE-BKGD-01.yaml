abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A YANG device profile is primarily a group of YANG models that
    are\n   appropriate for use with a particular class of device or in specific\n
    \  device roles.  This document provides background and describes the\n   rationale
    for a baseline data center switch device profile, e.g., for\n   top-of-rack switches
    in data center converged infrastructure.  This\n   rationale is based on the reuse
    of YANG models by the DMTF Redfish\n   standard for management of converged infrastructure,
    but the\n   resulting YANG device profile is intended to be useable by any YANG-\n
    \  based network management approach or protocol, as opposed to being\n   specific
    to Redfish.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
