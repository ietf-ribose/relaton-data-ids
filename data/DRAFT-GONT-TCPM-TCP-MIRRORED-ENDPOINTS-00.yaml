abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a problem found in some popular\n   implementations
    regarding the processing of TCP segments in which the\n   local endpoint is equal
    to the remote endpoint.  Additionally, it\n   formally updates RFC 793 clarifying
    how this scenario should be\n   handled.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
