abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a UDP-based publication channel for
    streaming\n   telemetry use to collect data from devices.  A new shim header is\n
    \  proposed to facilitate the distributed data collection mechanism\n   which
    directly pushes data from line cards to the collector.  Because\n   of the lightweight
    UDP encapsulation, higher frequency and better\n   transit performance can be
    achieved.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
