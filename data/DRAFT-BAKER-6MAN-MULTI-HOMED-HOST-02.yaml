abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note describes expected host behavior in a network that
    has more\n   than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network that\n   implements
    BCP 38 filtering, when the host has multiple routers to\n   choose from.\n\n   This
    may interact with source address selection in a given\n   implementation, but
    logically follows it - given that the network or\n   host is or appears to be
    multihomed with PA addresses, the host has\n   elected to use source address in
    a given prefix, and some but not all\n   neighboring routers are advertising that
    prefix in their RA PIOs, to\n   which router should a host present its transmission?\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
