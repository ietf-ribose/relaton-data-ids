abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multiple protocol experiments have been proposed that involve
    changes\n   to Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) as specified in RFC 3168.\n
    \  This memo summarizes the proposed areas of experimentation to provide\n   an
    overview to the Internet community and updates RFC 3168, a\n   Proposed Standard
    RFC, to allow the experiments to proceed without\n   requiring a standards process
    exception for each Experimental RFC to\n   update RFC 3168.  Each experiment is
    still required to be documented\n   in an Experimental RFC.  In addition, this
    memo makes related updates\n   to the ECN specifications for RTP in RFC 6679 and
    to the ECN\n   specifications for DCCP in RFC 4341, RFC 4342 and RFC 5622.  This\n
    \  memo also records the conclusion of the ECN Nonce experiment in RFC\n   3540,
    obsoletes RFC 3540 and reclassifies it as Historic to enable\n   new experimental
    use of the ECT(1) codepoint.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
