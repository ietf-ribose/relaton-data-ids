abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB) \n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
    \ \n   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related \n
    \  to the Fibre Channel network's Virtual Fabrics function. At present, \n   this
    memo is a work item of T11.5 (http://www.t11.org). The plan is \n   that it will
    later become a work item of IETF's IMSS working group.\n\t </p>\n      "
