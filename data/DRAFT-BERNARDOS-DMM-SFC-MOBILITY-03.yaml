abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service function chaining (SFC) allows the instantiation of
    an\n   ordered set of service functions and subsequent \"steering\" of traffic\n
    \  through them.  In order to set up and maintain SFC instances, a\n   control
    plane is required, which typically is centralized.  In\n   certain environments,
    such as fog computing ones, such centralized\n   control might not be feasible,
    calling for distributed SFC control\n   solutions.  This document specifies Mobile
    IPv6 extensions to enable\n   function migration in SFC.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
