abstract:
- content: "<p>When both the LDAP client and server reside on the same machine, communication
    efficiency can be greatly improved using host- specific IPC mechanisms instead
    of a TCP session. Such mechanisms can also implicitly provide the client's identity
    to the server for extremely lightweight authentication. This document describes
    the implementation of LDAP over Unix IPC that has been in use in OpenLDAP since
    January 2000, including the URL format used to specify an IPC session.</p>"
