abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a set of necessary functions and desirable
    properties of an ideal system for resolving names to addresses and associated
    information for establishing communication associations in the Internet. For each
    property, it briefly explains the rationale behind it, and how the property is
    or could be met with the present Domain Name System. It is intended to start a
    discussion within the IAB's Names and Identifiers program about gaps between the
    present reality of DNS and the naming service the Internet needs by returning
    to first principles.</p>"
