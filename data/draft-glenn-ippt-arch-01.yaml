abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an architecture for use in tracing packets across
    the Internet. It envisages a two-tier model wherein at the top level a Packet
    Tracer Application (PTA) queries relevant Autonomous System (AS) packet tracers
    (ASPT) with details of the packet to be traced. The PTA constructs the complete
    path from the responses of the queried ASPTs. At the lower level an ASPT receives
    queries from a PTA, traces the path of a packet within the AS and sends back the
    result to the PTA.</p>"
