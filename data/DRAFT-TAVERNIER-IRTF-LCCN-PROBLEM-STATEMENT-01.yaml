abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Operational procedures and protocols of today's communication\nnetworks
    typically use explicitly defined mechanisms and\nrepresentations to reach the
    goals associated to their design.  This\npractice results into numerous protocols
    having a restricted space\nfor (self-)adaptability, flexibility, and sensitivity
    respective to\ntheir network context (e.g. network traffic conditions, failure\nconditions,
    etc).  On the other hand, a wide spectrum of learning and\noptimization techniques
    is available such that networks could learn\nand optimize their behavior in the
    running context.  This document\ndescribes the opportunities and challenges for
    a Learning Capable\nCommunication Network (LCCN).\n\t </p>\n      "
