abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines service controls that extend the LDAPv3 [LDAP]
    operations to provide a simple mechanism by which an LDAP client can select master
    or replica directory information, control chaining and specify other service requirements
    when connected to an X.500 directory service. These service control mechanisms
    are not required when LDAP clients are connected to a single(non X.500) LDAP server
    because, for example, chaining [X.518]is not supported by these servers. Chaining
    protocols (DSP in X.500) also permit the extraction of master or replica data
    from within the X.500 directory system and provide this to the client (via LDAP)
    without the need for client based LDAP referrals to different servers. In addition,
    the controls proposed provide major step in the 'control' alignment of LDAP and
    DAP and their use of X.500. This will permit functional consistency to be achieved
    in directory enabled applications that use LDAP for access. In order to distinguish
    this functionality from LDAP V3 capable systems, an upgrade to LDAP V4 is also
    proposed. The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
    'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', and 'MAY' in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].</p>"
