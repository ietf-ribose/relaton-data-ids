abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines service controls that extend the LDAPv3 [LDAP]operations
    to provide a simple mechanism by which an LDAP client canselect master or replica
    directory information, controlchaining and specify other service requirements
    when connected to anX.500 directory service. These service control mechanisms
    are notrequired when LDAP clients are connected to a single(non X.500) LDAPserver
    because, for example, chaining [X.518]is not supported by theseservers.Chaining
    protocols (DSP in X.500) also permit the extraction ofmaster or replica data from
    within the X.500 directory system andprovide this to the client (via LDAP) without
    the need for client basedLDAP referrals to different servers. In addition, the
    controls proposed provide major step in the 'control'alignment of LDAP and DAP
    and their use of X.500. This will permitfunctional consistency to be achieved
    in directory enabled applicationsthat use LDAP for access. In order to distinguish
    this functionality from LDAP V3 capable systems,an upgrade to LDAP V4 is also
    proposed.The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT','SHOULD',
    'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', and 'MAY' in this document areto be interpreted as
    described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].</p>"
