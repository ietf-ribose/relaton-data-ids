abstract:
- content: "<p>We envision a new mobile architecture for the future Evolved Packet
    Core (EPC). The new architecture is designed to support the virtualization scheme
    called NFV (Network Function Virtualization). In our architecture, the user plane
    of EPC is decoupled from the control-plane and uses routing information to forward
    packets of mobile nodes. Although the EPC control plane will run on hypervisor,
    our proposal does not modify the signaling of the EPC control plane. The benefits
    of our architecture are 1) scalability, 2) flexibility and 3) Manageability. How
    to run the EPC control plane on NFV is out of our focus in this document.</p>"
