abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism along with extensions to [PWE3-\nCONTROL]
    draft that enable a PE to signal to the remote PE \nadditional dynamic information
    about the pseudowire. This \ninformation may either be related to the operations
    of the \npseudowire such as operational state of the Attachment circuit, the \nstate
    of the pseudowire forwarders, the IP address and/or MAC \naddress of the attached
    CE, or may affect the setup of the \npseudowire, such as traffic engineering parameters,
    security related \ninformation, etc. \n\t </p>\n      "
