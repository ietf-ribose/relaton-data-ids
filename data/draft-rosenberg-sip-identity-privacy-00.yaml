abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC3323 defines procedures for privacy in the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP). These mechanisms make use of a privacy service that resides in the network,
    which can remove identifying information from messages. Its approach to privacy
    was compatible with the identity mechanisms in RFC 3325, which defined the P-Asserted-ID
    header field. However, its approach does not work well with the new cryptographic-
    based mechanisms in draft-ietf-sip-identity. As such, this document proposes a
    new framework for user privacy in SIP.</p>"
