abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is intended to provide additional guidance to
    operators\n   of end-systems, operators of networks, and researchers beyond that\n
    \  provided in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id] and\n   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-aqm-dualq-coupled]
    in order to ensure successful\n   deployment of L4S [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-l4s-arch]
    in the Internet.  The\n   focus of this document is on potential interactions
    between L4S flows\n   and Classic ECN ([RFC3168]) flows in Classic ECN bottleneck
    links.\n   The document discusses the potential outcomes of these interactions,\n
    \  describes mechanisms to detect the presence of [RFC3168] bottlenecks,\n   and
    identifies opportunites to prevent and/or detect and resolve\n   fairness problems
    in such networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
