abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies mechanisms of NSA (Native Short Address)
    that\n   enables IP packet transmission over links where the transmission of a\n
    \  full length address may be wasteful.  All descriptions will focus on\n   carrying
    IP packets across LLN (Low power and Lossy Networks), those\n   LLNs positioned
    as limited domains.  The specifications include NSA\n   allocation, routing with
    NSA, header format design including length-\n   variable fields, and how to access
    full IPv6 networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
