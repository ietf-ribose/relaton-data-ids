abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo supports the process of progressing performance metric
    RFCs\nalong the standards track.  Observing that the metric definitions\nthemselves
    should be the primary focus rather than the\nimplementations of metrics, this
    memo describes results of example\nlab test procedures to evaluate specific metric
    RFC requirement\nclauses to determine if the requirement has been implemented
    as\nintended.  A single implementation has been tested against the key\nspecifications
    of RFC 2679 on One-way Delay.\n\t </p>\n      "
