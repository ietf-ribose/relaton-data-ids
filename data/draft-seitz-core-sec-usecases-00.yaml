abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents use cases for security measures in scenarios
    involving constrained RESTful devices. Special focus is placed on access control
    and authentication. Where specific details are relevant, it is assumed that the
    devices use CoAP as communication protocol, however most conclusions apply generally.
    A number of security requirements are derived from the use cases, which are intended
    as a guideline for developing a comprehensive authentication and authorization
    approach for this class of scenarios.</p>"
