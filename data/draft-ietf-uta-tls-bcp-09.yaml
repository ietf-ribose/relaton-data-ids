abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application protocols such
    as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP. Over the last few years, several serious
    attacks on TLS have emerged, including attacks on its most commonly used cipher
    suites and modes of operation. This document provides recommendations for improving
    the security of deployed services that use TLS and DTLS. The recommendations are
    applicable to the majority of use cases.</p>"
