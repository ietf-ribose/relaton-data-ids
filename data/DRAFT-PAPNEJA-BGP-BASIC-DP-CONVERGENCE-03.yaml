abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP is widely deployed and used by several service providers
    as the\n   default Inter AS routing protocol.  It is of utmost importance to\n
    \  ensure that when a BGP peer or a downstream link of a BGP peer fails,\n   the
    alternate paths are rapidly used and routes via these alternate\n   paths are
    installed.  This document provides the basic BGP\n   Benchmarking Methodology
    using existing BGP Convergence Terminology,\n   RFC 4098.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
