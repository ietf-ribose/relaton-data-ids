abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is no standard terminology as how to talk about use of
    DNS in\n   various application contexts, this document goal is to facilitate\n
    \  creation of such a vocabulary/taxonomy.\n\n   This document started out as
    proposal for specific word usage for\n   specifications of adding DANE like technology
    by different protocols/\n   services.  DANE is a method for specifying in DNS
    records acceptable\n   keys/certificates for application servers.\n\n   The terms
    defined in this document should be applicable to all uses\n   of service specification
    that uses DNS records.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
