abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS-forwarding-layer in a core network is a shared resource.\n
    \  The MPLS FIB at nodes in this layer contains labels that are\n   dynamically
    allocated and locally significant at that node.\n\n   For some usecases like upstream-label-allocation,
    it is useful to be\n   able to create virtual private MPLS-forwarding-layers over
    this\n   shared MPLS-forwarding-layer.  This allows installing deterministic\n
    \  private label-values in the private-FIBs created at nodes\n   participating
    in this private MPLS forwarding-layer, while preserving\n   the \"locally significant\"
    nature of the underlying shared 'public'\n   MPLS-forwarding-layer.\n\n   This
    specification describes the procedures to create such virtual\n   private MPLS-forwarding
    layers (private MPLS-planes) using a new BGP\n   family.  And gives a few example
    use-cases on how this private\n   forwarding-layers can be used.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
