abstract:
- content: <p>OAM and PM information from the SR endpoints can be piggybacked in the
    data packet. The OAM and PM information piggybacking in the data packets is also
    known as In-situ OAM (IOAM). IOAM records OAM information within the packet while
    the packet traverses a particular network domain. The term "in-situ" refers to
    the fact that the IOAM data fields are added to the data packets rather than being
    sent within probe packets specifically dedicated to OAM. This document defines
    the data fields encapsulation model of IOAM TLV in SRv6 network.</p>
