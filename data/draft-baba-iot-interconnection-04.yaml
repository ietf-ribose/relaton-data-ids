abstract:
- content: <p>This paper describes issues for solutions through cloud inter- connection
    to structural problems, which are called as "silo effects" found in cloud-connected
    electric home appliances, housing equipment and sensors in the face of increasingly
    accelerated connection of them. Specifically, this paper explains an inter-connection
    agreement considered to be required for enhancement of cloud inter- connection,
    what performance guarantee as well as IoT supervising and management should be,
    necessity of inter-connection HUB which is able to provide inter-connection amongst
    the preponderance of private cloud groups, and the necessity of a mechanism to
    avoid threats that cause danger to users when we make the inter-connection.</p>
