abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IP protocol ensures correct routing of packets to mobile\nnode
    as the mobile node changes its point of attachment with the\nInternet. However,
    it is also required to provide proper QoS\nforwarding treatment to mobile node's
    packet stream at the\nintermediate nodes in the network, so that QoS-sensitive
    IP\nservices can be supported over Mobile IP. This document describes\nrequirements
    of an IP QoS mechanism for its satisfactory operation\nwith Mobile IP.\n\n\t </p>\n
