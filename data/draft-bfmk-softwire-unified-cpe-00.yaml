abstract:
- content: "<p>Transporting IPv4 packets over IPv6 is a common solution to the problem
    of IPv4 service continuity over IPv6-only provider networks. A number of differing
    functional approaches have been developed for this, each having their own specific
    characteristics. As these approaches share a similar functional architecture and
    use the same data plane mechanisms, this memo describes a specification whereby
    a single CPE can interwork with all of the standardized and proposed approaches
    to providing encapsulated IPv4 in IPv6 services.</p>"
