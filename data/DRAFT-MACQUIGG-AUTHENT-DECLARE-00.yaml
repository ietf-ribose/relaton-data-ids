abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A key item that must be standardized to allow interoperation of
    \n   different email authentication methods is the ID declaration.  \n   Current
    authentication methods assume that one or another of the \n   existing fields
    in a mail transfer can be used as the Identity to be \n   verified.  Since there
    is no way to tell which field, if any, the \n   sender is prepared to authenticate,
    extra DNS queries must be made, \n   in the worst-case, testing all possibilities
    just to find no \n   authentication is offered at all.  This draft proposes a
    neutral \n   syntax that can be used by all methods.\n\t </p>\n      "
