abstract:
- content: "<p>A key problem in the design of RSVP version 1 is, as noted in its applicability
    statement, that it lacks facilities for aggregation of individual reserved sessions
    into a common class. The use of such aggregation is recommended in the paper by
    Clark, Shenker, and Zhang in SIGCOMM '92, and required for scalability. This document
    describes the use of a single RSVP reservation to aggregate other RSVP reservations
    across a transit routing region, in a manner conceptually similar to the use of
    Virtual Paths in an ATM network. It proposes a way to dynamically create the aggregate
    reservation, classify the traffic for which the aggregate reservation applies,
    determine how much bandwidth is needed to achieve the requirement, and recover
    the bandwidth when the sub-reservations are no longer required. It also contains
    recommendations concerning algorithms and policies for predictive reservations.</p>"
