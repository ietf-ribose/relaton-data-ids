abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A key problem in the design of RSVP version 1 is, as noted inits
    applicability statement, that it lacks facilities foraggregation of individual
    reserved sessions into a commonclass. The use of such aggregation is recommended
    in the paperby Clark, Shenker, and Zhang in SIGCOMM '92, and required forscalability.This
    document describes the use of a single RSVP reservationto aggregate other RSVP
    reservations across a transit routingregion, in a manner conceptually similar
    to the use of VirtualPaths in an ATM network. It proposes a way to dynamicallycreate
    the aggregate reservation, classify the traffic forwhich the aggregate reservation
    applies, determine how muchbandwidth is needed to achieve the requirement, and
    recoverthe bandwidth when the sub-reservations are no longerrequired. It also
    contains recommendations concerningalgorithms and policies for predictive reservations.</p>"
