abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes enhancements of bootstrapping a remote secure
    key infrastructure (BRSKI) to also operate in domains featuring no or only timely
    limited connectivity between involved components. Moreover, newly introduced are
    methods to perform the BRSKI approach in environments, in which the role of the
    pledge changes to a server instead of the client. This changes the interaction
    model as the pledge is pushed to interact with the registrar instead of pulling
    information from the registrar. To support both, BRSKI-AE relies on the exchange
    of it authenticated self-contained objects (signature- wrapped objects) also for
    requesting and distributing of domain specific device certificates. The defined
    approach is agnostic regarding the utilized enrollment protocol allowing the application
    of existing and potentially new certificate management protocols.</p>"
