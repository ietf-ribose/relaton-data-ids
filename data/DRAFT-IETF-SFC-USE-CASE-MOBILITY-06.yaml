abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides some exemplary use cases for service
    function\n   chaining in mobile service provider networks.  The objective of this\n
    \  draft is not to cover all conceivable service chains in detail.\n   Rather,
    the intention is to localize and explain the application\n   domain of service
    chaining within mobile networks as far as it is\n   required to complement the
    problem statement [RFC7498] and\n   architecture framework [ietf-sfc-arch] of
    the working group.\n\n   Service function chains typically reside in a LAN segment
    which links\n   the mobile access network to the actual application platforms
    located\n   in the carrier's datacenters or somewhere else in the Internet.\n
    \  Service function chains (SFC) ensure a fair distribution of network\n   resources
    according to agreed service policies, enhance the\n   performance of service delivery
    or take care of security and privacy.\n   SFCs may also include Value Added Services
    (VAS).  Commonly, SFCs are\n   typical middle box based services.\n\n   General
    considerations and specific use cases are presented in this\n   document to demonstrate
    the different technical requirements of these\n   goals for service function chaining
    in mobile service provider\n   networks.\n\n   The specification of service function
    chaining for mobile networks\n   must take into account an interaction between
    service function chains\n   and the 3GPP Policy and Charging Control (PCC) environment.\n\n\n\t
