abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) protocol has been designed for neighbor's
    address resolution, unreachability detection, address autoconfiguration, router
    advertisement and solicitation. With the progress of Internet adoption on various
    industries including home, wireless, m2m and Cellular(LTE) networks, there is
    a desire for optimizing legacy IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol to be more efficient
    in terms of number of signaling messages in the network. This document describes
    a method of optimization by reducing periodic multicast messages, frequent Neighbor
    Solicitation messages and supports interoperability with legacy IPv6 nodes and
    avoids Duplicate Address Detection by introducing an address Registration mechanism.
    Efficient IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol is useful for energy- efficient IPv6
    networks as well as Data Center and Home Networks.</p>"
