abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Home Networking Control Protocol
    (HNCP),\n   an extensible configuration protocol, and a set of requirements for\n
    \  home network devices.  HNCP is described as a profile of and\n   extension
    to the Distributed Node Consensus Protocol (DNCP).  HNCP\n   enables discovery
    of network borders, automated configuration of\n   addresses, name resolution,
    service discovery, and the use of any\n   routing protocol that supports routing
    based on both the source and\n   destination address.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
