abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such
    as\n   pieces of information or server processes, which are available in\n   several
    equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but\n   is not limited
    to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal\n   of Application-Layer
    Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide\n   guidance to these applications,
    which have to select one or several\n   hosts from a set of candidates that are
    able to provide a desired\n   resource.  This memo discusses deployment related
    issues of ALTO.  It\n   addresses different use cases of ALTO such as peer-to-peer
    file\n   sharing and CDNs, security considerations, recommendations for\n   network
    administrators, and also guidance for application designers\n   using ALTO.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
