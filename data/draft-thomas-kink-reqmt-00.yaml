abstract:
  content: "<p>The KINK working group is chartered to create a standards trackprotocol
    to facilitate centralized key management for IPsec securityassociations as defined
    in RFC 2401, as an alternative to IKE (RFC2409). Participating systems will use
    the Kerberos architecture asdefined in RFC 1510 (and its successors) for key management.
    The goalof the working group is to produce a streamlined, fast, easilymanaged,
    and cryptographically sound protocol without requiringpublic key.The working group
    will not require changes to either IPsec (RFC2401), or Kerberos (RFC 1510).</p>"
