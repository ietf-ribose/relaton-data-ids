abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a high-level design for an End-Middle-End (EME)
    signaling protocol called NUTSS (which stands for NAT, URI, Tunnel, Signaling,
    STUN). While high-level, this document tries to be detailed enough that the EME
    RG can have a meaningful debate about its pros and cons and possible alternatives.
    The main attribute of NUTSS is that it couples together both path-coupled and
    path- decoupled signaling.</p>"
