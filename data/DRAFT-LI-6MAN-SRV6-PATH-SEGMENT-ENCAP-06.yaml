abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end\n
    \  paths by encoding an ordered list of instructions, called \"segments\".\n   The
    SR architecture can be implemented over an IPv6 data plane,\n   called SRv6.  In
    some use-cases such as end-to-end SR Path Protection\n   and Performance Measurement
    (PM), an SRv6 path needs to be\n   identified.  An SRv6 Path Segment can be used
    for identifying an SRv6\n   path.  This document defines a P-flag in the Segment
    Routing Header\n   to indicate the appearence of SRv6 Path Segment.\n\n\t </p>\n
