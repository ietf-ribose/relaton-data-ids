abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a method for detection and mitigation of AS
    hijacking. In this mechanism, an AS operator registers a new object in the RPKI
    called 'ROAs Exist for All Prefixes (REAP)'. REAP is digitally signed using the
    AS holder's certificate. By registering REAP, the AS operator is declaring that
    they have Route Origin Authorization (ROA) coverage for all prefixes originated
    by their AS. A receiving AS will mark a route as Invalid if the prefix is not
    covered by any Validated ROA Payload (VRP) and the route origin AS has signed
    a REAP. Here Invalid means that the route is determined to be an AS hijack.</p>"
