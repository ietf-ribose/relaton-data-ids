abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Information Centric Networking (ICN) is shaping up as an alternative\n
    \  networking mechanism for the TCP/IP based host-centric networking\n   paradigm.
    \ Content delivery or streaming is one of important use\n   cases where the real
    value and potential of ICN architecture is being\n   investigated.  While a number
    of studies on an optimal and efficient\n   routing of Interest requests have been
    published, more discussion is\n   needed on the mechanisms for implementation
    and enforcement of the\n   quality of service (QoS) in the ICN based data delivery
    path.  In\n   this document, we focus on two most popular ICN architectures, CCN\n
    \  (Content Centric Networking) and NDN (Named Data Networking) and\n   describe
    how we can achieve the QoS aware data delivery in the ICN\n   network.  We propose
    to use the differentiated services (DiffServ)\n   QoS model based on DSCP codes,
    which is also used in the IP based\n   Internet design.  We further present how
    QoS parameter syntax can be\n   added to the current CCNx messages.\n\n\t </p>\n
