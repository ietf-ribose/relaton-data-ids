abstract:
- content: <p>"Happy Eyeballs" (RFC6555) is the name for a technique of reducing user-visible
    delays on dual-stack hosts. Since one address family (IPv4 or IPv6) may be blocked,
    broken, or sub-optimal on a network, clients that attempt connections for both
    address families in parallel have a higher chance of establishing a connection
    sooner. Now that this approach has been deployed at scale and measured for several
    years, the algorithm specification can be refined to improve its reliability and
    generalization.</p>
