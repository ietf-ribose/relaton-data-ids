abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines an extensible metadata that may be inserted
    into the OAuth 2.0 responses to assist the clients to process those responses.
    It is expressed either as a link header, or query parameters. It will allow the
    client to learn where the members in the response could be used. Since it is just
    additional response header/query parameters, any client that does not understand
    this extension should not break and work normally while supporting clients can
    utilize the metadata to take the advantage of the extension.</p>"
