abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a scalable architecture for assigning and aggregating
    IPv6 address space. The current IPv4 assignment and addressing architecture has
    been successful in helping to scale the IPv4 routing architecture. This same architecture,
    when carried forward to IPv6, will help to ensure that the IPv6 routing architecture
    is sustainable.</p>"
