abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are circumstances in RPKI operations where a resource
    holder's\n   parent may not be able to, or may not choose to, facilitate full
    and\n   proper registration of the holder's data.  As in real life, the\n   holder
    may form a relationship with their grandparent who is willing\n   to aid the grandchild.
    \ This document describes simple procedures for\n   doing so.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
