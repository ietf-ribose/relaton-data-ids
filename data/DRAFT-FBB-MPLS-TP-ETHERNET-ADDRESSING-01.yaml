abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile
    (MPLS-TP)\n   is the set of MPLS protocol functions applicable to the construction\n
    \  and operation of packet-switched transport networks.  This document\n   presents
    considerations for link-layer addressing of Ethernet frames\n   carrying MPLS-TP
    packets.\n\n   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
    Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\n   Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF
    MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
