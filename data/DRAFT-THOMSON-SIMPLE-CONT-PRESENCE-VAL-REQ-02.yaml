abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The attributes of continuous-valued data are examined in respect
    to\npresence systems.  The limitations of the existing presence system\nwith respect
    to continuous-valued data is examined.  Requirements are\nformulated that would
    enable the use of the presence system for this\ndata, with an emphasis on providing
    the watcher with a means of\ncontrol over the measurement process.\n\t </p>\n
