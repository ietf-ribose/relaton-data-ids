abstract:
- content: "<p>The introduction of MIME brings the standards required to construct
    robust mail user agents. These agents will quite often have presentation semantics.
    In many cases, the way to present a multipart message is clear based on the message,
    but there are times when this is not true. This document proposes a mechanism
    for dealing with those cases.</p>"
