abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow seamlessIP
    multicast datagram delivery to mobile nodes in the Internet. Inorder to receive
    IP multicast datagrams, mobile nodes are notrequired to be identified by their
    unicast IP addresses. Forunicast communication using Mobile IP, each mobile node
    needs tohave a unicast home address and a care-of address. Following ahandover
    to another IP subnet, such a mobile node is able toreceive IP multicast traffic
    after exchanging IGMP messages withthe multicast routers on the currently visiting
    network. However,in the worst case, it takes an unreasonably long time (especiallywith
    respect to streaming media) to resume receiving multicast IPtraffic in the visiting
    network.This draft specifies a Mobility Support Agent (MSA) protocol whichprovides
    a mechanism to help ensure seamless reception of IPmulticast traffic despite a
    mobile node handover. This is possiblebecause in advance of its handover, a mobile
    node pre-registerswith the MSA on the next network to be visited. The MSA acts
    as aproxy for this mobile node and is thus able to set up all thenecessary states
    for the seamless delivery of multicast traffic tothis mobile node.</p>"
