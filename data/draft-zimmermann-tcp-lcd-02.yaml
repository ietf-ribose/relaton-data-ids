abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Disruptions in end-to-end path connectivity which last longer thanone
    retransmission timeout cause suboptimal TCP performance. Thereason for the performance
    degradation is that TCP interprets segmentloss induced by connectivity disruptions
    as a sign of congestion,resulting in repeated backoffs of the retransmission timer.
    Thisleads in turn to a deferred detection of the re-establishment of theconnection
    since TCP waits until the next retransmission timeoutoccurs before attempting
    the retransmission.This document describes how standard ICMP messages can be exploitedto
    disambiguate true congestion loss from non-congestion loss causedby long connectivity
    disruptions. Moreover, a revert strategy of theretransmission timer is specified
    that enables a more promptdetection of whether the connectivity to a previously
    disconnectedpeer node has been restored or not. The specified algorithm is a TCPsender-only
    modification that effectively improves TCP performance inpresence of connectivity
    disruptions.</p>"
