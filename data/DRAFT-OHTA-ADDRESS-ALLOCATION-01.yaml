abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The current usage based IPv4 address assignment policies might
    have\nprolonged the useful lifetime of IPv4 address space but this has to\nthe
    detriment of the the end-to-end architecture of the Internet.\nThis memo proposes
    the adoption of an address assignment strategy\nthat releases large blocks of
    IPv4 address space into the Internet.\nThe objective of this policy is to encourage
    healthy Internet\ndeployment models with end-to-end transparency and association
    of\npermanent connectivity with a stable IP address. This is intended to\nencourage
    provider support for open transparent Internet service\nenvironments that can
    be sustained with the adoption of IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
