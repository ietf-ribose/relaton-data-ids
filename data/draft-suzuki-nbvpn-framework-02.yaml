abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The objective of this draft is to clarify a framework forstandardizing
    the mechanisms supporting interoperable network-basedvirtual private networks
    (NBVPNs). These are VPNs using IPfacilities whose operation mechanisms are implemented
    within anetwork (or networks) and outsourced to one or more serviceproviders.This
    draft first describes the assumed services of NBVPNs andclarifies the logical
    architecture model and reference model ofNBVPN. Considering the assumed services,
    this draft furtherclarifies the NBVPN requirements for interfaces and MIBs in
    thereference model. It also surveys and discusses current technologiessupporting
    NBVPNs such as tunneling, VPN identifier, routing, andQoS/SLA. Additionally it
    will, in future, provide outline of theinterface and MIB specifications and present
    criteria for achievinginteroperability.</p>"
