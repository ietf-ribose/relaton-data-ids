abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo outlines RTP splicing.  Splicing is a process that
    replaces\n   the content of the main multimedia stream with other multimedia\n
    \  content, and delivers the substitutive multimedia content to receiver\n   for
    a period of time.  This memo provides some RTP splicing use\n   cases, then we
    enumerate a set of requirements and analyze whether an\n   existing RTP level
    middlebox can meet these requirements, at last we\n   provide concrete guidelines
    for how the chosen middlebox works to\n   handle RTP splicing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
