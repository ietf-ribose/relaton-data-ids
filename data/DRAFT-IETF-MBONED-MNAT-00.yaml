abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a method for a network to maintain Network\n
    \  Address Translation address mappings for the transport of globally\n   addressed
    multicast traffic within a network that can't otherwise\n   forward the globally
    addressed traffic.  A new Multicast Network\n   Address Translation (MNAT) service
    is defined to communicate the\n   address mappings to ingress and egress points
    within the network, and\n   considerations for operation of the MNAT service are
    described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
