abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A common approach to deal with unwanted communication attempts
    is to\nrely on some form of authorization policies, typically whitelists.\nIn
    order to populate the entries in such an access control list it is\nhelpful to
    have a way to challenge the entity willing to engage in a\nconversation (unless
    they are already pre-authorized).  One reason\nwhy this is desired is to deal
    with robots that are aggressively\ndistributing messages.\n\nThis document describes
    how \"Completely Automated Public Turing Test\nto Tell Computers and Humans Apart\"
    (CAPTCHA) tests, which require\nhuman interaction, are applied to SIP.\n\t </p>\n
