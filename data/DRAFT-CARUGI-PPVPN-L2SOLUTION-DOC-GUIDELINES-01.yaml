abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides guidelines on how to structure a PPVPN
    Layer 2 \nsolution document.  \nThe intent is to provide a common way of describing
    the various \nfunctional components of a Layer 2 solution, making easier their
    \nidentification as well as the mechanisms providing those \nfunctionalities,
    and, possibly, facilitating further convergence in \nthe solution space. \nThese
    guidelines have been discussed internally to the PPVPN Layer 2 \ndesign team and
    agreed as a recommendation, although not mandatory, \nto authors of PPVPN L2 solution
    drafts. \n\t </p>\n      "
