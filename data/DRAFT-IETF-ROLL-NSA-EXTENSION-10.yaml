abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Packet Replication and Elimination is a method in which several\n
    \  copies of a data packet are sent in the network in order to achieve\n   high
    reliability and low jitter.  This document details how to apply\n   Packet Replication
    and Elimination in RPL, especially how to exchange\n   information within RPL
    control packets to let a node better select\n   the different parents that will
    be used to forward the multiple\n   copies of a packet.  This document also describes
    the Objective\n   Function which takes advantage of this information to implement\n
    \  multi-path routing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
