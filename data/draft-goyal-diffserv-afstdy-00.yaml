abstract:
  content: "\t <t>One desirable characteristics of any resource allocation (ordifferentiation)
    mechanism is that if many aggregates, each with itsown reservation, are merged
    with other aggregates of the same class,each aggregate should get its reserved
    bandwidth and a fair share ofthe excess bandwidth. In particular, the performance
    of an aggregateshould not be adversely affected by other aggregates and theircongestion
    sensitivity. TCP flows are congestion sensitive while UDPflows are congestion
    insensitive in the sense that TCP flows reducetheir traffic if any packets are
    lost. The goal of this study is tosee if TCP flow aggregates will be punished
    for their good behaviorin the presence of competing UDP flow aggregates in the
    same assuredforwarding class. We identify several factors that affect theperformance
    in the mixed environments and quantify their effectsusing a full factorial design
    of experiment methodology.</p>"
