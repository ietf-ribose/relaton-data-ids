abstract:
- content: "<p>When IP multicast trees created by PIM-SM in ASM mode need to pass
    through an MPLS domain, it may be desirable to map such trees to Point-to-Multipoint
    Label Switched Paths. This document describes how to accomplish this in the case
    where such Point-to-Multipoint Label Switches Paths are established using mLDP.
    Specification of Requirements</p>"
