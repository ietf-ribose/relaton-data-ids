abstract:
- content: "<p>IEEE 802.1ah standard [IEEE802.1ah], also known as Provider Backbone
    Bridges (PBB) defines an architecture and bridge protocols for interconnection
    of multiple Provider Bridge Networks (PBNs). PBB was defined in IEEE as a connectionless
    technology based on multipoint VLAN tunnels. MSTP is used as the core control
    plane for loop avoidance and load balancing. As a result, the coverage of the
    solution is limited by STP scale in the core of large service provider networks.
    PBB on the other hand can be used to attain better scalability in terms of number
    of customer MAC addresses and number of service instances that can be supported.
    Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4664] provides a framework for extending
    Ethernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling capabilities, through a routed MPLS
    backbone without running (M)STP across the backbone. As a result, VPLS has been
    deployed on a large scale in service provider networks. This draft discusses extensions
    to the VPLS PE model required to incorporate desirable PBB components while maintaining
    the Service Provider fit of the initial model.</p>"
