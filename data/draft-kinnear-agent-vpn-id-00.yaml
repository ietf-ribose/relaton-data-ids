abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In some environments, a relay agent resides in a network elementwhich
    also has access to one or more VPNs. If one DHCP server wishesto offer service
    to DHCP clients on those different VPNs the DHCPserver needs to know the VPN on
    which each client resides. The vpn-id sub-option of the relay-agent-information
    option is used by therelay agent to tell the DHCP server the VPN for every DHCP
    request itpasses on to the DHCP server, and is also used to properly forwardany
    DHCP reply that the DHCP server sends back to the relay agent.</p>"
