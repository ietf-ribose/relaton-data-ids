abstract:
  content: "<p>In some environments, a relay agent resides in a network element which
    also has access to one or more VPNs. If one DHCP server wishes to offer service
    to DHCP clients on those different VPNs the DHCP server needs to know the VPN
    on which each client resides. The vpn- id sub-option of the relay-agent-information
    option is used by the relay agent to tell the DHCP server the VPN for every DHCP
    request it passes on to the DHCP server, and is also used to properly forward
    any DHCP reply that the DHCP server sends back to the relay agent.</p>"
