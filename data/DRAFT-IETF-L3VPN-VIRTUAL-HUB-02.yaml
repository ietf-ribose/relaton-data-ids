abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With BGP/MPLS VPNs any-to-any connectivity among sites of a
    given\n   Virtual Private Network would require each Provider Edge router that\n
    \  has one or more of these sites connected to it to hold all the routes\n   of
    that Virtual Private Network. The approach described in this\n   document allows
    to reduce the number of Provider Edge routers that\n   have to maintain all these
    routes by requiring only a subset of these\n   routers to maintain all these routes.\n\n
    \  Furthermore, when Provider Edge routers use ingress replication to\n   carry
    multicast traffic of VPN customers, the approach described in\n   this document
    could allow to reduce bandwidth inefficiency associated\n   with ingress replication,
    and to redistribute the replication load\n   among Provider Edge routers.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
