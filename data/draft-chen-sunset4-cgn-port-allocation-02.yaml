abstract:
- content: "<p>The document enumerates methods of port assignment in CGN contexts,
    more focusing on a NAT64 environment. The analysis categorizes the different methods
    with several key features. The uses of existing protocols are further described
    corresponding to those features. This memo also states the port-usage experiences,
    relevant findings, evaluations and workarounds. It's expected the document could
    provide an informative base line to help operators choosing a proper method.</p>"
