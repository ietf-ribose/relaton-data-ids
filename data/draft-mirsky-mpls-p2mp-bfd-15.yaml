abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes procedures for using Bidirectional Forwarding
    Detection (BFD) for multipoint networks to detect data plane failures in Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) point-to-multipoint (p2mp) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
    and Segment Routing (SR) point-to- multipoint policies with SR-MPLS data plane.
    It also describes the applicability of LSP Ping, as in-band, and the control plane,
    as out-band, solutions to bootstrap a BFD session. It also describes the behavior
    of the active tail for head notification.</p>"
