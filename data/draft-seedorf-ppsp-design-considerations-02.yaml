abstract:
  content: "<p>Streaming video on P2P overlays puts extremely high demands andstress
    on the underlying network, especially in case of TV and livestreaming. The EU
    research project NAPA-WINE has devised an overallarchitecture for live video streaming
    that supports the needs of theusers and content providers, while being respective
    of network-levelneeds, as reducing inter-AS traffic using ALTO-like services.
    Inthis document, we describe generic elements of this softwarearchitecture for
    P2P live streaming and derive the correspondingimplications for standardizing
    a Peer-to-Peer streaming protocol.</p>"
