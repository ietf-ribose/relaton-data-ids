abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There are times that an LSP source node needs to know change(s)
    hasoccurred along the originally established LSP path. This isespecially true
    in the Mobile Backhaul environment where microwavetransport is widely deployed.
    The bandwidth provided by the microwavetransport can change with weather. The
    source LSR, e.g. LTE's eNodeB,needs to adjust its admission rate or shift more
    load to alternativepaths when the backhaul transport path condition is changed.This
    draft describes a simple mechanism for transit LSRs to notifySource LSR of the
    path condition changes.Conventions used in this documentThe key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",
    \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in thisdocument are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC-2119 0.</p>"
