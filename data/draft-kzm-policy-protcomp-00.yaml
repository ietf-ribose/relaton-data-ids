abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The IETF's RAP Working Group has almost completed its task of definingCOPS
    as a standards-track protocol for RSVP Admission Policy. TheWG's charter is now
    being extended to cover standardizing a policyprovisioning protocol, and the proposal
    put forward for considerationby the WG is based on defining a new Client-type
    for COPS. This newClient-type is intended to work in conjunction with the QoS
    Policyobjects and schema definitions being defined in two other IETF WorkingGroups:
    Differentiated Services, and Policy. Before proceeding anyfurther, it has been
    requested that a comparison be undertaken as towhy COPS is better suited to this
    than a (modified if necessary)version of SNMP. This memo attempts to document
    such a comparison.</p>"
