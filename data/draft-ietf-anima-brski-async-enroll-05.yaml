abstract:
- content: "<p>This document enhances Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure
    (BRSKI, [RFC8995]) to allow employing alternative enrollment protocols, such as
    CMP. Using self-contained signed objects, the origin of enrollment requests and
    responses can be authenticated independently of message transfer. This supports
    end-to-end security and asynchronous operation of certificate enrollment and provides
    flexibility where to authenticate and authorize certification requests.</p>"
