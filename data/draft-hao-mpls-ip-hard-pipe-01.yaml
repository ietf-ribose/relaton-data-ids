abstract:
- content: <p>This document is intended to become an Informational RFC on the independent
    stream. The document does not specify any new protocol or procedures. It does
    explain how the MPLS standards implementation, has been deployed and operated
    to meet the requirements from operators that offer traditional Virtual Leased
    Line services. This document describes an MPLS/IP network that has an infrastructure
    that can be separated into two or more strata. For the implementation described
    in this document the infrastructure has been separated into two strata. One for
    the 'Hard Pipes', called the 'Hard Pipe Stratum". And one for the normal IP/MPLS
    traffic - called the 'Normal IP/MPLS stratum'. This document introduces the concept
    of "Hard Pipes", a Hard Pipe is an MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) or a Pseudowire
    (PW) with a bandwidth that is guaranteed and can neither be exceeded nor infringed
    upon. The Hard Pipe stratum does not use statistical multiplexing, for the LSPs
    and PWs setup within this stratum the bandwidth are guaranteed end to end.</p>
