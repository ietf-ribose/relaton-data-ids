abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers
    which\n   then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks.\n
    \  This document considers both this traditional case, and the case when\n   the
    \"requesting router\" is actually a simple host which receives a\n   delegated
    prefix that it can use for its own internal multi-\n   addressing purposes.  This
    latter method can be employed in a wide\n   variety of use cases to allow ample
    address availability without\n   impacting link performance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
