abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents the design of Unicorn, a multi-domain,\n
    \  geographically-distributed, data-intensive analytics system.  The\n   setting
    of such a system includes edge science networks, which\n   provide storage and
    computation resources for collecting, sharing and\n   analyzing extremely large
    amounts of data, and transit networks,\n   which provide networking resources
    to connects edge science networks\n   for transmitting large science datasets.\n\n
    \  The key design challenge is to accurately discover and represent\n   resource
    information from different domains.  Unicorn leverages\n   multiple ALTO services,
    including ALTO-Path Vector, ALTO-Routing\n   State Abstraction, ALTO-Server-Side
    Event and ALTO-Flow Cost Service\n   to address this challenge.  In particular,
    Unicorn decomposes the\n   resource discovery into three phases.  The first phase
    is to identify\n   endpoint resource, e.g., dataset storage location, computation\n
    \  resource location and output storage resource location.  The second\n   phase
    is to identify the reachability information between the\n   locations of storage
    and computation resources.  The third phase is\n   to identify the available networking
    resource connecting different\n   storage and computation resources.  All information
    collected through\n   these three phases can be used by a logically centralized
    scheduling\n   system to orchestrate the resources usage.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
