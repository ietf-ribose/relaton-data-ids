abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A mobile IPv6 node remains reachable when it moves in a IPv6\nInternet.
    However, if such a node, i.e. MN, moves to a network which\nis protected by firewalls,
    the communication that is already existed\nbefore its moving may be blocked by
    firewall. The document presents a\nmechanism to update the corresponding access
    control entry of\nfirewall to avoid the communication interrupted. \n\n\t </p>\n
