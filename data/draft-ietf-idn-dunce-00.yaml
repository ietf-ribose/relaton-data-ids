abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a transformation method for representingnon-ASCII
    characters in host name parts in a fashion that iscompletely compatible with the
    current DNS. It is a potentialcandidate for an ASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE)
    forinternationalized host names, as described in the comparisondocument from the
    IETF IDN Working Group. This method is basedexclusively on long-established mechanisms
    for denoting thepositions of characters in tables, but included variations forcompressing
    that information, also based on long-establishedmechanisms.</p>"
