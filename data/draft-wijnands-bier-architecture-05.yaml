abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast
    data packets. It provides optimal forwarding of multicast packets through a "multicast
    domain". However, it does not require any explicit tree-building protocol, nor
    does it require intermediate nodes to maintain any per-flow state. This architecture
    is known as "Bit Index Explicit Replication" (BIER). When a multicast data packet
    enters the domain, the ingress router determines the set of egress routers to
    which the packet needs to be sent. The ingress router then encapsulates the packet
    in a BIER header. The BIER header contains a bitstring in which each bit represents
    exactly one egress router in the domain; to forward the packet to a given set
    of egress routers, the bits corresponding to those routers are set in the BIER
    header. Elimination of the per-flow state and the explicit tree-building protocols
    results in a considerable simplification.</p>
