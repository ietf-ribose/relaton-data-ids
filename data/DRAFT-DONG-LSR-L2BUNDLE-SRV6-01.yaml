abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are deployments where the Layer-3 interface on which
    IGP\n   operates is a Layer-2 interface bundle.  Existing IGP advertisements\n
    \  only support advertising link attributes of the Layer-3 interface.\n   If entities
    external to IGP wish to control traffic flows on the\n   individual physical links
    that comprise the Layer-2 interface bundle,\n   link attribute information about
    the bundle members is advertised by\n   IGP extensions for Layer-2 (L2) bundle.\n\n
    \  When Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) is used with Layer-2 interface\n   bundle
    to control traffic flows on the individual member links, the\n   SRv6 SIDs which
    represent the Layer 2 member links of the L2 bundle\n   needs to be advertised
    in IGP.\n\n   This document proposes the IGP extensions to advertise the SRv6
    SIDs\n   of the Layer 2 (L2) bundle member links.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
