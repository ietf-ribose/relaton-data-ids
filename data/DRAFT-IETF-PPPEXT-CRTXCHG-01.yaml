abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard
    method\n        for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point\n
    \       links\n \n        PPP also defines an extensible Link Control Protocol,
    which\n        allows negotiation of an Authentication Protocol for\n        authentication
    of its peer before allowing Network Layer\n        protocols to transmit over
    the link.\n \n        The Certificate exchange protocol is an extension to PPP
    that is\n        in the form of an additional phase, called the certificate\n
    \       exchange phase, that would allow for a PPP entity to request\n        certificates
    from a peer.  If configured, this phase would be\n        negotiated during the
    LCP exchange. This exchange of\n        certificates is aimed at easing configuration
    issues by\n        providing for the exchange of certificate path information
    in a\n        standard manner across different strong, or public-key\n        certificate-based,
    \ authentication protocols.  The certificate\n        exchange protocol accomodates
    arbitrary sized certificates.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
