abstract:
- content: "<p>This problem statement examines how existing protocols that separate
    identifiers from their location may benefit from the concept of identity. The
    proposal laid out herein advocates for a standardized identity/identifier network
    infrastructure that provides a framework to support identity services in addition
    to enhancing existing identifier/location mapping and resolution services.</p>"
