abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Mobile IP working group is currently examining proposals to\nassist
    in minimizing the latency and packet loss due to handoffs\nwhen a Mobile IPv6
    node moves from one point of attachment to\nanother.  One of the desires to reduce
    this latency and packet loss\nis a result of the strict requirements of real-time
    network\nservices.  This proposal specifies a solution whereby the mobile\nnode
    sends a binding update with multiple care-of-addresses which\nmatch the current
    link and other links that the mobile node may\npossibly visit next. After receiving
    such a binding update, the \ncorrespondent nodes and home agent use a new routing
    header \nextension to route the packet that will be received by the mobile \nnode
    at one of the possible care-of-addresses. Thus, the \ncorrespondent nodes and
    home agent can still communicate with \nthe mobile node despite not knowing its
    exact location while the\nmobile node moves across links. The proposal presents
    no new \nnetworking entities and the resulting architecture describes a\nnatural
    extension to the Mobile IPv6 protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
