abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the network comprising thousands of iBGP peers exchanging millions\nof
    routes, many routes are reachable via more than one next-hop.\nGiven the large
    scaling targets, it is desirable to restore traffic\nafter failure in a time period
    that does not depend on the number of\nBGP prefixes. In this document we proposed
    an architecture by which\ntraffic can be re-routed to ECMP or pre-calculated backup
    paths in a\ntimeframe that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. The\nobjective
    is achieved through organizing the forwarding data\nstructures in a hierarchical
    manner and sharing forwarding elements\namong the maximum possible number of routes.
    The proposed technique\nachieves prefix independent convergence while ensuring
    incremental\ndeployment, complete automation, and zero management and provisioning\neffort.
    It is noteworthy to mention that the benefits of BGP-PIC are\nhinged on the existence
    of more than one path whether as ECMP or\nprimary-backup.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
