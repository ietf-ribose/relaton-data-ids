abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support
    the\n   needs of new applications, particularly including the applications\n   that
    are associated with 5G services.  An enhanced VPN may be used\n   for 5G transport
    network slicing, and will also be of use in more\n   generic scenarios.  [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn]
    describes the\n   framework and candidate component technologies for providing
    enhanced\n   VPN services.  This document describes the control plane\n   requirements,
    functions and considerations to enable VPN+ services.\n   Specifically, the scalability
    of control plane is analyzed, and the\n   proposed optimization mechanisms are
    described.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
