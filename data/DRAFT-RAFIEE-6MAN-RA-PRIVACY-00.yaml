abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Privacy is an important issue for many governments and users
    where\n   its importance becomes more evident every day. Nodes might change\n
    \  their IP addresses frequently in order to avoid being tracked by\n   attackers
    and which also results in the prevention of information\n   being leaked from
    their nodes. In IPv6 networks there is currently\n   one solution for maintaining
    privacy for nodes when IPv6 StateLess\n   Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) (RFC-4662)
    is used. Unfortunately\n   this solution, i.e., Privacy Extension (RFC-4941),
    has some problems,\n   such as not generating a new Interface ID (IID) after changing
    the\n   router prefix. The RFC also gives no explanation as to how to use CGA\n
    \  in its randomizing solution. The purpose of this document is to\n   address
    these issues and to update the current RFC.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
