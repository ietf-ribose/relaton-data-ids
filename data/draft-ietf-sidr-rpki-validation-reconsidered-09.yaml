abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an alternative to the certificate validation
    procedure specified in RFC 6487 that reduces aspects of operational fragility
    in the management of certificates in the RPKI, while retaining essential security
    features. Where the procedure specified in RFC 6487 requires that Resource Certificates
    are rejecting entirely if they are found to over-claim any resources not contained
    on the issuing certificate, the validation process defined here allows an issuing
    Certificate Authority to chose to communicate that such Resource Certificates
    should be accepted for the intersection of their resources and the issuing certificate.
    This choice is signalled by form of a set of alternative Object Identifiers (OIDs)
    of RFC 3779 X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers, and certificate
    policy for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RFC 6484). It should be noted
    that in case these OIDs are not used for any certificate under a Trust Anchor,
    the validation procedure defined here has the same outcome as the procedure defined
    in RFC 6487 Furthermore this document provides an alternative to ROA (RFC 6482),
    and BGPSec Router Certificate (BGPSec PKI Profiles - publication requested) validation.</p>"
