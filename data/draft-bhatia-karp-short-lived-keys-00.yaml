abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a generic mechanism for deriving short-lived traffic
    keys from the longed-lived keys. The long-lived key could be a preshared secret
    or a key obtained from some key management protocol. The mechanism described in
    this draft can be used to implement key rollovers without requiring the participating
    routers to exchange any additional information.</p>"
