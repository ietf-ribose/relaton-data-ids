abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft proposes a generic mechanism for deriving short-livedtraffic
    keys from the longed-lived keys. The long-lived key could bea preshared secret
    or a key obtained from some key managementprotocol. The mechanism described in
    this draft can be used toimplement key rollovers without requiring the participating
    routersto exchange any additional information.</p>"
