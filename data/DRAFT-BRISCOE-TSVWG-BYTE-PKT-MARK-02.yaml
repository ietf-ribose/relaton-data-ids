abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo concerns dropping or marking packets using active queue\nmanagement
    (AQM) such as random early detection (RED) or pre-\ncongestion notification (PCN).
    \ The primary conclusion is that packet\nsize should be taken into account when
    transports decode congestion\nindications, not when network equipment writes them.
    \ Reducing drop\nof small packets has some tempting advantages: i) it drops less\ncontrol
    packets, which tend to be small and ii) it makes TCP's bit-\nrate less dependent
    on packet size.  However, there are ways of\naddressing these issues at the transport
    layer, rather than reverse\nengineering network forwarding to fix specific transport
    problems.\nNetwork layer algorithms like the byte-mode packet drop variant of\nRED
    should not be used to drop fewer small packets, because that\ncreates a perverse
    incentive for transports to use tiny segments,\nconsequently also opening up a
    DoS vulnerability.\n\t </p>\n      "
