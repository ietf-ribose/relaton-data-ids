abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the\n
    \  network.  Instead, links with restricting MTUs must either drop each\n   too-large
    packet and return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) message or\n   perform link-specific
    fragmentation and reassembly (also known as\n   \"link adaptation\") at a layer
    below IPv6.  This latter category of\n   links is often performance-challenged
    to accommodate steady-state\n   link adaptation.  A common case that exhibits
    these link\n   characteristics is seen for IPv6-within-IP tunnels.  Additionally,\n
    \  IPv6 nodes can avoid path MTU discovery issues even when no link\n   adaptation
    is necessary by performing a small amount of fragmentation\n   and/or by probing
    the path as necessary.  This document therefore\n   proposes an update to the
    base IPv6 specification to better\n   accommodate path MTU issues.\n\n\t </p>\n
