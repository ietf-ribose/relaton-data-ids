abstract:
  content: "<p>RFC 4364 and RFC 4659 define an approach to building provider-provisioned
    Layer 3 VPNs for IPv4 and IPv6. It may be desirable touse RSVP to perform admission
    control on the links between CE and PErouters. This document specifies procedures
    by which RSVP messagestravelling from CE to CE across an L3VPN may be appropriately
    handledby PE routers so that admission control can be performed on PE-CElinks.
    Optionally, admission control across the provider's backbonemay also be supported.</p>"
