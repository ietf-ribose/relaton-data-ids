abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents a framework for user-centric Quality of
    \n   Service (QoS) management in heterogeneous Internet environments\n   (considering
    fixed, mobile and broadcast networks). \n   The framework is based on dynamic
    business level QoS policy \n   specification by different actors  (such as users,
    operators \n   and administrators), as well as hierarchical policy refinement\n
    \  and translation, supporting the automated configuration of QoS\n   mechanisms
    at heterogeneous network and transport entities.\n\nThe hierarchical policy approach
    involves abstractions and mapping  \n   of policies described at business, unified,
    operational and \n   configuration level considering networks with different capabilities\n
    \  and QoS requirements of different actors. \n   The policy specification is
    dependent on the Service \n   Level Agreements (SLAs) of the particular actors.
    \n   This allows controlled and restricted usage of the network \n   resources
    by the actors according to the actor dependencies and \n   corresponding SLA rules.
    \   \n\n   The policy management framework includes components for dynamic \n
    \  actor-based QoS policy specification, policy consistency check\n   and dependency
    analysis regarding SLAs, automated policy \n   provisioning and configuration
    at heterogeneous transport and \n   network entities, policy monitoring and performance
    \n   assessment, as well as automated adaptation of QoS mechanisms at \n   operational
    level.  \n   Policy enforcement combined with policy monitoring and performance\n
    \  assessment is considered, as well as automated adaptation of \n   policy parameters
    (e.g. operational policies) based on policy \n   performance analysis. \n \n   Interactions
    of components for policy specification and automated\n   provisioning are based
    on policy repository storing the unified \n   (intermediate) policy representations
    describing policy parameters, \n   conditions and actions.\n\t </p>\n      "
