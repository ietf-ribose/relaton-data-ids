abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft presents a number of use cases of applications running
    on\n   endpoints located in cellular networks and whose performances highly\n
    \  depend on network information.  This document first, shows how the\n   performances
    of these applications can be further improved with ALTO\n   provided abstracted
    network information and transportation means\n   thereof.  Second, upon reviewing
    the existing ALTO capabilities, it\n   lists the ALTO features that need to be
    extended or defined to\n   support the presented use cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
