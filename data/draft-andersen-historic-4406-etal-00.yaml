abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2006, two experiments were started for email authentication: Sender
    Policy Framework (SPF, RFC 4408 [RFC4408]) and Sender ID (RFC 4406 [RFC4406],
    supported by RFCs 4405 [RFC4405] and 4407 [RFC4407]). After eight years of experimental
    data (RFC 6686 [RFC6686]), it was clear that SPF remained in widespread use while
    Sender ID did not. RFC 7208 [RFC7208] moved SPF from Experimental status to Proposed
    Standard. This document acknowledges that Sender ID did not pass its experiment,
    and changes the status of RFCs 4405 [RFC4405], 4406 [RFC4406], and 4407 [RFC4407]
    to Historic.</p>"
