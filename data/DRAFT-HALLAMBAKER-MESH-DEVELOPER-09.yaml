  content: "\n\t <p>   The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an end-to-end secure\n
    \  infrastructure that facilitates the exchange of configuration and\n   credential
    data between multiple user devices.\n\n   This document describes the Mesh reference
    code and how to install,\n   run and make use of it in applications.  It does
    not form a part of\n   the Mesh specifications and is not normative.\n\n   This
