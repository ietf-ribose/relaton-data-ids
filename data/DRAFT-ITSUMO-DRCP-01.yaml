abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Dynamic Host  Configuration  Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework\nfor
    \ passing  configuration  information  to hosts  [DHC].  DHCP was,\nhowever,  designed
    \ for hosts on a fixed  LAN, not for nodes  roaming\namong commercial  wireless
    networks.  A Mobile IP [MIP] Foreign Agent\ngives some  powerful  plug and play
    \ capability  for  roaming  hosts,\nespecially  when  combined  with some recent
    \ proposals  [e.g., MIPA,\nMIPC, MIPD, MIPN, HAW, CEL, TIA].  Mobile IP  functionality,
    \ however\nis not  always  needed  and  for  some  dynamic  networks  it  may
    be\nundesirable to use Foreign Agents.  This draft proposes a lightweight\ndynamic
    \ configuration  protocol, called the Dynamic Registration and\nConfiguration
    \ Protocol  (DRCP).  DRCP borrows  heavily from DHCP and\ncan switch to using
    DHCP protocol if only DHCP servers are present in\nthe  network;  but adds  features
    \ critical  to roaming  users.  Most\nimportantly,  DRCP  allows  rapid  configuration
    \ by  moving  address\nconsistency  checking  from the  critical  path.  Other
    new  features\nallow:  a) clients to know when to get a new address  independent
    \ of\nthe layer-2 access  technology,  b) efficient use of scarce  wireless\nbandwidth,
    c) clients to be routers, d) dynamic  addition or deletion\nof address  pools
    to any DRCP node, and e) message  exchange  without\nbroadcast.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
