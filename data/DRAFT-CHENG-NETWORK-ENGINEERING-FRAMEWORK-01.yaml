abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document outlines an early draft of a Network Engineering
    (NE) \nframework. It defines the Network Engineering function and discusses \nthe
    differences between Traffic Engineering (TE) and Network \nEngineering. It identifies
    network architecture and major functional \ncapabilities for Network Engineering.
    Network Engineering provides a \nnew set of capabilities that is utilized in conjunction
    with Traffic \nEngineering to optimize the network efficiency, operation, and
    \nutilization.\n\t </p>\n      "
