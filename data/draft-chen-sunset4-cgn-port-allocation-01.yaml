abstract:
- content: "<p>The document enumerated methods of port assignment in CGN contexts,
    more focused on NAT64 environments. The analysis categorized the different methods
    with several key features. Corresponding to those features, the uses of existing
    protocols are also described. The potential concerns and workaround have been
    discussed. It's expected the document could provide a informative base line to
    help operators choosing a proper method.</p>"
