abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    The most common user applications for data communication (including
    \n    web browsing and e-mail) lack a method for name resolution in multi-\n    hop
    wireless ad-hoc networks of mobile nodes (MANETs). While the \n    Domain Name
    System (DNS) works well on the fixed Internet, it \n    represents a centralized
    approach to name resolution, which is not \n    suitable for MANETs. This document
    specifies a straightforward \n    solution for name resolution lookup in on-demand
    MANETs, i.e. MANETs \n    that are routed with a reactive routing protocol, such
    as DSR [DSR] \n    or AODV [AODV]. Names are resolved locally within the MANET
    with a \n    mechanism similar to multicast DNS or LLMNR on a link. Although \n
    \   names resolved locally normally will have preference, MANET nodes \n    that
    have access to external networks may complement the local name \n    resolution
    by injecting into the MANET lookup results resolved by a \n    conventional DNS
    server. The proposed solution applies equally well \n    to IPv4 or IPv6. \n\t
