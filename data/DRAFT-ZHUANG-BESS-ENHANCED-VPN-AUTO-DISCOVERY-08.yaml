abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A variety of VPN technologies have been widely deployed to
    bear\n   different services.  As new applications develop, a requirement has\n
    \  been proposed for auto-discovery of Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks\n   (L3VPN)
    and enhanced auto-discovery requirements for other VPN\n   technologies that already
    have basic auto-discovery mechanisms.\n\n   This document identifies some possible
    applications of these auto-\n   discovery requirements and defines a new BGP NLRI,
    called the BGP-\n   VPN-INSTANCE NLRI, to satisfy the requirement for auto-discovery
    of\n   BGP VPN instances. It also defines a new type of extended community,\n
    \  called the Import Route Target, which can be applied to auto-\n   discovery
    mechanisms of multiple VPN technologies.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
