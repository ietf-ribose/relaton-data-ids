abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This note describes an IPv6 multi-homing solution that achieves\nequivalent
    fault tolerance benefits to those provided by current IPv4\nmulti-homing solution
    while preserving the route aggregation\ncapabilities of the Provider-based Aggregation
    scheme.  The solution\nlies on the inclusion, in every packet flowing to a multi-homed
    site,\nof an extension header containing multiple alternative route\ninformation
    to the destination, so that if the original destination\naddress becomes unreachable,
    alternative route is used for reaching\nthe destination.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
