abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) defines a framework for applications\n
    \  to announce and discover services.  This includes service names,\n   service
    instance names, common parameters for selecting a service\n   instance (weight
    or priority) as well as other service-specific\n   parameters.  For the specific
    case of autonomic networks, GeneRic\n   Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) intends
    to be used for service\n   discovery in addition to the setup of basic connectivity.\n
    \  Reinventing advanced service discovery for GRASP with a similar set\n   of
    features as DNS-SD would result in duplicated work.  To avoid\n   that, this document
    defines how to use GRASP to announce and discover\n   services relying upon DNS-SD
    features while maintaining the intended\n   simplicity of GRASP.  To that aim,
    the document defines name\n   discovery and schemes for reusable elements in GRASP
    objectives.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
