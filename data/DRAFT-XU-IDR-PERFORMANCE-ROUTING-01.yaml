abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current BGP specification doesn't use network performance
    metrics\n   (e.g., network latency) in the route selection decision process.\n
    \  This document describes a performance-based BGP routing mechanism in\n   which
    network latency metric is taken as one of the route selection\n   criteria.  This
    routing mechanism is useful for those server\n   providers with global reach to
    deliver low-latency network\n   connectivity services to their customers.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
