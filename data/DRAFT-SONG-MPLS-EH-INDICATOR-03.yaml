abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The intention of this document is to enumerate and describe
    the\n   candidate schemes that can be used to indicate the presence of the\n   MPLS
    extension header(s) following the MPLS label stack.  After a\n   careful evaluation
    of these options by comparing their pros and cons,\n   it is expected that one
    should be chosen as the final standard scheme\n   for MPLS extension header indicator.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
