abstract:
- content: "<p>Session recording is a critical requirement in many business communications
    environments such as call centers and financial trading floors. In some of these
    environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory and compliance reasons.
    In others, calls may be recorded for quality control or business analytics. Recording
    is typically done by sending a copy of the session media to the recording devices.
    This document specifies requirements for extensions to SIP that will manage delivery
    of RTP media from an end- point that originates media (or that has access to it)
    to a recording device. This is being referred to as SIP-based Media Recording.</p>"
