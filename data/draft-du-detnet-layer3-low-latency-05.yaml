abstract:
- content: "<p>It is complex to support deterministic forwarding in a large scale
    network because there is too much dynamic traffic in the network and the data
    model becomes hard to predict after traffic aggregation on the intermediate nodes.
    This document introduces the problem of micro-bursts in the layer3 network, and
    analyses the method to decrease the micro-bursts in layer3 network for low-latency
    traffic.</p>"
