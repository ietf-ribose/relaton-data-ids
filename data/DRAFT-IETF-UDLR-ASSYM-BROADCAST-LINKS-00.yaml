abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Satellite hops, the region between a basestation and a set
    of mobile\n   nodes, and a number of other similar scenarios represent a challenge\n
    \  to providing IP connectivity at various levels due to the 1-many\n   broadcast
    nature of the link. The UDLR group has addressed these\n   problems in some limited
    situations. The general case, where\n   multiple, possibly partially intersecting
    set of such hops are part\n   of a general set of Internet Paths (or need to be
    considered in the\n   route computation that will buld such paths) is complex.
    This note is\n   an attempt to outline a framework for the general case. We include\n
    \  certain recent approaches to managing connectivity that also include\n   quality
    of service, multiple alternate paths, and traffic engineering\n   considerations.\n
    \n   In this version of this note, we are discussing techniques for\n   connectivity,
    so mechanisms and techniques described are applicable\n   to routers. We would
    need a seperate (and hopefully much simpler) set\n   of mechanisms to incorporate
    hosts that exist on a unidirectional\n   link or path that includes such links.\n\n\t
