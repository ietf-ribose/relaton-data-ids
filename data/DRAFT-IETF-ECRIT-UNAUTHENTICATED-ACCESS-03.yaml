abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF emergency services architecture assumes that the calling\n
    \  device has acquired rights to use the access network or that no\n   authentication
    is required for the access network, such as for public\n   wireless access points.
    \ Subsequent protocol interactions, such as\n   obtaining location information,
    learning the address of the Public\n   Safety Answering Point (PSAP) and the emergency
    call itself are\n   largely decoupled from the underlying network access procedures.\n\n
    \  In some cases, however, the device does not have these credentials\n   for
    network access, does not have a VoIP service provider, or the\n   credentials
    have become invalid, e.g., because the user has exhausted\n   their prepaid balance
    or the account has expired.\n\n   This document provides a problem statement,
    introduces terminology\n   and describes an extension for the base IETF emergency
    services\n   architecture to address these scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
