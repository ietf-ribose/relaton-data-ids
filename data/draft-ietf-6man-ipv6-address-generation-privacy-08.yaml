abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses privacy and security considerations for several
    IPv6 address generation mechanisms, both standardized and non-standardized. It
    evaluates how different mechanisms mitigate different threats and the trade-offs
    that implementors, developers, and users face in choosing different addresses
    or address generation mechanisms.</p>"
