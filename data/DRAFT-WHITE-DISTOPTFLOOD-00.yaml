abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Dense topologies, such as data center fabrics based on the
    Clos and\n   butterfly fabric topologies.  Flooding mechanisms designed for sparse\n
    \  topologies, when used in these dense topologies, can result in slower\n   convergence
    times and higher resource utilization.  The modifications\n   to the flooding
    mechanism in the Intermediate System to Intermediate\n   System (IS-IS) link state
    protocol described in this document reduce\n   resource utilization to a minimum,
    while increaseing convergence\n   performance in dense topologies.\n\n   Note
    that a Clos fabric is used as the primary example of a desne\n   flooding topology
    throughout this document.  However, the flooding\n   optimizations described in
    this document apply to any dense topology.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
