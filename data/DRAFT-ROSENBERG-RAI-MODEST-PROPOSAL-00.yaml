abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has become widely deployed
    on\nthe Internet, covering a wide range of usages from toll bypass to\ninstant
    messaging, from service provider to enterprise.  However, its\nrealization in
    actual deployments differs in important ways from the\nspecifications.  This has
    created a gulf between existing and ongoing\nstandards work, and real live deployments.
    \ This document argues that\nthe RAI area should focus on solving real world interoperability\nissues
    and address real world functional gaps.\n\t </p>\n      "
