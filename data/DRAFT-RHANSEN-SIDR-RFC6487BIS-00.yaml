abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates
    for\n   the purpose of supporting validation of assertions of \"right-of-use\"\n
    \  of Internet Number Resources (INRs).  The certificates issued under\n   this
    profile are used to convey the issuer's authorization of the\n   subject to be
    regarded as the current holder of a \"right-of-use\" of\n   the INRs that are
    described in the certificate.  This document\n   contains the normative specification
    of Certificate and Certificate\n   Revocation List (CRL) syntax in the Resource
    Public Key\n   Infrastructure (RPKI).  This document also specifies profiles for
    the\n   format of certificate requests and specifies the Relying Party RPKI\n
    \  certificate path validation procedure.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 6487.\n\n\t
