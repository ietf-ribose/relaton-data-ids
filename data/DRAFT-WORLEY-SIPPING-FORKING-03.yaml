abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The rules for SIP proxies are organized so that when a UAC sends
    an\nout-of-dialog request, even if the request is forked to a number of\nUASs,
    (usually) only one UAS will accept the request, and only the\nfinal response from
    that UAS will be returned to the UAC.  This\nforking mechanism is optimal for
    an INVITE intended to connect one\nhuman user with another human uses, but is
    poor for requests that\nhave a \"one to many\" nature, especially PUBLISH and
    SUBSCRIBE\nrequests, but also including some INVITEs.  This document proposes
    an\nalternative forking mechanism that better supports \"one to many\"\nrequests,
    and that mechanism be the standardized meaning of the\n(existing but weakly specified)
    \"Request-Disposition: no-cancel,\nparallel\" header.\n\t </p>\n      "
