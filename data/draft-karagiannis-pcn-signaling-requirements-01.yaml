abstract:
- content: "<p>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality
    of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. The overall PCN
    architecture is described in RFC 5559. This memo describes the requirements for
    the signaling applied within the PCN domain: PCN feedback is carried from the
    PCN-egress-node to the decision point and the decision point may demand for the
    measurement and delivery of the PCN rate sent at the PCN-ingress-node. The decision
    point may be either collocated with the PCN-ingress-node or a centralized node.</p>"
