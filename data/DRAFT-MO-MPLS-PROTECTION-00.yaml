abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Protection issues for MPLS LSP have been discussed in recent IETF
    meetings.\nVarious drafts have different proposals on establishing the working\nand
    protection LSP ([1]-[5]). But how to reserve bandwidth for the\nprotection LSP
    has not be discussed. If the bandwidth for the\nprotection LSP is reserved in
    a similar fashion as that of the working\nLSP, the bandwidth utilization in the
    network would be very poor.\nIn this draft, an algorithm for reserve bandwidth
    for protection LSP\nis presented which enables very efficient bandwidth reservation
    for\nsingle fault protection.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
