abstract:
- content: "<p>Many stringent requirements are imposed on today's network, such as
    low latency, high availability and reliability in order to support several use
    cases such as IoT, Gaming, Content distribution, Robotics etc. Networks need to
    be flexible and dynamic in terms of allocation of services and resources. Network
    Operators should be able to reconfigure the composition of a service and steer
    users towards new service end points as user move or resource availability changes.
    SFC allows network operators to easily create and reconfigure service function
    chains dynamically in response to changing network requirements. We discuss a
    use case where Service Function Chain can adapt or self-organize as demanded by
    the network condition without requiring SPI re-classification. This can be achieved,
    for example, by decoupling the service consumer and service endpoint by a new
    service function proposed in this draft. We describe few requirements for this
    service function to enable dynamic switching between consumer and end point.</p>"
