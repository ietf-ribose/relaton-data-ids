abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we present a two-round signing variant of FROST, a Flexible
    Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold signature scheme. FROST signatures can be issued
    after a threshold number of entities cooperate to issue a signature, allowing
    for improved distribution of trust and redundancy with respect to a secret key.
    Further, this draft specifies signatures that are compatible with EdDSA verification
    of signatures. However, this draft does not generate deterministic nonces as defined
    by EdDSA, to ensure protection against a key-recovery attack that is possible
    when even only one participant is malicious.</p>"
