abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OAM (Operations, Administration and Maintenance - as per BCP161,\n
    \  [RFC6291]) processes for data networks are often subject to the\n   problem
    of circular dependencies when relying on connectivity\n   provided by the network
    to be managed for the OAM purposes.\n   Provisioning during device/network bring
    up tends to be far less easy\n   to automate than service provisioning later on,
    changes in core\n   network functions impacting reachability may not be easy to
    be\n   automated either because of ongoing connectivity requirements for the\n
    \  OAM, and widely used OAM protocols are not secure enough to be\n   carried
    across the network without security concerns.\n\n   This document describes how
    to integrate OAM with the autonomic\n   control plane (ACP) in Autonomic Networks
    (AN) to provide stable and\n   secure connectivity for conducting OAM.  This connectivity
    is not\n   subject to aforementioned circular dependencies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
