abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A number of enhancements to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
    have been proposed.  Some have been implemented, and some are advancing toward
    standardization.  It is likely that additional enhancements will be proposed in
    the future.  This document defines a mechanism for advertising LDP enhancements
    at session initialization time, as well as a mechanism to enable and disable enhancements
    after LDP session establishment. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t </p>\n      "
