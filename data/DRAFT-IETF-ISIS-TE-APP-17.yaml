abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Existing traffic engineering related link attribute advertisements\n
    \  have been defined and are used in RSVP-TE deployments.  Since the\n   original
    RSVP-TE use case was defined, additional applications (e.g.,\n   Segment Routing
    Policy, Loop Free Alternate) that also make use of\n   the link attribute advertisements
    have been defined . In cases where\n   multiple applications wish to make use
    of these link attributes, the\n   current advertisements do not support application
    specific values for\n   a given attribute, nor do they support indication of which\n
    \  applications are using the advertised value for a given link.  This\n   document
    introduces new link attribute advertisements that address\n   both of these shortcomings.\n\n\n\t
