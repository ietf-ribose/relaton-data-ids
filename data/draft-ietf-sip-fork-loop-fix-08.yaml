abstract:
- content: "<p>This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP), to address a security vulnerability identified in SIP proxy behavior.
    This vulnerability enables an attack against SIP networks where a small number
    of legitimate, even authorized, SIP requests can stimulate massive amounts of
    proxy-to-proxy traffic. This document strengthens loop-detection requirements
    on SIP proxies when they fork requests (that is, forward a request to more than
    one destination). It also corrects and clarifies the description of the loop-detection
    algorithm such proxies are required to implement. Additionally, this document
    defines a Max-Breadth mechanism for limiting the number of concurrent branches
    pursued for any given request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
