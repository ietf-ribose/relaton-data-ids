abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an algorithm that makes Interactive\n
    \  Connectivity Establishment (ICE) connectivity checks more responsive\n   by
    reducing delays in dual-stack host ICE connectivity checks when\n   there is a
    path failure for an address family preferred by the\n   application or by the
    operating system.  As IPv6 is usually preferred\n   over IPv4, the procedures
    in this document helps avoid user-\n   noticeable delays when the IPv6 path is
    broken or excessively slow.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
