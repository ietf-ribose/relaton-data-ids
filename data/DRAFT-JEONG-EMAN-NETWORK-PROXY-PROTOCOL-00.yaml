abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Climate change and cost drives all sectors of industry and
    society as\n   a whole towards more energy-efficient technology, products and
    life\n   styles.  The collection of Internet infrastructure and the attached\n
    \  devices are a large user of electrical energy and therefore of course\n   are
    no exception regarding this trend.  This memo attempts to\n   identify obstacles
    and more importantly technology options for an\n   energy-efficient Internet with
    a focus on the protocols that are the\n   product of the IETF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
