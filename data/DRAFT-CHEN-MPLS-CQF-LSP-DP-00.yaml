abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Large-scale Deterministic Network (LDN) [ldn] aims to achieve
    bounded\n   latency forwarding on layer-3 networks that contain long-distance\n
    \  links, large number of nodes and flows.  LDN requires a data plane\n   mechanism
    to indicate different forwarding cycles in the upstream\n   node.  This document
    proposes to use multiple MPLS labels to indicate\n   this kind of information,
    for MPLS-LSP data plane.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
