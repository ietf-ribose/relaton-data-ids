abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proposed are the allocation of a NAL unit type from the\n   \"unspecified\"
    set of NAL units of H.265 [HEVC] for the purpose of\n   payload header extensions,
    a generic syntax for the use of that\n   pseudo NAL unit, and one application
    for it: the signaling of\n   temporal scalability support information.  Two alternative
    designs\n   are included.  The content of this draft is intended for\n   incorporation
    into the H.265 RTP payload [h265-payload].\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
