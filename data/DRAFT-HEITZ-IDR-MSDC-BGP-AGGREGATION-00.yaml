abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A design for a fabric of switches to connect up to one million\n
    \  servers in a data center is described.  At that scale, it is\n   impractical
    for every switch to maintain knowledge about every other\n   switch and every
    other link in the fabric.  Aggregation of routes is\n   an excellent way to scale
    such a fabric.  However, aggregation\n   presents some problems under link failures
    or switch failures.  This\n   design solves those problems.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
