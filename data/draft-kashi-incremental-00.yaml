abstract:
- content: "<p>The Lightweight Directory Access protocol [1] provides a means for
    clients to read and write information stored in a distributed directory system.
    This information is stored as attributes of entries. The attributes may be multi-valued.
    The LDAP protocol reads a multi-valued attribute as a single entity. This can
    be inconvenient or even impossible when the number of values in a multi-valued
    attribute becomes large.</p>"
