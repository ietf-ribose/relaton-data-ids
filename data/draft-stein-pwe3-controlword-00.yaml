abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Control words are used by PWE3 service emulations to carryinformation
    needed by the PWE3 Encapsulation Layer and the PSNConvergence Layer. The generic
    PWE3 documents do not specify theformat of this control word and hence contradictory
    control wordformats have proliferated in the various service encapsulationdocuments.
    We present an analysis of these control words and asuggestion for a single unified
    control word family.</p>"
