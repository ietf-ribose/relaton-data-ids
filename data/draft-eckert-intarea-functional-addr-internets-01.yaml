abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent work has raised interest in exploring network layer addressing
    that is more flexible than fixed-length addressing as used in IPv4 (32 bit) and
    IPv6 (128 bit). The reasons for the interest include both support for multiple
    and potentially novel address semantics, but also optimizations of addressing
    for existing semantics such as unicast tailored not for the global Internet but
    to better support private networks / limited domains. This memo explores in the
    view of the author yet little explored reasons for more flexible addresses namely
    the problems and opportunities for Internetworking with Independent Network Address
    Spaces (IINAS). To better enable such internetworks, this memo proposes a framework
    for a Functional Addressing model. This model also intends to support several
    other addressing goals including programmability and multiple semantics.</p>"
