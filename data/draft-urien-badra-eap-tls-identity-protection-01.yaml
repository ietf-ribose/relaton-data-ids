abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism that ensures EAP-TLS identity protection.
    The main idea is to encrypt the client's certificate. Three procedures are proposed
    in order to determine the certificate encryption mechanism, - Implicit, the client's
    certificate is encrypted according to a pre-defined algorithm, deduced from the
    server's certificate. - Notified, the EAP-identity response message, delivered
    by the client includes information that precise the encryption algorithm to be
    used. - Negotiated, the client indicates a list of encryption algorithm, the server
    chooses one of them, and indicates its choice.</p>"
