abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document analyzes multihoming from the perspective of
    the\n   Internet edge: i.e.  hosts and other edge networks.  We built on top\n
    \  of the previous work that describes goals and benefits of\n   multihoming,
    and identify problems for the provisioning of\n   multihoming at the edge level.
    \ In this memo, we first look at the\n   problem of multihoming for a generic
    IPv6 node, followed by narrowing\n   the analysis down to mobile hosts and networks.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
