abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an efficient augmented password-authenticated\n
    \  key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user remembers a low-entropy\n   password
    and its verifier is registered in the intended server.  In\n   general, the user's
    password is chosen from a small set of\n   dictionary, making the password susceptible
    to offline dictionary\n   attacks.  The AugPAKE protocol described here is secure
    against\n   passive attacks, active attacks and offline dictionary attacks (on\n
    \  the obtained messages with passive/active attacks), and also provides\n   resistance
    to server compromise (in the context of augmented PAKE\n   security).  Based on
    the AugPAKE protocol, this document also\n   specifies a new password-only authentication
    handshake for Transport\n   Layer Security (TLS) protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
