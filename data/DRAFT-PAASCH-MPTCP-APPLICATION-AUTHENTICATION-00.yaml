abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath TCP (MPTCP), described in [3], is an extension to
    TCP to\n   provide the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between\n
    \  hosts.\n\n   MPTCP currently specifies a single authentication mechanism, using\n
    \  keys that are initially exchanged in the clear.  There are\n   application-layer
    protocols that may have better information as to\n   the identity of the parties
    and so is able to better provide keying\n   material that could be used for the
    authentication of future\n   subflows.\n\n   This document specifies \"application
    layer authentication\" for\n   Multipath TCP, an alternatively negotiated keying
    mechanism for\n   MPTCP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
