abstract:
  content: "<p>Currently the GMPLS signaling requires to include a 'LSP EncodingType'
    in the Generalized Label Request ([GMPLS-SIG]), which indicatesthe encoding of
    the LSP being requested. Upon receiving a RSVP PATHmessage or CR-LDP REQUEST message
    that contains a Generalized Label Request, a LSR must verify if the receiving
    and transmitting interfacecan support the LSP. In particular on the transmitting
    side, the nodeeither finds an interface that has the same switching class, among
    other requirements, or it may use a FA-LSP, i.e., another class ofswitching.</p>"
