abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Extension Headers allow for the extension of the IPv6 protocol,
    and provide support for some core functionality such as IPv6 fragmentation. However,
    IPv6 Extension Headers are deemed to present a challenge to IPv6 implementations
    and networks, and are known to be intentionally filtered in some existing IPv6
    deployments. This summarizes the issues associated with IPv6 extension headers,
    and presents real-world data regarding the extent to which packets with IPv6 extension
    headers are filtered in the public Internet, and where in the network such filtering
    occurs. Additionally, it provides some guidance to operators in troubleshooting
    IPv6 blackholes resulting from the use of IPv6 extension headers. Finally, this
    document provides some advice to protocol designers, and discusses areas where
    further work might be needed.</p>"
