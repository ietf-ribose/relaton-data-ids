abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>It is often useful for a single user to have multiple email addresses\nwhich
    can be used to assist categorizing incoming email.  One way of\ndoing this is
    to divide the local-part of an email address into user\nand detail parts.  The
    user part is used to route the message within\nthe specified domain and the detail
    part is used to route the message\naccording to a particular user's wishes.\n\nThis
    specification formalizes the de-facto standard for subaddressing\nin use today
    and includes advice and requirements for final delivery\nagents, MUAs and mail
    list servers which wish to support\nsubaddressing.\n\t </p>\n      "
