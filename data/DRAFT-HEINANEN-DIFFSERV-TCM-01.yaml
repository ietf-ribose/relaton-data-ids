abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a Three Color Marker (TCM), which can
    be used\n   as component in a Diffserv traffic conditioner [RFC2475, RFC2474].\n
    \  The TCM meters a traffic stream and marks its packets according to\n   three
    traffic parameters, Committed Information Rate (CIR), Committed\n   Burst Size
    (CBS), and Excess Burst Size (EBS), to be either green,\n   yellow, or red.  The
    TCM is useful, for example, in policing a\n   service, where green, yellow, and
    red packets are forwarded with\n   increasing discard probability.\n\n\t </p>\n
