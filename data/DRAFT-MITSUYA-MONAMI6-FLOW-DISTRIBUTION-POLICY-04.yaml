abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   The multiple care-of addresses registration protocol [1]
    allows a\n   mobile node to maintain, at the same time, multiple virtual paths\n
    \  with its home agent or correspondent nodes.  This document presents a\n   policy
    data set for flow distribution to be used with the multiple\n   care-of addresses
    registration protocol.  This policy data set\n   defines policies, in an OS-independant
    manner, for a mobile node and\n   its home agent or correspondent node, from the
    point of view of one\n   of these nodes.  This data set is aimed to be processed
    by this node\n   and the output is a set of filter rules to be used and exchanged
    with\n   its correspondents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
