abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Some document authors want to express requirement levels using
    the\ntraditional definitions of \"MUST\" and \"SHOULD\" from RFC 2119, but\nalso
    want to express that there is an expectation that later versions\nof the document
    may change those requirements.  For example, they may\nwant to express \"this
    SHOULD be implemented now, but we expect that\nthis will become a MUST requirement
    in a future update to this\nstandard\".\nThis document defines three new keywords,
    \"MUST-\", \"SHOULD+\", and\n\"SHOULD-\" to facilitate such definitions.\n\t </p>\n
