abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Host Identity Protocol Diet EXchange
    (HIP\n   DEX), a variant of the Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2) and\n
    \  specifically developed for use on low end processors.  The HIP DEX\n   protocol
    design aims at reducing the overhead of the employed\n   cryptographic primitives
    by omitting public-key signatures and\n   cryptographic hash functions.\n\n   The
    HIP DEX protocol is primarily designed for computation or memory-\n   constrained
    sensor/actuator devices.  Like HIPv2, it is expected to\n   be used together with
    a suitable security protocol such as the\n   Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP)
    for the protection of upper layer\n   protocol data.  Unlike HIPv2, HIP DEX does
    not support Forward\n   Secrecy (FS), and MUST only be used on devices where FS
    is\n   prohibitively expensive.  In addition, HIP DEX can also be used as a\n
    \  keying mechanism for security primitives at the MAC layer, e.g., for\n   IEEE
    802.15.4 networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
