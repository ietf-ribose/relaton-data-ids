abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document clarifies requirements for IPv6 routers with
    respect to\n   the Hop-by-Hop (HBH) Options Extension Header.  These requirements\n
    \  are applicable to all IPv6 routers, regardless of whether they\n   maintain
    a strict separation between forwarding and control plane\n   hardware.  In this
    respect, this document updates RFC 2460 and RFC\n   7045.\n\n   This document
    also describes forwarding plane procedures for\n   processing the HBH Options
    Extension Header.  These procedures are\n   applicable to implementations that
    maintain a strict separation\n   between forwarding and control plane implementations.\n\n
    \  The procedures described herein satisfy the above mentioned\n   requirements
    by processing HBH Options on the forwarding plane to the\n   greatest degree possible.
    \ If a packet containing HBH Options must be\n   dispatched to the control plane,
    it is rate limited before\n   dispatching.  In order to comply with the requirements
    of this\n   specification, implementations may execute the procedures described\n
    \  herein or any other procedures that result in compliant behavior.\n\n\t </p>\n
