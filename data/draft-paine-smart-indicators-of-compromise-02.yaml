abstract:
- content: "<p>Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are an important technique in attack
    defence (often called cyber defence). This document outlines the different types
    of IoC, their associated benefits and limitations, and discusses their effective
    use. It also contextualises the role of IoCs in defending against attacks through
    describing a recent case study. This draft does not pre-suppose where IoCs can
    be found or should be detected - as they can be discovered and deployed in networks,
    endpoints or elsewhere - rather, engineers should be aware that they need to be
    detectable (either by endpoints, security appliances or network-based defences,
    or ideally all) to be effective. The purpose of this draft is to document both
    the operational issues, but also the best practices associated with use of IoCs
    today. This draft provides a foundation for proposals for new approaches to operational
    challenges in network security.</p>"
