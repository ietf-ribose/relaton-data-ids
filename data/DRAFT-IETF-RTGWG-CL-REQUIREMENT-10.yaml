abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is often a need to provide large aggregates of bandwidth
    that\n   are best provided using parallel links between routers or MPLS LSR.\n
    \  In core networks there is often no alternative since the aggregate\n   capacities
    of core networks today far exceed the capacity of a single\n   physical link or
    single packet processing element.\n\n   The presence of parallel links, with each
    link potentially comprised\n   of multiple layers has resulted in additional requirements.
    \ Certain\n   services may benefit from being restricted to a subset of the\n
    \  component links or a specific component link, where component link\n   characteristics,
    such as latency, differ.  Certain services require\n   that an LSP be treated
    as atomic and avoid reordering.  Other\n   services will continue to require only
    that reordering not occur\n   within a microflow as is current practice.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
