abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on the\nInternet
    today and make up a large portion of the traffic in many\nnetworks.  In P2P applications,
    one technique for reducing the total\namount of P2P traffic is to introduce storage
    capabilities within the\nnetwork.  Traditional caches (e.g., P2P and Web caches)
    provide such\nstorage, but they are complex (due to explicitly supporting\nindividual
    P2P application protocols) and they do not allow users to\nmanage access to content
    in the cache.  For example, Content\nProviders cannot easily control access and
    resource usage policies to\nsatisfy their own requirements.  This document discusses
    the\nintroduction of in-network storage for P2P applications, shows the\nneed
    for a standard protocol for accessing this storage, and\nidentifies the scope
    of this protocol.  The accessing protocol can\nalso be used by other applications
    with similar requirements.\n\t </p>\n      "
