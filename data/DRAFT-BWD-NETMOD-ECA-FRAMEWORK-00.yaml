abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Event-driven management is meant to provide a useful method
    to\n   monitor state change of managed objects and resources, and facilitate\n
    \  automatic triggering of a response to events, based on an established\n   set
    of rules.  This would provide rapid autonomic responses to\n   specific conditions,
    enabling self-management behaviors, including:\n   self-configuration, self-healing,
    self-optimization, and self-\n   protection.\n\n   This document provides a framework
    that describes the architecture\n   for supporting event-driven management of
    managed object state across\n   devices.  It does not describe specific protocols
    or protocol\n   extensions needed to realize the objectives and capabilities\n
    \  discussed in the document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
