abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this note we will present a functional decomposition of
    the\n   multihomig protocol i.e. the protocol for preserving established\n   communications
    in multihomed environments.  We will do so by\n   describing a protocol walkthrough,
    presenting which functions have to\n   be performed at each stage and the messages
    required to accomplish\n   them.  The functional decomposition presented in this
    draft is based\n   on the general functional analysis of multihoming approaches\n
    \  presented in [3].\n\t </p>\n      "
