abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this informational document is to establish definitions,
    discussion and measurement techniques for data center benchmarking. Also, it is
    to introduce new terminologies applicable to data center performance evaluations.
    The purpose of this document is not to define the test methodology, but rather
    establish the important concepts when one is interested in benchmarking network
    equipment in the data center.</p>"
