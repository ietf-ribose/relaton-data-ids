abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The photonic firewall oriented routing and spectrum allocation\n
    \  strategy in elastic optical networks is proposed. For the security\n   detecting
    requirement, each light-path should pass through at least a\n   photonic firewall.
    To reduce the blocking rate and improve the\n   spectrum efficiency, the whole
    network is divided into several parts\n   according to the locations of all deployed
    photonic firewalls. A\n   photonic firewall is responsible for the security detecting
    for each\n   part. This strategy has a low complexity and is suitable for large-\n
    \  scale optical networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
