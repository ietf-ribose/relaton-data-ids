abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a detailed analysis of the problems
    and\n   requirements of network addressing in \"Internet in space\" for\n   terrestrial
    users.  It introduces the basics of satellite mega-\n   constellations, terrestrial
    terminals/ground stations, and their\n   inter-networking.  Then it explicitly
    analyzes how space-terrestrial\n   mobility yeilds challenges for the logical
    topology, addressing, and\n   their impact on routing.  The requirements of addressing
    in the\n   space-terrestrial network are discussed in detail, including\n   uniqueness,
    stability, locality, scalability, efficiency and backward\n   compatibility with
    terrestrial Internet.  The problems and\n   requirements of network addressing
    in space-terrestrial networks are\n   finally outlined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
