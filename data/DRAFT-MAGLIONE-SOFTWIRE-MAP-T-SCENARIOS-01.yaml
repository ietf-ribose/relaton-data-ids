abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Softwire working group is currently discussing both encapsulation
    and\n   translation based stateless IPv4/IPv6 solutions in order to be able\n
    \  to provide IPv4 connectivity to customers in an IPv6 only\n   environment.\n\n
    \  The purpose of this document is to describe some use cases that would\n   take
    advantage of a translation based solution, by highlighting the\n   operational
    benefits that a translation based approach would allow.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
