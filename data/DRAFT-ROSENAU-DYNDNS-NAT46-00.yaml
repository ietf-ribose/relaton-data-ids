abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many devices in private homes can be controlled via Web browser
    from\n   another computer in the internet.  This assumes that the IP address\n
    \  of the device is known and that the private internet access has a\n   public
    IP address at all.\n\n   Due to the IPv4 address shortage many internet providers
    only provide\n   IPv6 internet access while many internet accesses (and therefore
    Web\n   browsers) are IPv4-only.\n\n   This document describes a method that allows
    an internet service\n   provider that also provides dynamic DNS to the customers
    to allow\n   accessing IPv6-only devices from IPv4-only Web browsers.\n\n\t </p>\n
