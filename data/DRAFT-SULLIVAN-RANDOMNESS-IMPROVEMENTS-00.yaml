abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Randomness is a crucial ingredient for TLS and related transport\n
    \  security protocols.  Weak or predictable cryptographically-strong\n   pseudorandom
    number generators (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited\n   for malicious purposes.
    \ See the Dual EC random number backdoor for a\n   relevant example of this problem.
    \ This document describes a way for\n   security protocol participants to mix
    their long-term private key\n   into the entropy pool from which random values
    are derived.  This may\n   help mitigate problems that stem from broken CSPRNGs.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
