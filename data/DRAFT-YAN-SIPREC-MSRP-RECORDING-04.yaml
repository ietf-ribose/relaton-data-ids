abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SIPREC is capable of recording interactive text media that
    is\n   transmitted via RTP.  However that format is not commonly used for\n   message
    or chat scenarios.  There is also a need for recording text\n   media carried
    via MSRP.  One case of note is exchange of text between\n   hearing-impaired users
    and emergence service bureaus.  Also,\n   recording support is needed for MSRP
    used in chat conferences and\n   multimedia conferences.\n\n   This document describes
    how to achieve MSRP channel recording within\n   the mechanism of SIP Recording
    (SIPREC).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
