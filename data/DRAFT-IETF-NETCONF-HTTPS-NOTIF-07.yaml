abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines both a protocol for sending notifications
    over\n   HTTPS as well as extensions to the data model for configured\n   subscriptions
    defined in RFC 8639.  It also presents an example\n   module for configuration
    without using the data model defined in RFC\n   8639.\n\n   This document requires
    that the publisher is a \"server\" (e.g., a\n   NETCONF or RESTCONF server), but
    does not assume that the receiver is\n   a server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
