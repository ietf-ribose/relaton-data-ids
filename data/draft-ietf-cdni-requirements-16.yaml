abstract:
- content: "<p>Content delivery is frequently provided by specifically architected
    and provisioned Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). As a result of significant growth
    in content delivered over IP networks, existing CDN providers are scaling up their
    infrastructure. Many Network Service Providers and Enterprise Service Providers
    are also deploying their own CDNs. To deliver contents from the Content Service
    Provider (CSP) to end users, the contents may traverse across multiple CDNs. This
    creates a need for interconnecting (previously) standalone CDNs so that they can
    collectively act as a single delivery platform from the CSP to the end users.
    The goal of the present document is to outline the requirements for the solution
    and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI working group.</p>"
