abstract:
- content: "<p>Vulnerability information will be recorded in risk detection and scanning.
    If a vulnerability is detected in a host during one scan, a record will be generated
    and added to the database, together with a time-stamp when the vulnerability is
    detected. If risk detection is carried out periodically, a series of records will
    be generated for each detection, until vulnerability is fixed. At present, a common
    way to record vulnerabilities is a vulnerability--a detection--a record, a vulnerability--N
    detections--N records(N&gt;1).In this way, the number of vulnerability records
    is related to the rounds of detection. In the case that the number of existing
    vulnerabilities remains unchanged, more frequent vulnerabilities are scanned,
    more records are recorded In this document, a light weighted vulnerability recording
    method is proposed. To make that, in the whole life cycle of a vulnerability,
    only one record is generated after multiple detections.</p>"
