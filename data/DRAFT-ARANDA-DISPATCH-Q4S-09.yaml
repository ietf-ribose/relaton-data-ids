abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes an application level protocol for the\n
    \  communication of end-to-end QoS compliance information based on\n   the   Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Session\n   Description Protocol (SDP).  The
    Quality for Service Protocol\n   (Q4S) provides a mechanism to negotiate and monitor
    latency,\n   jitter, bandwidth, and packet, and to alert whenever one of the\n
    \  negotiated conditions is violated.\n\n   Implementation details on the actions
    to be triggered upon\n   reception/detection of QoS alerts exchanged by the protocol
    are\n   out of scope of this document, it is application dependent (e.g.,\n   act
    to increase quality or reduce bit-rate) or network dependent\n   (e.g., change
    connection's quality profile).\n\n   This protocol specification is the product
    of research conducted\n   over a number of years, and is presented here as a permanent\n
    \  record and to offer a foundation for future similar work.  It does\n   not
    represent a standard protocol and does not have IETF\n   consensus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
