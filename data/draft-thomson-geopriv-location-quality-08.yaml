abstract:
- content: "<p>Parameters that define the expected quality of location information
    are defined for use in location protocols. These parameter can be used by a requester
    to indicate to a Location Server quality requirements for the location information
    that is requested. The Location Server is able to use this information to control
    how location information is determined. An optional indication of whether the
    quality requirements were met is defined to be provided by the Location Server
    alongside location information.</p>"
