abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax\n   [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct]
    does not define any direct methods\n   for using hash algorithms.  There are,
    however, circumstances where\n   hash algorithms are used, such as indirect signatures
    where the hash\n   of one or more contents are signed, and X.509 certificate or
    other\n   object identification by the use of a fingerprint.  This document\n
    \  defines a set of hash algorithms that are identified by COSE\n   Algorithm
    Identifiers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
