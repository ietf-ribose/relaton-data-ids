abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper create a method using a simple implementation to inform
    the traffic source at a very early stage that the network is becoming overload
    or congested and to ask the source to slow down its transmission rate. For simplicity,
    the network only indicates congesition to the node where data transmission rate
    will be reduced or increased adaptively. For the consideration of asymmetric routing
    and to shorten long control delay time, the congestion notification message generated
    for the incipient congestion in the network should immediately routed back according
    to its source address. Upon receiving this message, the source terminal discards
    this message and immediately initiates its congestion control, then it sends message
    to tell the network node to stop adding it.</p>"
