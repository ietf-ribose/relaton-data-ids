abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a simple and yet time-proven strategy for
    handling long lines in artwork in drafts using a backslash ('\\') character where
    line-folding has occurred. The strategy works on any text based artwork, producing
    consistent results regardless the artwork content. Using a per-artwork notice,
    the strategy is both self-documenting and enables automated reconstitution of
    the original artwork.</p>"
