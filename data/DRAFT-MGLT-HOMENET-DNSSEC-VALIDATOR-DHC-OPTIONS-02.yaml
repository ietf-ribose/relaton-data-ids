abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNSSEC provides data integrity and authentication for DNSSEC\n
    \  validators.  However, without valid trust anchor(s) and an acceptable\n   value
    for the current time, DNSSEC validation cannot be performed.\n   As a result,
    there are multiple cases where DNSSEC validation MUST\n   NOT be performed.  In
    addition, this list of exceptions is expected\n   to become larger over time.\n\n
    \  Considering an increasing number of cases where DNSSEC is disabled\n   adds
    complexity to the DNSSEC validator implementations and increases\n   the vectors
    that disable security.\n\n   This document assumes that DNSSEC adoption by end
    devices requires\n   that end devices MUST be able to support a DNSSEC validation
    always\n   set.  This MUST be valid today as well as in the future.\n\n   This
    document describes DHCP Options to provision the DHCP Client\n   with valid trust
    anchors and time so DNSSEC validation can be\n   performed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
