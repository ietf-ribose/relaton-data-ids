abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents an overview of contributions made in IETF,\nITU-T
    and T1X1.5 pertaining to the Optical Link Interface (OLI) and\nrelated interfaces.
    The intent is to summarize for the IETF\ncommunity the different approaches and
    corresponding interface and\nprotocol specification under-construction in these
    different\nstandardization bodies; this in order to provide the material during\nCCAMP
    WG meetings. Since the scope of this memo is not to replace in\nany case these
    contributions, we also strongly encourage the reader\nto refer to these contributions
    for more details.\nNotice since OIF contributions are regulated by privacy copyright\nrelated
    documents arenâ€™t referenced in this memo.\n\t </p>\n      "
