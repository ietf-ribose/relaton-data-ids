abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some enterprises are heavily TLS encrypted within their own\n
    \  enterprise network boundaries.  Many of these enterprises are also\n   utilizing
    out-of-band TLS decryption in order to inspect their own\n   traffic for purposes
    of troubleshooting, network security monitoring,\n   and for other kinds of monitoring.
    \ These monitoring functions are\n   mission critical, and cannot just be done
    without when TLS 1.3\n   (draft-ietf-tls-tls13-26) is released or when the RSA
    key exchange is\n   someday deprecated from TLS 1.2 (RFC5246).  This draft will
    outline\n   the use cases for out-of-band TLS decryption, as well as alternative\n
    \  suggestions for monitoring and troubleshooting and the limitations of\n   those
    alternatives.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
