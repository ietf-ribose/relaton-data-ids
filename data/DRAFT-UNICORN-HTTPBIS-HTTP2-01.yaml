abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification describes an optimized expression of the
    syntax of\n   the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  The HTTP/2.0 encapsulation\n
    \  enables more efficient use of network resources and reduced\n   perception
    of latency by allowing header field compression and\n   multiple concurrent messages
    on the same connection.  It also\n   introduces unsolicited push of representations
    from servers to\n   clients.\n\n   This document is an alternative to, but does
    not obsolete the\n   HTTP/1.1 message format or protocol.  HTTP's existing semantics\n
    \  remain unchanged.\n\n   This version of the draft has been marked for implementation.\n
    \  Interoperability testing will occur in the HTTP/2.0 interim in\n   Hamburg,
    DE, starting 2013-08-05.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
