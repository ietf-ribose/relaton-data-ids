abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The original specification of the membership of the IAOC included
    the\n   IETF and IAB Chairs as voting members.  While probably desirable\n   initially,
    this has turned out to have unfortunate side effects.\n   This document discusses
    those side effects and replaces those\n   specific individuals with liaisons from
    the IAB and IESG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
