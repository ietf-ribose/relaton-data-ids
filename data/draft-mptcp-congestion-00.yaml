abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Often endpoints are connected by multiple paths, but communicationsare
    usually restricted to a single path per connection. Resourceusage within the network
    would be more efficient were it possible forthese multiple paths to be used concurrently.
    Multipath TCP is aproposal to achieve multipath transport in TCP.New congestion
    control algorithms are needed for multipath transportprotocols such as Multipath
    TCP, as single path algorithms have aseries of issues in the multipath context.
    One of the prominentproblems is that running existing algorithms such as TCP New
    Renoindependently on each path would give the multipath flow more thanits fair
    share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of itssubflows. Further,
    it is desirable that a source with multiple pathsavailable will transfer more
    traffic using the least congested of thepaths, hence achieving resource pooling.
    This would increase theoverall utilization of the network and also its robustness
    tofailure.This document presents a congestion control algorithm which couplesthe
    congestion control algorithms running on different subflows bylinking their increase
    functions, and dynamically controls theoverall aggresiveness of the multipath
    flow. The result is apractical algorithm that is fair to TCP at bottlenecks while
    movingtraffic away from congested links.</p>"
