abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an overview of the issues associated
    with the\n   deployment of service functions (such as firewalls, load balancers,\n
    \  etc.) in large-scale environments.  The term service function\n   chaining
    is used to describe the definition and instantiation of an\n   ordered list of
    instances of such service functions, and the\n   subsequent \"steering\" of traffic
    flows through those service\n   functions.\n\n   The set of enabled service function
    chains reflect operator service\n   offerings and is designed in conjunction with
    application delivery\n   and service and network policy.\n\n   This document also
    identifies several key areas that the SFC working\n   group will investigate to
    guide its architectural and protocol work\n   and associated drafts.\n\n\t </p>\n
