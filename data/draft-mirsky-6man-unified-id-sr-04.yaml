abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing architecture leverages the paradigm of source routing.
    It can be realized in a network data plane by prepending the packet with a list
    of instructions, a.k.a. segments. A segment can be encoded as a Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) label, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address. Segment Routing can
    be applied in MPLS data plane by encoding segments in MPLS label stack. It also
    can be applied to IPv6 data plane by encoding a list of segment identifiers in
    IPv6 Segment Routing Extension Header (SRH). This document extends the use of
    the SRH to unified identifiers encoded as MPLS label or IPv4 address, to compress
    the SRH, and support support more detailed network programming and interworking
    between SR-MPLS and SRv6 domains.</p>"
