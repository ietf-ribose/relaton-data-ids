abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Wireless IP-based systems will be increasingly used for building\n
    \  control systems in the future where wireless devices interconnect\n   with
    each other, forming low-power and lossy networks (LLNs).  The\n   CoAP and 6LoWPAN
    standards are emerging as the de-facto protocols in\n   this area for resource-constrained
    devices.  Both multicast and\n   security are key needs in these networks.  This
    draft presents a\n   method for securing IPv6 multicast communication in LLNs
    based on the\n   DTLS which is already available in CoAP devices.  This draft
    deals\n   with the adaptation of the DTLS record layer to protect CoAP group\n
    \  communication, assuming that all group member devices are already\n   configured
    with the group security association.  The DTLS record\n   layer is used to provide
    authentication and encrypt multicast\n   messages using the group keying material
    before sending the message\n   via IPv6 multicast to the group.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
