abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Identifiers such as hostnames, URIs/IRIs, and email addresses
    are\n   often used in security contexts to identify security principals and\n
    \  resources.  In such contexts, an identifier supplied via some\n   protocol
    is often compared against some policy to make security\n   decisions such as whether
    the principal may access the resource, what\n   level of authentication or encryption
    is required, etc.  If the\n   parties involved in a security decision use different
    algorithms to\n   compare identifiers, then failure scenarios ranging from denial
    of\n   service to elevation of privilege can result.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
