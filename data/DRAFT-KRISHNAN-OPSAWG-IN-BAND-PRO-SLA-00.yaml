abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of in-band telemetry is to drive per packet, per hop
    real-\n   time monitoring for the infrastructure towards achieving a\n   programmable
    proactive SLA monitoring framework. Some of the key\n   aspects from a switch/NIC
    perspective are - ingress/egress timestamp\n   (latency), queue depth, bandwidth
    etc. Some of the key aspects from\n   a server perspective are - cache/memory
    statistics etc. This\n   document summarizes the current work in the industry
    in this area\n   and identifies key requirements for a comprehensive solution.\n
    \  Towards addressing the requirements, this document describes uses\n   cases
    and defines reusable monitoring packet formats across all\n   layers in the OAM
    hierarchy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
