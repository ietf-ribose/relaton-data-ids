abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The compression of domain names in DNS messages was introduced
    in\n   [RFC1035].  Although some remarks were made about applicability to\n   future
    defined resource record types, no method has been deployed yet\n   to support
    interoperable DNS compression for RR types specified since\n   then.\n \n   This
    document summarizes current problems and proposes a new\n   compression scheme
    to be applied to future RR types, which supports\n   interoperability.  Also,
    suggestions are made how to deal with RR\n   types defined so far.\n\t </p>\n
