abstract:
- content: "<p>During the early weeks and months of the COVID-19 pandemic, significant
    changes to Internet usage occurred as a result of a sudden global shift to people
    working, studying and quarantining at home. One aspect that this affected was
    interconnection between networks, which this paper studies. This paper explores
    some of the effects of these changes on Internet interconnection points, in terms
    of utilization, traffic ratios, and other performance characteristics such as
    latency.</p>"
