abstract:
  content: "<p>Connectivity between customer sites in an IP Virtual Private Network(VPN)
    supported by BGP/MPLS may be achieved using MPLS TrafficEngineered (TE) Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs). The paths of these LSPsmust be computed to provide the
    end-to-end connectivity desired, andthe paths selected may depend upon the VPN
    being served, and thelocation and reachability of target addresses within customer
    sites.The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a server that can compute thepaths
    of TE LSPs in an MPLS network. Where one or more VPNs issupported over a core
    network, different PCEs may serve computationsfor different VPNs.PCE discovery
    allows a Path Computation Client (PCC) to determinewhich PCEs are available to
    service its computation requests.Using an IGP to distribute PCE discovery information
    for VPN usewould result in the information being needlessly flooded to all corenodes
    regardless of whether they are aware of the VPN. These nodes donot need to be
    aware of per-VPN PCE function. This document describeshow BGP can be used to distribute
    PCE discovery informationspecifically for use in VPN path computation.</p>"
