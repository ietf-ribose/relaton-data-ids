abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The distribution of BGP routing information within an autonomoussystem
    requires all border routers to be fully meshed. Thisconstitutes a significant
    operational problem in terms ofconfiguration management.This has led to the wide-spread
    adoption of route reflection[RFC2796], primarily in order to reduce the number
    systems whichconfiguration must be modified in order to introduce or remove a
    newinternal BGP speaker. Route reflection, however, implies with itinformation
    reduction which is not always desired.This document defines a discovery mechanism
    that is designed toaddress the problem of introducing (or removing) a BGP speaker
    intoan iBGP mesh without implying any other behavior change when comparedto manual
    configuration.</p>"
