  content: "\t <t>This document introduces extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 that allowsnetworks
    dynamically binding IP flows to different interfaces of amobile node. Mobile Access
    Gateways can move flows to other mobileaccess gateways by establishing flow bindings
    at the local mobilityanchor. Local mobility anchor sends packets from the offloaded
    flowseamlessly to the new mobile access gateway.</p>"
