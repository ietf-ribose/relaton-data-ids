abstract:
- content: <p>BGP protocol lacks self diagnostic tools which would allow for monitoring
    and detection of any possible bgp state database differences between BGP_RIB_Out
    of the sender and BGP_RIB_In of the receiver over BGP peering session. It also
    lacks of build in mechanism to inform peer about subset of prefixes received over
    session which experienced some errors and which per protocol specification either
    resulted in attribute drop or "treat-as- withdraw" action. The intention of this
    document is to start a new class of work which will make BGP protocol and therefor
    assuring services constructed with the help of BGP protocol to become much more
    reliable and robust.</p>
