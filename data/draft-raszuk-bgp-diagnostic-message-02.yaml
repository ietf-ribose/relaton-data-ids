abstract:
  content: <p>BGP protocol lacks self diagnostic tools which would allow formonitoring
    and detection of any possible bgp state databasedifferences between BGP_RIB_Out
    of the sender and BGP_RIB_In of thereceiver over BGP peering session. It also
    lacks of build inmechanism to inform peer about subset of prefixes received oversession
    which experienced some errors and which per protocolspecification either resulted
    in attribute drop or "treat-as-withdraw" action.The intention of this document
    is to start a new class of work whichwill make BGP protocol and therefor assuring
    services constructedwith the help of BGP protocol to become much more reliable
    androbust.</p>
