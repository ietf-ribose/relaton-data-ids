abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CAPWAP defines a specification to encapsulate a station's data
    frames\n   between the Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and Access Controller\n
    \  (AC) using CAPWAP.  Specifically, the station's IEEE 802.11 data\n   frames
    can be either locally bridged or tunneled to the AC.  When\n   tunneled, a CAPWAP
    data channel is used for tunneling.  In many\n   deployments it is desirable to
    encapsulate date frames to an entity\n   different from the AC for example to
    an Access Router (AR).  Further,\n   it may also be desirable to use different
    tunnel encapsulations to\n   carry the stations' data frames.  This document provides
    a\n   specification for this and refers to it as Alternate tunnel\n   encapsulation.
    \ The Alternate tunnel encapsulation allows 1) the WTP\n   to tunnel non-management
    data frames to an endpoint different from\n   the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel
    using one of many known encapsulation\n   types such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, CAPWAP.
    \ The WTP may advertise support\n   for Alternate tunnel encapsulation during
    the discovery or join\n   process and AC may select one of the supported Alternate
    Tunnel\n   encapsulation types while configuring the WTP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
