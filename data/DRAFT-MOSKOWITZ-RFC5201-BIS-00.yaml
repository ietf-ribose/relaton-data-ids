abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol\n
    \  (HIP).  HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and\n   maintain
    shared IP-layer state, allowing separation of the identifier\n   and locator roles
    of IP addresses, thereby enabling continuity of\n   communications across IP address
    changes.  HIP is based on a Sigma-\n   compliant Diffie-Hellman key exchange,
    using public key identifiers\n   from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual
    peer authentication.\n   The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service
    (DoS)\n   and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  When used together with\n   another
    suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulated Security\n   Payload (ESP),
    it provides integrity protection and optional\n   encryption for upper-layer protocols,
    such as TCP and UDP.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 5201 and addresses the
    concerns raised by\n   the IESG, particularly that of crypto agility.  It also
    incorporates\n   lessons learned from the implementations of RFC 5201.\n\t </p>\n
