abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft attempts to define security classes for devices
    targeted\n   by SUIT protocols. A device security is characterized by five\n   Boolean
    security attributes: firmware loader (FLD), one time\n   programmable memory (OTP),
    secure firmware loader (FLD-SEC), tamper\n   resistant key (TRT-KEY) and diversified
    key (DIV-KEY). This\n   classification creates 18 device classes.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n
