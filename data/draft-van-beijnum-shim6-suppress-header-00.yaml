abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The shim6 protocol defines a header that contains a \"context tag\"
    thatidentifies packets as belonging to a certain shim6 context that existsbetween
    two hosts. It has been suggested that this shim6 header isinserted between the
    IPv6 header and the upper layer protocol such asTCP in all packets where the shim
    layer has rewritten the source and/ordestination address. This document considers
    the suppression of thisheader in situations where packets can be successfully
    demultiplexed bythe receiver without it.</p>"
