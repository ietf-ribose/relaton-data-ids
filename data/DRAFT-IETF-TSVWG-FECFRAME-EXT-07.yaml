abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 6363 describes a framework for using Forward Error Correction\n
    \  (FEC) codes to provide protection against packet loss.  The framework\n   supports
    applying FEC to arbitrary packet flows over unreliable\n   transport and is primarily
    intended for real-time, or streaming,\n   media.  However FECFRAME as per RFC
    6363 is restricted to block FEC\n   codes.  This document updates RFC 6363 to
    support FEC Codes based on\n   a sliding encoding window, in addition to Block
    FEC Codes, in a\n   backward-compatible way.  During multicast/broadcast real-time\n
    \  content delivery, the use of sliding window codes significantly\n   improves
    robustness in harsh environments, with less repair traffic\n   and lower FEC-related
    added latency.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
