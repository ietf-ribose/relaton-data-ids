abstract:
- content: "<p>Within the DNS, there is no mechanism for authoritative servers to
    advertise which transport methods they are capable of. If secure transport methods
    are adopted by authoritative operators, protocol negotiation would be required.
    This document provides two new Resource Record Types, NS2 and NS2T, to facilitate
    that negotiation by allowing zone owners to signal how the authoritative nameserver(s)
    for their zone(s) may accept queries.</p>"
