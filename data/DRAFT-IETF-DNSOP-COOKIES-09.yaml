abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS cookies are a lightweight DNS transaction security mechanism
    that\n   provides limited protection to DNS servers and clients against a\n   variety
    of increasingly common denial-of-service and amplification /\n   forgery or cache
    poisoning attacks by off-path attackers. DNS Cookies\n   are tolerant of NAT,
    NAT-PT, and anycast and can be incrementally\n   deployed. (Since DNS Cookies
    are only returned to the IP address from\n   which they were originally received,
    they cannot be used to generally\n   track Internet users.)\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
