abstract:
- content: <p>There can be M2M scenarios where responses from a server against requests
    from client are redundant. This kind of open-loop exchange (with no response path
    from the server to the client) may be desired to minimize resource consumption
    in constrained systems while updating a bulk of resources simultaneously, or updating
    a resource with a very high frequency. CoAP already provides Non-confirmable (NON)
    messages that are not acknowledged by the recipient. However, the request/response
    semantics still require the server to respond with a status code indicating "the
    result of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request". This specification
    introduces a CoAP option called 'No-Response'. Using this option the client can
    explicitly express to the server its disinterest in all responses against the
    particular request. This option also provides granular control to enable expression
    of disinterest to a particular class of response or a combination of response-classes.
    The server MAY decide to suppress the response by not transmitting it back to
    the client according to the value of No- Response option in the request. This
    option may be effective for both unicast and multicast requests. This document
    also discusses a few exemplary applications which benefit from this option.</p>
