abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 822 [RFC0822] defines many headers which can be applied
    to email\n   messages and RFC 2076 [RFC2076] provides a simple summary of the\n
    \  commonly occurring headers in headings of e-mail messages.  Both of\n   these
    RFCs define the 'In-Reply-To' and 'References' fields - which\n   have since had
    their definitions improved in RFC 2822 [RFC2822] and\n   RFC 1036 [RFC1036] respectively.
    \ These fields are used by 'thread\n   capable' email clients to display messages
    grouped together in\n   organised parent/child relationships that enable the reader
    to follow\n   a train of thought or a process of information dissemination.\n\n
    \  However, if a reply to such a threaded message does not contain\n   relevant
    follow-up information or is used as a platform to deliver a\n   new message with
    new subject, then that reply is put within the\n   already existing thread.  This
    is known as 'Thread-Jacking'.  This\n   draft proposes a couple of techniques
    which can be undertaken to\n   resolve this issue within the scope of email.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
