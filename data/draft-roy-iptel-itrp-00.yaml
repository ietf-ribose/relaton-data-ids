abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This contribution describes an IP Telephony Routing Protocol (ITRP)for
    intra-ITAD communications. ITRP is a SINGLE protocol that isused between gateways
    and servers as well as among servers. It usesdiscovery, registration, update,
    keep-alive, confirmation, anderror-notification messages. The connectionless (e.g.,
    UDP)transport is used and, if needed, multicasting can be used insteadof flooding.
    The connection-oriented (e.g., TCP) transport can alsobe utilized. ITRP's operation
    is independent of any signalingprotocol and, can serve as a mechanism to provide
    the reachabilityinformation about alias addresses including telephone numbers.
    Theproposed message formats in ITRP are similar to TRIP.</p>"
