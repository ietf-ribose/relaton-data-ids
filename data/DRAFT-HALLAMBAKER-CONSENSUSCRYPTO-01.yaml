abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies conformance criteria for choices of\n
    \  cryptographic algorithms. Conformance with this document establishes\n   that
    an implementation supports the community consensus for choice of\n   cryptographic
    algorithms at the time of publication and that the\n   implementation can interoperate
    with other implementations compliant\n   with the specified criteria.\n\n\t </p>\n
