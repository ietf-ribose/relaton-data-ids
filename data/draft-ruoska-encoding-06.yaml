abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes hierarchically structured binary encoding format
    called Ruoska Encoding (later RSK). The main design goals are minimal resource
    usage, well defined structure with good selection of widely known data types,
    and still extendable for future usage. The main benefit when compared to non binary
    hierarchically structured formats like XML is simplicity and minimal resource
    demands. Even basic XML parsing is time and memory consuming operation. When compared
    to other binary formats like BER encoding of ASN.1 the main benefit is simplicity.
    ASN.1 with many different encodings is complex and even simple implementation
    needs a lot of effort. RSK is also more efficient than BER.</p>"
