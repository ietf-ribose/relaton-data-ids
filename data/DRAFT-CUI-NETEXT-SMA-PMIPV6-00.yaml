abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Simultaneous Multi-Access (SMA), originally designed for MIPv6,\nexpects
    to be ported to PMIPv6 to achieve flow binding. However,\nthere are a lot of problems
    to adapt SMA to PMIPv6 due to\ndifferent mechanisms of two mobility management
    protocol. This\ndocument analyzes issues of SMA and different multihoming\nscenarios
    in PMIPv6. A PMIPv6 system which allows a MN to share\nHNP across its interfaces
    is proposed and a SMA solution is\ndesigned for the modified PMIPv6 system. The
    solution supports\nflow-based routing and address-based routing simultaneously.\n\t
