abstract:
- content: "<p>Babel is a routing protocol based on the distance-vector algorithm
    augmented with mechanisms for loop avoidance and starvation avoidance. In this
    document, we describe a number of niches where Babel has been found to be useful
    and that are arguably not adequately served by more mature protocols.</p>"
