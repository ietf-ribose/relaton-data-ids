abstract:
- content: "<p>Semantic Delta Encoding with HTTP defines an efficient stateless mechanism
    for multiple clients to become synchronised and stay synchronised with a large
    resource through the transmission of semantic deltas (distinct from RFC3229),
    and supports a long poll option for timely delivery. It is intended to support
    web browsers needing to keep up to date with changes of state on an origin server
    as well as to support a wide variety of other realtime and non- realtime synchronisation
    requirements between communicating systems.</p>"
