abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The PKIX working group is profiling the use of X.509 attribute\ncertificates.
    This document specifies a deliberately limited\nprotocol for requesting an attribute
    certificate from a server. It\nis intended to be complementary to the use of LDAP
    for AC retrieval,\ncovering, for example, those cases where use of an LDAP server
    is\nnot suitable due to the type of authorization model being employed.\nFor many
    other cases, the use of LDAP is preferred.\n\t </p>\n      "
