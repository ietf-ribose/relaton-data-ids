  content: "\n\t <p>   As an important means for operation and maintenance (O&amp;M),
    mirroring\n   is the most direct and comprehensive technology for capturing data\n
    \  streams and forwarding information.  Compared with other\n   visualization
    technologies, it can not only obtain the content of an\n   entire packet, but
    also add forwarding information of a network\n   device to a mirror packet and
    send the packet to a remote analysis\n   server.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
