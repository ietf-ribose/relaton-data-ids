abstract:
- content: "<p>A transport network is a lower-layer network designed to provide connectivity
    services for a higher-layer network to carry the traffic opaquely across the lower-layer
    network resources. A transport network may be constructed from equipment utilizing
    any of a number of different transport technologies such as the evolving optical
    transport infrastructure (Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) / Synchronous
    Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical Transport Network (OTN)) or packet transport
    as epitomized by the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). All transport networks
    have high benchmarks for reliability and operational simplicity. This suggests
    a common, technology- independent management/control paradigm that can be extended
    to represent and configure specific technology attributes. This document describes
    the high-level requirements facing transport networks in order to provide open
    interfaces for resource programmability and control/management automation. Furtheremore,
    gap analysis against existing models are also provided so that it can used as
    the guidance to separate efforts/drafts proposing new models or augmentation models
    based on existing models.</p>"
