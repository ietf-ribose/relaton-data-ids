abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Real-time text mixers for multi-party sessions need to identify
    the\n   source of each transmitted group of text so that the text can be\n   presented
    by endpoints in suitable grouping with other text from the\n   same source, while
    new text from other sources is also presented in\n   readable grouping as received
    interleaved in real-time.\n\n   Regional regulatory requirements specify provision
    of real-time text\n   in multi-party calls.  RFC 4103 mixer implementations can
    use\n   traditional RTP functions for source identification, but the mixer\n   source
    switching performance is limited when using the default\n   transmission characteristics
    with redundancy.\n\n   Enhancements for RFC 4103 real-time text mixing is provided
    in this\n   document, suitable for a centralized conference model that enables\n
    \  source identification and source switching.  The intended use is for\n   real-time
    text mixers and multi-party-aware participant endpoints.\n   The specified mechanism
    build on the standard use of the CSRC list in\n   the RTP packet for source identification.
    \ The method makes use of\n   the same \"text/t140\" and \"text/red\" formats
    as for two-party\n   sessions.\n\n   A capability exchange is specified so that
    it can be verified that a\n   participant can handle the multi-party coded real-time
    text stream.\n   The capability is indicated by use of a media attribute \"rtt-mixer\".\n\n
    \  The document updates RFC 4103[RFC4103]\n\n   A specifications of how a mixer
    can format text for the case when the\n   endpoint is not multi-party aware is
    also provided.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
