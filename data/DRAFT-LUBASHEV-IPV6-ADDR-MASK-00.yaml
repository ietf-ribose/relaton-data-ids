abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With significantly longer IPv6 address prefixes assigned to
    ISPs,\n   operators sometimes find opportunities to assign special meaning to\n
    \  lower-order bit patterns.  Often, these bit patterns cannot be\n   expressed
    as an address prefix.\n\n   This RFC introduces IPv6 Address/Mask notation that
    allows one to\n   express address groupings beyond \"all addresses that share
    a single\n   prefix\".  The notation is similar to the IPv4 Address/Mask notation\n
    \  in its expressiveness, but its syntax is derived from the traditional\n   Address/Prefix-length
    notation.  The traditional Address/Prefix-\n   length notation is a special case
    of the Address/Mask notation.\n\n   For example, using this notation, both 2001:db8::/32
    and 2001:db8::/\n   ffff:ffff:: have the same meaning.  However, the following
    requires\n   the new notation: 2001:db8::1234/ffff:ffff::ffff or, equivalently,\n
    \  2001:db8::1234/32+::ffff.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
