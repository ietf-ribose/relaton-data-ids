abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Watching videos (Contents) from mobile devices has been causing
    most ofthe network traffic and is projected to remain to increaseexponentially.
    Thus, numerous types of content and chunk based cachingschemes have been proposed
    to handle the increasing traffic. Thosecaching schemes cache the whole videos
    at the edge nodes, but mostof the users view only the beginning of the videos.
    Hence, cachingthe complete video on the edge node is an ineffective solution toreduce
    the network traffic as well as to improve the cacheutilization. Thus, a chunk-level
    caching scheme to store popularvideos partially and a smart prefetching scheme
    is needed toprovide the missing chunks of the video.This Internet-Draft will expire
    on August 09, 2021.</p>"
