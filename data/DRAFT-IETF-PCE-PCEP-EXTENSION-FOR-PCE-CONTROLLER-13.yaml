abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-\n
    \  Defined Networking (SDN) systems.\n\n   A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC)
    can simplify the processing of\n   a distributed control plane by blending it
    with elements of SDN and\n   without necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus,
    the LSP can be\n   calculated/set up/initiated and the label forwarding entries
    can also\n   be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network device\n
    \  along the path, while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as\n   much
    as possible.\n\n   This document specifies the procedures and PCEP extensions
    for using\n   the PCE as the central controller for provisioning labels along
    the\n   path of the static LSP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
