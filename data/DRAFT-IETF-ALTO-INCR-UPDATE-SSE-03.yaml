abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285]
    protocol\n   provides network related information to client applications so that\n
    \  clients may make informed decisions.  To that end, an ALTO Server\n   provides
    Network and Cost Maps.  Using those maps, an ALTO Client can\n   determine the
    costs between endpoints.\n\n   However, the ALTO protocol does not define a mechanism
    to allow an\n   ALTO client to obtain updates to those maps, other than by\n   periodically
    re-fetching them.  Because the maps may be large\n   (potentially tens of megabytes),
    and because only parts of the maps\n   may change frequently (especially Cost
    Maps), that can be extremely\n   inefficient.\n\n   Therefore this document presents
    a mechanism to allow an ALTO Server\n   to provide updates to ALTO Clients.  Updates
    can be both immediate,\n   in that the server can send updates as soon as they
    are available,\n   and incremental, in that if only a small section of a map changes,\n
    \  the server can send just the changes.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
