abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  The working group NSIS (Next Step In Signaling) is created to
    define a \n  new signaling protocol.  This signaling protocol will be generic
    and \n  applicable to the most of present and future signaling applications. \n
    \ Some of these signaling applications are resource reservation, \n  communication
    protocol for middlebox, VPN, etc.\n\n  The intention of NSIS is to re-use, where
    appropriate, the protocol \n  mechanisms of RSVP while at the same time simplifying
    it and applying \n  a more general signaling model.\n\n  NSIS signaling protocol
    is composed of two layers. NTLP (NSIS \n  Transport Layer Protocol) layer is responsible
    for transporting \n  signaling messages. NSLP (NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol)
    is the upper \n  layer that contains functionality such as message formats and
    \n  sequences, specific to a particular signaling application.\n\nNSIS signaling
    protocol is composed of two layers. NTLP (NSIS\nTransport Layer Protocol) layer
    is responsible for transporting\nsignaling messages. NSLP (NSIS Signaling Layer
    Protocol) is the upper\nlayer which contains functionality such as message formats
    and\nsequences, specific to a particular signaling application.\n\nThis document
    outlines the proposal of implementation for NTLP which\ncan satisfy the requirements
    defined in the NSIS working group.\n\t </p>\n      "
