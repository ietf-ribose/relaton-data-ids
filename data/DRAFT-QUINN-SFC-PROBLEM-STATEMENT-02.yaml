abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an overview of the issues associated
    with the\n   deployment of service functions (such as firewalls, load balancers)\n
    \  in large-scale environments.  The term service function chaining is\n   used
    to describe the definition and instantiation of an ordered set\n   of such service
    functions, and the subsequent \"steering\" of traffic\n   flows through those
    service functions.\n\n   The set of enabled service function chains reflect operator
    service\n   offerings and is designed in conjunction with application delivery\n
    \  and service and network policy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
