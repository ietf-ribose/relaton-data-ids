abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CUBIC is an extension to the traditional TCP standards.  It
    differs\n   from the traditional TCP standards only in the congestion control\n
    \  algorithm on the sender side.  In particular, it uses a cubic\n   function
    instead of a linear window increase function of the\n   traditional TCP standards
    to improve scalability and stability under\n   fast and long-distance networks.
    \ CUBIC has been adopted as the\n   default TCP congestion control algorithm by
    Linux, Windows, and Apple\n   stacks.\n\n   This document updates the specification
    of CUBIC to include\n   algorithmic improvements based on these implementations
    and recent\n   academic work.  Based on the extensive deployment experience with\n
    \  CUBIC, it also moves the specification to the Standards Track,\n   obsoleting
    [RFC8312].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
