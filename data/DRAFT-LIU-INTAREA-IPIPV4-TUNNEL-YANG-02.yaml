abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a YANG data model for the management
    of IP\n   based tunnels.  The data model includes configuration data and state\n
    \  data.  In default format, it describes managed attributes used for\n   managing
    tunnels of IPv4 or IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels.  And it can also\n   serve as a base
    model which can be augmented with technology-specific\n   details in other Ip
    based tunnel models.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
