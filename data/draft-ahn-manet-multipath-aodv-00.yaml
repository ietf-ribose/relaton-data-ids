abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how AODV [1] can be extended for the support
    of MANET multipath routing. In AODV, the route information is not avilable either
    at the source or at the destination. So, AODV is less appropriate in establishing
    multiple routes with more desirable properties, compared with DSR [2]. But, for
    the sake of reliability and load balancing, in this draft, we describe how we
    can extend AODV to establish multiple routes from the source to the destination.</p>"
