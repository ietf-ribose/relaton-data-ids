abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The PCE architecture is well-defined and may be used to compute
    the\n   optimal path for LSPS across domains in MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks.\n
    \  The Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) [RFC6805] was\n   developed
    to provide an optimal path when the sequence of domains is\n   not known in advance.
    \ The procedure and mechanism for populating the\n   Traffic Engineering Database
    (TED) with domain topology and link\n   information used in H-PCE-based path computations
    is open to\n   interpretation.  This informational document describes how topology\n
    \  dissemination mechanisms may be used to provide TE information\n   between
    Parent and Child PCEs (within the H-PCE context).  In\n   particular, it describes
    how BGP-LS might be used to provide inter-\n   domain connectivity.  This document
    is not intended to define new\n   extensions, it demonstrates how existing procedures
    and mechanisms\n   may be used.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
