abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines MSIX, a protocol that enables transmission of
    service definitions and service usage information from client to server. Services
    can be defined dynamically such that a metering server can become capable of handling
    new metered service types during the normal course of business without need for
    recompilation or reconfiguration. Service usage description semantics support
    transactional data submission. Support for both simple and compound transactions
    is provided.</p>"
