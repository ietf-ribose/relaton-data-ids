abstract:
- content: "<p>LISP upgrades the architecture of the IPvN internetworking system by
    separating location and identity, current intermingled in IPvN addresses. This
    is a change which has been identified by the IRTF as a critically necessary evolutionary
    architectural step for the Internet. In LISP, nodes have both a 'locator' (a name
    which says _where_ in the network's connectivity structure the node is) and an
    'identifier' (a name which serves only to provide a persistent handle for the
    node). A node may have more than one locator, or its locator may change over time
    (e.g. if the node is mobile), but it keeps the same identifier. This document
    gives additional architectural insight into LISP, and considers a number of aspects
    of LISP from a high-level standpoint. [NOTE: This is still a somewhat rough draft
    version; a few sections at the end are just rough frameworks, but almost all the
    key sections, and all the front part of the document, are here, and in something
    like reasonably complete form.]</p>"
