abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is a product of the work of the MIF Architecture
    Design\n   team.  It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues\n   experienced
    by nodes that can be attached to multiple networks\n   simultaneously.  The framework
    defines the concept of a Provisioning\n   Domain (PvD) which is a a consistent
    set of network configuration\n   information.  PvD aware nodes learn PvD specific
    information from the\n   networks they are attached to and / or other sources.
    \ PvDs are used\n   to enable separation and configuration consistency in presence
    of\n   multiple concurrent connections.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
