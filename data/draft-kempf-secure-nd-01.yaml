abstract:
- content: "<p>When an IPv6 node receives a Router Advertisement, how does it know
    that the node which sent the advertisement is authorized to announce that it routes
    the prefix? When an IPv6 node receives a Neighbor Advertisement message, how does
    it know that the node sending the message is, in fact, authorized to claim the
    binding? The answer is, in the absence of a preconfigured IPsec security association
    among the nodes on the link and the routers, they don't. In this draft, a lightweight
    protocol is described for securing the signaling involved in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.
    The protocol allows a node receiving a Router Advertisement or a Neighbor Advertisement
    to have the confidence that the message was authorized by the legitimate owner
    of the address or prefix being advertised without requiring a preconfigured IPsec
    security association. A certain degree of infrastructural support is required,
    but not any more than is currently common for public access IP networks. The protocol
    is based on some results in identity based cryptosystems that allow a publicly
    known identifier to function as a public key.</p>"
