abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a Service-Oriented Mechanism for Fault\n
    \  Detection and Localization (SOMFDL). This mechanism brings up the\n   concepts
    of \"Chord supplementary\" and \"QoS Trigger\". By monitoring\n   the real-time
    QoS level of the forward path, network can launch the\n   mechanism when the QoS
    level cannot satisfy the requirement of\n   service transmission, so that fault
    detection and localization can be\n   realized. By designing related protocols,
    the manipuility of this\n   mechanism can be guaranteed. Utilizing this mechanism,
    network can\n   accomplish fault detection and localization in a time scale of\n
    \  milliseconds with a few datagram sent.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
