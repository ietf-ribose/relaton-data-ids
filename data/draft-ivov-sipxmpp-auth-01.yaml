abstract:
  content: "<p>This document discusses several mechanisms for simplifyingauthentication
    of dual-stack SIP+XMPP clients against thecorresponding SIP and XMPP services.
    The text is not attempt todefine a complex credential sharing protocol but rather
    to determineand eventually encourage use of a simple mechanism that would allowservice
    providers to host a SIP+XMPP solution appearing as a singleservice to their users.
    In other words, the goal here is to agree ona set of recommendations that would
    encourage client developers toimplement simple UIs that would only require users
    to provide an IDand a password when configuring their SIP+XMPP account for the
    firsttime (as opposed to having to do so separately for SIP and XMPP).</p>"
