abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain network deployments, a single operator has multiple Autonomous
    Systems(AS) to facilitate ease of management. A multiple AS network design could
    also be a result of network mergers and acquisitions. In such scenarios, a centralized
    Inter-domain TE approach could provide most optimal allocation of resources and
    the most controlled path placement. BGP-LS-EPE [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe]describes
    an extension to BGP Link State (BGP-LS) for the advertisement of BGP Peering Segments
    along with their BGP peering node and inter-AS link information so that efficient
    BGP Egress Peer Engineering (EPE) policies and strategies can be computed based
    on Segment Routing. This document describes extensions to the BGP-LS EPE to enable
    it to be used for inter-AS Traffic-Engineering (TE) purposes.</p>"
