abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a protocol extension in TRILL IS-IS
    and a\n   parent selection tiebreak algorithm in the calculation of\n   distribution
    trees in TRILL. The proposal is to modify the current\n   algorithm to improve
    the stability of the distribution trees when\n   multiple equal cost parents are
    present. It also offers the\n   capabilities of pinning down multi-destination
    traffic and re-shaping\n   the distribution trees to improve the traffic load
    balancing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
