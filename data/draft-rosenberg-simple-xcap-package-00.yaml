abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event
    package for finding out about changes to documents managed by the Extensible Markup
    Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP). XCAP allows a client to manipulate
    XML documents on a server which contain configuration information for application
    protocols. Multiple clients can potentially access the same document, in which
    case the other clients would like to be notified of a change in the document made
    by another. This event package allows a client to do that.</p>"
