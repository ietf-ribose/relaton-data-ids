  content: "\t <t>This specification defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) eventpackage
    for finding out about changes to documents managed by theExtensible Markup Language
    (XML) Configuration Access Protocol(XCAP). XCAP allows a client to manipulate
    XML documents on a serverwhich contain configuration information for application
    protocols.Multiple clients can potentially access the same document, in whichcase
    the other clients would like to be notified of a change in thedocument made by
    another. This event package allows a client to dothat.</p>"
