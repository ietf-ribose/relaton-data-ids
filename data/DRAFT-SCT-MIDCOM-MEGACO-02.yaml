abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft discusses the applicability of the Megaco/H.248 device
    \ \ncontrol protocol [1] as the Middlebox communication protocol. It  \ndiscusses
    the architectural similarities between Megaco and Midcom  \nand how Megaco meets
    most of the key requirements for the Midcom  \nprotocol. Modeling the underlying
    Middlebox resources (such as,  \nfilters, policy rules etc) as separate elements
    from the Megaco  \nentities allows the usage of the protocol as-is, satisfying
    some of  \nthe resource access control requirements. Minimal extensions in the
    \ \nform of new Termination/Package definition (without impacting the  \nbase
    protocol) are sought for Midcom. The Midcom protocol profile  \nand other extensions/packages
    will be specified in a separate  \ninternet draft.\n\t </p>\n      "
