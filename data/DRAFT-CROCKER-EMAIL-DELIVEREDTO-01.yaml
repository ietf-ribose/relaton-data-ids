abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The address to which email is delivered might be different
    than any\n   of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were\n
    \  created by the author.  The address used by the mail transport\n   service
    is provided separately, through an envelope SMTP \"RCPT TO\"\n   command.  Before
    final delivery, handling can entail a sequence of\n   addresses that lead to the
    recipient.  It can be helpful for a\n   message to have a common way to record
    each delivery in such a\n   sequence, and to include each address used for that
    recipient.  This\n   specification defines a header field for this information.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
