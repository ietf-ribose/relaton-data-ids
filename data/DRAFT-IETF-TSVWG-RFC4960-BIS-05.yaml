abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document obsoletes RFC 4960, if approved.  It describes
    the\n   Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  SCTP is designed to\n   transport
    Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) signaling messages\n   over IP networks,
    but is capable of broader applications.\n\n   SCTP is a reliable transport protocol
    operating on top of a\n   connectionless packet network such as IP.  It offers
    the following\n   services to its users:\n\n   o  acknowledged error-free non-duplicated
    transfer of user data,\n\n   o  data fragmentation to conform to discovered path
    MTU size,\n\n   o  sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams,
    with\n      an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user\n      messages,\n\n
    \  o  optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP\n      packet,
    and\n\n   o  network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing\n
    \     at either or both ends of an association.\n\n   The design of SCTP includes
    appropriate congestion avoidance behavior\n   and resistance to flooding and masquerade
    attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
