abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes procedures that enhance OSPF TrafficEngineering
    (TE) extensions for advertising a router's localaddresses. This is needed to enable
    other routers in a network tocompute traffic engineered MPLS LSPs to a given router's
    localaddresses. Currently, the only addresses belonging to a router thatare advertised
    in TE LSAs are the router's local addresses on linksenabled for TE, and the Router
    ID.</p>"
