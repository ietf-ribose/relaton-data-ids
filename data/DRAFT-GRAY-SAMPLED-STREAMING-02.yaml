abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document standardizes both 1) a means of requesting a
    stream of\n   packet samples from any device generating, routing, or forwarding\n
    \  traffic, and 2) receiving metadata information from the network\n   element
    about these packet samples, and the structure of said stream\n   metadata.  A
    main design requirement is to provide network elements\n   with widely varying
    capabilities (e.g., ASICs, NPUs, NICs, vSwitches,\n   CPUs) a mechanism to sample
    and export packets at high rates, by\n   allowing communication of the specific
    bit formats of internal data\n   headers applied to the packet flow, in a way
    that enhances\n   interoperability between traffic sources and sinks.  Historically,\n
    \  Netflow and similar mechanisms have been used for these use cases;\n   however,
    the increasing packet rates of very high-speed devices and\n   increasing variance
    in the information available to data planes lends\n   itself to both a less-prescriptive
    set of packet formats as well as a\n   decoupling of the sampling action from
    the collection and analysis\n   mechanisms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
