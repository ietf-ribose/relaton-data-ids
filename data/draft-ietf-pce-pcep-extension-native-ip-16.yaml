abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) extension for Central Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR) based application
    in Native IP network. The scenario and framework of CCDR in native IP is described
    in [RFC8735] and [RFC8821]. This draft describes the key information that is transferred
    between Path Computation Element (PCE) and Path Computation Clients (PCC) to accomplish
    the End to End (E2E) traffic assurance in Native IP network under central control
    mode.</p>"
