abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Most P2P system performance suffers from the mismatch between
    the \nrandomly constructed overlays topology and the underlying physical \nnetwork
    topology, causing a large burden in the ISP and a long RTT \ntime. This document
    describes how DHT overlay peers can interact with \nthe routers by traceroute
    to get the path information, and execute 2-\nMeans Classification, thereafter
    peers leverage the DHT itself to \n\n \n \n build efficient \"closer\" cluster.
    This scheme only requires the \ninfrastructure to enable traceroute queries.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
