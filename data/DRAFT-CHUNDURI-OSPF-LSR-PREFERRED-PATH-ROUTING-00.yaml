abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a Preferred Path Routing (PPR) mechanism
    to\n   simplify the path description of data plane traffic in Segment\n   Routing
    (SR) deployments with OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocols.  PPR aims\n   to mitigate the
    MTU and data plane processing issues that may result\n   from SR packet overheads;
    and also supports traffic measurement,\n   accounting statistics and further attribute
    extensions along the\n   paths.  Preferred Path Routing is achieved through the
    addition of\n   descriptions to OSPF advertised prefixes, and mapping those to
    a PPR\n   data-plane identifier.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
