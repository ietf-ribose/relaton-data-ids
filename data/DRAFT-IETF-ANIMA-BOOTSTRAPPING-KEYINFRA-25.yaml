abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic\n
    \  Control Plane.  To do this a Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI)\n   is
    created using manufacturer installed X.509 certificates, in\n   combination with
    a manufacturer's authorizing service, both online\n   and offline.  Bootstrapping
    a new device can occur using a routable\n   address and a cloud service, or using
    only link-local connectivity,\n   or on limited/disconnected networks.  Support
    for lower security\n   models, including devices with minimal identity, is described
    for\n   legacy reasons but not encouraged.  Bootstrapping to is complete when\n
    \  the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is\n   successfully
    deployed to the device.  The established secure\n   connection can be used to
    deploy a locally issued certificate to the\n   device as well.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
