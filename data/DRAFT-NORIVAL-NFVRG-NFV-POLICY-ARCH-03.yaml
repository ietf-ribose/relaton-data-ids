abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A policy architecture and framework is discussed to support
    NFV\n   environments, where policies are used to enforce business rules and\n
    \  to specify resource constraints in a number of subsystems. This\n   document
    approaches the policy framework and architecture from the\n   perspective of overall
    orchestration requirements for services\n   involving multiple subsystems. The
    framework extends beyond common\n   orchestration constraints across compute,
    network, and storage\n   subsystems to include energy conservation. This document
    also\n   analyses policy scope, global versus local policies, policy actions\n
    \  and translations, policy conflict detection and resolution,\n   interactions
    among policies engines, and a hierarchical policy\n   architecture/framework to
    address the demanding and growing\n   requirements of NFV environments, that could
    also be applicable to\n   cloud infrastructures in general.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
