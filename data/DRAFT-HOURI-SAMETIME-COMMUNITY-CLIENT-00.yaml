abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the protocol used by a client in a Sametime\n(TM)
    community. The protocol enables users connecting to a Sametime\ncommunity to be
    aware each other and to send Instant Messages (IMs)\nto other users in the community.\nWhile
    this protocol does not meet many of the requirements of the IMPP\nworking group,
    it is provided as background information on existing\nInstant Messaging and Presence
    implementations. This protocol is\nprovided 'as is' without warranty of any kind.
    In particular,\ncommercial use  of this protocol requires licensing.\nThe protocol
    described in this document should enable implementing a\nclient program that can
    interoperate with Sametime communities, given\nthe user has registered with the
    community.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
