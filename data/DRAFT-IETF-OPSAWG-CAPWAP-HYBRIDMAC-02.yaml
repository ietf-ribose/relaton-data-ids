abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CAPWAP defines two entities Wireless Transmission Point (WTP)
    and\n   Access Controller (AC).  CAPWAP also defines two MAC (Medium Access\n
    \  Control) modes for IEEE 802.11 WTPs: Split and Local MAC . For each\n   MAC
    mode, CAPWAP describes how the MAC functionality is split between\n   the WTP
    and AC.  However, certain functions have not been clearly\n   defined.  For example
    for the Split MAC mode, the IEEE 802.11\n   encryption is specified as located
    in either the AC or the WTP with\n   no clear way for the AC to inform the WTP
    where it should be.  This\n   lack of specification leads to interoperability
    especially when AC\n   and WTP come from different vendors.  To solve the problem,
    this\n   specification defines a IEEE 802.11 MAC profile where each profile\n
    \  specifies an unambigous division of functionality between the WTP and\n   AC.
    \ The IEEE 802.11 MAC profile is used as follows: The WTP informs\n   the AC of
    the supported profiles during the discovery or join process\n   and the AC configures
    the WTP with one of the supported profiles\n   while configuring a WLAN.\n\n\t
