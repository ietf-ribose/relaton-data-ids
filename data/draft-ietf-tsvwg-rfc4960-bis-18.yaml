abstract:
- content: "<p>This document obsoletes RFC 4960, if approved. It describes the Stream
    Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and incorporates the specification of the
    chunk flags registry from RFC 6096 and the specification of the I bit of DATA
    chunks from RFC 7053. Therefore, RFC 6096 and RFC 7053 are also obsoleted by this
    document, if approved. In addition to that, the Errata documents RFC 4460 and
    RFC 8540 are also obsoleted by this document, if approved. SCTP was originally
    designed to transport Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) signaling messages
    over IP networks. It is also suited to be used for other applications, for example
    WebRTC. SCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a connectionless
    packet network such as IP. It offers the following services to its users: * acknowledged
    error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data, * data fragmentation to conform
    to discovered path maximum transmission unit (PMTU) size, * sequenced delivery
    of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival
    delivery of individual user messages, * optional bundling of multiple user messages
    into a single SCTP packet, and * network-level fault tolerance through supporting
    of multi-homing at either or both ends of an association. The design of SCTP includes
    appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding and masquerade
    attacks.</p>"
