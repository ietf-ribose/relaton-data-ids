abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 4279 and RFC 4785 describe pre-shared key cipher suites for Transport
    Layer Security (TLS). However, all those cipher suites use SHA-1 as their MAC
    algorithm. This document describes a set of cipher suites for TLS/DTLS which uses
    stronger digest algorithms (i.e., SHA-256 or SHA-384) and another which uses the
    Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois Counter Mode (GCM).</p>"
