abstract:
- content: "<p>This document requests the allocation of an IPv4 /10 address block
    to be used as Shared Address Space to accommodate the needs of Carrier- Grade
    NAT (CGN) devices. It is anticipated that Service Providers will use this Shared
    Address Space to number the interfaces that connect CGN devices to Customer Premises
    Equipment (CPE). Shared Address Space is distinct from RFC 1918 private address
    space because it is intended for use on Service Provider networks. However, it
    may be used in a manner similar to RFC 1918 private address space on routing equipment
    that is able to do address translation across router interfaces when the addresses
    are identical on two different interfaces. Details are provided in the text of
    this document. This document details the allocation of an additional special-use
    IPv4 address block and updates RFC 5735. This memo documents an Internet Best
    Current Practice.</p>"
