abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SIMPLE (SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions)\n
    \  is a protocol suite for instant messaging (IM) service, but it is\n   inefficient
    in processing instant message in session mode due to its\n   complex signaling
    processes and heavy header overheads, which makes\n   it difficult to meet the
    QoE (quality of experience) requirement,\n   especially in the usage scenario
    of mobile Internet and other traffic\n   sensitive networks.\n\n   This document
    describes an alternative Session Initiation Protocol\n   (SIP) extension for instant
    messaging service. The extension uses the\n   publish-subscribe mode to simplify
    signaling procedures and\n   introduces message user agent (MUA) to publish and
    receive message,\n   and message broker (MB) as an intermediary to exchange messages\n
    \  between MUAs. Message is tagged with a topic, and the lightweight\n   message
    format is more suitable for traffic sensitive networks.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
