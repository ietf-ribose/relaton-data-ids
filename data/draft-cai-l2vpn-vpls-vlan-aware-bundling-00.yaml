abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies VPLS extensions to support the new VLAN aware
    bundling service interface type. The new service interface type provides advantages
    in reducing the provisioning overhead, as well as pseudowire scalability in environments
    where a large number of VLANs need to be extended over an MPLS/IP network while
    maintaining traffic segregation among those VLANs. The VLAN aware bundling service
    interface can handle the high scale requirements of today's Data Centers by bundling
    different VLANs over a single WAN VPLS instance used to interconnect sites. Furthermore,
    this document specifies an extension to the LDP MAC Withdrawal mechanisms to allow
    per-VLAN MAC flushing for the new service interface type.</p>"
