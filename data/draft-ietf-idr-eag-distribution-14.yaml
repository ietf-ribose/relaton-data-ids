abstract:
- content: <p>Administrative groups are link attributes (commonly referred to as "colors"
    or "link colors") advertised by link state protocols (e.g. ISIS or OSPF) and used
    for traffic engineering. These administrative groups were initially defined as
    32 bit masks. As network usage grew, these 32 bit masks were found to constrain
    traffic engineering. Therefore, link state protocols (ISIS, OSPF) were expanded
    to advertise a variable length administrative group.This document defines an extension
    to BGP-LS for advertisement of extended administrative groups (EAGs) to allow
    to support a number of administrative groups greater than 32, as defined in [RFC7308].</p>
