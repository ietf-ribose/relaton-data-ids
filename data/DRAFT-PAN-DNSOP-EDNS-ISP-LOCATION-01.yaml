abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)\n
    \  option that is in active use to carry &lt; COUNTRY, AREA, ISP &gt; isp\n   location
    information about the network that originated a DNS query\n   and the network
    for which the subsequent response can be cached.\n\n   It is inspired by EDNS
    Client Subnet (ECS) with some privacy\n   considerations, goals to reduce the
    \"guess location of client's IP\"\n   work on Authoritative Nameservers.\n\n\t
