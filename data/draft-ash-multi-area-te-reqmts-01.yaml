abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft describes requirements for multi-area TE within the context
    of GMPLS. Based on the requirements, the goal is to eventually provideprotocol
    extensions needed for multi-area TE. Various approaches tomulti-area TE are considered,
    and these approaches are evaluated against the requirements. These approaches
    include state dependent routing (SDR) LSP selection, event dependent routing (EDR)
    LSP selection, and time dependent routing (TDR) LSP selection. These approaches
    include needs to support path-computation server (PCS) functionality, query functionality,
    crankback functionality, TE feedback functionality, and summary-LSA functionality.The
    target in future releases of this document will be to converge on areduced subset
    of the required multi-area TE methods and protocolextensions.</p>"
