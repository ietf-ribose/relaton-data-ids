abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Virtual Desktop Infrastructure is a technology to separate
    local\ndesktop and remote computing and storage resources, which was\ninitially
    derived from the remote desktop administration but with new\nbusiness models and
    very different use cases.  Most of existing VDI\nsystems are based on proprietary
    implementation, and positioning\ndifferent market with different features.  Since
    virtual desktop\ntechnology is believed that it will become a mainstream application\ndelivery
    method similar to the http protocol with regard to web\napplications, so it's
    important to make the virtual desktop access\nprotocol open and standard.  This
    draft summarizes the limitations of\nexisting virtual desktop systems, and proposes
    the intent\nstandardization work in IETF.\n\t </p>\n      "
