abstract:
  content: "\t <t>[VPN] describes a method by which a Service Provider (SP) may providea
    VPN service to its customers. In that method, BGP is used to carrycustomer routes
    across the SP's backbone. That method allows avariety of different protocols to
    be used as the routing protocolbetween the Customer Edge (CE) router and the Provider
    Edge (PE)router. [VPN-OSPF] specifies additional procedures to be used whenthe
    CE/PE router protocol is OSPF. In these additional procedures,customer OSPF routes
    from a CE router are translated into BGP routesby a PE router. Then they are sent
    via BGP to another PE router,which translates them back into OSPF routes and distributes
    them toanother CE router. This translation may lose some of the informationneeded
    to prevent loops. This document proposes that one of theOSPF options bits be used
    to ensure that when a VPN route is sentfrom a PE to a CE, the route will be ignored
    by any PE which receivesit back from a CE.</p>"
