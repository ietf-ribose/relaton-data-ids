abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a new DNS TIMEOUT resource record
    (RR)\n   that associates a lifetime with one or more zone resource records.\n
    \  It is intended to be used to transfer resource record lifetime state\n   between
    a zone's primary and secondary servers and to store lifetime\n   state during
    server software restarts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
