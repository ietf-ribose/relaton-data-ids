abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The invention of a large-scale quantum computer would pose
    a serious\n   challenge for the cryptographic algorithms that are widely deployed\n
    \  today.  The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) supports key transport\n   and
    key agreement algorithms that could be broken by the invention of\n   such a quantum
    computer.  By storing communications that are\n   protected with the CMS today,
    someone could decrypt them in the\n   future when a large-scale quantum computer
    becomes available.  Once\n   quantum-secure key management algorithms are available,
    the CMS will\n   be extended to support them, if existing syntax the does not\n
    \  accommodated them.  In the near-term, this document describes a\n   mechanism
    to protect today's communication from the future invention\n   of a large-scale
    quantum computer by mixing the output of key\n   transport and key agreement algorithms
    with a pre-shared key.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
