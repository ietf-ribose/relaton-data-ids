abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a classical network the link layer is responsible for transferring\n
    \  a datagram between two nodes that are connected by a single link,\n   possibly
    including switches.  In a quantum network however, the link\n   layer will need
    to provide a robust entanglement generation service\n   between two quantum nodes
    which are connected by a quantum link.\n   This service can be used by higher
    layers to produce entanglement\n   between distant nodes or to perform other operations
    such as qubit\n   transmission, without full knowledge of the underlying hardware
    and\n   its parameters.  This draft defines what can be expected from the\n   service
    provided by a link layer for a Quantum Network and defines an\n   interface between
    higher layers and the link layer.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
