abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The CAPWAP Working Group (WG) is currently looking into defining
    a\n    protocol that would enable interoperability in an IEEE 802.11 based\n    wireless
    local area network (WLAN) comprised of Wireless Termination\n    Points (WTP)
    and Access Controllers (AC) belonging to different\n    vendors.\n\n    This document
    presents a self-review of Simple Light Access Point\n    Protocol (SLAPP), one
    of the candidate protocol proposals submitted\n    to the CAPWAP WG for consideration
    as a CAPWAP protocol.  The WG has\n    requested that the authors of all candidate
    proposals to provide a\n    document which evaluates how their submission meets
    the objectives,\n    taxonomy, and problem statement.\n\t </p>\n      "
