abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain
    to be\n   able to associate tags with prefixes.  Previously, OSPFv2 and OSPFv3\n
    \  were relegated to a single tag for AS External and Not-So-Stubby-Area\n   (NSSA)
    prefixes.  With the flexible encodings provided by OSPFv2\n   Prefix/Link Attribute
    Advertisement and OSPFv3 Extended LSAs,\n   multiple administrative tags may advertised
    for all types of\n   prefixes.  These administrative tags can be used for many\n
    \  applications including route redistribution policy, selective prefix\n   prioritization,
    selective IP Fast-ReRoute (IPFRR) prefix protection,\n   and many others.\n\n
    \  The ISIS protocol supports a similar mechanism that is described in\n   RFC
    5130.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
