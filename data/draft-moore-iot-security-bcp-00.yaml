abstract:
- content: "<p>In recent years, embedded computing devices have increasingly been
    provided with Internet interfaces, and the typically-weak network security of
    such devices has become a challenge for the Internet infrastructure. This document
    lists a number of minimum requirements that vendors of Internet of Things (IoT)
    devices need to take into account during development and when producing firmware
    updates, in order to reduce the frequency and severity of security incidents in
    which such devices are implicated.</p>"
