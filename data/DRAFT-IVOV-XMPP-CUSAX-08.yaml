abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document suggests some strategies for the combined use
    of the\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and\n
    \  Presence Protocol (XMPP).  Such strategies aim to provide a single\n   fully
    featured real-time communication service by using complementary\n   subsets of
    features from each of the protocols.  Typically such\n   subsets would include
    telephony capabilities from SIP and instant\n   messaging and presence capabilities
    from XMPP.  This document does\n   not define any new protocols or syntax for
    either SIP or XMPP, and by\n   intent it does not attempt to standardize \"best
    current practices\".\n   However, implementing the suggested strategies outlined
    in this\n   document may require modifying or at least reconfiguring existing\n
    \  client and server-side software.  Also, it is not the purpose of this\n   document
    to make recommendations as to whether or not such combined\n   use should be preferred
    to the mechanisms provided natively by each\n   protocol (for example, SIP's SIMPLE
    or XMPP's Jingle.  It merely aims\n   to provide guidance to those who are interested
    in such a combined\n   use.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
