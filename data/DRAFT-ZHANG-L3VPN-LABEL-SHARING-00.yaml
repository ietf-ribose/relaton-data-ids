abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to be used by Service Providers
    to\n   provide fast protection of VPN connections for a CE. Egress PEs in a\n
    \  redundant group always assign the same label for VPN routes from a\n   VRF.
    These egress PEs create a BGP virtual Next Hop (vNH) in the\n   domain of the
    IP/MPLS backbone network as an agent of the CE router.\n   Primary and backup
    tunnels terminated at the vNH are set up by the\n   BGP/MPLS IP VPN based on IGP
    FRR. If the primary egress PE fails, the\n   backup egress PEs can recognize the
    \"shared\" VPN route label and\n   deliver the failure affected packets accordingly.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
