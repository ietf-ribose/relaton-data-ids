abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft will eventually recommend a minimal set of IETF
    Transport\n   Services offered by end systems supporting TAPS, and give guidance
    on\n   choosing among the available mechanisms and protocols.  As a starting\n
    \  point for discussion, it currently only gives an overview of some\n   ways
    to categorize the set of transport services in the first TAPS\n   document (version
    4: draft-ietf-taps-transports-04), assuming that\n   the eventual minimal set
    of transport services will be based on a\n   similar form of categorization.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
