abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 prefix sharing in policy for convergence applications
    makes it\n   impossible to track individual quality of service requirements for\n
    \  each host by the policy server.  In order to enable it, we define a\n   protocol
    which is based on the residential gateway sending some\n   parameters such as
    IPv6 addresses of each host (3GPP UE or fixed\n   host) to the edge router.  The
    edge router in its turn establishes\n   IP-CAN sub-session for each host to receive
    the quality of service\n   parameters.  The edge router enforces this quality
    of service which\n   is specific to the host on its traffic both uplink and downlink.\n
    \  When the host disconnects or leaves the network, IP-CAN sub-session\n   is
    terminated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
