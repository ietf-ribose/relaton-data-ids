abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding\n
    \  standard ISO/IEC International Standard 23094-1, also known as\n   Essential
    Video Coding (EVC) and developed by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11.\n   The RTP payload
    format allows for packetization of one or more\n   Network Abstraction Layer (NAL)
    units in each RTP packet payload as\n   well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into
    multiple RTP packets.  The\n   payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing,
    Internet\n   video streaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among\n
    \  others.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
