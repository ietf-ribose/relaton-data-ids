abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Routing in mobile ad-hoc network is achieved through the mutual
    \ncooperation of mobile devices that form routes in between two mobile\nnodes.It
    is one of the challenging issues in mobile ad-hoc network [1].\nThe current protocols
    for an ad-hoc network can generally be categorized \ninto two groups i.e. pro-active
    and re-active[15,16,17,18]. \nPro-active protocols by continuously evaluating
    the known and attempting \nto discover new routes. \nThese protocols try to maintain
    the most up-to-date view of the \nnetwork[2]. This allows them to efficiently
    forward packets as the route \nis known in advanced [14]. In contrast reactive
    protocols determine the \nroute only when require [3, 5, 6].\nMobile Ad-hoc On
    Demand Data Delivery protocol (MAODDP) establishes \nroute on demand and delivers
    the data at the same time one after the \nother [22].MAODDP support both unicast
    and multicast routing. \nIt is designed to minimize reaction to topological changes.
    \nIn order to ensure the freshness of route MAODDP uses combination \nof sequence
    numbers and broadcast ID. MAODDP is loop-free,\nself-starting protocol whic can
    scales to different size of networks. \nMAODDP offers quick adaptation to the
    dynamic link \nconditions and determines routes to the destinations on demand.\n\n\t
