abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the framework of a mechanism for use
    in\n   conjunction with link state routing protocols which prevents the\n   transient
    loops which would otherwise occur during topology changes.\n   It does this by
    correctly sequencing the forwarding information base\n   (FIB) updates on the
    routers.\n\n   This mechanism can be used in the case of non-urgent (management\n
    \  action) link or node shutdowns and restarts or link metric changes.\n   It
    can also be used in conjunction with a fast re-route mechanism\n   which converts
    a sudden link or node failure into a non-urgent\n   topology change.  This is
    possible where a complete repair path is\n   provided for all affected destinations.\n\n
    \  After a non-urgent topology change, each router computes a rank that\n   defines
    the time at which it can safely update its FIB.  A method for\n   accelerating
    this loop-free convergence process by the use of\n   completion messages is also
    described.\n\n   The technology described in this document has been subject to\n
    \  extensive simulation using real network topologies and costs, and\n   pathological
    convergence behaviour.  However the mechanism described\n   in this document are
    purely illustrative of the general approach and\n   do not constitute a protocol
    specification.  The document represents\n   a snapshot of the work of the Routing
    Area Working Group at the time\n   of publication and is published as a document
    of record.  Further\n   work is needed before implementation or deployment.\n\n\t
