abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes serious issues regarding the use of reactive
    routing protocols in Low power and lossy network. Routing requirements for various
    LLN deployments are studied in order to judge how reactive routing may or may
    not fit to those criteria. This document is intended to point out shortcomings
    of reactive protocols to operate in LLN.</p>"
