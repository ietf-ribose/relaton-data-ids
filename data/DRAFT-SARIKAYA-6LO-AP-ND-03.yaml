abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an extension to 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery.\n
    \  This extension is designed for low-power and lossy network\n   environments
    and it supports multi-hop operation.  Nodes supporting\n   this extension compute
    a Cryptographically Unique Interface ID and\n   associate it with one or more
    of their Registered Addresses.  The\n   Cryptographic ID (Crypto-ID) uniquely
    identifies the owner of the\n   Registered Address.  It is used in place of the
    EUI-64 address that\n   is specified in RFC 6775.  Once an address is registered
    with a\n   Cryptographic ID, only the owner of that ID can modify the state\n
    \  information of the Registered Address in the 6LR and 6LBR.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
