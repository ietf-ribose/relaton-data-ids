abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which\n
    \  depends on some addressing and routing.  This Autonomic Control Plane\n   should
    ideally be self-managing, and as independent as possible of\n   configuration.
    \ This document defines such a plane and calls it the\n   \"Autonomic Control
    Plane\", with the primary use as a control plane\n   for autonomic functions.
    \ It also serves as a \"virtual out-of-band\n   channel\" for Operations, Administration
    and Management (OAM)\n   communications over a network that provides automatically
    configured\n   hop-by-hop authenticated and encrypted communications via\n   automatically
    configured IPv6 even when the network is not\n   configured, or misconfigured.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
