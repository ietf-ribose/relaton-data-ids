abstract:
- content: "<p>In Information-centric network (ICN), everything is an identifiable
    object with a name such as named data chunks, services and mobile devices. Different
    from host-centric connectivity, ICN connects these named entities using name-based
    routing and forwarding. At the same time, network entities, end devices, and applications
    have variant demands to verify the integrity, authenticity, and validation of
    these entities through names. This document proposes a generic naming schema,
    called PID (Principal, Identifier, and Domain), which supports security provenance,
    content lookup, routing and inter- domain resolution for ICN. With P:I:D (or simply
    PID) schema, a name consists of three components: Principal, Identifier, and Domain.
    In this specification, we only illustrate the principles and concepts of PID schema
    and the functional role of each component, and leave the encoding approaches as
    implementation options.</p>"
