abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC).  TFRC
    is a\n    congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best-\n
    \   effort Internet environment.  It is reasonably fair when competing\n    for
    bandwidth with TCP flows, but has a much lower variation of\n    throughput over
    time compared with TCP, making it more suitable for\n    applications such as
    telephony or streaming media where a relatively\n    smooth sending rate is of
    importance.\n\t </p>\n      "
