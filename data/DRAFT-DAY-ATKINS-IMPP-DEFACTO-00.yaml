abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This is a 'de facto IMPP charter' to accompany the IMPP submissions
    to\nthe IESG. Such an arrangement is not ordinarily part of the IETF\nprocess,
    but appears to be the most effective means of providing\nnecessary context to
    the IESG as it considers the IMPP documents. The\nfirst part of this document
    describes the circumstances that have led\nto this unusual de facto charter.  The
    second part describes the IMPP\ncharter as it has been understood by the current
    chairs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
