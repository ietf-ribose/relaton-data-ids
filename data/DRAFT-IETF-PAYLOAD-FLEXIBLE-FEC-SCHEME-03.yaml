abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward
    Error\n   Correction (FEC) packets that are generated by the non-interleaved\n
    \  and interleaved parity codes from a source media encapsulated in RTP.\n   These
    parity codes are systematic codes, where a number of repair\n   symbols are generated
    from a set of source symbols.  These repair\n   symbols are sent in a repair flow
    separate from the source flow that\n   carries the source symbols.  The non-interleaved
    and interleaved\n   parity codes which are defined in this specification offer
    a good\n   protection against random and bursty packet losses, respectively, at\n
    \  a cost of decent complexity.  Moreover, alternate FEC codes may be\n   used
    with the payload formats presented.  The RTP payload formats\n   that are defined
    in this document address the scalability issues\n   experienced with the earlier
    specifications including RFC 2733, RFC\n   5109 and SMPTE 2022-1, and offer several
    improvements.  Due to these\n   changes, the new payload formats are not backward
    compatible with the\n   earlier specifications, but endpoints that do not implement
    the\n   scheme can still work by simply ignoring the FEC packets.\n\n\t </p>\n
