abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a facility to enable a relying party
    (RP) to\n   manage trust anchors (TAs) in the context of the Resource Public Key\n
    \  Infrastructure (RPKI). It is common in RP software (not just in the\n   RPKI)
    to allow an RP to import TA material in the form of self-signed\n   certificates.
    However, this approach to incorporating TAs is\n   potentially dangerous. (These
    self-signed certificates rarely\n   incorporate any extensions that impose constraints
    on the scope of\n   the imported public keys, and the RP is not able to impose
    such\n   constraints.) The facility described in this document allows an RP to\n
    \  impose constraints on such TAs. Because this mechanism is designed to\n   operate
    in the RPKI context, the most important constraints are the\n   Internet Number
    Resources (INRs) expressed via RFC 3779 extensions.\n   These extentions bind
    address spaces and/or autonomous system (AS)\n   numbers to entities. The primary
    motivation for the facility described\n   in this document is to enable an RP
    to ensure that INR information\n   that it has acquired via some trusted channel
    is not overridden by the\n   information acquired from the RPKI repository system
    or by the putative\n   TAs that the RP imports. Specifically, the mechanism allows
    an RP to\n   specify a set of overriding bindings between public key identifiers
    and\n   INR data. These bindings take precedence over any conflicting bindings\n
    \  acquired by the putative TAs and the certificates downloaded from the\n   RPKI
    repository system. This mechanism is designed for local use by an RP,\n   but
    any entity that is accorded administrative control over a set of RPs\n   may use
    this mechanism to convey its view of the RPKI to RPs within its\n   jurisdiction.
    The means by which this latter use case is effected is\n   outside the scope of
    this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
