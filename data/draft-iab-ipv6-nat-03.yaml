abstract:
- content: "<p>There has been much recent discussion on the topic of whether the IETF
    should develop standards for IPv6 Network Address Translators (NATs). This document
    articulates the architectural issues raised by IPv6 NATs, the pros and cons of
    having IPv6 NATs, and provides the IAB's thoughts on the current open issues and
    the solution space. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
