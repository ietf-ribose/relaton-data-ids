abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification,
    a Mobile Node\n       (MN) is assigned a 64-bit Home Network Prefix (HNP) during
    the\n       initial attachment for the Home Address (HoA) configuration. During\n
    \      the movement of the MN, this prefix is unchanged and unnecessary for\n
    \      the MN to reconfigure the HoA. However, the current protocol does\n       not
    specify related operations to support the MN to timely receive\n       and configure
    a new HNP when the allocated HNP changes. In this\n       draft, this problem
    is discussed and a possible solution is proposed\n       based on RFC 7077.\n\n
    \   \n\t </p>\n      "
