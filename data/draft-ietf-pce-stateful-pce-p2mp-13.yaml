- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been identified as an appropriate
    technology for the determination of the paths of point- to-multipoint (P2MP) TE
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs). This document provides extensions required for the
    Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) so as to enable the usage
    of a stateful PCE capability in supporting P2MP TE LSPs.</p>"
