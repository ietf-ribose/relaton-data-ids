abstract:
- content: "<p>Ensuring reliable communication often manifests in a timeout and retry
    mechanism. Each implementation of a retransmission timeout mechanism represents
    a balance between correctness and timeliness and therefore no implementation suits
    all situations. This document provides high-level requirements for retransmission
    timeout schemes appropriate for general use in the Internet. Within the requirements,
    implementations have latitude to define particulars that best address each situation.
