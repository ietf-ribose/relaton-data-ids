abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document records a format whereby a network operator can
    publish a mapping of IP address prefixes to simplified geolocation information,
    colloquially termed a \"geolocation feed\". Interested parties can poll and parse
    these feeds to update or merge with other geolocation data sources and procedures.
    This format intentionally only allows specifying coarse-level location.\n\n Some
    technical organizations operating networks that move from one conference location
    to the next have already experimentally published small geolocation feeds.\n\n
    This document describes a currently deployed format. At least one consumer (Google)
    has incorporated these feeds into a geolocation data pipeline, and a significant
    number of ISPs are using it to inform them where their prefixes should be geolocated.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
