abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes a framing protocol for TCP which is designedto
    be fully compliant with applicable TCP RFC's and fullyinteroperable with existing
    TCP implementations. The framingmechanism is designed to work as a 'shim' between
    TCP and higher-level protocols, preserving the reliable, in-order delivery of
    TCPwhile adding the preservation of higher-level protocol recordboundaries if
    the record is less than or equal to the path MTU. Theshim is designed to enable
    hardware acceleration of data movementoperations (e.g. direct placement of receive
    TCP segments intohigher-level protocol buffers) for the protocols that use it,
    evenif TCP segments are delivered out-of-order.</p>"
