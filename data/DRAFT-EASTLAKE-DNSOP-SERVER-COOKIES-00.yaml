abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS cookies, as specified in RFC 7873, are a lightweight DNS\n
    \  transaction security mechanism that provides limited protection to\n   DNS
    servers and clients against a variety of denial-of-service and\n   amplification,
    forgery, or cache poisoning attacks by off-path\n   attackers. This document specifies
    a means of producing interoperable\n   strong cookies so that an anycast server
    set including diverse\n   implementations will interoperate with standard clients.
    This\n   document updates RFC 7873.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
