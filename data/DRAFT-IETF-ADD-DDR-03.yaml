abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR),
    a\n   mechanism for DNS clients to use DNS records to discover a resolver's\n
    \  encrypted DNS configuration.  This mechanism can be used to move from\n   unencrypted
    DNS to encrypted DNS when only the IP address of a\n   resolver is known.  This
    mechanism is designed to be limited to cases\n   where unencrypted resolvers and
    their designated resolvers are\n   operated by the same entity or cooperating
    entities.  It can also be\n   used to discover support for encrypted DNS protocols
    when the name of\n   an encrypted resolver is known.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
