abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A common format simplifies exchange of secondary school academic\n
    \  transcripts via electronic mail.  Extant standards are applied to\n   prevent
    unauthorized alteration of transcript content and to deliver\n   transcripts directly
    and securely from each student to his or her\n   chosen recipients.  By eliminating
    third-party intervention and\n   surveillance, the defined protocol better protects
    student privacy\n   and independence than does current practice.\n\n\t </p>\n
