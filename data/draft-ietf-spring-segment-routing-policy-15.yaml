abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) allows a headend node to steer a packet flow along
    any path. Intermediate per-path states are eliminated thanks to source routing.
    The headend node steers a flow into an SR Policy. The packets steered into an
    SR Policy carry an ordered list of segments associated with that SR Policy. This
    document details the concepts of SR Policy and steering into an SR Policy.</p>"
