abstract:
- content: "<p>In some instances, Service Providers have a legal logging requirement
    to be able to map a subscriber's inside address with the address used on the public
    Internet (e.g. for abuse response). Unfortunately, many Carrier Grade NAT logging
    solutions require active logging of dynamic translations. Carrier Grade NAT port
    assignments are often per-connection, but could optionally use port ranges. Research
    indicates that per-connection logging is not scalable in many residential broadband
    services. This document suggests a way to manage Carrier Grade NAT translations
    in such a way as to significantly reduce the amount of logging required while
    providing traceability for abuse response. While the authors acknowledge that
    IPv6 is a preferred solution, Carrier Grade NAT is a reality in many networks,
    and is needed in situations where either customer equipment or Internet content
    only supports IPv4; this approach should in no way slow the deployment of IPv6.</p>"
