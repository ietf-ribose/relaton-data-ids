abstract:
- content: "<p>DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides configuration parameters such as IPv6 network
    addresses for hosts. The unencrypted nature and use of various identifiers make
    its privacy and security become more vulnerable. With appropriate protection mechanisms,
    the privacy and security can be improved to some extent. This document specifies
    such a mechanism that builds a trusted relationship between DHCPv6 clients and
    servers before solicitation. The mechanism enables a valid client to find and
    access the legitimate server or reject and blacklist a rogue server.</p>"
