abstract:
- content: "<p>Cryptographic hash functions often have multiple output sizes and encodings.
    This variability makes it difficult for applications to examine a series of bytes
    and determine which hash function produced them. Multihash is a universal data
    format for encoding outputs from hash functions. It is useful to write applications
    that can simultaneously support different hash function outputs as well as upgrade
    their use of hashes over time; Multihash is intended to address these needs.</p>"
