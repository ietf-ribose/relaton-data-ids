abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Efficient Protocol Independent Compression [EPIC] scheme is
    a \ngeneral mechanism for providing additional profiles for use within \nthe [ROHC8]
    framework. The EPIC inputset is a list of fields from \nthe protocol stack to
    be compressed, and for each field a choice of \nencoding techniques together with
    the probabilities that they will \nbe used. The output of EPIC is a set of optimally
    efficient \ncompressed header formats for the chosen protocol stack, and an \nautomatic
    mechanism for translating between compressed and \nuncompressed packet formats.\n\t
