abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Secure Frames (SFrame) defines a compact scheme for encrypting
    real-\n   time media.  In order for SFrame to address cases where media are\n
    \  exchanged among many participants (e.g., real-time conferencing), it\n   needs
    to be augmented with a group key management protocol.  The\n   Messaging Layer
    Security (MLS) protocol provides continuous group\n   authenticated key exchange,
    allowing a group of participants in a\n   media session to authenticate each other
    and agree on a group key.\n   This document defines how the group keys produced
    by MLS can be used\n   with SFrame to secure real-time sessions for groups.\n\n\t
