abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) is a two-party protocol\n
    \  between client and server for computing the output of a Pseudorandom\n   Function
    (PRF).  The server provides the PRF secret key, and the\n   client provides the
    PRF input.  At the end of the protocol, the\n   client learns the PRF output without
    learning anything about the PRF\n   secret key, and the server learns neither
    the PRF input nor output.\n   A Partially-Oblivious PRF (POPRF) is an OPRF that
    allows client and\n   server to provide public input to the PRF.  OPRFs and POPRFs
    can also\n   satisfy a notion of 'verifiability'.  In this setting, clients can\n
    \  verify that the server used a specific private key during the\n   execution
    of the protocol.  This document specifies a POPRF protocol\n   with optional verifiability
    instantiated within standard prime-order\n   groups, including elliptic curves.\n\n\t
