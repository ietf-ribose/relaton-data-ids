abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       The current HTTP/1.1 (RFC2068) specification introduces
    a\n        new Warning header, meant to carry status information\n        about
    a request that cannot or should not be carried by the\n        response status
    code.  The existing specification for the\n        interaction between Warning
    and HTTP caches is faulty, in\n        that it may allow incorrect results after
    cache validation\n        operations.  This document identifies two separate (but\n
    \       related) problems, and proposes revisions of the HTTP/1.1\n        specification
    to solve these problems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
