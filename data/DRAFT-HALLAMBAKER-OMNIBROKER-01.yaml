abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An Omnibroker is an agent chosen and trusted by an Internet
    user to\n   provide information such as name and certificate status information\n
    \  that are in general trusted even if they are not trustworthy.  Rather\n   than
    acting as a mere conduit for information provided by existing\n   services, an
    Omnibroker is responsible for curating those sources to\n   protect the user.\n\n
    \  The Omnibroker Protocol (OBP) provides an aggregated interface to\n   trusted
    Internet services including DNS, OCSP and various forms of\n   authentication
    service.  Multiple transport bindings are supported to\n   permit efficient access
    in virtually every common deployment scenario\n   and ensure access in any deployment
    scenario in which access is not\n   being purposely denied.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
