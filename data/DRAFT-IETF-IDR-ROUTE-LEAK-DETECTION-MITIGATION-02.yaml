abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In [I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition], the authors
    have\n   provided a definition of the route leak problem, and also enumerated\n
    \  several types of route leaks.  In this document, we first examine\n   which
    of those route-leak types are detected and mitigated by the\n   existing origin
    validation (OV) [RFC 6811].  It is recognized that OV\n   offers a limited detection
    and mitigation capability against route\n   leaks.  This document proposes an
    enhancement that significantly\n   extends the route-leak detection and mitigation
    capabilities of BGP.\n   The solution involves carrying a per-hop route-leak protection
    (RLP)\n   field in BGP updates.  The RLP field is proposed be carried in an\n
    \  optional transitive path attribute.  The solution is meant to be\n   initially
    implemented as an enhancement of BGP without requiring\n   BGPsec [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol].
    \ However, when BGPsec is\n   deployed in the future, the solution can be incorporated
    in BGPsec,\n   enabling cryptographic protection for the RLP field.  That would
    be\n   one way of implementing the proposed solution in a secure way.  It is\n
    \  not claimed that the solution detects all possible types of route\n   leaks
    but it detects several types, especially considering some\n   significant route-leak
    occurrences that have been observed in recent\n   years.  The document also includes
    a stopgap method for detection and\n   mitigation of route leaks for an intermediate
    phase when OV is\n   deployed but BGP protocol on the wire is unchanged.\n\n\t
