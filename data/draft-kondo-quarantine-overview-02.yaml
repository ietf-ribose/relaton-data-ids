abstract:
  content: "<p>In the current Internet, a site is often secured by firewall, whichfilters
    harmful traffic from outside at the border of the site. This'Border Defense Model',
    provides only a single line of defence andhinders the deployment of many next-generation
    Internet applicationsand services.This memo surveys the security issues of the
    'Border Defense Model',and proposes a network architecture 'Quarantine Model',
    to provide abetter security model and promote various end-to-end Internet usages.In
    our 'Quarantine Model', nodes shareing an Enterprise networknetwork are connected
    to separate logical networks according to theirsecurity privilege level and community
    of interest. A differentsecurity policy is implemented on each logical network
    segment usingthe multiple security-related techniques, such as filtering,authentication,
    and encryption. This 'Compartmentalized' frameworkprovides a better depth of network
    defenes and additional flexibilityto our 'Quarantine Model'.This memo enumerates
    requirements and issues for this architecture.However, it is beyond the scope
    of this document to propose specificimplementations or protocols.</p>"
