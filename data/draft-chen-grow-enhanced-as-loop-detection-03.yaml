abstract:
- content: "<p>Misconfiguration and malicious manipulation of BGP AS_Path may lead
    to route hijack. This document proposes to enhance the BGP Inbound/ Outbound route
    processing in the case of detecting an AS loop. Two options are proposed for the
    enhancement, a) a local check at the device; b) data collection/analysis at the
    remote network controller/ server. Both approaches are beneficial for route hijack
    detection.</p>"
