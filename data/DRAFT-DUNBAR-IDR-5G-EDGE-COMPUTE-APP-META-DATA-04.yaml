abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes a new AppMetaData subTLV carried by\n
    \  Tunnel Encap[RFC9012] Path Attribute for egress router to\n   advertise the
    running status and environment for the directly\n   attached 5G Edge Computing
    (EC) servers. The AppMetaData can\n   be used by the ingress routers in the 5G
    Local Data Network to\n   make path selection not only based on the routing distance
    but\n   also the running environment of the destinations. The goal is\n   to improve
    latency and performance for 5G EC services.\n\n   The extension enables an EC
    server at one specific location to\n   be more preferred than the others with
    the same IP address to\n   receive data flows from a specific source (UE).\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
