abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized
    to enable\n   carrier-grade packet transport and complement converged packet\n
    \  network deployments. Among the most attractive features of MPLS-TP\n   are
    OAM functions, which enable network operators or service\n   providers to provide
    various maintenance characteristics, such as\n   fault location, survivability,
    performance monitoring, and\n   preliminary or in-service measurements.\n\n   One
    of the most important mechanisms which is common for transport\n   network operation
    is fault location. A segment monitoring function of\n   a transport path is effective
    in terms of extension of the\n   maintenance work and indispensable particularly
    when the OAM function\n   is effective only between end points. However, the current
    approach\n   defined for MPLS-TP for the segment monitoring (SPME) has some fatal\n
    \  drawbacks. This document elaborates on the problem statement for the\n   Sub-path
    Maintenance Elements (SPMEs) which provides monitoring of a\n   portion of a set
    of transport paths (LSPs or MS-PWs). Based on the\n   problems, this document
    specifies new requirements to consider a new\n   improved mechanism of hitless
    transport path segment monitoring.\n\n   This document is a product of a joint
    Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunications
    Union Telecommunications\n   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include
    an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support
    the\n   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.\n\t </p>\n
