abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an authentication service that uses
    the\n   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) transported employing\n   Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP) messages.  As such, it\n   defines an EAP lower-layer
    based on CoAP called CoAP-EAP.  One of the\n   primer goals is to authenticate
    a CoAP-enabled device (EAP peer) that\n   intends to join a security domain managed
    by a domain Controller (EAP\n   authenticator).  Secondly, it allows deriving
    key material to protect\n   CoAP messages exchanged between them based on Object
    Security for\n   Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), enabling the establishment\n
    \  of a security association between them.  This document also provides\n   guidelines
    on how to generate key material for other types of\n   security associations.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
