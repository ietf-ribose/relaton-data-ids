abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A transport network is a server-layer network designed to provide\n
    \  connectivity services for a client-layer network to carry the client\n   traffic
    opaquely across the server-layer network resources.  A\n   transport network may
    be constructed from equipments utilizing any of\n   a number of different transport
    technologies such as the evolving\n   optical transport infrastructure (Synchronous
    Optical Networking\n   (SONET) / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical
    Transport\n   Network (OTN)) or packet transport as epitomized by the MPLS\n   Transport
    Profile (MPLS-TP).\n\n   This draft provides a transport service YANG model that
    can be used\n   together with the RESTCONF protocol for a northbound client to\n
    \  initiate service requests toward the transport network controllers\n   via
    the RESTful interface between them so as to enable automated\n   service interations.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
