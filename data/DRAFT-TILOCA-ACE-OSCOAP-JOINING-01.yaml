abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to join a multicast group
    where\n   communications are based on CoAP and secured with Object Security for\n
    \  Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE).  The proposed method\n   delegates
    the authentication and authorization of client nodes that\n   join an OSCORE multicast
    group through a Group Manager server.  This\n   approach builds on the ACE framework
    for Authentication and\n   Authorization, and leverages protocol-specific profiles
    of ACE to\n   achieve communication security, proof-of-possession and server\n
    \  authentication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
