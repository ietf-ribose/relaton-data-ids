abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering
    Point\n   (PSAP), the device that sends it, as well as any application service\n
    \  provider in the path of the call, or access network provider through\n   which
    the call originated has information about the call, the caller\n   or the location
    which might be helpful for the PSAP to have in\n   handling the emergency.  This
    document describes data structures and\n   a mechanism to convey such data to
    the PSAP.  The intent is that\n   every emergency call carry the information described
    here using the\n   mechanisms described here.\n\n   The mechanism uses a Uniform
    Resource Identifier (URI), which may\n   point to either an external resource
    or an object in the body of the\n   SIP message.  The mechanism thus allows the
    data to be passed by\n   reference (when the URI points to an external resource)
    or by value\n   (when it points into the body of the message).  This follows the\n
    \  tradition of prior emergency services standardization work where data\n   can
    be conveyed by value within the call signaling (i.e., in body of\n   the SIP message)
    and also by reference.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
