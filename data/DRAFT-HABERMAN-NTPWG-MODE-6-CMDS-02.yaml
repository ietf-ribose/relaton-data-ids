abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the structure of the control messages
    used\n   with the Network Time Protocol.  These control messages can be used\n
    \  to monitor and control the Network Time Protocol application running\n   on
    any IP network attached computer.  The information in this\n   document was originally
    described in Appendix B of RFC 1305.  The\n   goal of this document is to provide
    a historic description of the\n   control messages.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
