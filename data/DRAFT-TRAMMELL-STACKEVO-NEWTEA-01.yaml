abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document explores architectural considerations for using\n
    \  encapsulation in support of stack evolution and new transport\n   protocol
    deployment in an increasingly encrypted Internet.  These\n   architectural considerations
    are based on an idealized architecture\n   where all interactions among applications,
    endpoints, and the path\n   occur explicitly, with this cooperation enforced cryptographically.\n
    \  This idealized architecture is then lensed through the state of\n   devices
    in the present Internet and how they would impair the\n   deployability of such
    an architecture, in order to support an\n   incremental deployment of this approach.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
