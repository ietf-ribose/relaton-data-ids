abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Virtualization and Virtual Machine (VM) migration provide Data
    Center\n   with feasibility and improves the utilization of limited physical\n
    \  resource, e.g. switches/routers, servers and links.  Meanwhile, a\n   variety
    of policies (e.g.  ACL, firewalls, load balancers, IPS and\n   QoS) are deployed
    in Data Center to improve system security and\n   gurantee SLA.  Those polices
    are executed by rules configured or\n   generated on network devices.  E.g. packet
    filtering policies are\n   executed by Access Control List on switches or firewalls.
    \ Another\n   example is Load balancer (LB) who extablishes TCP/HTTP connections\n
    \  with external clients and balances connections among server farm.\n   During
    this process, TCP connection tables are dynamically generated\n   on LB.  When
    VM migrates, the network devices that processing and\n   forward VM's packets
    may change.  In order to keep VM's running\n   serives and guanrantee security
    on new place, VM-relevant policies,\n   including static policies as well as the
    dynamically generated\n   information, need to migrate with VM.\n\n   This draft
    describes some examples of the policies that need to\n   migrate with VM, the
    problems that need to consider when migrate\n   polices in Data Center.  The goal
    is to justify that it is necessary\n   for IETF to make new effort on management
    of virtualized Data Center.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
