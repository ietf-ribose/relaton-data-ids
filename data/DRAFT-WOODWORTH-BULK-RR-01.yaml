abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BULK DNS resource record type defines a method of pattern
    based\n   creation of DNS resource records to be used in place of NXDOMAIN\n   errors
    which would normally be returned.  These records are currently\n   restricted
    to registered DNS resource record types A, AAAA, PTR and\n   CNAME.  The key benefit
    of the BULK resource record type is the\n   simplification of maintaining \"generic\"
    record assignments which\n   would otherwise be too many to manage or require
    scripts or\n   proprietary methods as bind's $GENERATE.\n\n   This document updates
    RFCs 2308, 4033, 4034 and 4035.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
