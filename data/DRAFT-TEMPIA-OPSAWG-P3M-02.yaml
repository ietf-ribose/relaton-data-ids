abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to achieve performance measurements\n
    \  of live traffic, applicable to any packet based traffic stream,\n   including
    L2, L3, MPLS traffic, unicast and multicast.  The method\n   can be easily implemented
    using tools and features already available\n   on existing routing platforms without
    any protocol extension and, for\n   this reason, it does not raise any interoperability
    issue.  However,\n   the method could be further improved by means of some extension
    to\n   existing protocols, but this aspect is left for further study and it\n
    \  is out of the scope of the document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
