abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When operating a multi-domain network, it is quite common for
    a \ndomain to have a number of border-nodes that end up with a large \nnumber
    of connections between them using the same path.  While \nsupport for LSP stitching
    has removed the need to maintain the data \nassociated with each end-to-end session
    (e.g. Sender Template and \nSession object data) within the domain, the mechanisms
    used by GMPLS \nRSVP-TE to support out-of-band signaling still force individual
    \nsessions to be used between the border nodes for each connection. \nThis has
    a negative impact on intermediate nodes, as it increases \nthe amount of RSVP
    processing and memory required. \n \nThis document details a method for GMPLS
    RSVP-TE to use a common \nsession for an edge-to-edge LSP supporting multiple
    data-plane \nconnections between border nodes.\n\t </p>\n      "
