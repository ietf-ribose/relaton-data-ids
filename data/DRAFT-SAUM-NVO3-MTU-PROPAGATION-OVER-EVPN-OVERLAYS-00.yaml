abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Path MTU Discovery between end-host-devices/Virtual-Machines/servers/\n
    \  workloads connected over an EVPN-Overlay Network in an\n   Datacenter/Campus/enterprise
    deployment, is a problem, yet to be\n   resolved in the standards forums.  It
    needs a converged solution to\n   ensure optimal usage of network and computational
    resources of the\n   underlay routers/switches forming the basis of the overlay
    network.\n   This documents takes leads from the guidelines presented in\n   [RFC4459].\n\n
    \  The overlay connectivity can pan across various sites (geographically\n   seperated
    or collocated) for realizing a Datacenter Interconnect or\n   intersite VPNs between
    campus sites (buildings, branch offices etc).\n\n   This literature intends to
    solve problem of icmp error propagation\n   from an underlay routing/switching
    device to an end-host (hooked to\n   EVPN overlay), thus facilitating \"accurate
    MTU\" learnings.\n\n   This document also leverages the icmp multipart message
    extension,\n   mentioned in [RFC4884] to carry the original packet in the icmp
    PDU.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
