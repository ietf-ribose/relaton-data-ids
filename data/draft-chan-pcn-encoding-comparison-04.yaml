abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A number of mechanisms have been proposed to support differentialQualiy
    of Service for packets in the Internet. DiffServ is anexample of such a mechanism.
    However, the level of assurance thatcan be provided with DiffServ without substantial
    over-provisioningis limited. Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) uses path congestioninformation
    across a PCN region to enable per-flow admission controlto provide the required
    service guarantees for the admitted traffic.While admission control will protect
    the QoS under normal operatingconditions, an additional flow termination mechanism
    is necessary tocope with extreme events (e.g. route changes due to link or nodefailure).In
    order to allow the PCN mechanisms to work it is necessary for IPpackets to be
    able to carry the pre-congestion information to the PCNegress nodes. This document
    explores different ways in which thisinformation can be encoded into IP packets.
    This document does notchoose the encoding but provide guidance and recommendation
    based ondifferent criteria. This document also provides a historical traceof the
    consideration on different encoding alternatives for Pre-Congestion Notification.</p>"
