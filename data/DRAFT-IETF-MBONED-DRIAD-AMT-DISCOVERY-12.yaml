abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC 7450 (Automatic Multicast Tunneling,
    or\n   AMT) by modifying the relay discovery process.  A new DNS resource\n   record
    named AMTRELAY is defined for publishing AMT relays for\n   source-specific multicast
    channels.  The reverse IP DNS zone for a\n   multicast sender's IP address is
    configured to use AMTRELAY resource\n   records to advertise a set of AMT relays
    that can receive and forward\n   multicast traffic from that sender over an AMT
    tunnel.  Other\n   extensions and clarifications to the relay discovery process
    are also\n   defined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
