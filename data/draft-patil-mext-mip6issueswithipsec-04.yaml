abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 as specified in RFC3775 relies on IPsec for securing the
    signaling messages and user plane traffic between the mobile node and home agent.
    An IPsec SA between the mobile node and the home agent provides security for the
    mobility signaling. Use of IPsec for securing the data traffic between the mobile
    node and home agent is optional. This document analyses the implications of the
    design decision to mandate IPsec as the default security protocol for Mobile IPv6
    and consequently Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 and recommends revisiting this decision
    in view of the experience gained from implementation and adoption in other standards
    bodies.</p>"
