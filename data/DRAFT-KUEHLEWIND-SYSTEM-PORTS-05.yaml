abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number
    Registry,\n   a large number of System Ports are currently assigned to individuals\n
    \  or companies who have registered the port for the use with a certain\n   protocol
    before RFC6335 was published.  For some of these ports, RFCs\n   exist that describe
    the respective protocol; for others, RFCs are\n   under development that define,
    re-define, or assign the protocol used\n   for the respective port, such as in
    case of so-far unused UDP ports\n   that have been registered together with the
    respective TCP port.  In\n   these cases the IESG has the change control about
    the protocol used\n   on the port (as described in the corresponding RFC) but
    change\n   control for the port allocation iis designated to others.  Under\n
    \  existing operational procedures, this means the original assignee\n   needs
    to be involved in chnage to the port assignment.  As it is not\n   always possible
    to get in touch with the original assignee,\n   particularly because of out-dated
    contact information, this current\n   practice of handling historical allocation
    of System Ports does not\n   scale well on a case-by-case basis.  To address this,
    this document\n   instructs IANA to perform actions with the goal to reassign
    System\n   Ports to the IESG that were assigned to individuals prior to the\n
    \  publication of RFC6335, where appropriate.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
