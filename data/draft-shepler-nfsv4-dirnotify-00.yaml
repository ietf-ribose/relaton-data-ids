abstract:
  content: "\t <t>NFSv4 [RFC3530] contains within it a mechanism for the delegation
    offile data to a client. The intent of this feature is to reduce thenecessary
    interaction between a client and server such that overallperformance is improved.
    The same type of mechanism does not existfor directory contents and to determine
    validity of cached directorycontents an NFSv4 client is left with polling the
    server to determineif updates have occurred.The proposal described here is for
    an NFSv4 minor version that wouldallow a client to register interest in a directory
    and to receive acallback RPC upon update of that directory. This type of interactionwould
    reduce or eliminate the polling that occurs between client andserver and improve
    scalability of the server's resources along withimproved performance for the client's
    directory content caching.</p>"
