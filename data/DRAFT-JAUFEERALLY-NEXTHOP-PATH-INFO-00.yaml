abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The aim of this document is to define an interface through
    which an\n   Autonomous System (AS) can disseminate information about forwarding\n
    \  of packets to the next hop outside the AS, to devices within its\n   network.
    \ This information can be used to make path aware routing\n   decisions, either
    by being aware of the default route packets will\n   take when traversing the
    AS, or by using other mechanisms to control\n   the path packets which is out
    of the scope of this document.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
