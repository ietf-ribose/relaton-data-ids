abstract:
- content: "<p>The length of IP prefixes to be manipulated by forwarding and routing
    processes is policy-based; no maximum length must be assumed by design. This document
    sketches a recommendation to be followed by forwarding and routing designs with
    regards to the prefix length. The aim is to avoid hard-coded routing and forwarding
    designs that exclude some IP prefix lengths.</p>"
