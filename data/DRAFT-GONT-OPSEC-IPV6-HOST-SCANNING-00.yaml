abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4\n
    \  counterpart.  The standard /64 IPv6 subnets can (in theory)\n   accommodate
    approximately 1.844 * 10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a\n   much lower host density
    (#hosts/#addresses) than their IPv4\n   counterparts.  As a result, it is widely
    assumed that it would take a\n   tremendous effort to perform host scanning attacks
    against IPv6\n   networks, and therefore IPv6 host scanning attacks have long
    been\n   considered unfeasible.  This document analyzes the IPv6 address\n   configuration
    policies implemented in most popular IPv6 stacks, and\n   identifies a number
    of patterns in the resulting addresses lead to a\n   tremendous reduction in the
    host address search space, thus\n   dismantling the myth that IPv6 host scanning
    attacks are unfeasible.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
