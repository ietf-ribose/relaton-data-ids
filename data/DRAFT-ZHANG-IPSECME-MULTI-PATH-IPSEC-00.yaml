abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents one approach to enhance data protection
    when\n   transmitting IPsec datagrams across the insecure networks. The method\n
    \  affords the stronger protection to the traffic by splitting it among\n   a
    set of sub-tunnels.  All the Security Associations (SAs) are set up\n   independently
    for all sub-tunnels.  Both the sending and receiving\n   entity combine all the
    sub-tunnels to one clustered tunnel.  As\n   different sub-tunnel uses different
    crypto key materials and\n   processing parameters, it may achieve the stronger
    protection of the\n   traffic across the insecure networks.  In addition, it could
    possibly\n   bring more benefits in terms of the network control.\n\n\n\n\n\t
