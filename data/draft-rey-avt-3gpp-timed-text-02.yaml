abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an RTP payload format for the transmission
    of 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) timed text. 3GPP timed text is time-lined
    decorated text media format based on the ISO (International Standardisation Organisation)
    Base Media File Format. As of today, 3GPP timed text contents can be downloaded
    via HTTP and synchronised with audio/video contents. There is however no available
    mechanism for streaming 3GPP timed text. In the following sections the problems
    of streaming timed text are addressed and a payload format for streaming 3GPP
    timed text over RTP is specified.</p>"
