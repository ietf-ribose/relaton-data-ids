abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ordinary TCP loss recovery takes at least one round-trip time
    and as\n   such can increase application-perceived latency, especially for short\n
    \  flows such as Web transactions.  TCP Instant Recovery (TCP-IR) is an\n   experimental
    algorithm that allows a receiving end to recover lost\n   packets without retransmissions,
    thus potentially saving at least one\n   full round-trip time compared to standard
    TCP.  TCP-IR achieves this\n   by judiciously injecting encoded data segments
    within a TCP stream.\n   This document describes the TCP-IR algorithm at the sending
    and\n   receiving ends, along with the required protocol changes.\n\n\t </p>\n
