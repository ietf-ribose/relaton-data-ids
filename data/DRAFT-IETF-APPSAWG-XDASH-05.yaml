abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Historically, designers and implementers of application protocols
    have often distinguished between standardized and unstandardized parameters by
    prefixing the names of unstandardized parameters with the string \"X-\" or similar
    constructs.  In practice, that convention causes more problems than it solves.
    \ Therefore, this document deprecates the convention for newly defined parameters
    with textual (as opposed to numerical) names in application protocols.  This memo
    documents an Internet Best Current Practice.\n\t </p>\n      "
