abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This text describes evolving networking technology within residential\n
    \  home networks with increasing numbers of devices and a trend towards\n   increased
    internal routing.  The goal of this document is to define a\n   general architecture
    for IPv6-based home networking, describing the\n   associated principles, considerations
    and requirements.  The text\n   briefly highlights specific implications of the
    introduction of IPv6\n   for home networking, discusses the elements of the architecture,
    and\n   suggests how standard IPv6 mechanisms and addressing can be employed\n
    \  in home networking.  The architecture describes the need for specific\n   protocol
    extensions for certain additional functionality.  It is\n   assumed that the IPv6
    home network is not actively managed, and runs\n   as an IPv6-only or dual-stack
    network.  There are no recommendations\n   in this text for the IPv4 part of the
    network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
