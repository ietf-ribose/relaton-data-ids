abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the information contained in a conceptual\n
    \  database of long-lived cryptographic keys used by many different\n   security
    protocols.  The database is designed to support both manual\n   and automated
    key management.  In addition to describing the schema\n   for the database, this
    document describes the operations that can be\n   performed on the database as
    well as the requirements for the\n   security protocols that wish to use the database.
    \ In many typical\n   scenarios, the security protocols do not directly use the
    long-lived\n   key, but rather a key derivation function is used to derive a short-\n
    \  lived key from a long-lived key.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
