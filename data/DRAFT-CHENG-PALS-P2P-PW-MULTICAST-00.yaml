abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multicast services such as Evolved Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast\n
    \  Service (eMBMS) become more and more popular in mobile networks.  In\n   mobile
    transport network, it is important for the operators to\n   provide efficient
    transport of multicast services with existing\n   network devices.  This document
    describes a mechanism of using point-\n   to-point Pseudowires (PW) [RFC 3985]
    to achieve efficient layer 2\n   multicast transportation in mobile transport
    networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
