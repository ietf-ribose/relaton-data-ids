abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is now entering widespread\n
    \  deployment.  However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet\n   as
    mature and reliable as is the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain\n   administration
    tools and processes.  One potential technique to\n   mitigate this is to use a
    Negative Trust Anchor, which is defined in\n   this document.\n\n   This document
    discusses Trust Anchors for DNSSEC and defines a\n   Negative Trust Anchor, which
    is potentially useful during the\n   transition to ubiquitous DNSSEC deployment.
    \ These are configured\n   locally on a particular instance of a validating DNS
    recursive\n   resolver and can shield end users of such a resolver from the DNSSEC-\n
    \  related authoritative name server operational errors that appear to\n   be
    somewhat typical during the transition to ubiquitous DNSSEC\n   deployment.  Negative
    Trust Anchors are intended to be temporary, and\n   should not be distributed
    by IANA or any other organization outside\n   of the administrative boundary of
    the organization locally\n   implementing a Negative Trust Anchor.  Finally, Negative
    Trust\n   Anchors pertain only to DNSSEC and not to Public Key Infrastructures\n
    \  (PKI) such ad X.509.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
