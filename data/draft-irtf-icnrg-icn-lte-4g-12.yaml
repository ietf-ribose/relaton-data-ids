abstract:
- content: "<p>4G mobile network uses IP-based transport for the control plane to
    establish the data session at the user plane for the actual data delivery. In
    the existing architecture, IP-based unicast is used for the delivery of multimedia
    content to a mobile terminal, where each user is receiving a separate stream from
    the server. From a bandwidth and routing perspective, this approach is inefficient.
    Evolved multimedia broadcast and multicast service (eMBMS) provides capabilities
    for delivering contents to multiple users simultaneously, but its deployment is
    very limited or at an experimental stage due to numerous challenges. The focus
    of this draft is to list the options for use of Information centric technology
    (ICN) in 4G mobile networks and elaborate the experimental setups for its further
    evaluation. The experimental setups discussed provide for using ICN either natively
    or with existing mobility protocol stack. With further investigations based on
    the listed experiments, ICN with its inherent capabilities such as, network- layer
    multicast, anchorless mobility, security, and optimized data delivery using local
    caching at the edge may provide a viable alternative to IP transport in 4G mobile
    networks.</p>"
