abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new EVPN VPWS service type specifically for
    multiplexing multiple attachment circuits across different Ethernet Segments and
    physical interfaces into a single EVPN VPWS service tunnel and still providing
    Single-Active and All-Active multi-homing. This new service is referred to as
    flexible cross-connect service. After a description of the rationale for this
    new service type, the solution to deliver such service is detailed.</p>"
