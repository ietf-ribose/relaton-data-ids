abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Researchers proposed practical DNS cache poisoning attacks
    using IP\n   fragmentation.  This document shows feasible and adequate measures
    at\n   full-service resolvers and authoritative servers against these\n   attacks.
    \ To protect resolvers from these attacks, avoid\n   fragmentation (limit requestor's
    UDP payload size to 1220/1232), drop\n   fragmented UDP DNS responses and use
    TCP at resolver side.  To make a\n   domain name robust against these attacks,
    limit EDNS0 Responder's\n   maximum payload size to 1220, set DONTFRAG option
    to DNS response\n   packets and use good random fragmentation ID at authoritative
    server\n   side.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
