abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document initiates the discussion on enhanced mobility
    anchoring\n   solutions in the context of a distributed mobility management\n
    \  deployment.  Such solutions consider the problem of assigning a\n   mobility
    anchor and a gateway at the initiation of a session.  In\n   addition, the mid-session
    switching of the mobility anchor in a\n   distributed mobility management environment
    is considered.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
