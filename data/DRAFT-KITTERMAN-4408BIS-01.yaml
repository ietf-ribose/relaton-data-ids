abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   E-mail on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways.  In\n
    \  particular, existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending\n   host
    can use as the reverse-path of a message or the domain given on\n   the SMTP HELO/EHLO
    commands.  This document describes version 1 of\n   the Sender Policy Framework
    (SPF) protocol, whereby a domain may\n   explicitly authorize the hosts that are
    allowed to use its domain\n   name, and a receiving host may check such authorization.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
