abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  This document describes a mechanism that provides Mobile IP
    nodes\n  and agents with the necessary keys and information\n  needed to establish
    mobility security associations within a\n  foreign network. This mechanism aims
    at reducing the latency and\n  computational burden introduced by public-key based
    key management\n  protocols in network topologies where visiting mobile nodes
    register\n  with their respective home agents several times through different\n
    \ foreign agents requiring Mobile-Foreign Authentication. This\n  mechanism employs
    a key distribution center capable of generating\n  the security contexts needed
    to authenticate Mobile IP control\n  messages. This mechanism, designed as an
    extension to the Mobile IP\n  protocol, preservs backward compatibility and interoperability
    with\n  RFC2002 compliant implementations of Mobile IP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
