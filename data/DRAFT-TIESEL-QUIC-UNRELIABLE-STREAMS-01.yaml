abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo outlines how to support unreliable streams as well
    as\n   partially-reliable streams within QUIC.  The intention of this\n   document
    is to collect requirements and considerations, to frame the\n   design space,
    and to give an example how unreliable stream support\n   could be realized.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
