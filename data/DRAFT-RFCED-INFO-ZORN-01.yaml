abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes  a  set  of  vendor-specific  RADIUS  attributes\ndesigned
    \ to  support  the use of Microsoft's proprietary dialect of PPP\nCHAP (MS-CHAP)
    in dial-up networks.  MS-CHAP is derived from and  (where\npossible) consistent
    with PPP CHAP [1]; the differences between PPP CHAP\nand MS-CHAP are significant
    enough to  warrant  the  definition  of  new\nRADIUS attributes, however.\n\t
