    in IPv4,\n   and it is intended to resolve Data Link Layer Ethernet addresses
    to\n   Network Layer IP-FF addresses,  in addition to Duplicate Address\n   Detection
    (DAD), includes optional duplicate MAC address detection.\n   This spec was written
    for IEEE 802.3 Ethernet links or compatible.\n   Separate specifications may be
    required for other link types.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
