abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Scheduling schemes play a key role in the performance of multipath\n
    \  transport protocols. A path-aware scheduling scheme for latency-\n   sensitive
    applications is proposed, which always schedules data in\n   the path with the
    lowest One-Way Latency (OWL). The OWLs of all paths\n   are obtained by employing
    the redundant transmission periodically.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
