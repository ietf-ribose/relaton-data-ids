abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Congestion control (CC) is the key to achieving ultra-low latency,\n
    \  high bandwidth and network stability in high-speed networks.\n   However, the
    existing high-speed CC schemes have inherent limitations\n   for reaching these
    goals.\n\n   In this document, we describe HPCC++ (High Precision Congestion\n
    \  Control), a new high-speed CC mechanism which achieves the three\n   goals
    simultaneously.  HPCC++ leverages in-network telemetry (INT) to\n   obtain precise
    link load information and controls traffic precisely.\n   By addressing challenges
    such as delayed INT information during\n   congestion and overreaction to INT
    information, HPCC++ can quickly\n   converge to utilize free bandwidth while avoiding
    congestion, and can\n   maintain near-zero in-network queues for ultra-low latency.
    \ HPCC++\n   is also fair and easy to deploy in hardware, implementable with\n
    \  commodity programmable NICs and switches.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
