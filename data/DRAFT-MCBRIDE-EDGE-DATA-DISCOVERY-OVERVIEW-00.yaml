abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the problem of distributed data discovery
    in\n   edge computing.  Increasing numbers of IoT devices and sensors are\n   generating
    a torrent of data that originates at the very edges of the\n   network and that
    flows upstream, if it flows at all.  Sometimes that\n   data must be processed
    or transformed (transcoded, subsampled,\n   compressed, analyzed, annotated, combined,
    aggregated, etc.) on edge\n   equipment along the way, particularly in places
    where multiple high\n   bandwidth streams converge and where resources are limited.
    \ Support\n   for edge data analysis is critical to make local, low-latency\n
    \  decisions (e.g., regarding predictive maintenance, the dispatch of\n   emergency
    services, identity, authorization, etc.).  In addition,\n   (transformed) data
    may be cached, copied and/or stored at multiple\n   locations in the network on
    route to its final destination.  Although\n   the data might originate at the
    edge, for example in factories,\n   automobiles, video cameras, wind farms, etc.,
    as more and more\n   distributed data is created, processed and stored, it becomes\n
    \  increasingly dispersed throughout the network and there needs to be a\n   standard
    way to find it.  New and existing protocols will need to be\n   identified/developed/enhanced
    for distributed data discovery at the\n   network edge and beyond.\n\n\t </p>\n
