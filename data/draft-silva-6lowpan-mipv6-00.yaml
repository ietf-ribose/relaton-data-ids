abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Real deployments of wireless sensor networks (WSN) are rare, andvirtually
    all have considerable limitations when node mobility isconcerned. On one hand,
    research in WSNs tends to favour complexmulti-hop routing protocols and, on the
    other hand, IP and mobilityare considered too demanding for these environments.
    In thisdocument we contradict this general belief by proposing an adaptationmodel
    for Mobile IPv6 in 6lowPANs.</p>"
