abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines a new attribute for BGP called the FlexibleCommunity
    attribute. Flexible Communities build on the experienceand utility of the standard
    BGP community, and the extended BGPcommunity attributes. This attribute allows
    operators to associatestructured information with a route or set of routes. Thisinformation
    can be then be used to execute routing policy. Anenhanced version of communities
    is necessary to accommodate IPv6,4-byte ASN's, and introduce a more extensible
    and flexible policyexpression. This document also introduces the concept of NeighborClasses.
    A Neighbor Class is applied to a group of BGP neighbors whoshare certain attributes.
    For example, the PEER Neighbor Class couldbe applied to BGP sessions between ASN
    X and other networks withwhich ASN X has a non-transit peering relationship.</p>"
