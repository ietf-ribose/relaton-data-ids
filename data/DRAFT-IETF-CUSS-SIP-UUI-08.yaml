abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a class of applications which benefit from using SIP
    to\n   exchange User to User Information (UUI) data during session\n   establishment.
    \ This information, known as call control UUI data, is\n   a small piece of data
    inserted by an application initiating the\n   session, and utilized by an application
    accepting the session.  The\n   rules which apply for a specific application are
    defined by a UUI\n   package.  This UUI data is opaque to SIP and its function
    is\n   unrelated to any basic SIP function.  This document defines a new SIP\n
    \  header field, User-to-User, to transport UUI data, along with an\n   extension
    mechanism.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
