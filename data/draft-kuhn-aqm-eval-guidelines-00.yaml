abstract:
- content: "<p>Unmanaged large buffers in today's networks have given rise to a slew
    of performance issues. These performance issues can be addressed by some form
    of Active Queue Management (AQM), optionally in combination with a packet scheduling
    scheme such as fair queuing. The IETF AQM working group was recently formed to
    standardize AQM schemes that are robust, easily implemented, and successfully
    deployed in today's networks. This document describes various criteria for performing
    precautionary evaluations of AQM proposals. This document also helps in ascertaining
    whether any given AQM proposal should be taken up for standardization by the AQM
    WG.</p>"
