abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes misconfigurations of DNS authoritative
    servers\n   and its effect to old DNS iterative resolver servers we experienced.\n
    \  We recommend re-checking DNS authoritative server configuration and\n   advise
    using newer iterative resolver server implementations.  The\n   recommendations
    made in this document are based on analysis of\n   abnormal DNS resolver server
    load at large ISP resolver server which\n   has many customers.  This is not protocol
    issue.\n\t </p>\n      "
