abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the utility of passive two-way latency\n
    \  measurement, both for the generation of latency metrics, as well as\n   for
    other measurement tasks, when passive latency measurement is the\n   only facility
    available for measurement.  It additionally discusses\n   other metrics derivable
    from the transport-independent latency spin\n   signal defined in [TSVWG-SPIN].\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
