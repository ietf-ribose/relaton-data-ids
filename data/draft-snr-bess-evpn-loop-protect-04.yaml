abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet Virtual Private Networks (EVPN) is becoming the de-facto standard-based
    control plane solution for Data Center and layer-2 Service Provider applications.
    The risk of loops caused by backdoor paths accidentally created within the same
    broadcast domain, is a general common concern, especially among Service Providers
    in large Layer-2 networks. While other layer-2 Ethernet technologies use Spanning
    Tree based Protocols (xSTP) to provide a network-wide loop protection, EVPN has
    the right tools to detect and protect the network against loops in an efficient
    and effective way. This document describes a mechanism to provide global loop
    protection in EVPN networks.</p>"
