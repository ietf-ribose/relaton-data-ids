abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As originally specified, [RFC5050] presumes that any DTN node
    will\n   have access to accurate real world time.  Experience has shown that\n
    \  there are devices and networks where accurate real world time is\n   difficult
    or impossible to consistently obtain.\n\n   This draft proposes an extension block
    that contains the current age\n   of a bundle in order to support bundle expiration
    for nodes and\n   networks that have faulty, intermittent, or no notion of the
    real\n   world time.  Bundle age may be used to expire bundles by a Bundle\n   Protocol
    Agent which does not have access to accurate real world\n   time.  The bundle
    age must be updated at each hop in order to\n   maintain accuracy.\n\t </p>\n
