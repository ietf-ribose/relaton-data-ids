  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a mechanism to establish Security\n
    \  Associations (SAs) between Access Nodes in the handover keying\n   architecture.
    \ The proposed mechanism negotiates the SA with the help\n   of existing SAs between
    Access Nodes and Access Domain Controller,\n   and between Access Domain Controller
    and AAA server as well.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
