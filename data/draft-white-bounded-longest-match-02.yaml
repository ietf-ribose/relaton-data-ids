abstract:
  content: "<p>Some ASes currently use length-based filters to manage the size ofthe
    routing table they use and propagate. This draft explores analternative to length-based
    filters which allows for more automaticconfiguration and which provides for better
    redundancy.Rather than use a filter, this draft proposes a method of modifyingthe
    BGP [RFC1771] longest match algorithm by setting a bound on theprefix lengths
    eligible for preference. A bound would operate onlong prefixes when covering route
    announcements are available; incertain circumstances it would cause a router to
    prefer an aggregateover a more specific route announcement.</p>"
