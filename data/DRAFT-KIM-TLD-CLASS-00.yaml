abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     This document specifies a structural organization of Internet
    top\n     level domain names based on the International Schedule of Classes\n
    \    of Goods and Services. This structure intends to provide a\n     framework
    for classification such that web content providers can\n     differentiate their
    goods and services and minimize the probability\n     of name confusion and collision.
    Under each class, as specified by\n     the International Schedule of Classes
    of Goods and Services, single\n     or multiple top level domain names should
    be specified each\n     appropriately partitioning the class of goods or service
    into an\n     appropriate sub-categorization. A method will further be described\n
    \    to incorporate additions/modifications as becomes necessary by as\n     of
    yet unforseen future developments.\n \n     This document does not address the
    delegation or the administration\n     of top level domain names which the author
    feels should be\n     considered separately. However, the author does acknowledge
    that\n     some form of centralized authority should be in place to properly\n
    \    control the structure to be described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
