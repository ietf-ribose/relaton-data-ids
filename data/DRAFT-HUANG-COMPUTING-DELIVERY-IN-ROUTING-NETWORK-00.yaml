abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document drafts a proposal of Computing Delivery in Routing\n
    \  Network which incorporates both computing and networking metrics into\n   the
    routing polices and enables the network sensing and scheduling\n   computing services
    based upon traditional networking services.  A\n   mechanism of two-class computing
    power granularity and two segment\n   forwarding is illustrated for end-to-end
    networking and computing\n   service in the cloud sites, while major networking
    and computing\n   actors is defined in terms of functionality.  An example work
    flow is\n   demonstrated, and both control plane and data plane solution\n   consideration
    is proposed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
