abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The current OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as defined\nin
    the OSPF standards is vulnerable to both inter-session and intra-\nsession replay
    attacks when its uses manual keying.  Additionally,\nthe existing cryptographic
    authentication schemes do not cover the IP\nheader.  This omission can be exploited
    to carry out various types of\nattacks.\n\nThis draft proposes an authentication
    scheme based on a challenge-\nresponse mechanism that will protect OSPFv2 from
    both inter and intra\nreplay attacks when its using manual keys for securing its
    protocol\npackets.  For comparison, an approach based on making sequence\nnumbers
    unique is presented.  Later we also describe some changes in\nthe cryptographic
    hash computation so that we eliminate most attacks\nthat result because of OSPFv2
    not protecting the IP header.\n\t </p>\n      "
