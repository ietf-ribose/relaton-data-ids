abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a simple method of encapsulating SCTP
    Packets\n   into UDP packets and its limitations.  This allows the usage of SCTP\n
    \  in networks with legacy NAT not supporting SCTP.  It can also be used\n   to
    implement SCTP on hosts without directly accessing the IP-layer,\n   for example
    implementing it as part of the application without\n   requiring special privileges.\n\n
    \  Please note that this document only describes the functionality\n   required
    within an SCTP stack to add on UDP encapsulation, providing\n   only those mechanisms
    for two end-hosts to communicate with each\n   other over UDP ports.  In particular,
    it does not provide mechanisms\n   to determine whether UDP encapsulation is being
    used by the peer, nor\n   the mechanisms for determining which remote UDP port
    number can be\n   used.  These functions are are out of scope for this document.\n\n
    \  This document covers only end-hosts and not tunneling (egress or\n   ingress)
    end-points.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
