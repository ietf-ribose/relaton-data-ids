abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) was developed
    to\n   prevent IP source address spoofing which can enable impersonation and\n
    \  malicious traffic redirection. An Internet Service Provider (ISP) who\n   provides
    Internet access services, information services and value-\n   added services to
    the customers should guarantee security of its\n   network and customers' privacy.
    Thus, the mechanism is essential for\n   ISPs. However, due to a diversity of
    ISPs' access network, SAVI\n   solution is also different accordingly. This document
    describes five\n   scenarios of ISPs'IPv6 access network, and moreover, states
    its SAVI\n   requirements and according tentative solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
