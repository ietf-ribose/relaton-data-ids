abstract:
- content: "<p>The DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) working group is specifying
    standardized interfaces for accessing in-network storage from applications to
    store, retrieve and manage data. The main objective is to provide a framework
    that is useful to P2P applications, without excluding other, possibly related
    applications that can benefit from accessing in-network storage. This memo presents
    Internet TV as a specific application scenario where access to in-netork storage
    would be required and lists a set of concrete requirements that should be considered
    for the DECADE architecture and protocol specifications.</p>"
