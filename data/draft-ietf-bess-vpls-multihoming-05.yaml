abstract:
- content: <p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a Layer 2 Virtual Private Network
    (VPN) that gives its customers the appearance that their sites are connected via
    a Local Area Network (LAN). It is often required for the Service Provider (SP)
    to give the customer redundant connectivity to some sites, often called "multi-homing".
    This memo shows how BGP-based multi-homing can be offered in the context of LDP
    and BGP VPLS solutions. This document updates RFC 4761 by defining new flags in
    the Control Flags field of the Layer2 Info Extended Community.</p>
