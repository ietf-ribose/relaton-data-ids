abstract:
- content: "<p>In RFC 2826, the IAB set out the benefits of a globally unique public
    name space. As alternative contexts of resolution emerge, such as those implied
    by RFC 7686, maintaining a single namespace for the Internet requires a method
    to indicate the context of resolution for a name. This document proposes a registry
    for such alternative resolution contexts as well as a set of pointer resource
    record types useful for allowing conformant resolvers which query for the name
    in the DNS to be redirected to the appropriate alternative resolution context.</p>"
