abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an ALTO protocol extension for overlay routing.
    It considers three different methods to route traffic from a data source to a
    data receiver, which are direct Internet routing, VPN tunnel, and overlay routing
    via intermediate/relay node(s), analyze their use cases in real world and then
    proposes an extension to ALTO protocol so as to support a ALTO client to get cost
    value between hosts via these different routing methods.</p>"
