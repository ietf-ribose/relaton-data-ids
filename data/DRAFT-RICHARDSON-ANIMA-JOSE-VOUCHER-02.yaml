abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC8366 defines a digital artifact called voucher as a YANG-defined\n
    \  JSON document that has been signed using a Cryptographic Message\n   Syntax
    (CMS) structure.  This memo introduces a variant of the\n   voucher structure
    in which CMS is replaced by the JSON Object Signing\n   and Encryption (JOSE)
    mechanism described in RFC7515 to better\n   support use-cases in which JOSE is
    preferred over CMS.\n\n   In addition to explaining how the format is created,
    MIME types are\n   registered and examples are provided.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
