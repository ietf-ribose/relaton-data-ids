abstract:
  content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network based mobility managementprotocol
    that enables IP mobility for a host without requiring itsparticipation in any
    mobility-related signaling. PMIPv6 requires allcommunications to go through the
    local mobility anchor. As this canbe suboptimal, localized routing allows mobile
    nodes attached to thesame or different mobile access gateways to exchange traffic
    by usinglocalized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the gateways. Thisdocument
    proposes an initiation mechanism for localized routing.</p>"
