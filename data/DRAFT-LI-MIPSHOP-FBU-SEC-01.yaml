abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification introduces a symmetric cryptography mechanism
    for\nprotecting signaling messages between the Mobile Node and previous\nAccess
    Router for Fast Mobile IPv6.  The method defined here utilizes\nthe Master Session
    Key(MSK) generated from EAP authentication to\nderive a fast handover key between
    the Mobile Node and the Access\nRouter in order to avoid certain attacks.  This
    mechanism also adopts\nthe Mobile Node Identifier option and the mobility message\nauthentication
    option to the FMIPv6 signaling messages.\n\t </p>\n      "
