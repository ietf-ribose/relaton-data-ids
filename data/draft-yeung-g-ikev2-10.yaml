abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a new group key distribution protocol. The protocol
    is in conformance with MSEC key management architecture it contains two components:
    member registration and group rekeying, both downloading group security associations
    from the Group Controller Key Server to a member of the group. The new protocol
    is similar to IKEv2 in message and payload formats as well as message semantics.</p>"
