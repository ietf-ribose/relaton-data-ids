abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NAT444, DS-LITE, 6RD and other transition technologies have
    been well\n   done, the ISP should select the most suitable tool to meet the\n
    \  requirements of a typical broadband access network in the real world\n   regarding
    its network architecture, operation situation and\n   transition goals, etc.\n\n
    \  According to the mainstream broadband access network, this draft\n   focuses
    on analyzing the problems that may be encountered when using\n   various transitional
    technologies during the transition and finally\n   introduces a more systematic
    and operational proposal.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
