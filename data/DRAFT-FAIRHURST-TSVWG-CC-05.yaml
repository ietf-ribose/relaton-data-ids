abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is for discussion by the TSVWG.  It provides
    guidance\n   on the design of methods to avoid congestion collapse and to provide\n
    \  congestion control.  Recommendations and requirements on this topic\n   are
    distributed across many documents in the RFC series.  This\n   therefore seeks
    to gather and consolidate these recommendations in an\n   annexe.  Based on these
    specifications, and Internet engineering\n   experience, the document provides
    input to the design of new\n   congestion control methods in protocols.\n\n   The
    present document is for discussion and comment by the IETF.  If\n   published,
    it plans to update or replace the Best Current Practice in\n   BCP 41, which currently
    includes \"Congestion Control Principles\"\n   provided in RFC2914.\n\n\t </p>\n
