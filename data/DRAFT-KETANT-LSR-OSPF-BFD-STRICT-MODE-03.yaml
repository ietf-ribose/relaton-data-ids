abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the extensions to OSPF that enables
    a router\n   and its neighbor to signal their intention to use Bidirectional\n
    \  Forwarding Detection (BFD) for their adjacency using link-local\n   advertisement
    between them.  The signaling of this BFD enablement,\n   allows the router to
    block and not allow the establishment of\n   adjacency with its neighbor router
    until a BFD session is\n   successfully established between them.  The document
    describes this\n   OSPF \"strict-mode\" of BFD establishment as a prerequisite
    to\n   adjacency formation.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
