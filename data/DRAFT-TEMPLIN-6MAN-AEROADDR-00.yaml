abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 interfaces are required to have a link-local address that
    is\n   unique on the link.  Nodes normally derive a link local address\n   through
    the use of IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)\n   along with Duplicate
    Address Detection (DAD).  This document presents\n   a method for a node to construct
    a link-local address that is assured\n   to be unique on the link when the node
    has already received a\n   delegated prefix.  This is through the construction
    of a link-local\n   address format known as the AERO address.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
