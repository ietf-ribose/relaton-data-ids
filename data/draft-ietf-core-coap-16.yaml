abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer
    protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy)
    networks. The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM
    and RAM, while constrained networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error
    rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for
    machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.
    CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints,
    supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts
    of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface
    with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements
    such as multicast support, very low overhead and simplicity for constrained environments.</p>"
