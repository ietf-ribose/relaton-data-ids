abstract:
  content: "<p>IP mutli-function Media Server control is a problem that has slowlybubbled
    up in importance over the past four years. A driver in theIETF is the requirements
    generated by the XCON framework. Manyapproaches have been proposed. Some of these
    proposals are device-controlled-oriented, such as H.248. Others are server-oriented,using
    SIP and application-oriented markup. Before rushing headlonginto a framework for
    a solution, it is time to step back and try tounderstand just what the scope of
    the problem is. Once consensus isreached, we can then move forward with a framework
    for a solution.This document describes a number of existing approaches and proposalsto
    solve the Application Server - Media Server protocol problem,their characteristics
    and benefits and drawbacks.</p>"
