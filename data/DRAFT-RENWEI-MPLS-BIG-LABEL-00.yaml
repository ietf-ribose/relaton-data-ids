abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies encoding and encapsulation methods
    for MPLS\n   big labels.  Big labels are required for accessing virtual networks\n
    \  in data centers by using, for example, BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  Data center\n   virtualization
    encapsulation methods and protocols such as VXLAN,\n   NVGRE and NVO3 are being
    standardized to support a few millions of\n   virtual networks, but the currently
    label format can support up to\n   one million of labels.  When the BGP/MPLS IP
    VPN method, for example,\n   is used by an enterprise/customer to access its corresponding
    virtual\n   networks, more than one million of labels are required to map VPN\n
    \  labels and Virtual Network Identifiers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
