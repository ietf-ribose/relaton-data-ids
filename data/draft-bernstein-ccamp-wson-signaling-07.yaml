abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
    (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched optical networks (WSON).
    Such extensions are necessary in WSONs under a number of conditions including:
    (a) when optional processing, such as regeneration, must be configured to occur
    at specific nodes along a path, (b) where equipment must be configured to accept
    an optical signal with specific attributes, or (c) where equipment must be configured
    to output an optical signal with specific attributes. In addition this memo provides
    mechanisms to support distributed wavelength assignment with bidirectional LSPs,
    and choice in distributed wavelength assignment algorithms. These extensions build
    on previous work for the control of lambda and G.709 based networks.</p>"
