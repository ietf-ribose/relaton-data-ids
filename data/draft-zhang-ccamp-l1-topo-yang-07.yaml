abstract:
- content: "<p>A transport network is a server-layer network designed to provide connectivity
    services for a client-layer network to carry the client traffic transparently
    across the server-layer network resources. A transport network can be constructed
    from equipments utilizing any of a number of different transport technologies
    such as the evolving Optical Transport Networks (OTN) or packet transport as provided
    by the MPLS-Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). This draft describes a YANG data model
    to describe the topologies of an Optical Transport Network (OTN). It is independent
    of control plane protocols and captures topological and resource related information
    pertaining to OTN. This model enables clients, which interact with a transport
    domain controller via a REST interface, for OTN topology related operations such
    as obtaining the relevant topology resource information.</p>"
