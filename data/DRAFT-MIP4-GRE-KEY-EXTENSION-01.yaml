abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The GRE specification contains a Key field, which MAY contain
    a value\nthat is used to identify a particular GRE data stream.  This\nspecification
    defines a new Mobile IP extension that is used to\nexchange the value to be used
    in the GRE Key field.  This extension\nfurther allows the Mobility Agents to setup
    the necessary protocol\ninterfaces prior to receiving the mobile's traffic.  The
    new\nextension option allows a foreign agent to request GRE tunneling\nwithout
    disturbing the Home Agent behavior specified for Mobile Ipv4.\nGRE tunneling provides
    an advantage that allows operator's private\nhome networks to be overlaid and
    allows the HA to provide overlapping\nhome addresses to different subscribers.
    \ When the tuple &lt; Care of\nAddress, Home Address and Home Agent Address &gt;
    is the same across\nmultiple subscriber sessions, GRE tunneling will provide a
    means for\nthe FA and HA to identify data streams for the individual sessions\nbased
    on the GRE key.  In the absence of this key identifier, the\ndata streams cannot
    be distinguished from each other, a significant\ndrawback when using IP-in-IP
    tunneling.\n\t </p>\n      "
