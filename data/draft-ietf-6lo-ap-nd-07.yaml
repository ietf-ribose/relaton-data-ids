abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery (ND)
    [RFC6775] [I-D.ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update] called Address Protected ND (AP-ND); AP-ND
    protects the owner of an address against address theft and impersonation inside
    a low-power and lossy network (LLN). Nodes supporting this extension compute a
    cryptographic Owner Unique Interface ID and associate it with one or more of their
    Registered Addresses. The Cryptographic ID identifies the owner of the Registered
    Address and can be used for proof-of-ownership. It is used in 6LoWPAN ND in place
    of the EUI-64-based unique ID that is associated with the registration. Once an
    address is registered with a Cryptographic ID, only the owner of that ID can modify
    the registration information of the Registered Address, and Source Address Validation
    can be enforced.</p>"
