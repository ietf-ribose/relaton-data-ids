abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The application specific routing requirements for Urban Low Power
    and\nLossy Networks (U-L2Ns) are presented in this document. In the near\nfuture,
    sensing and actuating nodes will be placed outdoors in urban\nenvironments so
    as to improve the citizens' living conditions as well\nas to monitor compliance
    with increasingly strict environmental laws.\nThese field nodes are expected to
    measure and report a wide gamut of\ndata, such as required in smart metering,
    waste disposal,\nmeteorological, pollution and allergy reporting applications.
    The\nmajority of these nodes is expected to communicate wirelessly which\n- given
    the limited radio range - requires the use of suitable\nmulti-hop routing protocols.
    The design of such protocols will be\nmainly impacted by the limited resources
    of the nodes (memory,\nprocessing power, battery, etc) and the particularities
    of the\noutdoors urban application scenario. As such, for a wireless RL2N\nsolution
    to be competitive with other incumbent and emerging\nsolutions, the protocol ought
    to be energy-efficient, scalable and\nautonomous. This documents aims to specify
    a set of requirements\nreflecting these and further U-L2Ns tailored characteristics.\n\t
