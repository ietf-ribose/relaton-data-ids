abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a methodology for evaluating the ability
    of\n   content-aware network devices to correctly detect and block malicious\n
    \  or administratively disallowed traffic flows. This benchmark\n   addresses
    the issue of classification accuracy under well defined\n   conditions. It is
    not concerned with measuring forwarding performance\n   which is covered by other
    BMWG documents.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
