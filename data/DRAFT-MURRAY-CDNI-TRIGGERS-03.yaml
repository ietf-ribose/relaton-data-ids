abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the part of the CDN Interconnect Control\n
    \  Interface that allows a CDN to trigger activity in an interconnected\n   CDN
    that is configured to deliver content on its behalf.  The\n   upstream CDN can
    use this mechanism to request that the downstream\n   CDN pre-positions metadata
    or content, or that it re-validate or\n   purge metadata or content.  The upstream
    CDN can monitor the status\n   of activity that it has triggered in the downstream
    CDN.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
