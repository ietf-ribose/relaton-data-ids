- content: "<p>The use of network firewalls, systems that effectively isolate an organizations
    internal network structure from an exterior network, such as the INTERNET is becoming
    increasingly popular. These firewall systems typically act as application-layer
    gateways between networks, usually offering controlled TELNET, FTP, and SMTP access.</p>"
