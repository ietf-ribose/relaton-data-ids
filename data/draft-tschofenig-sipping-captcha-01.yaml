abstract:
  content: <p>A common approach to deal with unwanted communication attempts is torely
    on some form of authorization policies, typically whitelists.In order to populate
    the entries in such an access control list it ishelpful to have a way to challenge
    the entity willing to engage in aconversation (unless they are already pre-authorized).
    One reasonwhy this is desired is to deal with robots that are aggressivelydistributing
    messages.This document describes how "Completely Automated Public Turing Testto
    Tell Computers and Humans Apart" (CAPTCHA) tests, which requirehuman interaction,
    are applied to SIP.</p>
