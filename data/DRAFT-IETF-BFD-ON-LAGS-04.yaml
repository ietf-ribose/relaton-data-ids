abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a mechanism to run Bidirectional Forwarding
    Detection (BFD) on Link Aggregation Group (LAG) interfaces. It does so by running
    an independent Asynchronous mode BFD session on every LAG member link.\n\n This
    mechanism allows the verification of member link continuity, either in combination
    with, or in absence of, Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). It provides
    a shorter detection time than what LACP offers. The continuity check can also
    cover elements of Layer 3 (L3) bidirectional forwarding.\n\t </p>\n      "
