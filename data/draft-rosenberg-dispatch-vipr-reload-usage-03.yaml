abstract:
- content: <p>Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a technique for inter-domain
    SIP federation. ViPR makes use of the RELOAD protocol to store unverified mappings
    from phone numbers to RELOAD nodes, with whom a validation process can be run.
    This document defines the usage of RELOAD for this purpose. Legal This documents
    and the information contained therein are provided on an "AS IS" basis and THE
