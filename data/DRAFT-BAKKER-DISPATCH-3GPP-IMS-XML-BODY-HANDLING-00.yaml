abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document registers new disposition-types for the Content-\n
    \  Disposition header field that apply to the application/3gpp-ims+xml\n   body
    (part) used by 3GPP [5].  The applicability of these content-\n   disposition
    values are limited to 3GPP IMS [5].  The application/\n   3gpp-ims+xml body (part)
    has the following three distinct uses: (1)\n   for redirecting the emergency session
    to use a different domain (e.g.\n   using a Circuit Switched call), (2) for delivering
    user profile\n   specific information from the SIP registrar to an Application
    Server,\n   and (3) for causing a UAC to attempt to re-register with the IMS.\n\n\t
