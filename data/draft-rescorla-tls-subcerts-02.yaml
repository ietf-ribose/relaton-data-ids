abstract:
- content: "<p>The organizational separation between the operator of a TLS server
    and the certificate authority that provides it credentials can cause problems,
    for example when it comes to reducing the lifetime of certificates or supporting
    new cryptographic algorithms. This document describes a mechanism to allow TLS
    server operators to create their own credential delegations without breaking compatibility
    with clients that do not support this specification.</p>"
