abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the 120 (Rated) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    response code. This response code enables calling parties to learn an intermediary
    rated their call attempt. Depending on rating (e.g. Scam), the call may go unanswered.
    Through a 1xx code, the caller's network may become aware future attempts to contact
    the same User Agent Server (UAS) will likely go unanswered. The initial use case
    driving the need for a 120 response code is when the intermediary is an analytics
    engine. Code 120 (Rated) contrasts with 607 (Unwanted) &amp; 608 (Rejected) SIP
    response codes in which a human at target UAS, or terminating network analytics,
    indicate the call may not completed. This document also defines use of a Call-Info
    header field in 120 (Rated) responses to enable negatively rated callers to contact
    entities that rated their calls in error. This provides a remediation mechanism
    for legal callers who find their calls going unanswered (not necessarily blocked).</p>"
