abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Border Router Discovery Protocol
    (BRDP)\n   and all of its related components.  BRDP enables multi-homing for\n
    \  small to medium sites, including Homenets, using Provider\n   Aggregatable
    IPv6 addresses.  It describes a mechanism for automated\n   IP address configuration
    and renumbering, a mechanism for optimized\n   source address selection and a
    new paradigm for packet forwarding,\n   for support of multi-homed sites.  BRDP
    prevents ingress filtering\n   problems with multi-homed sites and supports load-balancing
    for\n   multi-path transport protocols.  This work also prevents routing\n   scalability
    problems in the provider network and Internet Default\n   Free Zone because small
    to medium multi-homed size sites would not\n   need to request Provider Independent
    address blocks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
