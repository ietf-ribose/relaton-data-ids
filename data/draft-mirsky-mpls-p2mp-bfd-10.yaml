abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes procedures for using Bidirectional Forwarding
    Detection (BFD) for multipoint networks to detect data plane failures in Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) point-to-multipoint (p2mp) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
    using active tails with unsolicited notifications mode. It also describes the
    applicability of LSP Ping, as in-band, and the control plane, as out-band, solutions
    to bootstrap a BFD session in this environment.</p>"
