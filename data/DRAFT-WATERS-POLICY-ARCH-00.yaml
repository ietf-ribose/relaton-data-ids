abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document articulates the requirements and basic components
    of a\n   policy-based management architecture.  It focuses on the storage and\n
    \  retrieval of policy rules from a directory-based repository, for use\n   in
    the management of network devices.  The architecture is described\n   in terms
    of its functional components and operational characteristics.\n   It is intended
    to be device and vendor independent, interoperable and\n   scalable.\n \n   There
    are three basic sections of this draft, addressing:\n \n   o the motivation for
    policy-based management that briefly describes\n     the requirements for a policy
    framework architecture;\n \n   o a reference model that defines a first-level
    functional\n     decomposition and captures the key concepts in defining policy\n
    \    tools, policy rules, the use of a repository and schema, and the\n     mechanisms
    underlying the definition, storage and retrieval of\n     policies; and\n \n   o
    an architecture that describes each of the functional components,\n     and includes
    a narrative about how the architecture will execute.\n\t </p>\n      "
