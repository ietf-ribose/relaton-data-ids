abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Virtual machine migration is a critical requirement in today's
    data\n   centers to support services dynamically deployed in distributed\n   infrastructures.
    \ To keep the uniform environment required by\n   application software, large
    number of networking based solutions have\n   been presented to provide data center
    interconnection for virtual\n   resource management.  Aiming at simplifying networking
    complexities\n   in off-site service deployment, this document presents a framework\n
    \  based on content delivery network for supporting virtual machine\n   migration
    over the legacy wide area network.\n\t </p>\n      "
