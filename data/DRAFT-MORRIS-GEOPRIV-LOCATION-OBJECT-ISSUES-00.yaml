abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses three major questions that were posed
    and\ndiscussed at some length at the interim meeting in San Diego, June\n2002:\n(1)
    Should geopriv facilitate the misrepresentation of location\ninformation?\n(2)
    Should the geopriv Location Object (LO) accommodate multiple\nlocations as part
    of a single positioning transaction?\n(3) If so, should the Location Object hold
    multiple locations in a\nsingle object, or should the multiple locations be contained
    in\nmultiple objects?\nIn this paper we propose an answer to those questions.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
