abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an abstract syntax and semantic of HTTP cookies.
    This approach presents a new cookie attribute that ensures cookie integrity and
    improves source authentication of the cookie sent back to the server. Cookies
    are always used on the Web in order to store user identification data and sensible
    user information. Adversary can easily modify cookiesstored in the User Agent.
    Therefore, Origin Server has to be able to verify cookie integrity and ensure
    that the returned cookies are its own cookies. This document explains a way to
    calculate and apply the integrity attribute in HTTP cookie headers.</p>"
