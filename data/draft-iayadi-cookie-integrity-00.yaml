    improves source authentication of the cookiesent back to the server.Cookies are
    always used on the Web in order to store user identification data and sensible
    user information. Adversary caneasily modify cookiesstored in the User Agent.
    Therefore, OriginServer has to be able to verify cookie integrity and ensure thatthe
    returned cookies are its own cookies.This document explains a way to calculate
    and apply the integrityattribute in HTTP cookie headers.</p>"
