abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note describes mechanisms for address selection in hosts
    within\n   a multihomed site.  The goal of these mechanisms is to allow hosts\n
    \  within the multihomed site to establish new communications after an\n   outage.
    \ The presented mechanisms are not by themselves a complete\n   multihoming solution
    but rather a component of such solution.\n\t </p>\n      "
