abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The memo has proposed a bi-directional option, along with which
    PCPcould not only control PCP client pinhole, but also could manage portmapping
    status for communicating remote peers. The bi-directionalport control mode will
    eliminate risks of connections interruptioncaused by remote peer pinhole timeout.</p>"
