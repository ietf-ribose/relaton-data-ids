abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft specifies some new PDU operations intended to optimize\nSNMP
    requests for performance.\nThis draft is not a complete specification, but merely
    is intended\nto illustrate concepts which can then be discussed within the EoS\nworking
    group.  A complete specification will be completed after the\nagreed features
    and packet structure is fairly well solidified so\nthe author doesn't have to
    rewrite large portions of stuff ;-).\nThere are no error handling codes or elements
    of procedures defined\nyet.  The concepts, however, have been thought out about
    a lot.\nFeedback on what you see within would be greatly appreciated at this\npoint.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
