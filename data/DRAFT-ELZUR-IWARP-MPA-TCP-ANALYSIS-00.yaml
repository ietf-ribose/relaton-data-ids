abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Further explanation and analysis of architectural recommendations
    \ncontained in the recent Internet-Draft, Marker PDU Aligned Framing \nfor TCP
    Specification [MPA], is provided.  The impact of the \nfollowing three attributes
    of MPA over TCP is examined:  \n*  packing of multiple DDP ULPDUs into one TCP
    segment;  \n*  simplifying the receiver due to transmitter alignment of DDP \nheaders
    with TCP headers; and  \n*  mistakenly attempting to interoperate an MPA-enabled
    endpoint \nwith a non-MPA-enabled endpoint. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
