abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service Function Chain(SFC) is a ordered set of service functions.\n
    \  Packets flow restrictively at the service functions according to the\n   order.
    \ To enable a network service, operator composes the service\n   function chain
    logically.  Though SFC is efficient where network/\n   service requirements are
    dynamically changing, the reliability of SFC\n   should be guaranteed.  This memo
    describes the considerations for\n   benchmarking SFC reliability.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
