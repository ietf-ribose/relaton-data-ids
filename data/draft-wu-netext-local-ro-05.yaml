abstract:
  content: "<p>This document extends local routing in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) anddefines
    a localized routing optimization protocol between MobilityAccess Gateways within
    a single provider domain. The protocolsupports operation over IPv4 transport networks,
    IPv4 home addressmobility and handover. The Local mobility anchor initiated andmobile
    access gateway initiated local routing are allowed to setuplocal routing path
    between the mobile and correspondent node bysending messages to the corresponding
    mobile access gateway or localmobility anchor. If the MN &amp; CN are anchored
    with two different LMAsthen the MN-LMA must discover which LMA the CN is registered
    withbefore an optimized local routing path can be established. MobileAccess Gateways
    create and refresh bindings using proxy bindingupdate and acknowledgement messages.</p>"
