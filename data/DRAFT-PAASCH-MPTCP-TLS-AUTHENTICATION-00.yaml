abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath TCP (MPTCP), described in [4], is an extension to
    TCP to\n   provide the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between\n
    \  peers.\n\n   draft-paasch-mptcp-application-authentication specifies \"application\n
    \  layer authentication\" for Multipath TCP, an alternatively negotiated\n   keying
    mechanism for MPTCP.  This allows keying material to be\n   sourced from an application
    layer protocol in order to secure MP_JOIN\n   handshakes.\n\n   This document
    explains how to use the proposed application-layer\n   authentication extension
    with TLS [6], in order to leverage securely\n   exchanged keys for MPTCP security,
    whilst simultaneously freeing the\n   MPTCP token to be used as a channel for
    additional information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
