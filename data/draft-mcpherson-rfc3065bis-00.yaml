abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-autonomous systemrouting
    protocol designed for Transmission Control Protocol/InternetProtocol (TCP/IP)
    networks. BGP requires that all BGP speakerswithin a single autonomous system
    (AS) must be fully meshed. Thisrepresents a serious scaling problem that has been
    well documented ina number of proposals.This document describes an extension to
    BGP which may be used tocreate a confederation of autonomous systems that is represented
    as asingle autonomous system to BGP peers external to the confederation,thereby
    removing the 'full mesh' requirement. The intention of thisextension is to aid
    in policy administration and reduce themanagement complexity of maintaining a
    large autonomous system.</p>"
