abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification designs an architecture that aims at load
    \n   balancing flows along multiple routes according to a measure of their \n
    \  average traffic loads.   \n   This architecture supports such a service due
    to the operation in a \n   closed loop of an enhanced routing control plane with
    an enhanced \n   forwarding plane. \n   Basically, this routing paradigm allows
    a second dynamic metric \n   called load to be taken into account when calculating
    new routes and \n   when forwarding the flows along the routes.  \n\t </p>\n      "
