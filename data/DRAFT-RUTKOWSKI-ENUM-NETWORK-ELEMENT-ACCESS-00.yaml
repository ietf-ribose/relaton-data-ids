abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>ENUM is an Internet information service for the benefit\nof private
    users of the Internet.  It makes use of\nauthoritative E.164 telephone number
    data maintained\namong public telecommunication service providers to\nenable some
    useful value added messaging services on\nthe Internet.  Anyone can (and several
    companies do)\nprovide these ENUM services competitively today without\ngovernment
    involvement or regulation.  Other providers\ncan enter the marketplace.\nAlthough
    one ENUM provisioning option is to denominate\na particular Internet offering
    worldwide as 'public'\nand 'authoritative,' there are significant technical,\noperational,
    and regulatory burdens and costs created\nthat make the prospect rather daunting
    at best.  It is\nalso unnecessary.  A more effective alternative is to\nfacilitate
    ENUM service providers' access to authoritative \nE.164 number and customer information
    through fair and \nnon-discriminatory contractual arrangements with public \ntelecommunication
    service providers, and leave the rest \nto a competitive ENUM provider marketplace
    and the \ncommercial relationships between Internet Service \nProviders and public
    telecommunication carriers.\n\t </p>\n      "
