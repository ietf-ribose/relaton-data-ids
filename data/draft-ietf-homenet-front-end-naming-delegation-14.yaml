abstract:
- content: "<p>Home owners often have IPv6 devices that they wish to access over the
    Internet using names. It has been possible to register and populate a DNS Zone
    with names since DNS became a thing, but it has been an activity typically reserved
    for experts. This document automates the process through creation of a Homenet
    Naming Authority (HNA), whose responsibility is to select, sign and publish names
    to a set of publicly visible servers. The use of an outsourced primary DNS server
    deals with possible renumbering of the home network, and with possible denial
    of service attacks against the DNS infrastructure. This document describes the
    mechanism that enables the HNA to outsource the naming service to the DNS Outsourcing
    Infrastructure (DOI) via a Distribution Master (DM). In addition, this document
    deals with publication of a corresponding reverse zone.</p>"
