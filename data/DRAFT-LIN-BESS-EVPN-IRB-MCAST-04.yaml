abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides a service that allows a single
    Local\n   Area Network (LAN), i.e., a single IP subnet, to be distributed over\n
    \  multiple sites.  The sites are interconnected by an IP or MPLS\n   backbone.
    \ Intra-subnet traffic (either unicast or multicast) always\n   appears to the
    endusers to be bridged, even when it is actually\n   carried over the IP backbone.
    \ When a single \"tenant\" owns multiple\n   such LANs, EVPN also allows IP unicast
    traffic to be routed between\n   those LANs.  This document specifies new procedures
    that allow inter-\n   subnet IP multicast traffic to be routed among the LANs
    of a given\n   tenant, while still making intra-subnet IP multicast traffic appear\n
    \  to be bridged.  These procedures can provide optimal routing of the\n   inter-subnet
    multicast traffic, and do not require any such traffic\n   to leave a given router
    and then reenter that same router.  These\n   procedures also accommodate IP multicast
    traffic that needs to travel\n   to or from systems that are outside the EVPN
    domain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
