abstract:
  content: "\t <t>RFC 2119 defines words that are used in IETF standards documents
    toindicate standards compliance. These words are fine for defining newprotocols,
    but there are certain deficiencies in using them when itcomes to protocol maintainability.
    Protocols are maintained byeither updating the core specifications or via changes
    in protocolregistries.For example, security functionality in protocols often relies
    uponcryptographic algorithms that are defined in external documents.Cryptographic
    algorithms have a limited life span, and new algorithmsregularly phased in to
    replace older algorithms.This document proposes standard terms to use in protocol
    registriesand possibly in standards track and informational documents toindicate
    the life cycle support of protocol features and operations.</p>"
