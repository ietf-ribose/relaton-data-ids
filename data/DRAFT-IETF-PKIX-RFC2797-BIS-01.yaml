abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a Certificate Management protocol using
    CMS\n(CMC).  This protocol addresses two immediate needs within the\nInternet
    PKI community:\n1. The need for an interface to public key certification products\nand
    \   services based on [CMS] and [PKCS10], and\n2. The need in [SMIMEV3] for a
    certificate enrollment protocol for\nDSA-signed certificates with Diffie-Hellman
    public keys.\n\n   A small number of additional services are defined to supplement
    the\n   core certificate request service.\n\t </p>\n      "
