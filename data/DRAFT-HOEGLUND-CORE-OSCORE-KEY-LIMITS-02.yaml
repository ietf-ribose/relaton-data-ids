abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)
    uses\n   AEAD algorithms to ensure confidentiality and integrity of exchanged\n
    \  messages.  Due to known issues allowing forgery attacks against AEAD\n   algorithms,
    limits should be followed on the number of times a\n   specific key is used for
    encryption or decryption.  This document\n   defines how two OSCORE peers must
    follow these limits and what steps\n   they must take to preserve the security
    of their communications.\n   Therefore, this document updates RFC8613.  Furthermore,
    this document\n   specifies Key Update for OSCORE (KUDOS), a lightweight procedure
    that\n   two peers can use to update their keying material and establish a new\n
    \  OSCORE Security Context.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
