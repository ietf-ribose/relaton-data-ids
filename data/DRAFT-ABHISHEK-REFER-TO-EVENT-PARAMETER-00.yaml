abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends the REFER method, defined in RFC 3515,
    to\n   convey feature parameters defined in RFC 3840.\n\n\nTerminology\n\n   In
    this document, the key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",\n   \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",\n   and \"OPTIONAL\"
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].\n   To simplify discussions
    of the REFER method and its extensions, three\n   new terms are used throughout
    the document:\n\n    - REFER-Issuer: the UA issuing the REFER request\n    - REFER-Recipient:
    the UA receiving the REFER request\n    - REFER-Target: the UA designated in the
    Refer-To URI\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n   This document extends the SIP REFER method
    defined in RFC 3515\n   to be used with feature parameters defined in RFC 3840.\n\n
    \  Feature tags are used by a UA to convey to another UA information\n   about
    capabilities and features. This information can be shared by a\n   UA using a
    number of mechanisms, including OPTIONS responses.\n\n   Feature tag information
    can be very useful to another UA. It is\n   especially useful prior to the establishment
    of a subscription,\n   triggered only through REFER method. This is valid only
    for the request\n   containing parameter \"method=SUBSCRIBE\" in Refer-To header.
    While\n   sending this request if there is no mechanism to indicate as to which\n
    \  event is to be subscribed, the REFER-Recipient may send SUBSCRIBE with\n   an
    undesired event. For example, if a REFER-Issuer knows (through an\n   OPTIONS
    query, for example) that the remote REFER-Target supports\n   events like dialog
    the REFER-Recipient might subscribe with dialog\n   or any other event as specified.\n\n
    \  This extension to the REFER method provides a mechanism by which the\n   REFER-Issuer
    can provide this useful information about the REFER-Target\n   capabilities and
    functionality to the REFER-Recipient by\n   including feature tags in the Refer-To
    header field in a REFER\n   request.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\t </p>\n      "
