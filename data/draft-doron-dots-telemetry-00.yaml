abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims to enrich DOTS Signaling with various telemetry
    attributes allowing optimal DDoS/DoS attack mitigation. The nature of the DOTS
    architecture is to allow DOTS Agents to be integrated in highly diverse environments.
    Therefore, the DOTS architecture imposes a significant challenge in delivering
    optimal mitigation services. The DOTS Telemetry covered in this document aims
    to provide all needed attributes and feedback signaled from DOTS Agents such that
    optimal mitigation services can be delivered based on DOTS Signaling.</p>"
