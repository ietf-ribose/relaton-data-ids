abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document defines a mechanism that allows communication
    of DNS\n   resolver information to DNS clients for use in server selection\n   decisions.
    \ In particular, the document defines a mechanism for a DNS\n   server to communicate
    its filtering policy and privacy statement URL\n   to DNS clients.  This information
    is cryptographically signed to\n   attest its authenticity.  Such information
    is used for the selection\n   of DNS resolvers.  Typically, evaluating the DNS
    privacy statement,\n   filtering policy, and the signatory, DNS clients with minimum
    human\n   intervention can select the DNS server that best supports the user's\n
    \  desired privacy and filtering policy.\n\n   This assertion is useful for encrypted
    DNS (e.g., DNS-over-TLS and\n   DNS-over-HTTPS) servers that are either public
    resolvers or are\n   discovered in a local network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
