abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is
    a data\n   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small\n
    \  code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the\n   need
    for version negotiation.\n\n   Useful tags and techniques have emerged since the
    publication of RFC\n   7049; the present document makes use of CBOR's built-in
    major types\n   to define and refine several useful constructs, without changing
    the\n   wire protocol.  This document adds object identifiers (OIDs) to CBOR\n
    \  with CBOR tags &lt;&lt;O&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;R&gt;&gt; [values TBD].  It is
    intended as the\n   reference document for the IANA registration of the CBOR tags
    so\n   defined.  Useful techniques for enumerations and sets are presented\n   (without
    new tags).  As the documentation for binary UUIDs (tag 37),\n   MIME entities
    (tag 36) and regular expressions (tag 35) RFC 7049 left\n   much out, this document
    provides more comprehensive specifications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
