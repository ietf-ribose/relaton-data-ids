abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of strategies to allow clients to submit
    new email messages incorporating content which resides on locations external to
    the client. This is the so-called 'IMAP Pull' approach currently being considered
    by the LEMONADE working group as one solution to the 'forward without download'
    problem (that is, as a means for clients to send new messages consisting of or
    containing all or parts of previously received messages without having to download
    and upload the data). Some of the strategies in this document rely upon extensions
    to other protocols; specifically URLAUTH and CATENATE in the IMAP protocol (RFC
    3501) and BURL in the SUBMIT protocol (RFC 2476).</p>"
