abstract:
- content: "<p>The Kerberos 5 network authentication protocol, originally specified
    in RFC 1510, can use the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for encryption. Almost
    30 years after first publishing DES, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) finally withdrew the standard in 2005, reflecting a long-established consensus
    that DES is insufficiently secure. By 2008, commercial hardware costing less than
    USD 15,000 could break DES keys in less than a day on average. DES is long past
    its sell-by date. Accordingly, this document updates RFC 1964, RFC 4120, RFC 4121,
    and RFC 4757 to deprecate the use of DES, RC4-HMAC-EXP, and other weak cryptographic
    algorithms in Kerberos. Because RFC 1510 (obsoleted by RFC 4120) supports only
    DES, this document recommends the reclassification of RFC 1510 as Historic. This
    memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.</p>"
