abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MPLS Segment Routing (SR-MPLS) is an MPLS data plane-based
    source\n   routing paradigm in which the sender of a packet is allowed to\n   partially
    or completely specify the route the packet takes through\n   the network by imposing
    stacked MPLS labels on the packet.  SR-MPLS\n   can be leveraged to realize a
    source routing mechanism across MPLS,\n   IPv4, and IPv6 data planes by using
    an MPLS label stack as a source\n   routing instruction set while making no changes
    to SR-MPLS\n   specifications and interworking with SR-MPLS implementations.\n\n
    \  This document describes how SR-MPLS capable routers and IP-only\n   routers
    can seamlessly co-exist and interoperate through the use of\n   SR-MPLS label
    stacks and IP encapsulation/tunneling such as MPLS-in-\n   UDP as defined in RFC
    7510.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
