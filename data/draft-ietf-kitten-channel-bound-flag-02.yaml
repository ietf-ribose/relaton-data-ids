abstract:
- content: '<p>Channel binding is a technique that allows applications to use a secure
    channel at a lower layer without having to use authentication at that lower layer.
    The concept of channel binding comes from the Generic Security Services Application
    Programming Interface (GSS- API). It turns out that the semantics commonly implemented
    are different than those specified in the base GSS-API RFC (RFC2743), and that
    that specification has a serious bug. This document addresses both the inconsistency
    as-implemented and the specification bug. This Internet-Draft proposes the addition
    of a "channel bound" return flag for the GSS_Init_sec_context() and GSS_Accept_sec_context()
    functions. Two behaviors are specified: a default, safe behavior reflecting existing
    implementation deployments, and a behavior that is only safe when the application
    specifically tells the GSS-API that it (the application) supports the new behavior.
    Additional API elements related to this are also added, including a new security
    context establishment API.</p>'
