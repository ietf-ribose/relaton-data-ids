abstract:
  content: "<p>Session recording is a critical requirement in many communicationsenvironments
    such as call centers and financial trading. In some ofthese environments, all
    calls must be recorded for regulatory,compliance, and consumer protection reasons.
    Recording of a sessionis typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream
    to arecording device. This document describes architectures fordeploying session
    recording solutions in an environment which isbased on the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP). This is an initialdraft which explores possible architectural
    solutions and has manyopen issues.</p>"
