abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes IP packet transmission over IEEE 802.16 network
    to access Internet with PMP mode based IP CS. IP CS is a payload of IPv4 packet
    and IPv6 packet over IEEE 802.16 frame. This draft introduces host based packet
    delivery mechanism that can be classified layer 2 forwarding and IP tunnel based
    on public service and trial on IEEE 802.16 network. It describes HBPD on IEEE
    802.16, requirements of the network elements and how to control IP CS on the IEEE
    802.16.</p>"
