abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Sieve scripts allow users to filter incoming email.  Message stores\nare
    commonly sealed servers so users cannot log into them, yet users\nmust be able
    to update their scripts on them.  This document\ndescribes a protocol \"ManageSieve\"
    for securely managing Sieve\nscripts on a remote server.  This protocol allows
    a user to have\nmultiple scripts, and also alerts a user to syntactically flawed\nscripts.\n\t
