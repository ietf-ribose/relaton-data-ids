abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Over time, the document series associated with the IETF has grownand
    changed. One such change is the increase in the use ofsecondary markers to identify
    when documents fit specificcategories and, especially, when they are or are not
    the productof specific IETF processes. The author believes that thesesecondary
    markers have largely failed but that the distinctionsthey were meant to draw remain
    valuable. A new set of categorylabels is proposed to re-emphasize these distinctions.
    The formalcategories proposed are Internet Note, Candidate Specification,Proposed
    IETF Standard, Confirmed IETF Standard, and ExternalInternet Engineering Document.
    These may be informally understoodas ideas which are unbaked, baking, baked, eaten,
    and boiled.</p>"
