abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a few scenarios where PW redundancy is\n\nneeded.
    A set of redundant PWs is configured between PE nodes in SS-\n\nPW applications,
    or between T-PE nodes in MS-PW applications. In\n\norder for the PE/T-PE nodes
    to indicate the preferred PW path to\n\nforward to one another, a new status bit
    is needed to indicate the\n\npreferential forwarding status of active or standby
    for each PW in\n\nthe redundancy set as defined in [7]. \n\nConventions used in
    this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].\n\t </p>\n
