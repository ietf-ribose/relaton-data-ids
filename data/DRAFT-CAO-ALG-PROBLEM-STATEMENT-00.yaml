abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Application Layer Gateway (ALG) has been widely implemented and
    used\nto support address and port translation in the payload for some well-\nknown
    protocols.  Due to the lackness of standardization on\naddressing ALG related
    issues, a number of serious problems are faced\nby service deployments and upgrades.
    \ This document specifies the\ncommon problems for ALG in various aspects.  In
    addition, some\ncollected feedbacks are also listed as the next steps to tackle
    these\nproblems.\n\t </p>\n      "
