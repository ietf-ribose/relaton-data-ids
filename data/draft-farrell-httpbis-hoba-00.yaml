abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo proposes a way of using origin-bound certificates for HTTP
    authentication, called HOBA. HOBA is an HTTP authentication method with credentials
    that are not vulnerable to simple phishing attacks, and that does not require
    a server-side password database, both major potential positives, if deployed.
    HOBA can be integrated with account management and other applications running
    over HTTP and supports portability, so a user can associate more than one device
    or origin-bound certificate with the same service. This also provides a mechanism
    to handle state-loss, if one of a user's credentials is lost. HOBA also provides
    a logout mechanism.</p>"
