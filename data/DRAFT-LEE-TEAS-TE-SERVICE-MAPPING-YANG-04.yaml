abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a YANG data model to map service model
    (e.g.,\n   L3SM) and Traffic Engineering model (e.g., TE Tunnel or ACTN VN\n   model).
    This model is referred to as TE service Mapping Model. This\n   model is applicable
    to the operation's need for a seamless control\n   and management of their VPN
    services with TE tunnel support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
