abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SAVI (Source Address Validation Improvement) is an excellent\n
    \  mechanism for anti-IP-spoofing, which was advocated by IETF but only\n   focused
    on single-stack or simple network scenarios right now. To the\n   best of our
    knowledge, existing studies have not paid attention to\n   the IPv4/IPv6 transition
    scenarios. However, since IPv4/IPv6\n   transition schemes are plenty and various,
    one solution cannot meet\n   all requirements of them. In this draft, we present
    a SAVI-based\n   general framework for IP source address validation and traceback
    in\n   the IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios, which achieve this by extracting\n
    \  out essential and mutual properties from these schemes, and forming\n   sub-solutions
    for each property. When one transition scheme is\n   composed from various properties,
    its IP source address validation\n   and traceback solution is directly comprised
    by the corresponding\n   sub-solutions. Thus, the most exciting advantage of this
    framework is\n   that it is a once-and-for-all solution no matter how transition\n
    \  schemes change. Till now, this proposal was approved by China\n   Communications
    Standards Association (CCSA), and we will actively\n   promote it to apply real
    network scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
