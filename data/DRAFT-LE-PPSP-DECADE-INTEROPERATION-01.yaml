abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   P2P Streaming has become popular application in the Internet.\n
    \  Currently, most home subscribers access Internet via ADSL, in which\n   downlink
    bandwidth and uplink bandwidth are not symmetric.  This\n   feature would influence
    the performance of P2P Streaming, and the\n   problem may be worse in mobile scenarios.
    \ This draft presents the\n   interoperation between PPSP protocol and DECADE
    protocol to provide\n   DECADE service for PPSP applications.  Typically, there
    are two\n   solution to achieve interoperation, loose interoperation among peers,\n
    \  and close interoperation via connection of peer and tracker.  By\n   introducing
    DECADE in both tracker protocol and peer protocol, PPSP\n   streaming can alleviate
    strength of upload bandwidth and improve\n   performance for fix and mobile scenario.\n\n\t
