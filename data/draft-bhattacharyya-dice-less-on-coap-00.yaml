abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents an experimental work proposing a lightweight secure
    session establishment scheme to mutually authenticate two endpoints and share
    the session key. It works on symmetric cryptosystem with pre-shared secret between
    the endpoints during provisioning. The main algorithm is proposed as a generic
    concept. This draft further describes how the generic concept can be modeled as
    simple CoAP request/response pairs. Thus the proposed scheme enables CoAP with
    inherent security which might be useful for object security without requiring
    any secure transport. Still further, this draft demonstrates how the scheme could
    be integrated with the record encryption mechanism of DTLS-PSK. It reuses the
    DTLS session parameter structure without any modification. Thus channel security
    for the whole application message can be provided. So the scheme is a cross-layer
    mechanism such that the session establishment is performed in CoAP and channel
    encryption is performed in the transport layer reusing only the record encryption
    mechanism of DTLS-PSK. The scheme uses all standard encryption libraries. The
    lightweight nature and performance improvement is demonstrated with some supporting
    comparative results.</p>"
