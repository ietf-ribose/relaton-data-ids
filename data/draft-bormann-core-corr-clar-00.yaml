abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 7252 defines the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), along
    with a number of additional specifications, including RFC 7641, RFC 7959, RFC
    8132, and RFC 8323. RFC 6690 defines the link format that is used in CoAP self-description
    documents. Some parts of the specification may be unclear or even contain errors
    that may lead to misinterpretations that may impair interoperability between different
    implementations. The present document provides corrections, additions, and clarifications
    to the RFCs cited; this document thus updates these RFCs. In addition, other clarifications
    related to the use of CoAP in other specifications, including RFC 7390 and RFC
    8075, are also provided.</p>"
