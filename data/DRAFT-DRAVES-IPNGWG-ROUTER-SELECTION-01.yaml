abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an optional extension to Neighbor Discovery
    \nRouter Advertisement messages for communicating default router \npreferences
    and more-specific routes from routers to hosts. This \nimproves the ability of
    hosts to pick an appropriate router, \nespecially when the host is multi-homed
    and the routers are on \ndifferent links. The preference values and specific routes
    \nadvertised to hosts require administrative configuration; they are \nnot automatically
    derived from routing tables.\n\t </p>\n      "
