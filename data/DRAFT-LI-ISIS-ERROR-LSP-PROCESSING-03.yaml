abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Recommendations for Interoperable Networks using Intermediate
    System\nto Intermediate System (IS-IS) [RFC3719] highlights a number of\ndifferences
    between the IS-IS protocol as described in ISO 10589 and\nthe protocol as it is
    deployed today.\n\nThis document outlines a number of differences found in the
    China\nMobile backbone network, which is constructed using routers from\nseveral
    manufacturers.  These differences include LSP checksum\ncalculation, zero checksum
    LSP processing, zero remaining lifetime\nLSP processing, and corrupt LSP processing.
    \ This document is\nintended to provide best current practices to facilitate\ninteroperability
    and maintain network stability.\n\t </p>\n      "
