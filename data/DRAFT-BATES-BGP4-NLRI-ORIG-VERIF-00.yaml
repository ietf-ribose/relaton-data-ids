abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes how a BGP speaker may verify that the
    Network\n   Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) of a prefix received from a\n
    \  peer is consistent with the allocation of IP address space as\n   determined
    by the Internet Registry system.  These verification\n   procedures rely on the
    DNS to provide a repository of information\n   about address space allocation
    provided by the Internet Registry\n   system.\n \n   Note that this is not a repository
    of announceable prefixes, but\n   rather of allocation of delegated address space.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
