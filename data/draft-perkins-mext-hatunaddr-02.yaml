abstract:
- content: "<p>Widely deployed mobility management systems for wireless communications
    have isolated the path for forwarding data from the control plane signaling for
    mobility management. To realize this requirement with Mobile IP requires that
    the control functions of the home agent be addressable at a different IP address
    than the source IP address of the tunnel between the home agent and mobile node.
    Similar considerations hold for mobility anchors implementing Hierarchical Mobile
    IP or PMIP.</p>"
