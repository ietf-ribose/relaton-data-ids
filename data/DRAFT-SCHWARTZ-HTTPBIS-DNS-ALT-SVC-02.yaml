abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The HTTP Alternative Services (Alt-Svc) mechanism allows an
    HTTP\n   origin to be served from multiple network endpoints, and over\n   multiple
    protocols.  However, the client must first contact the\n   origin server, in order
    to learn of the alternative services.  This\n   draft proposes a straightforward
    mapping of Alt-Svc into DNS,\n   allowing clients to learn of these services before
    their first\n   contact with the origin.  This arrangement offers potential benefits\n
    \  to both performance and privacy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
