abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a simple, low-\noverhead,
    UDP-based protocol for use with resource-constrained IP\nnetworks and nodes.  CoAP
    defines a simple technique to individually\nretransmit lost messages, but has
    no other congestion control\nmechanisms.\n\nThis document motivates the need for
    additional congestion control\nmechanisms, and defines some simple strawman proposals.
    \ The goal is\nto encourage experimentation with these and other proposals, in
    order\nto determine which mechanisms are feasible to implement on resource-\nconstrained
    nodes and are effective in real deployments.\n\t </p>\n      "
