abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies additional information that can inserted
    in\n   IS-IS LSPs to convey link capabilities that may be useful in certain\n
    \  applications.  In particular, an IS may convey that zero or more of\n   its
    links are explicit marked and/or implicit U-turn recipient\n   capable, which
    may be described as capable of identifying traffic as\n   U-turn traffic and redirecting
    the traffic to a suitable alternate.\n   The immediate applicability for these
    two link capabilities is in\n   support of local protection, provided by a U-turn
    alternate, in the\n   event of a link and/or node failure while the IS-IS area
    is\n   reconverging onto a new topology.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
