abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a set of Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) \n   call control requirements that support communication with direct \n
    \  transcoding capability. Several solutions are addressed for \n   transcoding
    service. \n    \n   Direct transcoding requires two kinds of requirements: the
    service \n   requirement and call control requirement. Service requirement is
    no \n   constraint of codec adaptation and interoperability of models. Call \n
    \  control requirement is exchange of codec information and minimizing \n   of
    call set up delay. \n \n   The model might be applied to general-purpose services
    satisfying the \n   requirements of multimedia applications without an additional
    INVITE. \n\t </p>\n      "
