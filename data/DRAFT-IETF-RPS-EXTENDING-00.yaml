abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet Draft  describes guidelines for  extending the Routing
    \ Policy\nSpecification Language  (RPSL) [3,  4].    Our  experiences with  PRDB
    \ [2],\nRIPE-81 [6], and  RIPE-181 [5]  taught us  that RPSL had  to be  extensible.\nThese
    languages were not  extensible and each transition  to a new  language\nturned
    out to be quite  painful.  As a  result, extensibility was a  primary\ndesign
    goal for  RPSL. New  routing protocols  or new  features to  existing\nrouting
    protocols can be easily handled using RPSL's dictionary class.   New\nclasses
    or new attributes to the existing classes can also be added.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
