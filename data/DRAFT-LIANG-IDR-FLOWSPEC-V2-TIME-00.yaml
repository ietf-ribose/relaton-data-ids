abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP flow specification version 1 (RFC5575) describes the distribution\n
    \  of traffic filter policy (traffic filters and actions) which are\n   distributed
    via BGP to BGP peers to support the following 3\n   applications: (1) mitigation
    of Denial of Service (DoS), (2) traffic\n   filtering in BGP/MPLS VPNs, and (3)
    centralized traffic control for\n   networks with SDN or NFV controllers.  A BGP
    Flow Filter that\n   combines packet filter with time may provide an ability to
    for these\n   three applications to have a flow filter operate for only a specific\n
    \  time.  The traffic filtering and centralized traffic control\n   applications
    may require user-defined ordering of filters rather than\n   RFC5575's defined
    order.  BGP Flow Specification version 2016 allows\n   for user ordering of flow
    specifications.\n\n   This document proposes a new BGP Flow specification filter
    for BGP\n   Flow Specification 2.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
