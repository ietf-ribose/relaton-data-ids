abstract:
- content: "<p>OAuth enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to
    a protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an
    approval interaction, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access
    on its own behalf. This document defines how an application client uses credentials
    obtained via OAuth over the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) or
    the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) to access
    a protected resource at a resource serve. Thereby, it enables schemes defined
    within the OAuth framework for non-HTTP-based application protocols. Clients typically
    store the user's long term credential. This does, however, lead to significant
    security vulnerabilities, for example, when such a credential leaks. A significant
    benefit of OAuth for usage in those clients is that the password is replaced by
    a token. Tokens typically provided limited access rights and can be managed and
    revoked separately from the user's long-term credential (password).</p>"
