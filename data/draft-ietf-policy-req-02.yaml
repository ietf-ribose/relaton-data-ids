abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes why policy based management is interest- ing
    to people managing IT environments and what is needed to make policy management
    address those interests. Work to date is described, as well as usage cases demonstrating
    how policy-based management would actually work. The goal for this document is
    to provide a set of requirements for further development of standards for policy
    management sys- tems. There has already been work in the area of policy manage-
    ment and the work to date is described as well as additional areas to be defined.</p>"
