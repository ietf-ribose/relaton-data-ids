abstract:
- content: <p>When implementing signaling protocols such as GIMPS, implementors need
    a way to test the functionality and measure the performance of their own implementations.
    In this document, we try to provide a sketch for such a testing tool, a simple,
    stateless "Ping" NSLP, which works similar to ICMP Ping. This tool is able to
    traverse a path from a source to a destination along signaling aware network nodes
    and collect various data that could be useful for identifying each node it is
    passing.</p>
