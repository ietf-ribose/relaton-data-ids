abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a software defined networking (SDN)
    based\n   unified IPv6 transition framework.  This framework makes use of the\n
    \  flow-based packet forwarding technology, which can simplify the\n   implementation
    of both control plane and data plane operations of\n   transition mechanisms.
    \ The purpose of this work is to provide an\n   integrated and flexible framework
    to implement and deploy transition\n   mechanisms, such as MAP-E, Lightweight
    4over6, etc.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
