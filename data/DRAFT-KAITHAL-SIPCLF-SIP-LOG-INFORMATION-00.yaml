abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current mechanisms to debug issues in SIP network are not
    very\n   efficient.  It requires to enable debugging logs across different\n   devices,
    recreate the problem and then collect the logs.  The idea is\n   to provide a
    solution to automatically enable relevant logs (SIP\n   messages and any other
    debugging logs meaningful to SIP devices), and\n   also to indicate where the
    logs are to be collected or stored.  The\n   enabling of logs will happen at all
    the SIP devices(upstream or\n   downstream).  This will help to get the logs from
    all the SIP devices\n   in a Common logging format (CLF).  The solution extends
    SIP to\n   provide the infrastructure to enable logging for upstream and\n   downstream
    devices with each server deciding how much troubleshooting\n   information it
    wants to log - with freedom to simply ignore requests\n   if required.  This document
    specifies a new header called \"Log-Me\"\n   Header in all the SIP messages.\n\n\t
