abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A clear application of the SRv6 Network Programming model consists
    in\n   steering, in a stateless manner, packets through a Service Function\n   Chain
    (SFC).  Each Service Function (SF) is identified by a segment.\n   Each SF can
    enrich its operation thanks to metadata present in the\n   SRH.\n\n   This document
    describes a practical use-case where the SF is a\n   firewall and the metadata
    helps to drastically decrease the number of\n   rules that need to be maintained
    by the operation team.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
