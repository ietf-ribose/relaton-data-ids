abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p> Internet routing scalability has long been considered a serious\n
    \  problem.  Although many efforts have been devoted to address this\n   problem
    over the years, the IETF community as a whole is yet to\n   achieve a shared understanding
    on what is the best way forward.  In\n   this draft, we step up a level to re-examine
    the problem and the\n   ongoing efforts. we conclude that, to effectively solve
    the routing\n   scalability problem, we first need a clear understanding on how
    to\n   introduce solutions to the Internet which is a global scale deployed\n
    \  system.  In this draft we sketch out our reasoning on the need for an\n   evolutionary
    path towards scaling the global routing system, instead\n   of attempting to introduce
    a brand new design.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
