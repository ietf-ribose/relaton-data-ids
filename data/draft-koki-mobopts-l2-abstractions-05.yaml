abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft proposes unified L2 abstractions for L3-driven fasthandovers.
    For efficient network communication, it is vital for aprotocol layer to know or
    utilize other layer's information such as aform of L2 triggers. However, each
    protocol layer is basicallydesigned independently. Since each protocol layer is
    alsoimplemented independently in current operating systems, it is veryhard to
    exchange control information between protocol layers. Tosolve the problem, this
    draft defines nine kinds of L2 abstractionsin the form of \"primitive\" to achieve
    fast handovers in the networklayer. This mechanism is called \"L3-driven fast
    handovers\" becausethe network layer initiates L2 and L3 handovers by using the\"primitives\".</p>"
