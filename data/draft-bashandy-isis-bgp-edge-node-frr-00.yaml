abstract:
  content: <p>Consider a BGP free core scenario where traffic is tunneled betweenedge
    routers. Suppose the edge BGP speakers PE1, PE2,..., PEn knowabout a prefix P/m
    via the external routers CE1, CE2,..., CEm. Ifthe edge router PEi crashes or becomes
    totally disconnected from thecore, it desirable for a core router "P" that is
    carrying traffic tothe failed edge router PEi to immediately restore traffic by
    re-routing packets originally tunneled to PEi and destined to the prefixP/m to
    one of the other edge routers that advertised P/m, say PEj,until BGP re-converges.
    If the packets originally flowing to thefailed edge router PEi are labeled, then
    the repairing core router Prouter must swap the label advertised by the failed
    edge router PEifor the prefix P/m with the label advertised for the same prefix
    bythe edge router PEj before re-routing the packet through an LSPterminating PEj.
    The document proposes an extension to IS-IS protocolto inform core routers about
    the repair edge router PEj and, forlabeled packets, the label that needs to be
    pushed/swapped beforesending the packet into the tunnel terminating on PEj</p>
