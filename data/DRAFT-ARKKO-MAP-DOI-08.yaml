abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Mobile Application Part (MAP) protocol is a signaling protocol\nfor
    cellular networks. The MAP Security (MAPSEC) protocol provides\na secure way to
    transport MAP messages. To use MAPSEC, however,\nSecurity Associations (SAs) are
    needed. This document defines how\nsuch SAs can be created automatically. We use
    the Internet\nSecurity Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) as a\nframework
    for managing SAs and establishing keys. The framework\ncan be specialized to a
    particular task. Such a specialization is\ncalled a Domain of Interpretation (DOI),
    and this document defines\nthe MAPSEC DOI. This specialization is very similar
    to the\nInternet Key Exchange protocol and the ISAKMP specialization for\nIP Security,
    except that non-IP protocols are being negotiated.\n\t </p>\n      "
