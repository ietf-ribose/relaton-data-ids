abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document we introduce a new BGP capability termed \"Long-lived\n
    \  Graceful Restart Capability\" so that stale routes can be retained for\n   a
    longer time upon session failure.  A well-known BGP community\n   \"LLGR_STALE\"
    is introduced for marking stale routes retained for a\n   longer time.  A second
    well-known BGP community, \"NO_LLGR\", is\n   introduced to mark routes for which
    these procedures should not be\n   applied.  We also specify that such long-lived
    stale routes be\n   treated as the least-preferred, and their advertisements be
    limited\n   to BGP speakers that have advertised the new capability.  Use of this\n
    \  extension is not advisable in all cases, and we provide guidelines to\n   help
    determine if it is.\n\n   We update RFC 6368 by specifying that the LLGR_STALE
    community must\n   be propagated into, or out of, the path attributes exchanged
    between\n   PE and CE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
