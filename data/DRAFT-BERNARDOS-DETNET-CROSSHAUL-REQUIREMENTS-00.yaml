abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Future 5G networks will not make a clear distinction between\n
    \  fronthaul and backhaul transport networks, because varying portions\n   of
    radio access network functionality might be moved toward the\n   network as required
    for cost reduction and performance increase.\n   This will pose additional challenges
    on the transport network,\n   driving for a new design of integrated fronthaul
    and backhaul,\n   usually referred to as crosshaul.\n\n   This document present
    the crosshaul architecture framework being\n   developed by the EU 5G-Crosshaul
    project, as well as identifies\n   several key requirements for the transport
    network, with the goal of\n   fostering discussion at the DETNET WG.\n\n\t </p>\n
