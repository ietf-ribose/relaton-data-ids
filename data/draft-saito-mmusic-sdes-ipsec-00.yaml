abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, a method of exchanging IPsec key information based
    on security descriptions [sdesc] framework is defined. By making use of this method,
    it is possible to negotiate IPsec with the offer- answer model with SDP [RFC3264]
    in order to protect a media session. Necessary extensions to security descriptions
    are also defined.</p>"
