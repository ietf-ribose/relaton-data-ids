abstract:
  content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a certaincomputational
    and communication overhead with respect to the numberof round-trips required and
    the cryptographic operations involved.In remote access situations, the Extensible
    Authentication Protocol(EAP) is used for authentication, which adds several more
    round tripsand consequently latency.To re-establish security associations (SA)
    upon a failure recoverycondition is time consuming, especially when an IPsec peer,
    such as aVPN gateway, needs to re-establish a large number of SAs with variousend
    points. A high number of concurrent sessions might causeadditional problems for
    an IPsec peer during SA re-establishment.In order to avoid the need to re-run
    the key exchange protocol fromscratch it would be useful to provide an efficient
    way to resume anIKE/IPsec session. This document proposes an extension to IKEv2
    thatallows a client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highlyefficient
    manner, utilizing a previously established IKE SA.A client can reconnect to a
    gateway from which it was disconnected.The proposed approach uses a ticket to
    store state information thatis later made available to the IKEv2 responder for
    re-authentication.Restoring state information by utilizing a ticket is one possibleway.
    This document does not specify the format of the ticket butrecommendations are
    provided.</p>"
