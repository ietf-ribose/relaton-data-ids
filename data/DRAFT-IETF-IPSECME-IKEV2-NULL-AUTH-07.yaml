abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the NULL Authentication method and the
    ID_NULL Identification Payload ID Type for Internet Key Exchange Protocol version
    2 (IKEv2).  This allows two IKE peers to establish single-side authenticated or
    mutual unauthenticated IKE sessions for those use cases where a peer is unwilling
    or unable to authenticate or identify itself.  This ensures IKEv2 can be used
    for Opportunistic Security (also known as Opportunistic Encryption) to defend
    against Pervasive Monitoring attacks without the need to sacrifice anonymity.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
