abstract:
- content: <p>The tunnel MTU for popular IP-in-IP tunneling mechanisms is currently
    recommended to be set to 1500 (or less) minus the length of the encapsulation
    headers when static MTU determination is used. This is to avoid IP fragmentation
    within the tunnel, but requires the tunnel ingress to either fragment any IP packet
    larger than the MTU or drop the packet and return an ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB)
    message. Concerns for operational issues with both IPv4 and IPv6 Path MTU Discovery
    point to the possibility of MTU-related black holes when a packet is dropped due
    to an MTU restriction. Fortunately, the "Internet cell size" is 1500 bytes, i.e.,
    the minimum MTU configured by the vast majority of links in the Internet. We also
    note that these same considerations apply to the encapsulation of any combination
    of IP- within-IP protocol versions. This document therefore presents a method
    to boost the tunnel MTU to larger values.</p>
