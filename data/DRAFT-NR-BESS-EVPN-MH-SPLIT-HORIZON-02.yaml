abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) is commonly used along
    with\n   Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) tunnels. The EVPN multi-homing\n
    \  procedures may be different depending on the NVO tunnel type used in\n   the
    EVPN Broadcast Domain. In particular, there are two multi-homing\n   Split Horizon
    procedures to avoid looped frames on the multi-homed\n   CE: ESI Label based and
    Local Bias. ESI Label based Split Horizon is\n   used for MPLSoX tunnels, E.g.,
    MPLSoUDP, whereas Local Bias is used\n   for others, E.g., VXLAN tunnels. The
    current specifications do not\n   allow the operator to decide which Split Horizon
    procedure to use for\n   tunnel encapsulations that could support both. Examples
    of tunnels\n   that may support both procedures are MPLSoGRE, MPLSoUDP, GENEVE
    or\n   SRv6.sThis document extends the EVPN Multi-Homing procedures so that\n
    \  an operator can decide the Split Horizon procedure for a given NVO\n   tunnel
    depending on their own requirements.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
