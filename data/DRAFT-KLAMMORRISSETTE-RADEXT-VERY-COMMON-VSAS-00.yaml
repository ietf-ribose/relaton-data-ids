abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a set of Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service\n
    \  attributes which have been widely used in different types of fixed\n   networks
    though they don't appear as standard attributes.  Each of\n   these attributes
    has for long been part of many vendor dictionnaries,\n   thus presented in different
    approaches and different syntaxes.  This\n   document try to solve this in an
    effort to present them in a\n   standard, common way, based on approaches found
    in multiple\n   dictionnaries.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
