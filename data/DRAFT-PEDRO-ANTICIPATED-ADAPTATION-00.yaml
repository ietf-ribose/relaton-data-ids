abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The adoption of SDN/NFV technologies by current computer and
    network\n   system infrastructures is constantly increasing, becoming essential\n
    \  for the the particular case of edge/branch network systems.  The\n   systems
    supported by these infrastructures require to be adapted to\n   environment changes
    within a short period of time.  Thus, the\n   complexity of new systems and the
    speed at which management and\n   control operations must be performed go beyond
    human limits.  Thus,\n   management systems must be automated.  However, in several
    situations\n   current automation techniques are not enough to respond to\n   requirement
    changes.  Here we propose to anticipate changes in the\n   operation environments
    of SDN/NFV systems in response to external\n   events and reflect it in the anticipation
    of the amount of resources\n   required by those systems for their ulterior adaptaion.
    \ The final\n   objective is to avoid service degradation or disruption while
    keeping\n   close-to-optimum resource allocation to reduce monetary and operative\n
    \  cost as much as possible.  Here we discuss how to achieve such\n   capabilities
    by the integration of the Autonomic Resource Control\n   Architecture (ARCA) to
    the management and operation (MANO) of NFV\n   systems.  We showcase it by building
    a multi-domain SDN/NFV\n   infrastructure based on OpenStack and deploying ARCA
    to adapt a\n   virtual system based on the edge/branch network concept to the\n
    \  operational conditions of an emergency support service, which is\n   rarely
    used but that cannot leave any user unattended.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
