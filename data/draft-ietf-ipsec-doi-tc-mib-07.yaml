abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines textual conventions for the constants used
    inMIBs for the IPsec protocols. In particular, it documents thosenumbers whose
    assignments are managed by the IANA, with newassignments being made over time.
    The textual conventions provideIPsec-related MIBs with clearer documentation,
    and insulate them fromhaving to track new assignments by the IANA.The MIB documented
    by this document will become a separate livingdocument maintained by the IANA,
    and will be the document of recordfor these assignments.</p>"
