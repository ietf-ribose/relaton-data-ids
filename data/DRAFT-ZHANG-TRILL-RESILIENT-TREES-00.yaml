abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL protocol provides layer 2 multicast data forwarding using
    IS-IS\n   link state routing. Distribution trees are computed based on the link\n
    \  state information through Shortest Path First calculation and shared\n   among
    VLANs across the campus. When a link on the distribution tree\n   fails, a campus-wide
    recovergence of this distribution tree will take\n   place, which can be time
    consuming and may cause considerable\n   disruption to the ongoing multicast service.\n\n
    \  This document makes use of Affinity TLVs to build the backup\n   distribution
    tree to protect links on the primary distribution tree.\n   Since the backup distribution
    tree is built up ahead of the link\n   failure, when a link on the primary distribution
    tree fails, the pre-\n   installed backup forwarding table will be utilized to
    deliver\n   multicast packets without waiting for the campus-wide recovergence,\n
    \  which minimizes the service disruption.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
