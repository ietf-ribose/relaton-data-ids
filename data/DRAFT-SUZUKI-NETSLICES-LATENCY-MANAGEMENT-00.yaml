abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft provides a use case that addresses the need for
    latency\n   management for end-to-end data transmissions through multiple\n   domains.
    \ Specifically, examples of latency management schemes are\n   described.  In
    addition, the necessity of a common latency management\n   framework and of interfaces
    to gather latency information between\n   edges in each domain and to determine
    data transmission paths is\n   addressed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
