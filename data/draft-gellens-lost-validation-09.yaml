abstract:
- content: "<p>This document adds the 'LoST-Validation' service tag to the Straightforward-Naming
    Authority PoinTeR (S-NAPTR) Application Service Tag IANA registry. This tag can
    appear in a Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) Domain Name System (DNS) record to
    assist clients of the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol in identifying
    LoST servers designated for location validation. This tag and the information
    about its use update RFC 5222, which enables the explicit discovery of a server
    that supports location validation.</p>"
