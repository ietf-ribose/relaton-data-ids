abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines mechanisms for providing all IP address
    \nresource records (specifically including any A and AAAA resource \nrecords)
    in DNS response messages. Specifically, this document \ndefines an 'ADDR' query-type
    which allows a system to issue a \nsingle lookup for all of the addressing resource
    records \nassociated with a domain name (explicitly including any IPv4 and \nIPv6
    resource records), and also defines an algorithm for DNS \nservers to use when
    returning supplemental address data in the \nadditional-data section of a response
    message. \n\t </p>\n      "
