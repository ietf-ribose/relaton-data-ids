abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Routers in an operational network are simultaneously configured
    with \n   multiple protocols and security policies while forwarding traffic and
    \n   being managed.  To accurately benchmark a router for deployment it is \n
    \  necessary that the router be tested in these simultaneous operational \n   conditions,
    which is known as Stress Testing.  This document provides \n   the Methodology
    for performing Stress Benchmarking of networking \n   devices when subjected to
    instability as described in [7].  \n   Descriptions of test topology, benchmarks
    and reporting format are \n   provided in addition to procedures for conducting
    various test cases.  \n   This methodology is based upon the accelerated stress
    methodology \n   guidelines [6] and is to be used with the companion terminology
    \n   document [4]. \n\t </p>\n      "
