abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft was submitted to obtain comments for an experimental
    work\nin progress. It presents Fast Mobile IPv6 and Context Transfer\ninteractions
    for a specific case of contextful, anticipative,\nnetwork controlled and Layer-2
    source-triggered IPv6 handover where\none or more candidate access routers can
    be identified for selection\nas target. It is also meant to illustrate a case
    where it might be\nuseful to:\na) have Context Transfer messages as but options
    in handover\nnegotiation messages (e.g., Fast MIPv6's HI/HACK messages)\nbetween
    Access Routers.\nb) have an additional flag in the Context Transfer Protocol Context\nTransfer
    Data message which indicates whether the new Access\nRouter should install any
    context at all given that any one\ncontext fails to be installed.\n\t </p>\n      "
