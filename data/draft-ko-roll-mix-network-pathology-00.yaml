abstract:
- content: "<p>Nodes can run RPL in storing or non-storing modes for downward routing.
    When a downward-bound packet traverses a node running in storing to a node running
    in non-storing mode, there is a routing pathology that makes the packet bounce
    between the two nodes. Due to this pathology, the packet never reaches the destination
    if it lies beyond these nodes in the multi-hop path. The solution is to mandate
    that all the nodes parse and interpret source routing headers and storing nodes
    to sometimes act like non-storing mode root.</p>"
