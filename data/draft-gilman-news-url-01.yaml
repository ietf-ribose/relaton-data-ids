abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the format of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)
    identifying news messages and groups. The syntax of 'news' URLs from RFC 1738
    is extended to allow specification of the site from which the message is to be
    sought and to incorporate protections via 'snews' URLs. This combines into the
    'news' scheme enough capability so that the previously-proposed 'nntp' scheme
    can be retired and URL usage simplified.</p>"
