abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies requirements for algorithms that make
    ICE\n   connectivity checks more responsive by reducing delays in dual-stack\n
    \  host ICE connectivity checks when there is a path failure for the\n   address
    family preferred by the application or by the operating\n   system.  As IPv6 is
    usually preferred, the procedures in this\n   document helps avoid user-noticeable
    delays when the IPv6 path is\n   broken or excessively slow.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
