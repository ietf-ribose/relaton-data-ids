abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines Uniform Resource Identifiers for Physical
    \ \nObjects and human.It provides a proposal for the implementation of the \nConcept,
    ”Physical resources as well as humans should be accessible\nover the Internet
    and an information object is on the web if it can have a URI ”. It emphasizes
    on the fact that people should be able to\naccess the physical resources,they
    possess or even humans,from anywhere \nin the world through a common standard(URI)
    e.g. accessing a car from a \nremote location,or finding the location of the child
    via URI.As URIs are\nneeded in RDF,XML,so by using them for ubiquitous resources
    we could \neasily integrate the world of ubiquitous computing and semantic web
    i.e.\nUbiquitous Semantic Web.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
