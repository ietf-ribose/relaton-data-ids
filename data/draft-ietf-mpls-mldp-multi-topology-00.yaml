abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) is a technology to enable service differentiation
    within an IP network. Flexible Algorithm (FA) is another mechanism of creating
    a sub-topology within a topology using defined topology constraints and computation
    algorithm. In order to deploy mLDP in a network that supports MTR and/or FA, mLDP
    is required to become topology and FA aware. This document specifies extensions
    to mLDP to support MTR with FA such that when building a Multi-Point LSPs it can
    follow a particular topology and algorithm.</p>"
