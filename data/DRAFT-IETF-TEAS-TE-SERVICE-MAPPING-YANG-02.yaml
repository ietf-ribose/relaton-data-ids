abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a YANG data model to map customer service\n
    \  models (e.g., the L3VPN Service Model (L3SM)) to Traffic Engineering\n   (TE)
    models (e.g., the TE Tunnel or the Virtual Network (VN) model).\n   This model
    is referred to as TE Service Mapping Model and is\n   applicable generically to
    the operator's need for seamless control\n   and management of their VPN services
    with TE tunnel support.\n\n   The model is principally used to allow monitoring
    and diagnostics of\n   the management systems to show how the service requests
    are mapped\n   onto underlying network resource and TE models.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
