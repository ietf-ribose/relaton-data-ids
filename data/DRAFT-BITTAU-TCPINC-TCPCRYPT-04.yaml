abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies tcpcrypt, a cryptographic protocol
    that\n   protects TCP payload data and is negotiated by means of the TCP\n   Encryption
    Negotiation Option (TCP-ENO) [I-D.ietf-tcpinc-tcpeno].\n   Tcpcrypt coexists with
    middleboxes by tolerating resegmentation,\n   NATs, and other manipulations of
    the TCP header.  The protocol is\n   self-contained and specifically tailored
    to TCP implementations,\n   which often reside in kernels or other environments
    in which large\n   external software dependencies can be undesirable.  Because
    of option\n   size restrictions, the protocol requires one additional one-way\n
    \  message latency to perform key exchange.  However, this cost is\n   avoided
    between two hosts that have recently established a previous\n   tcpcrypt connection.\n\n\t
