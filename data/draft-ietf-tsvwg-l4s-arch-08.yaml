abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet
    applications to achieve Low queuing Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable throughput
    (L4S). The insight on which L4S is based is that the root cause of queuing delay
    is in the congestion controllers of senders, not in the queue itself. The L4S
    architecture is intended to enable _all_ Internet applications to transition away
    from congestion control algorithms that cause queuing delay, to a new class of
    congestion controls that induce very little queuing, aided by explicit congestion
    signaling from the network. This new class of congestion control can provide low
    latency for capacity-seeking flows, so applications can achieve both high bandwidth
    and low latency. The architecture primarily concerns incremental deployment. It
    defines mechanisms that allow the new class of L4S congestion controls to coexist
    with 'Classic' congestion controls in a shared network. These mechanisms aim to
    ensure that the latency and throughput performance using an L4S-compliant congestion
    controller is usually much better (and never worse) than the performance would
    have been using a 'Classic' congestion controller, and that competing flows continuing
    to use 'Classic' controllers are typically not impacted by the presence of L4S.
    These characteristics are important to encourage adoption of L4S congestion control
    algorithms and L4S compliant network elements. The L4S architecture consists of
    three components: network support to isolate L4S traffic from classic traffic;
    protocol features that allow network elements to identify L4S traffic; and host
    support for L4S congestion controls.</p>"
