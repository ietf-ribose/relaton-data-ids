abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, no LDP capability is exchanged for LDP applications
    like\n   IP Label Switching and L2VPN P2P PW signaling. When an LDP session\n
    \  comes up, an LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state\n   for
    such LDP applications even when the peer session is established\n   for some other
    applications like mLDP or ICCP. This document defines\n   a solution by which
    an LDP speaker announces to its peer its\n   disinterest in such non-negotiated
    applications. This, in turn,\n   disables the advertisement of corresponding application
    state, which\n   would have otherwise be advertised by default, over the established\n
    \  LDP session.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
