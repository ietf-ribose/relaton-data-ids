abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service Function Chain is the ordered set of service functions
    such\n   as firewall, Deep Packet Inspection(DPI), virtualized Evolved Packet\n
    \  Core (vEPC), and etc,. Operators make chains with several service\n   functions
    depending on the service which they have to provide.  The\n   chain needs to be
    evaluated to measure the SLA.  This draft describes\n   the benchmarking methodologies
    for Service Function Chain(SFC)\n   performance and the affecting factors to SFC
    performance.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
