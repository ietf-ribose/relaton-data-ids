abstract:
  content: "<p>IPv6 nodes (clients) need a way to offer credentials to the AAAinfrastructure
    in order to be granted access to the local network.For IPv6, it will be more efficient
    and thus reasonable to expectsuch access controls to be exerted by IPv6 routers,
    possibly aspart of performing their role as DHCPv6 relays. Routers and DHCPv6servers
    are expected to work in conjunction with AAA servers todetermine whether or not
    the client's credentials are valid. Routerscan exert such network access control
    by the device of carefullycontrolling entries in their packet filter and Neighbor
    Cache.</p>"
