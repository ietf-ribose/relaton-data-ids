abstract:
- content: "<p>This document registers code points to allow status codes to be returned
    to an email client to indicate that a message is being rejected or deferred specifically
    because of email authentication failures. This document updates RFC 7208, since
    some of the code points registered replace the ones recommended for use in that
    document.</p>"
