abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP flow specification (RFC5575) describes the distribution
    policy\n   that contains filters and actions that apply when packets are\n   received
    on a router with the flow specification function turned on.\n   The popularity
    of these flow specification filters in deployment for\n   DoS and SDN/NFV has
    led to the requirement for more BGP flow\n   specification match filters in the
    NLRI and more BGP flow\n   specification actions.  Two solutions exist for adding
    new filters:\n   1) expanding the BGP Flow Specification version 1 (NLRI match
    filters\n   and extended communities actions) to included limited number of\n
    \  filters and actions, and 2) creating a BGP Flow Specification version\n   2
    that allows for ordering filters and actions (using new NLRI and\n   wide-communities
    for actions).  The two solutions can exist in\n   parallel.\n\n   This document
    contains an overview existing proposals for expansion\n   of BGP flow specification
    policy, proposals for BGP Flow\n   Specification v1 and a new BGP Flow specification
    version 2 that\n   supports order of filters and actions plus allowing more actions.\n
    \  This document also provides rules for the interaction of IDR Flow\n   Specification
    policy (session ephemeral policy) with policy found in\n   I2RS (reboot ephemeral
    policy), and policy found in ACLs and Policy\n   routing (configuration policy).
    \ This document does not contain the\n   individual definitions of policy rule
    conditions or actions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
