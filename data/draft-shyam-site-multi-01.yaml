abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a solution for Site Multihoming of stub networks
    in a real IP environment. Each user interface in a customer network will have
    as many global unicast addresses as many service providers as it is connected
    with. Users can establish multiple connections through different service providers
    simultaneously. A customer network can maintain private address space to communicate
    within its users and can share its load while maintaining VPN services. Customer
    networks can provide IP mobility services as well.</p>"
