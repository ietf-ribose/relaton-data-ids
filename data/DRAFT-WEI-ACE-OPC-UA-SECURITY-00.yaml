abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a communication protocol
    for\n   industrial automation developed by the OPC Foundation. Compared with\n
    \  OPC, OPC UA provides a complete set of security mechanisms to ensure\n   data
    confidentiality, data integrity and data availability. With the\n   development
    of industrial internet of things, more and more nodes\n   are expected to be implemented
    OPC UA, which are resource\n   constrained. This draft discusses OPC UA security
    mechanisms and the\n   applicability in a constrained environment. An outline
    of a\n   lightweight security mechanism for OPC UA using in constrained\n   device
    is proposed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
