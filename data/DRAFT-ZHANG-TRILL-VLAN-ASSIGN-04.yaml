abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   If RBridges are casually assigned as Appointed Forwarders for
    VLANs\n   without considering the number of MAC addresses and traffic load of\n
    \  these VLANs, it may overload some of the RBridges while leave other\n   RBridges
    lightly loaded, which reduces the scalability of a RBridge\n   network and undermines
    its performance.\n\n   A new mechanism is designed in this document to support
    the adaptive\n   VLAN assignment (or Appointed Forwarder selection) based on the\n
    \  forwarders' reporting of their usage of MAC tables and available\n   bandwidth.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
