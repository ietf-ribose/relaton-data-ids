abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines a means of self test for a Label-SwitchedRouter
    (LSR) to verify that its dataplane is functioning for certainkey Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) applications includingunicast forwarding based on LDP [LDP]
    and traffic engineering tunnelsbased on [RSVP-TE]. A new Loopback FEC type is
    defined to allow anupstream neighbor to assist in the testing at very low cost.
    MPLSEcho Request and MPLS Echo Reply messages [LSP-Ping] messages areextended
    to do the actually probing.</p>"
