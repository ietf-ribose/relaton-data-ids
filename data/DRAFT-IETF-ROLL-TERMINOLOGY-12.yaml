abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The documents defines a terminology for discussing routing\n
    \  requirements and solutions for networks referred to as Low power and\n   Lossy
    Networks (LLN).  An LLN is typically composed of many embedded\n   devices with
    limited power, memory, and processing resources\n   interconnected by a variety
    of links.  There is a wide scope of\n   application areas for LLNs, including
    industrial monitoring, building\n   automation (e.g.  Heating, Ventilating, Air
    Conditioning, lighting,\n   access control, fire), connected home, healthcare,
    environmental\n   monitoring, urban sensor networks, energy management, assets\n
    \  tracking, refrigeration.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
