abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes a mechanism that allows a single router
    to   \n   share one or more links among multiple IS-IS routing protocol \n   instances.
    \n\n   Multiple instances allow the isolation of resources associated with \n
    \  each instance. Routers will form instance specific adjacencies, \n   exchange
    instance specific routing updates and compute paths \n   utilizing instance specific
    LSDB information. Each PDU will contain \n   a new TLV identifying the instance
    to which the PDU belongs. This \n   allows a network operator to deploy multiple
    IS-IS instances in \n   parallel, using the same set of links when required and
    still have \n   the capability of computing instance specific paths. This draft
    does \n   not address the forwarding paradigm that needs to be used in order \n
    \  to ensure data PDUs are forwarded according to the paths computed by \n   a
    specific instance. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
