abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use cases, requirements, and\n
    \  considerations that should be factored in the design of a successor\n   protocol
    to supersede version 4 of the NTP protocol [RFC5905]\n   presently referred to
    as NTP version 5 (\"NTPv5\").  This document is\n   non-exhaustive and does not
    in its current version represent working\n   group consensus.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
