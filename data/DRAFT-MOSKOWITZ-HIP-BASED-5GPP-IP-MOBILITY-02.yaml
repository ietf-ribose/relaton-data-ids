abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HIP [RFC7401] stands alone in providing a secure Endpoint ID
    for\n   decoupling the Internetworking and Transport protocol layers.  The\n   addition
    of a secure rendezvous service to facilitate mobility will\n   form the cornerstones
    for this 5GPP mobility technology.  This\n   document will describe complete mobility
    environment and the\n   additional components needed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
