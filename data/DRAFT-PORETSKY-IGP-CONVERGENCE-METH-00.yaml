abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes the methodology for benchmarking IGP Route
    \nConvergence.  The applicability of this testing is described in \n[1] and the
    new terminology that it introduces is defined in [2].\nService Providers use IGP
    Convergence time as a key metric of \nrouter design and architecture.  Customers
    of Service Providers \nobserve convergence time by packet loss.  IGP Route Convergence
    \nis a Direct Measure of Quality (DMOQ) when benchmarking the data \nplane and
    not the control plane.  The test cases in this document \nare black-box tests
    that emulate the network events that cause \nroute convergence, as described in
    [1].  Black-box test design \naccounts for all of the factors for route convergence
    time, as\nprovided in [1].  The methodology and terminology is to be used \nfor
    benchmarking route convergence and can be applied to any\nlink-state IGP such
    as ISIS [3] and OSPF [4]. \n\t </p>\n      "
