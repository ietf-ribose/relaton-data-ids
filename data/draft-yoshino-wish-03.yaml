abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a general purpose message framing named WiSH
    which supports bi-directional (bidi) message-based communication over byte-stream
    oriented protocols such as HTTP (in its standard semantics). WiSH is designed
    to be compatible with WebSocket. WiSH can be viewed as a binary and bidi alternative
    to the framing defined for the server-sent events (SSE, EventSource) Web API [SSE].</p>"
