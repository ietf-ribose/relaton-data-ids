abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobility solutions at the IP layer have been specified in the
    IETF\n   for IPv4 and IPv6.  These solutions include host and network based\n
    \  mobility.  All of the mobility protocols enable IP session continuity\n   by
    providing the mobile host with an IP address or prefix that\n   remains constant
    even as the host moves and attaches to different\n   access networks and points
    of attachment.  Mobile hosts are anchored\n   at a gateway via a tunnel and the
    address/prefix provided to the host\n   via the gateway remains unchanged across
    mobility events.  All IP\n   sessions initiated or terminated at a mobile host
    are anchored via\n   the gateway.  A gateway centric approach such as Mobile IP,
    raises\n   certain concerns in terms of cost and efficiency.  A mobility model\n
    \  wherein the network entities enabling mobility are distributed is a\n   way
    of alleviating the concerns of a gateway centric approach.  This\n   document
    considers ways to alleviate anchored mobility issues with\n   approaches that
    could be considered in a deployment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
