abstract:
  content: "<p>This document states a traffic distribution problem in today's IP/MPLSnetwork
    when multiple links are configured between two routers. Thedocument presents motivation,
    a framework and requirements. It defines acomposite link as a group of parallel
    links that can be considered as asingle traffic engineering link or as an IP link,
    and used for MPLS.The document primarily focuses on MPLS traffic controlled throughcontrol
    plane protocols, the advertisement of composite link parameterin routing protocols,
    and the use of composite links in the RSVP-TE andLDP signaling protocols. Interactions
    with the data and management planeare also addressed. Applicability can be between
    a single pair of MPLS-capable nodes, a sequence of MPLS-capable nodes, or a multi-layernetwork
    connecting MPLS-capable nodes.</p>"
