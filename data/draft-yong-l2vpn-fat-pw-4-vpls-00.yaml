abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A pseudowire (PW) is used in Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)solutions
    to form any-to-any connections and provide servicedemuliplexing among Provider
    Edge routers (PEs), and is normallytransported over one single network path. Flow-aware
    PW enable a PWto take advantage of Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) and/or LinkAggregation
    Groups (LAG) in a packet switched network (PSN). PWpackets with a flow label can
    be transported over multi-paths. Thismethod can apply to the PWs in a VPLS service.This
    document describes how VPLS solutions utilize a PW with a flowlabel, and defines
    protocol extension for the provisioning of suchPWs.</p>"
