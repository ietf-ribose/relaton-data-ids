abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
    Defined Networking (SDN) systems. A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify
    the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of
    SDN and without necessarily completely replacing it. Thus, the LSP can be calculated/set
    up/initiated and the label forwarding entries can also be downloaded through a
    centralized PCE server to each network device along the path, while leveraging
    the existing PCE technologies as much as possible. This document specifies the
    procedures and PCEP extensions for using the PCE as the central controller for
    provisioning labels along the path of the static LSP.</p>"
