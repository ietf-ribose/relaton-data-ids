abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes a lightweight in-band edge-to-edge flow-based\n
    \  network round trip time measurement architecture and proposes the\n   implementation
    over IOAM E2E option.  By augmenting the IOAM E2E\n   option header, the process
    can be fully done in data plane without\n   needing to involve the control plane
    to maintain any states.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
