abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Composition creates a presence document from multiple components\n
    \  published by one or more sources.  This document identifies sources\n   of
    information that a compositor might draw on presence composition\n   and describes
    steps for composition.  The composing function can be\n   complex, so we intentionally
    restrict the discussion to cases that\n   are likely to be common across many
    users of presence systems.  We\n   present an XML format for specifying a composition
    policy, based on\n   our discussion.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
