abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CoRE set of protocols, in particular the CoAP protocol,
    is\n   defined in draft-ietf-core-coap in conjunction with a number of\n   specifications
    that are currently nearing completion.  There are also\n   several dozen more
    individual Internet-Drafts in various states of\n   development, with various
    levels of WG review and interest.\n\n   Today, this is simply a bewildering array
    of documents.  Beyond the\n   main four documents, it is hard to find relevant
    information and\n   assess the status of proposals.  At the level of Internet-Drafts,
    the\n   IETF has only adoption as a WG document to assign status - too crude\n
    \  an instrument to assess the level of development and standing for\n   anyone
    who does not follow the daily proceedings of the WG.\n\n   With a more long-term
    perspective, as additional drafts mature and\n   existing specifications enter
    various levels of spec maintenance, the\n   entirety of these specifications may
    become harder to understand,\n   pose specific implementation problems, or be
    simply inconsistent.\n\n   The present guide aims to provide a roadmap to these
    documents as\n   well as provide specific advice how to use these specifications
    in\n   combination.  In certain cases, it may provide clarifications or even\n
    \  corrections to the specifications referenced.\n\n   This guide is intended
    as a continued work-in-progress, i.e. a long-\n   lived Internet-Draft, to be
    updated whenever new information becomes\n   available and new consensus on how
    to handle issues is formed.\n   Similar to the ROHC implementation guide, RFC
    4815, it might be\n   published as an RFC at some future time later in the acceptance
    curve\n   of the specifications.\n\n   This document does not describe a new protocol
    or attempt to set a\n   new standard of any kind - it mostly describes good practice
    in using\n   the existing specifications, but it may also document emerging\n
    \  consensus where a correction needs to be made.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
