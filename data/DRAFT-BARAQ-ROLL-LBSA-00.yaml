abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks
    (RPL) has\n   been recently standardized as the de facto solution for routing
    in\n   the context of the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. RPL,\n   along
    with other standards, has provided a baseline framework for IoT\n   that has helped
    advance communications in the world of embedded\n   resource-constrained networks.
    However, RPL still suffers from issues\n   that may limit its efficiency such
    as the absence of an efficient\n   load-balancing primitive.  To address this
    problem, a novel load-\n   balancing scheme is introduced that ensures a fair
    distribution of\n   traffic among nodes while minimizing overhead\n\n\n\n\n\t
