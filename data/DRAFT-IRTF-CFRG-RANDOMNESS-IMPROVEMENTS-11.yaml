abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Randomness is a crucial ingredient for TLS and related security\n
    \  protocols.  Weak or predictable \"cryptographically-strong\"\n   pseudorandom
    number generators (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited\n   for malicious purposes.
    \ The Dual EC random number backdoor and\n   Debian bugs are relevant examples
    of this problem.  An initial\n   entropy source that seeds a CSPRNG might be weak
    or broken as well,\n   which can also lead to critical and systemic security problems.
    \ This\n   document describes a way for security protocol participants to\n   augment
    their CSPRNGs using long-term private keys.  This improves\n   randomness from
    broken or otherwise subverted CSPRNGs.\n\n   This document is a product of the
    Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG)\n   in the IRTF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
