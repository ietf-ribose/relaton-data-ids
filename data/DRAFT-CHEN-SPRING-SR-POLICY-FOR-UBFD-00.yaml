abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to leverage Segment Routing (SR)
    Policy\n   to make sure that the Unaffiliated BFD (U-BFD) Echo packets must be\n
    \  transmitted to the remote system before being looped back to the\n   local
    system.  This enables that U-BFD works not only for one hop\n   scenario but for
    multiple hops scenario as well.\n\n   In addition, this document also defines
    a way to explicitly specify\n   the loop back path of the Echo packets.  This
    is useful in the case\n   where the forward and reverse path of the Echo packets
    are required\n   to follow the same path.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
