abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n
    \  In particular, it describes managed objects for information related\n   to
    the Fabric Configuration Server function of a Fibre Channel\n   network.  At present,
    this memo is a work item of T11.5\n   (http://www.t11.org).  The plan is that
    it will later be a work item\n   of the IETF's IMSS working group.\n\t </p>\n
