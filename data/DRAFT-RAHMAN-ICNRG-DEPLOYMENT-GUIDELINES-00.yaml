abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides technical deployment guidelines for
    the ICN\n   community.  First, the possible deployment configurations for ICN
    are\n   described including overlay and underlay approaches.  Then proposed\n
    \  deployment migration paths for these configurations are outlined to\n   address
    the major issues facing ICN such as application migration,\n   and core and edge
    network migration.  Next, selected ICN trial\n   experiences are summarized.  Finally,
    recommendations are given for\n   protocol areas that require further standardization
    to facilitate\n   future ICN interoperable deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
