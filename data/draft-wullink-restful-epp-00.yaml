abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a 'RESTful interface for EPP' (REPP) with the
    aim to improve efficiency and interoperability of EPP systems. This document includes
    a new EPP Protocol Extension as well as a mapping of [RFC5730] XML-commands to
    an HTTP based (RESTful) interface. Existing semantics and mappings as defined
    in [RFC5731], [RFC5732] and [RFC5733] are largely retained and reusable in RESTful
    EPP. With REPP, no session is created on the EPP server. Each request from client
    to server will contain all of the information necessary to understand the request.
    The server will close the connection after each HTTP request.</p>"
