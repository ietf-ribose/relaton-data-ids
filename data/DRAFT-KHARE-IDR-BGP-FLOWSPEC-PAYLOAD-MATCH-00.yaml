abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The rise in frequency, volume, and pernicious effects of DDoS
    attacks\n   has elevated them from fare for the specialist to generalist press.\n
    \  Numerous reports detail the taxonomy of DDoS types, the varying\n   motivations
    of their attackers, as well as the resulting business and\n   reputation loss
    of their targets.\n\n   BGP FlowSpec (RFC 5575, \"Dissemination of Flow Specification
    Rules\")\n   can be used to rapidly disseminate filters that thwart attacks, being\n
    \  particularly effective against the volumetric type.  Operators can\n   use
    existing FlowSpec components to match on pre-defined packet\n   header fields.
    \ However recent enhancements to forwarding plane\n   filter implementations allow
    matches at arbitary locations within the\n   packet header and, to some extent,
    the payload.  This capability can\n   be used to detect highly amplified attacks,
    whose attack signature\n   remains relatively constant.\n\n   We define a new
    FlowSpec component, \"Flexible Match Conditions\", with\n   similar matching semantics
    to those of existing components.  This\n   component will allow the operator to
    define bounded match conditions\n   using offsets and bitmasks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
