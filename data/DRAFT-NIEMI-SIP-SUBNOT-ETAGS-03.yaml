abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables\n
    \  receiving asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP\n   user
    agents.  This framework defines the procedures for creating,\n   refreshing and
    terminating subscriptions, as well as fetching and\n   periodic polling of resource
    state.  These procedures have a serious\n   deficiency in that they do not allow
    state to persist over a\n   subscription refresh, or between two consecutive polls.
    \ This\n   inability to suppress notifications of state already known to the\n
    \  subscriber results in superfluous traffic in the network.  This memo\n   defines
    an extension to SIP events that allows the subscriber to\n   condition the subscription
    request to whether the state has changed\n   since the previous notification was
    received.  When such a condition\n   is true, either the body of an event notification
    or the entire\n   notification message is suppressed.\n\t </p>\n      "
