abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a method to reset a YANG datastore to
    its\n   factory-default content.  The reset operation may be used e.g. during\n
    \  initial zero-touch configuration or when the existing configuration\n   has
    major errors, so re-starting the configuration process from\n   scratch is the
    best option.\n\n   A new reset-datastore RPC is defined.  Several methods of documenting\n
    \  the factory-default content are specified.\n\n   Optionally a new \"factory-default\"
    read-only datastore is defined,\n   that contains the data that will be copied
    over to the running\n   datastore at reset.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
