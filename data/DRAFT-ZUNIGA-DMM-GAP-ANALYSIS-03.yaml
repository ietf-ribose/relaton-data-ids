abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes practices for the deployment of existing\n
    \  mobility protocols in a distributed mobility management (DMM)\n   environment,
    and identifies the limitations in the current practices\n   with respect to providing
    the expected DMM functionality.\n\n   The practices description and gap analysis
    are performed for IP-based\n   mobility protocols, dividing them into three main
    families: IP\n   client-based, IP network-based, and 3GPP mobility solutions.\n\n\t
