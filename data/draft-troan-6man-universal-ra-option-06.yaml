abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the original intentions for the IPv6 host configuration, was
    to configure the network-layer parameters only with IPv6 ND, and use service discovery
    for other configuration information. Unfortunately that hasn't panned out quite
    as planned, and we are in a situation where all kinds of configuration options
    are added to RAs. This document proposes a new universal option for RA in a self-describing
    data format, with the list of elements maintained in an IANA registry, with greatly
    relaxed rules for registration.</p>"
