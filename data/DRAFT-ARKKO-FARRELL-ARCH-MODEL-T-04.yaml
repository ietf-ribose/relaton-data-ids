abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Communications security has been at the center of many security\n
    \  improvements in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that\n   communications
    are protected against outside observers and attackers.\n\n   This memo suggests
    that the existing RFC 3552 threat model, while\n   important and still valid,
    is no longer alone sufficient to cater for\n   the pressing security and privacy
    issues seen on the Internet today.\n   For instance, it is often also necessary
    to protect against endpoints\n   that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests
    simply do not\n   align with the interests of users.  While such protection is\n
    \  difficult, there are some measures that can be taken and we argue\n   that
    investigation of these issues is warranted.\n\n   It is particularly important
    to ensure that as we continue to develop\n   Internet technology, non-communications
    security related threats, and\n   privacy issues, are properly understood.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
