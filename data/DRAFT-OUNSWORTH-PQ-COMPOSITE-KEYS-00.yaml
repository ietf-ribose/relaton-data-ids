abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will
    come\n   the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different\n
    \  cryptographic algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual\n   post-quantum
    algorithms is at question, a multi-key cryptographic\n   operation will need to
    be performed in such a way that breaking it\n   requires breaking each of the
    component algorithms individually.\n   This requires defining new structures for
    holding composite keys, for\n   use with composite signature and encryption data.\n\n
    \  This document defines the structures CompositePublicKey,\n   CompositePrivateKey,
    which are sequences of the respective structure\n   for each component algorithm.
    \ This document makes no assumptions\n   about what the component algorithms are,
    provided that they have\n   defined algorithm identifiers.  The only requirement
    imposed by this\n   document is that all algorithms be of the same key usage;
    i.e. all\n   signature or all encryption.  This document is intended to be coupled\n
    \  with corresponding documents that define the structure and semantics\n   of
    composite signatures and encryption.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
