abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is the deliverable out of the Network Hierarchy
    \nand Survivability Techniques Design Team established within the \nTraffic Engineering
    Working Group.  This team collected and \ndocumented current and near term requirements
    for survivability \nand hierarchy in service provider environments.  For clarity,
    \nan expanded set of definitions is included.  The team \ndetermined that there
    appears to be a need to define a small \nset of interoperable survivability approaches
    in packet and \nnon-packet networks.  Suggested approaches include path-based
    \nas well as one that repairs connections in proximity to the \nnetwork fault.
    \ They operate primarily at a single network \nlayer.  For hierarchy, there did
    not appear to be a driving \nnear-term need for work on 'vertical hierarchy,'
    defined as \ncommunication between network layers such as TDM/optical and \nMPLS.
    \ In particular, instead of direct exchange of signaling \nand routing between
    vertical layers, some looser form of \ncoordination and communication, such as
    the specification of \nhold-off timers, is a nearer term need.  For 'horizontal
    \nhierarchy' in data networks, there are several pressing needs.  \nThe requirement
    is to be able to set up many LSPs in a service \nprovider network with hierarchical
    IGP.  This is necessary to \nsupport layer 2 and layer 3 VPN services that require
    edge-to-\nedge signaling across a core network.  \nPlease send comments to te-wg@ops.ietf.org
