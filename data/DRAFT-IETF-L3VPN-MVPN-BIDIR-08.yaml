abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A set of prior RFCs specify procedures for supporting multicast
    in\n   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  These procedures allow customer multicast data to\n
    \  travel across a service provider's backbone network through a set of\n   multicast
    tunnels.  The tunnels are advertised in certain BGP\n   multicast \"auto-discovery\"
    routes, by means of a BGP attribute known\n   as the \"Provider Multicast Service
    Interface (PMSI) Tunnel\n   attribute\".  Encodings have been defined that allow
    the PMSI Tunnel\n   attribute to identify bidirectional (multipoint-to-multipoint)\n
    \  multicast distribution trees.  However, the prior RFCs do not provide\n   all
    the necessary procedures for using bidirectional tunnels to\n   support multicast
    VPNs.  This document updates RFCs 6513 and 6625 by\n   specifying those procedures.
    \ In particular, it specifies the\n   procedures for assigning customer multicast
    flows (unidirectional or\n   bidirectional) to specific bidirectional tunnels
    in the provider\n   backbone, for advertising such assignments, and for determining
    which\n   flows have been assigned to which tunnels.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
