abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Micromobility protocols address mobile nodes (MN) movements within
    a\n   particular IP network domain.  This document introduces a new\n   protocol
    \"Optimized Micromobility Management\" (OMM), to manage\n   Micromobility for
    active and dormant mobile nodes.  The suggested\n   solution is based on the Hierarchical
    Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) proposal\n   and aims to increase the mobility performance
    by reducing the\n   handover latency and the packet loss.\n\t </p>\n      "
