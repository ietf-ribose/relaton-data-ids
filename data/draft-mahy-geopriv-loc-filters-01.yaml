abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes filters which limit asynchronous location notifications
    to compelling events. The resulting location information is conveyed in existing
    location formats wrapped in GEOPRIV privacy extensions to the Presence Information
    Document Format (PIDF-LO). Location disclosure is limited to voluntary disclosure
    by a notifier that possesses credentials for the named resource.</p>"
