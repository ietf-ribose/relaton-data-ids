abstract:
- content: "<p>Problem definition for route leaks and enumeration of types of route
    leaks are provided in RFC 7908. This document specifies BGP enhancements that
    significantly extend its route-leak detection and mitigation capabilities. The
    solution involves each participating AS setting a route-leak protection (RLP)
    field in BGP updates. The RLP fields are carried in a new optional transitive
    attribute, called BGP RLP Attribute. The RLP Attribute helps with detection and
    mitigation of route leaks at ASes downstream from the leaking AS (in the path
    of BGP update). This is an inter-AS (multi-hop) solution mechanism. This solution
    complements the intra-AS (local AS) route-leak avoidance solution that is described
    in ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy draft.</p>"
