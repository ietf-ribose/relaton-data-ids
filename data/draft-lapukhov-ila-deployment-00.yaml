abstract:
- content: "<p>Identifier-Locator Addressing defined in [I-D.herbert-nvo3-ila] proposes
    using locator-identifier split in IPv6 address to realize workload mobility and
    network virtualization. This document describes how ILA can be implemented in
    datacenter using BGP as the control-plane protocol. In general, ILA could be built
    upon different control planes, and BGP is one particular instantiation. BGP is
    a well-known protocol, sufficient for small to medium size deployments, on scale
    of few millions of mappings. Defining more generic and scalable control plane
    is outside of scope of this document.</p>"
