abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo defines the Extensible Protocol (XP). XP is a generic application-level
    protocol meant to serve as the foundation for specific protocols, in a manner
    analogous to the way in which the Extensible Markup Language (XML) recommendation
    of the World Wide Web Consortium serves as the foundation for specific markup
    languages. XP is a bidirectional protocol on which XML documents are exchanged
    between two endpoints.</p>"
