abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specifications\n
    \  are designed to make identity management in cloud based applications\n   and
    services easier.  The specification suite builds upon experience\n   with existing
    schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on\n   simplicity of development
    and integration, while applying existing\n   authentication, authorization, and
    privacy models.  Its intent is to\n   reduce the cost and complexity of user management
    operations by\n   providing a common user schema and extension model, as well
    as\n   binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema\n   using
    HTTP protocol.\n\n   This document provides a platform neutral schema and extension
    model\n   for representing users and groups and other resource types in JSON\n
    \  format.  This schema is intended for exchange and use with cloud\n   service
    providers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
