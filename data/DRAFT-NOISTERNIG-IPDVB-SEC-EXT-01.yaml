abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) protocol provides\nan
    efficient mechanism for transporting IP and other network layer\nprotocol data
    over MPEG-2 networks. Such networks, widely used\nespecially for providing digital
    TV services, often use broadcast\nwireless transmission media, and are hence vulnerable
    to various\ntypes of security attacks.\n\nThis document describes a new mandatory
    ULE extension to protect ULE\ntraffic using security features such as data confidentiality,
    data\nintegrity, data origin authentication, and prevention against replay\nattacks.
    Additionally, destination addresses may be hidden from\nunauthorized receiver
    devices using the identity protection feature.\n\nThe format of the security extension
    header as well as the processing\nat receivers and transmitters are described
    in detail. The extension\naims to be lightweight and flexible such that it may
    be implemented\nin low-cost, resource-scarce transceivers, and different levels
    of\nsecurity may be selected.\n\nThe security extension may be easily adapted
    to the Generic Stream\nEncapsulation (GSE) protocol, which uses a similar extension
    header\nmechanism.\n\t </p>\n      "
