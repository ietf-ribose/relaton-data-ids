abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes a private extension to SIP in the form of
    a  \nP-Original-Dialog-ID header. The header is used to correlate two \ndifferent
    dialogs across a B2BUA that is non-transparent to \ndialogs. The contents of the
    header identify the original dialog \n(Call-id, From tag, To tag) associated with
    the SIP entity that \ninserted the header into a request. When the same instance
    of the \nheader is received at that SIP entity in a different request, then \nit
    is used to correlate the two different dialogs. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
