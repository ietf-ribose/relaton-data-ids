abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Multipath transport over potentially different paths can be realizedby
    several coupled Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections.Multi-Connection
    TCP (MCTCP) transport aggregates multiple TCPconnections between potentially different
    addresses into a singlesession that can be accessed by an application like a single
    TCPconnection. MCTCP encodes control information, as far as possible,in the payload
    of the TCP connections and therefore requires onlyminor changes in the TCP implementations,
    and it is transparent inthe single-path case. MCTCP is therefore proposed as a
    simple,modular, and extensible mechanism for multipath transport.</p>"
