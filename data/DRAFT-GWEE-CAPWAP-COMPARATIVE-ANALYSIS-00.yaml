abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of this document is to present a comparative evaluation\n
    \  of the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)\n   protocol
    proposals.  To the date of this document, the following four\n   protocols have
    been proposed, namely CAPWAP Tunneling Protocol (CTP),\n   Light Weight Access
    Point Protocol (LWAPP), Secure Light Access Point\n   Protocol (SLAPP), Wireless
    LAN Control Protocol (WiCoP).  Each of\n   these protocols has its own unique
    strengths in fulfilling the CAPWAP\n   Objectives through their own mechanisms
    and functionalities.  The\n   final CAPWAP protocol should comprise all of these
    strengths.  This\n   document gives a comparative study of the four proposed protocols\n
    \  based on the CAPWAP Objectives and makes recommendations on the\n   combination
    of their strengths for the final CAPWAP protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
