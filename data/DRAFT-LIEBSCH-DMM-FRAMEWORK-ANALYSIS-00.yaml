abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobile operators consider the distribution of mobility anchors
    to\n   enable offloading some traffic from their core network.  The\n   Distributed
    Mobility Management (DMM) Working Group is investigating\n   the impact of decentralized
    mobility management to existing protocol\n   solutions, while taking into account
    well defined requirements, which\n   are to be met by a future solution.  This
    document discusses DMM\n   using a functional framework.  Functional Entities
    to support DMM as\n   well as reference points between these Functional Entities
    are\n   introduced and described.  The described functional framework allows\n
    \  distribution and co-location of Functional Entities and build a DMM\n   architecture
    that matches the architecture of available protocols.\n   Such methodology eases
    the analysis of best current practices with\n   regard to functional and protocol
    gaps.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
