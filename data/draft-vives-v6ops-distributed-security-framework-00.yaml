abstract:
- content: "<p>Current Internet trends in several fields have brought some security
    concerns with regards to what will happen with the current security paradigms
    and mechanisms. This document analyzes two security paradigms, the network-based
    and the host-based. The former refers to what is being used nowadays out there
    and the latter is based on the distributed firewall concept [2]. From the point
    of view of these security concerns it is stated that there is a problem that must
    be addressed. Some insights are given with respect to the host-based security
    paradigm.</p>"
