abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     There are a number of design principles which come into play
    over\n     and over again when designing application protocols.  Many of these\n
    \    are entrenched in IETF lore and spread by word of mouth.  Most have\n     been
    learned the hard way many times.\n \n     This is an attempt to codify some of
    these principles so they can\n     be referenced rather than spread by word of
    mouth.  The author has\n     not invented any of these ideas and while the exercise
    of finding\n     the originator of the ideas would be interesting, it is not deemed\n
    \    necessary for this project.\n \n     Many of these principles have a much
    wider scope than application\n     protocol design.  However, the author's primary
    experience is with\n     application protocols and examples provided usually involve\n
    \    application protocols or elements.\n \n     [Disclaimer: this is a preliminary
    draft.  Some of the case studies\n     and exceptions need tuning.  Suggestions
    welcome.]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
