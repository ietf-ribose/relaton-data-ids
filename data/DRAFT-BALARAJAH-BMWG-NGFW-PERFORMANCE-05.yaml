abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides benchmarking terminology and methodology
    for\n   next-generation network security devices including next-generation\n   firewalls
    (NGFW), intrusion detection and prevention solutions (IDS/\n   IPS) and unified
    threat management (UTM) implementations.  The\n   document aims to strongly improve
    the applicability, reproducibility,\n   and transparency of benchmarks and to
    align the test methodology with\n   today's increasingly complex layer 7 application
    use cases.  The main\n   areas covered in this document are test terminology,
    traffic profiles\n   and benchmarking methodology for NGFWs to start with.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
