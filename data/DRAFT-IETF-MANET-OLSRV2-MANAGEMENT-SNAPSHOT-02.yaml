abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)
    are\n   typically managed, in terms of pre-deployment management, as well as\n
    \  rationale and means of monitoring and management of MANET routers\n   running
    the Optimized Link State Routing protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)\n   and its constituent
    MANET NehgiborHood Discovery Protocol (NHDP).\n   Apart from pre-deployment management
    for setting up IP addresses and\n   security related credentials, OLSRv2 only
    needs routers to agree one\n   single parameter (called \"C\").  Other parameters
    for tweaking network\n   performance may be determined during operation of the
    network, and\n   need not be the same in all routers.  This, using MIB modules
    and\n   related management protocols such as SNMP (or possibly other, less\n   \"chatty\",
    protocols).  In addition, for debugging purposes,\n   monitoring data and performance
    related counters, as well as\n   notifications (\"traps\") can be sent to the
    Network Management System\n   (NMS) via standardized management protocols.  This
    document\n\n\t </p>\n      "
