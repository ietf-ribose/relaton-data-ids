abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides the monitoring of
    BGP adj-\n   rib-in [RFC7854], BGP local-rib [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-local-rib] and
    BGP\n   adj-rib-out [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-adj-rib-out] through Route Monitoring\n
    \  (RM) messages.  With the capability of allowing optional data to be\n   added
    to the RM Messages in the format of TLV draft-lucente-bmp-tlv\n   [I-D.lucente-bmp-tlv],
    more information about the BGP Update message\n   encapsulated in the RM can be
    revealed.  This document proposes an\n   extension to BMP to describe the BGP
    path status through the\n   definition and use of Path Marking TLV.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
