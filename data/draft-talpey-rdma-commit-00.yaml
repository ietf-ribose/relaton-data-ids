abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies extensions to RDMA protocols to provide capabilities
    in support of enhanced remotely-directed data consistency. The extensions include
    a new operation supporting remote commitment to durability of remotely-managed
    buffers, which can provide enhanced guarantees and improve performance for low-
    latency storage applications. In addition to, and in support of these, extensions
    to local behaviors are described, which may be used to guide implementation, and
    to ease adoption. This document would extend the IETF Remote Direct Memory Access
    Protocol (RDMAP), RFC5040, and RDMA Protocol Extensions, RFC7306.</p>"
