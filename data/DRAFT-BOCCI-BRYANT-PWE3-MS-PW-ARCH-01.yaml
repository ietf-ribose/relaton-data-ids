abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an architecture for extending pseudo
    wire \n   emulation across multiple packet switched network segments. Scenarios
    \n   are discussed where each segment of a given edge-to-edge emulated \n   service
    spans a different provider's PSN, and where the emulated \n   service originates
    and terminates on the same providers PSN, but may \n   pass through several PSN
    tunnel segments in that PSN. It presents an \n   architectural framework for such
    multi-segment pseudo wires, defines \n   terminology, and specifies the various
    protocol elements and their \n   functions.  \n\t </p>\n      "
