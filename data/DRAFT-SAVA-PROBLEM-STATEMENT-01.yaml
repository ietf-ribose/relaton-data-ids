abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document outlines the problems that the Source Address\n
    \  Verification Architecture (SAVA) initiative plans to solve.  It\n   examines
    the current state in the internet, looks at current best\n   practices, and discusses
    why the current approaches are unlikely to\n   ever solve the problem of IP address
    spoofing.  It also discusses\n   some of the  problems that SAVA should NOT attempt
    to solve.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
