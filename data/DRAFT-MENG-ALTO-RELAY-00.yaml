abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>ALTO has been proposed to help peer-to-peer (P2P) applications
    make \n   better decisions with respect to peer selection. It provides the \n
    \  underlying network view for P2P users to choose the optimal resource \n   instances.
    The usage of ALTO has covered nearly all the P2P \n   applications, such as file
    sharing, media streaming, real time \n   communications and etc. In real time
    communication where the source \n   and destination are fixed, it is used to choose
    relays. \n\n   This document defines the relay usage for ALTO in real time \n
    \  communication. Beside the relay for NAT traversal mentioned before, \n   this
    document introduce a relay called Qos relay to improve the \n   performance. After
    analyzing the necessity of this type of relay and \n   the benefits of combining
    ALTO with relay, two models of combination \n   are described according to the
    coupling tightness between ALTO and \n   relay service. One is called \"integrating
    relay service into alto \n   service\" and the other is \"cooperation between
    P2P application \n   provider and ISP\". In all, the usage of ALTO in real time
    \n   communication has been developed in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
