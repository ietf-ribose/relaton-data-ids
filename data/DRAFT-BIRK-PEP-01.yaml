abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Building on already available security formats and message
    transports\n   (like PGP/MIME for email), and with the intention to stay\n   interoperable
    to systems widespreadly deployed, pretty Easy privacy\n   (pEp) describes protocols
    to automatize operations (key management,\n   key discovery, private key handling
    including peer-to-peer\n   synchronization of private keys and other user data
    across devices)\n   that have been seen to be barriers to deployment of end-to-end
    secure\n   interpersonal messaging. pEp also introduces \"Trustwords\" (instead
    of\n   fingerprints) to verify communication peers and proposes a trust\n   rating
    system to denote secure types of communications and signal the\n   privacy level
    available on a per-user and per-message level.  In this\n   document, the general
    design choices and principles of pEp are\n   outlined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
