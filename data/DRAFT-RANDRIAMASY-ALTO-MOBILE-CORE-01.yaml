abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The ALTO working group provides guidance to P2P applications,
    which\nhave to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates, that\nare
    able to provide a desired resource.  This guidance shall be based\non parameters
    that affect performance and efficiency of the data\ntransmission between the hosts,
    e.g., the topological distance.  The\nultimate goal is to improve performance
    (or Quality of Experience) in\nthe application while reducing resource consumption
    in the underlying\nnetwork infrastructure.\n\nThe present document addresses the
    case of ALTO transactions\ninvolving a peers connected via a mobile core network.
    \ It proposes\nspecific scopes and use cases for mobile core networks and as a
    first\nstep, properties of paths and endpoints that allow to facilitate ALTO\ntransaction
    within such a scope.\n\t </p>\n      "
