abstract:
- content: "<p>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a very simple TRIVIAL
    protocol that has been in use on the Internet for quite a long time. While this
    document discourages its continued use, largely due to security concerns, we do
    define a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme, as well as discuss the protocol's
    applicability.</p>"
