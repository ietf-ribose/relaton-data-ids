abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Each I2NSF agent and I2NSF client needs to provide application
    level\n   support for management traffic during periods of DDoS and network\n
    \  security attacks to deal with congestion (burst and/or continuous),\n   high
    error rates and packet loss due to the attacks, and the\n   inability to utilize
    a transport protocol (E.g.  TCP) due to a\n   specific protocol attack.  This
    application level support needs to be\n   able to select the key management system
    and provide \"chunking\" of\n   data (in order to fit in reduced effective MTUs),
    compression of data\n   (in order to fit into reduced bandwidth), small security
    envelope )in\n   order to maximize room for management payload), and fragmentation
    and\n   reassembly at the application layer for those protocols which do not\n
    \  support fragmentation/reassembly (E.g.  UDP or SMS).\n\n   These Secure Session
    Layer services may only be deployed on a the few\n   management ports which need
    to be protected during DDoS attacks or\n   network security attacks, and turned
    on/off based on need.  The\n   application and the network instrumentation need
    to cooperate to\n   determine if this service needs to be turned on or off.  This
    draft\n   specifies a security session layer services(SSLs) which provide these\n
    \  features in terms of APIs (North-Bound and South-bound), and the\n   component
    features (interface to key management systems, data\n   compression, chunking
    of data, secure session envelope (SSE) to send\n   data, and fragmentation and
    reassembly, and ability to detect\n   existence of attack).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
