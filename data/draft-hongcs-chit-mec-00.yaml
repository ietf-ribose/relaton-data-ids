abstract:
  content: "\t <t>By collocating servers at base stations, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)provides
    low latency to users for real time applications such asVirtual Reality and Augmented
    Reality. To satisfy the growing demandof users, base stations are deployed densely
    in highly populatedareas. Coordinated Multipoint Transmission (CoMP) allows users
    toconnect to multiple base stations simultaneously. In ultra-densenetworks, by
    offloading the partials of tasks to different basestations, users can achieve
    lower latency and utilize the computationability of the surrounding base stations.
    To control the signalingoverhead, the number of base stations that can be connected
    should belimited. In this paper, we propose a user-centric base stationassignment
    algorithm by considering the possible load of basestations. Moreover, a partial
    task offloading algorithm is proposedto utilize the computation of under-loaded
    base stations. Resourceallocation is then solved by convex optimization.</p>"
