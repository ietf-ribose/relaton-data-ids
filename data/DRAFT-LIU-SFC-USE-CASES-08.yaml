abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The delivery of value-added services relies on the invocation
    of\n   advanced Service Functions in a sequential order.  This mechanism is\n
    \  called Service Function Chaining (SFC).  The set of involved Service\n   Functions
    and their order depends on the service context and other\n   deployment-specific
    considerations.\n\n   Having a single use case document eases the effort of deriving\n
    \  requirements that are to be met by SFC solution(s).  Moreover, it\n   allows
    to identify commonalities between the various use cases that\n   are of interest.
    \ This document presents a set of general use cases\n   of Service Function Chaining
    (SFC).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
