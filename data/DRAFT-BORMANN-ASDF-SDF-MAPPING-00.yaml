abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain
    experts\n   to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models\n
    \  in the Internet of Things.  It was created as a common language for\n   use
    in the development of the One Data Model liaison organization\n   (OneDM) definitions.
    \ Tools convert this format to database formats\n   and other serializations as
    needed.\n\n   An SDF specification often needs to be augmented by additional\n
    \  information that is specific to its use in a particular ecosystem or\n   application.
    \ SDF mapping files provide a mechanism to represent this\n   augmentation.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
