abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network File System v4 (NFSv4) allows a client to both
    open a\n   file and be granted a delegation of that file.  This provides the\n
    \  client the right to cache metadata on the file locally.  This\n   document
    presents several refinements to both the opening and\n   delegating of the file
    to the client.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
