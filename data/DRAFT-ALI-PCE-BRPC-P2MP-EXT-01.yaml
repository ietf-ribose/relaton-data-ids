  content: "\n\t <p>The ability to compute constrained Traffic Engineering Label \n\nSwitched
    Paths (TE LSPs) for point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs \n\nin Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS \n\n(GMPLS) networks across multiple domains
    (where a domain is \n\na collection of network elements within a common sphere
    of \n\naddress management or path computational responsibility such \n\nas an
    IGP area or an Autonomous Systems) has been identified \n\nas a key requirement
    [PCEP-P2MP-REQ]. This document addresses \n\nthis requirement by extending backward
    recursive path \n\ncomputation (BRPC) technique proposed for Point-to-Point \n\n(P2P)
    LSPs in [P2P-BRPC] for P2MP LSP path computation in a \n\nmultiple domains network.
    \ \n \nConventions used in this document \n\n\nIn examples, \"C:\" and \"S:\"
    indicate lines sent by the client \n\nand server respectively. \n\n\nThe key words
    \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \n\n\"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", \n\nand \"OPTIONAL\" in this document
    are to be interpreted as \n\ndescribed in RFC-2119 0.\n\t </p>\n      "
