abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF has provided some tools for remote participation in its\n
    \  activities for many years, and some IETF participants have also used\n   their
    own tools when they felt the need arise.  The IETF now wishes\n   to support enhanced
    remote participation that is as seamless as\n   possible, improving the experience
    for the remote attendee at the\n   IETF regular meetings and interim meetings
    without degrading the\n   experience for the people that are physically present.
    \ Before\n   deploying the new tools and services needed for this enhanced remote\n
    \  participation, the requirements for such tools and services, and the\n   impacts
    they will make on the current procedures and infrastructure,\n   must be defined.
    \ This document is meant to be that definition.\n\t </p>\n      "
