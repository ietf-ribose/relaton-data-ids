abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       White space allocation and reutilization has attracted
    increasing\n       attention since they allow a more efficient way to gather spectrum\n
    \      usage information and keep assigning a proper spectrum to a\n       secondary
    user. This document provides an extended protocol to\n       construct a specific
    white space usage map with better interaction\n       between devices and spectrum
    database. By this mechanism, the Master\n       device or Slave Device sends the
    environmental spectrum to the\n       Database and obtains more frequency points
    to select the most\n       appropriate white space spectrum it could use in the
    local\n       regulatory domain. With regard to White Space Database, more white\n
    \      space information can be recorded for devices to choose. The\n       mechanism
    is an extension of protocol to access spectrum database.\n       We develop extended
    protocol data models under different scenarios\n       to enhance interaction
    of these networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
