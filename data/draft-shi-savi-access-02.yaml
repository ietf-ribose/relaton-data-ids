abstract:
- content: "<p>An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is always confronted with many security
    threats based on IP address spoofing. Unfortunately, the Internet architecture
    fails to provide the defense mechanism. Source Address Validation Improvement
    (SAVI) was developed to prevent IP source address spoofing which can enable impersonation
    and malicious traffic redirection. Thus, the mechanism is essential for ISPs.
    However, due to the diversity of address assignment methods, SAVI solution is
    also different accordingly. This document describes five scenarios of ISPs'IPv6
    access network, and moreover, states its SAVI requirements and tentative solutions
    accordingly.</p>"
