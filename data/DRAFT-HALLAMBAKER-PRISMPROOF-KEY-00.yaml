abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes previous efforts and their deployment
    legacy\n   and the requirements for a successful email security infrastructure.\n
    \  A gap analysis is performed and the tasks divided into problems that\n   are
    generally considered solved albeit possibly requiring improved\n   execution and
    problems that may be regarded as research.\n\n   This division of the problem
    space into 'execution' and 'research'\n   portions allows different groups of
    developers to address each\n   independently and avoid unnecessary duplication
    of effort. A testbed\n   for development and early adopter deployment that achieves
    this\n   separation is described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
