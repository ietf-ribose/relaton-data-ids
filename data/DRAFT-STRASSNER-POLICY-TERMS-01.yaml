abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Recent work in the IETF has led to multiple protocols which support\nthe
    classification of packets for the purposes of treating certain\nclasses or flows
    of packets in a particular way compared to other\npackets. The successful wide-scale
    deployment of these protocols\ndepends on the ability to administer and distribute
    consistent policy\ninformation to the multiple devices in the network which perform
    the\nclassification and packet conditioning or treatment. As a result,\nthere
    is a clear need to develop a scalable framework for policy\nadministration and
    distribution that will enable interoperability\namong multiple devices and device
    types that must work together to\nachieve a consistent implementation of policy.\n
    \nUnfortunately, terms like 'policy' and 'service' are not\ncurrently defined
    in sufficient detail as to enable the definition,\nspecification, and implementation
    of policy servers and how policy is\nrecognized and enforced at the device level.
    At present, both 'policy'\nand 'service' (as well as other related terms) are
    overloaded with\nmultiple (often conflicting) meanings. This makes communication
    about\npolicy in general and specifically policy-based networking cumbersome\nand
    difficult.\n \nThis document defines a set of terms that the Internet community
    can\nuse to exchange ideas on how policy creation, administration,\nmanagement,
    and distribution could work among policy servers and\nmultiple device types.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
