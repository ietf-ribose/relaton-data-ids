abstract:
- content: "<p>This document attempts to give guidelines for the people who have to
    deal with existing protocols where issues of languages and character sets were
    not considered from the beginning, and tries to help them a little along the way.
    Some of the advice might also be useful for people designing new protocols.</p>"
