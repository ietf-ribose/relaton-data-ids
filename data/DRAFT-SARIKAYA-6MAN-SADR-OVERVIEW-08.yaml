abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents the source address dependent routing
    (SADR)\n   problem space from the host perspective.  Both multihomed hosts and\n
    \  hosts with multiple interfaces are considered.  Several network\n   architectures
    are presented to illustrate why source address\n   selection and next hop resolution
    in view of source address dependent\n   routing is needed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
