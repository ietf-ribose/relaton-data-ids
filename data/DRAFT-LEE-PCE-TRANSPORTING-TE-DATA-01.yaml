abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to compute and provide optimal paths, Path Computation\n
    \  Elements (PCEs) require an accurate and timely Traffic Engineering\n   Database
    (TED). Traditionally this TED has been obtained from a link\n   state routing
    protocol supporting traffic engineering extensions.\n   This document discusses
    possible alternatives and enhancements to\n   the existing approach to TED creation.
    This document gives\n   architectural alternatives for these alternatives and
    their\n   potential impacts on network nodes, routing protocols, and PCEP.\n\n\n\n\t
