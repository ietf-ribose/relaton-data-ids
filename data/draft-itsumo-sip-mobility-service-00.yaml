  content: "<p>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can be used to provide means ofpersonal,
    terminal, and service mobility in a mobile Internet. Thisdocument describes two

    that call states are maintainedand stored within the network and home network
    always controls callsand services of its subscribers. The second assumes that
    call statesare stored in the mobile stations (MSs) and managed in a distributedmanner,
    and the visited network controls users' calls and services.</p>"
