abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a format, called JSON Type Definition (JTD),
    for describing the shape of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) messages. Its main
    goals are to enable code generation from schemas as well as portable validation
    with standardized error indicators. To this end, JTD is intentionally limited
    to be no more expressive than the type systems of mainstream programming languages.
    This intentional limitation, as well as the decision to make JTD schemas be JSON
    documents, makes tooling atop of JTD easier to build. This document does not have
    IETF consensus and is presented here to facilitate experimentation with the concept
    of JTD.</p>"
