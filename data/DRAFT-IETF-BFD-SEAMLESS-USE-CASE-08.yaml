abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes various use cases for Seamless Bidirectional
    Forwarding Detection (S-BFD) and provides requirements such that protocol mechanisms
    allow for simplified detection of forwarding failures.\n\n These use cases support
    S-BFD, which is a simplified mechanism for using BFD with a large proportion of
    negotiation aspects eliminated, accelerating the establishment of a BFD session.
    The benefits of S-BFD include quick provisioning, as well as improved control
    and flexibility for network nodes initiating path monitoring.\n\t </p>\n      "
