abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>HIP proxies play an important role in the transition from the
    \ncurrent Internet architecture to the HIP architecture. A core \nobjective of
    a HIP proxy is to facilitate the communications between \nlegacy (or Non-HIP)
    hosts and HIP hosts while not modifying their \nprotocol stacks. In this document,
    the legacy hosts served by \nproxies are referred to as the Made-up Legacy (ML)
    hosts. Currently, \nvarious designing solutions of HIP proxies have been proposed.
    These \nsolutions may be applicable in different working circumstances. In \nthis
    document, we attempt to investigate these solutions in detail \nand compare their
    performances in different scenarios.\n\t </p>\n      "
