abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There is a great deal of concern over the security of routing systemswithin
    the Internet, particularly in relation to the Border GatewayProtocol [BGP], which
    is used to provide routing information betweenautonomous systems. This draft addresses
    various deployment scenariosand options using the extensions to BGP outlined in
    [SOBGP-BGP] inconjunction with [SOBGP-KEY] (which is not yet completed orpublished)
    and [SOBGP-RADIUS]. Each section of this draft discusses adifferent deployment
    situation or deployment option. The finalsection discusses how private key rollovers
    can be accomplished withno loss of routing information within soBGP deployments.</p>"
