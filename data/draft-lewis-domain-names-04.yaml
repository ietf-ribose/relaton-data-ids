abstract:
- content: "<p>This document researches the origin of the term Domain Name in the
    Request for Comments document series, documenting that the term did not originate
    in the documents defining the Domain Name System. The document describes how the
    term came to be used, how the DNS followed, and surveys the diverse ways Domain
    Names have been interpreted within various protocols over time. The purpose of
    this is to give a solid foundation for work on Domain Names across all protocols
    making use of Domain Names.</p>"
