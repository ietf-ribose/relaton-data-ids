abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Adhoc networks are formed by the spontaneous collaboration ofwireless
    nodes when no networking infrastructure is available. Whencommunication to the
    Internet is desired, one or more nodes must actas gateways for the adhoc network.
    In this case, global addressing ofadhoc nodes is required. This document specifies
    a protocol (nodebehaviour, information propagation, message format) which allowsnodes
    in an adhoc network to discover a gateway/prefix pair which isused in order to
    build an IPv6 global address and, when necessary, tomaintain a default route towards
    the Internet.</p>"
