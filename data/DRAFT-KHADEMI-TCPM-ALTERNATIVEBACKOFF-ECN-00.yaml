abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo updates the TCP sender-side reaction to a congestion\n
    \  notification received via Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).\n   The updated
    method reduces FlightSize in Congestion Avoidance by a\n   smaller amount than
    the TCP reaction to loss.  The intention is to\n   achieve good throughput when
    the queue at the bottleneck is smaller\n   than the bandwidth-delay-product of
    the connection.  This is more\n   likely when an Active Queue Management (AQM)
    mechanism has used ECN\n   to CE-mark a packet, than when a packet was lost.  Future
    versions of\n   this document will also describe a corresponding method for SCTP.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
