abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A micro-loop is a packet forwarding loop that may occur transiently\n
    \  among two or more routers in a hop-by-hop packet forwarding paradigm.\n\n   In
    this document, we are trying to analyze the impact of using\n   different Link
    State IGP implementations in a single network in\n   regards of microloops.  The
    analysis is focused on the SPF triggers\n   and SPF delay algorithm.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
