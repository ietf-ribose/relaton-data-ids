abstract:
- content: "<p>A Threshold signature scheme is described. The signatures created are
    computationally indistinguishable from those produced using the Ed25519 and Ed448
    curves as specified in RFC8032 except in that they are non-deterministic. Threshold
    signatures are a form of digital signature whose creation requires two or more
    parties to interact but does not disclose the number or identities of the parties
    involved. https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/cfrg/ (http://whatever)Discussion
    of this draft should take place on the CFRG mailing list (cfrg@irtf.org), which
    is archived at .</p>"
