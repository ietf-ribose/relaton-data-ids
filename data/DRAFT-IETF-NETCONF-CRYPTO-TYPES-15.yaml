    a YANG module or modules that is/are part of a\n   collection of drafts that work
    together to produce the ultimate goal\n   of the NETCONF WG: to define configuration
    modules for NETCONF client\n   and servers, and RESTCONF client and servers.\n\n
    \  The relationship between the various drafts in the collection is\n   presented
    in the below diagram.\n\n                                  crypto-types\n                                    ^
