abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new SRv6 network function which can be used
    for SRv6 inter-layer network programming. It is a variant of the End.X function.
    Instead of pointing to an L3 adjacency, this function points to an underlay interface.
    Such a interface can stand for a underlay link or path/connection between two
    routers, which may be invisible in the L3 topology.</p>"
