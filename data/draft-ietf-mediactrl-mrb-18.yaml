abstract:
- content: "<p>The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF has proposed an architecture for
    controlling media services. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is used as the
    signalling protocol which provides many inherent capabilities for message routing.
    In addition to such signalling properties, a need exists for intelligent, application
    level media service selection based on non-static signalling properties. This
    is especially true when considered in conjunction with deployment architectures
    that include 1:M and M:N combinations of Application Servers and Media Servers.
    This document introduces a Media Resource Broker (MRB) entity which manages the
    availability of Media Servers and the media resource demands of Application Servers.
    The document includes potential deployment options for an MRB and appropriate
    interfaces to Application Servers and Media Servers.</p>"
