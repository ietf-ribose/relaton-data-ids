abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Slicing is considered as an important approach to provide\n
    \  different services and customers with the required network\n   connectivity,
    network resources and performance characteristics over\n   a shared network.  Operators
    have started the deployment of network\n   slices in their networks for different
    purposes.  This document\n   introduces several deployment cases of IETF network
    slices in\n   operator networks.  Some considerations collected from these IETF\n
    \  network slice deployments are also provided.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
