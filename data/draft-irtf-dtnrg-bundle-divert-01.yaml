abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines two extensions to the capabilities of a BundleProtocol
    Agent (BPA) (as defined in [refs.DTNBP]) that is processingbundles within the
    context of a Delay-Tolerant Network architecture[refs.DTNarch]. It defines an
    operation called \"diversion\", which isthe act of a bundle protocol agent moving
    an entire bundle from somepoint in bundle processing in the BPA to a DTN application
    agent.This diversion of a bundle from the BPA to an application agent isdistinct
    from delivery of the bundle at that application agent. Thisdocument defines a
    second operation, called \"injection\", which is theinverse of diversion. Injection
    is the act of an application agentmoving an entire bundle from the application
    agent into some point inbundle processing in the BPA. This injection of a bundle
    from anapplication agent to the BPA is distinct from bundle transmission.</p>"
