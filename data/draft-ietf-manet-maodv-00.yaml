abstract:
  content: "<p>The multicast operation of the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector(AODV)
    routing protocol (MAODV) is intended for use by mobile nodesin an ad hoc network.
    It offers quick adaptation to dynamic linkconditions, low processing and memory
    overhead, and low networkutilization. It creates bi-directional shared multicast
    treesconnecting multicast sources and receivers. These multicast treesare maintained
    as long as group members exist within the connectedportion of the network. Each
    multicast group has a group leaderwhose responsibility is maintaining the group
    sequence number, whichis used to ensure freshness of routing information.</p>"
