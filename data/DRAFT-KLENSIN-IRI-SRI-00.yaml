abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   While the URI specification has been widely deployed, it has
    long\n   been recognized that many valid URIs, especially those that contain\n
    \  extensive information in the \"tail\" are unsuitable for user\n   presentation,
    especially for internationalized environments.  IRIs\n   have been proposed as
    a solution for that problem but inherit (and\n   are constrained by) the complex
    and sometimes method-dependent syntax\n   model of URIs as well as positional
    and ordering assumptions that\n   make them more difficult to localize than is
    desirable.\n\n   This specification illustrates a way to define an \"above URI\"
    model\n   for a localization-friendly simple reference identifier (SRI) that\n
    \  explicitly identifies fields and is more appropriate than IRIs to\n   support
    localization.  The current version is intended simply to\n   initiate a discussion.
    \ In particular, while it is written to use an\n   XML element syntax model, variations
    using JSON or some other system\n   with explicitly-labeled data fields might
    be as, or more,\n   appropriate.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
