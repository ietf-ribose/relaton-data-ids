abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents NETCONF Call Home, which enables a NETCONF\n
    \  server to initiate a secure connection to the NETCONF client.\n   NETCONF Call
    Home supports both the SSH and TLS transports, and does\n   so in a way that preserves
    the SSH and TLS roles when compared to\n   standard NETCONF over SSH or TLS connections.\n\n\t
