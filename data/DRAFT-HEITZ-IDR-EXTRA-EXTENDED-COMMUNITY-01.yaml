abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Auto-derived identifiers are used by applications to enable
    zero\n   configuration features.  Such identifiers are often a combination of\n
    \  primitive identifiers and are thus longer.  In addition, existing\n   identifiers
    have grown longer.  IP addresses have grown from 4 octets\n   to 16.  AS numbers
    have grown from 2 octets to 4.  In order to\n   accommodate such longer identifiers
    in BGP extended communities, this\n   document defines a new BGP path attribute,
    the Extra Extended\n   Communities attribute.  It is similar to the Extended Community,
    but\n   is 24 octets long.  Communities are mostly used within ASes under a\n
    \  single administration or between neighboring ASes.  Limiting the\n   spread
    of communities beyond their intended reach and polluting the\n   internet at large
    is complex and error prone.  To simplify this,\n   enhanced transitivity options
    are provided.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
