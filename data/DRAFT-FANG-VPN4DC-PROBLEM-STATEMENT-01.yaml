abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Service Providers commonly use BGP/MPLS VPNs [RFC 4364]
    as\n   the control plane for virtual networks. This technology has proven\n   to
    scale to a large number of VPNs and attachment points, and it is\n   well suited
    for Data Center connectivity, especially when\n   supporting all IP applications.\n\n
    \  The Data Center environment presents new challenges and imposes\n   additional
    requirements to IP VPN technologies, including multi-\n   tenancy support, high
    scalability, VM mobility, security, and\n   orchestration. This document describes
    the problems and defines the\n   new requirements.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
