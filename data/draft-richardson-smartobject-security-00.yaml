abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a position paper for the pre-IETF83 Workshop on Smart Object
    Security. The author contends that layer-2 security solutions are not only in-adequate,
    but may in fact be harmful when deployed into smart object systems. While layer-2
    security services may be valuable, they must be channel bound up to the layer-7
    application layer.</p>"
