abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An increasing diversity of Web-connected devices and software\n
    \  capabilities has created a need to deliver optimized content for each\n   device.\n\n
    \  This specification defines a set of HTTP request header fields,\n   colloquially
    known as Client Hints, to address this.  They are\n   intended to be used as input
    to proactive content negotiation; just\n   as the Accept header allows clients
    to indicate what formats they\n   prefer, Client Hints allow clients to indicate
    a list of device and\n   agent specific preferences.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
