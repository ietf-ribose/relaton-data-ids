abstract:
  content: "<p>Most MIME syntax and semantics can usually be processed in a single
    passthrough the data. For example, the MIME boundary parameter alwaysappears before
    it is used. This is not the case with multipart/alternative MIME entities. Theprocessor
    of the data cannot know the MIME types of the altnernativespresent until all alternatives
    have been processed. Thus, it is notpossible for a one pass processor to consider
    more than the first andmost limited representation, because a subsequent part
    may be somethingthat cannot be handled.</p>"
