abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes service classes configured with DiffServ
    and\n   identifies how they are used and how to construct them using\n   Differentiated
    Services Code Points (DSCPs), traffic conditioners,\n   Per-Hop Behaviors (PHBs),
    and Active Queue Management (AQM)\n   mechanisms.  There is no intrinsic requirement
    that particular\n   DSCPs, traffic conditioners, PHBs, and AQM be used for a certain\n
    \  service class, but for consistent behavior under the same network\n   conditions,
    configuring networks as described here is appropriate.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
