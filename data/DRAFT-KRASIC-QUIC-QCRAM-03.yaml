abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The design of the core QUIC transport and the mapping of HTTP\n
    \  semantics over it subsume many HTTP/2 features, prominent among them\n   stream
    multiplexing and HTTP header compression.  A key advantage of\n   the QUIC transport
    is it provides stream multiplexing free of HoL\n   blocking between streams, while
    in HTTP/2 multiplexed streams can\n   suffer HoL blocking primarily due to HTTP/2's
    layering above TCP.\n   However if HPACK is used for header compression, HTTP
    over QUIC is\n   still vulnerable to HoL blocking, because of how HPACK exploits\n
    \  header redundancies between multiplexed HTTP transactions.  This\n   draft
    defines QCRAM, a variation of HPACK and mechanisms in the QUIC\n   HTTP mapping
    that allow QUIC implementations the flexibility to avoid\n   header-compression
    induced HoL blocking.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
