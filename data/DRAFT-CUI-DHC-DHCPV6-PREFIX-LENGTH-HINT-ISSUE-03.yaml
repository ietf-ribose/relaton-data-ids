abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation [RFC3633] allows a requesting router
    to\n   include a prefix-length hint value in the IA_PD option to indicate a\n
    \  preference for the size of the prefix to be delegated, but is unclear\n   about
    how the requesting router and delegating router should act in\n   different situations
    involving the prefix-length hint.  This document\n   provides a summary of the
    existing problems with the prefix-length\n   hint and guidance on what the requesting
    router and delegating router\n   could do in different situations.\n\n\t </p>\n
