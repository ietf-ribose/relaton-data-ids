abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The concepts in this document are based on work on\nQ.Flowstatesig
    in the ITU SG11/Q5. Flow State Aware Signaling\nhas been worked on in the ITU
    for the past 13 years. However,\nthis document stands on its own since no IETF
    compatible format\nhas yet been adopted. The goal of this protocol is to provide\n(1)
    a technique to have network nodes provide available rate\nflows (like TCP) rapid
    and periodic feedback to the sender as to\nthe maximum rate they should send and
    (2) to provide network\nfeedback to fixed rate flows (like UDP voice) if the peak
    rate\nthey require can be statistically assured. Network traffic using\nthis protocol
    should experience reduced response time, less\nqueuing delay and less packet discards.
    The use of this protocol\nis limited to bounded subnets at the network edge and
    is to be\nconverted to and from standard IP flows at the subnet\nboundaries.\n\t
