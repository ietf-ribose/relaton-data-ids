abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces Network Slicing problems and the motivation\n
    \  for new work areas. It represents an initial revision of the Network\n   Slicing
    problem statement derived from the analysis of the technical\n   gaps in IETF
    protocols ecosystem.  It complements and brings together\n   the silo efforts
    being carried out in several other IETF working groups\n   to achieve certain
    aspects of Network Slicing functions and operations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
