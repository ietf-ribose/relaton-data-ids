abstract:
- content: "<p>Deprecation of the subnet ID in IPv6 networking is proposed; the subnet
    ID is set to zero so that all nodes in a site carry the same prefix. While the
    procedures for neighbor discovery and duplicate address detection have to be changed,
    possible simplification gains in IPv6 networking including that of intra-site
    host- and subnet- mobility might be worth the modification. Site-external behaviors
    don't change through this modification, enabling incremental deployment of the
    proposal. Sites of manageable sizes for which scalability is not much a critical
    issue might consider the mode of operation proposed in this document.</p>"
