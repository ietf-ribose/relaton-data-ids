abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an update of TLS 1.2 for long-term support,
    one that incoporates as far as possible what's already deployed for TLS 1.2 but
    with the security holes and bugs fixed. This represents a stable, known-good version
    that can be deployed to systems that can't roll out ongoing patches and updates
    every time a new attack on standard TLS appears.</p>"
