abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     This memo defines the Receiver Initiated Shortcut Path (RISP)\n
    \    protocol for NBMA networks.  The protocol extends the NHRP message\n     set
    by adding Callback Request and Reply messages to allow the\n     destination host
    (or its corresponding egress router) to establish\n     a shortcut path for a
    data flow, using the existing NBMA signaling\n     protocols.  Because of this
    receiver-initiated mechanism, a\n     shortcut-capable network can use just the
    NBMA ARP servers, such as\n     the ATMARP servers, instead of the more complex
    Next Hop\n     Servers. This draft also describes how to extend NHRP with the
    new,\n     receiver-initiated mechanism.\n\t </p>\n      "
