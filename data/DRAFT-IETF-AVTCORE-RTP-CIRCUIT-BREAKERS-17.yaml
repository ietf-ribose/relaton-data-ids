abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony,\n
    \  video conferencing, and telepresence applications.  Such applications\n   are
    often run on best-effort UDP/IP networks.  If congestion control\n   is not implemented
    in these applications, then network congestion can\n   lead to uncontrolled packet
    loss, and a resulting deterioration of\n   the user's multimedia experience.  The
    congestion control algorithm\n   acts as a safety measure, stopping RTP flows
    from using excessive\n   resources, and protecting the network from overload.
    \ At the time of\n   this writing, however, while there are several proprietary
    solutions,\n   there is no standard algorithm for congestion control of interactive\n
    \  RTP flows.\n\n   This document does not propose a congestion control algorithm.
    \ It\n   instead defines a minimal set of RTP circuit breakers: conditions\n   under
    which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting media data, to\n   protect the
    network from excessive congestion.  It is expected that,\n   in the absence of
    long-lived excessive congestion, RTP applications\n   running on best-effort IP
    networks will be able to operate without\n   triggering these circuit breakers.
    \ To avoid triggering the RTP\n   circuit breaker, any standards-track congestion
    control algorithms\n   defined for RTP will need to operate within the envelope
    set by these\n   RTP circuit breaker algorithms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
