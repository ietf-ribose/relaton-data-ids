abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data source authentication is an important requirement to provide\n
    \  multicast security. Data source authentication assures that the \n   member
    claiming to send the data is the actual sender. An imposter\n   member should
    not be able to claim to be the sender of the data.\n   This document proposes
    a scheme by which data source authentication\n   can be acheived. This approach
    does not use digital signatures or \n   assume any time synchronization between
    the sender and the \n   receivers. Instead of directly authenticating a multicast
    \n   communication, it is split into a 1-to-1 authenticated unicast to\n   GCKS
    followed by an authenticated multicast by GCKS. Message \n   Authentication Codes
    (MACs) are used instead of digital signatures in \n   both the authenticated unicast
    and the authenticated multicast.\n\t </p>\n      "
