abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a format, called JSON Type Definition
    (JTD),\n   for describing the shape of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)\n   messages.
    \ Its main goals are to enable code generation from schemas\n   as well as portable
    validation with standardized error indicators.\n   To this end, JTD is intentionally
    limited to be no more expressive\n   than the type systems of mainstream programming
    languages.  This\n   intentional limitation, as well as the decision to make JTD
    schemas\n   be JSON documents, makes tooling atop of JTD easier to build.\n\n
    \  This document does not have IETF consensus and is presented here to\n   facilitate
    experimentation with the concept of JTD.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
