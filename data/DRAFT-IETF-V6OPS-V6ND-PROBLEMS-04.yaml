abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough
    to cover\n   the actual number of machines on the subnet.  In contrast, the\n
    \  default IPv6 subnet size is a /64, a number so large it covers\n   trillions
    of addresses, the overwhelming number of which will be\n   unassigned.  Consequently,
    simplistic implementations of Neighbor\n   Discovery (ND) can be vulnerable to
    deliberate or accidental denial\n   of service, whereby they attempt to perform
    address resolution for\n   large numbers of unassigned addresses.  Such denial
    of attacks can be\n   launched intentionally (by an attacker), or result from
    legitimate\n   operational tools or accident conditions.  As a result of these\n
    \  vulnerabilities, new devices may not be able to \"join\" a network, it\n   may
    be impossible to establish new IPv6 flows, and existing IPv6\n   transported flows
    may be interrupted.\n\n   This document describes the potential for DOS in detail
    and suggests\n   possible implementation improvements as well as operational\n
    \  mitigation techniques that can in some cases be used to protect\n   against
    or at least alleviate the impact of such attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
