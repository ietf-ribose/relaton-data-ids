abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SIP is selected as a session control protocol for many VOIP \napplications.
    Hence it should provide capabilities for supporting \nsuch redirection-based services
    as automatic call distribution for \ncall centers, third-party voicemail, follow-me
    service etc. The \nconcept of Call Redirection is implicit in the capabilities
    already \ndefined for SIP Proxies and Clients.\n\t </p>\n      "
