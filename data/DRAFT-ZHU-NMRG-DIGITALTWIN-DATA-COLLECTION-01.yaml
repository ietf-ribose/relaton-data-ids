abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Digital Twin Network is a network system with Physical Network
    and\n   Twin Network, which can be mapped interactively in real time.  The\n   construction
    of Digital Twin Network requires real-time data of\n   Physical Network to update
    the state of Twin Network.  However the\n   existing method collects the full
    amount of data from the Physical\n   Network for modeling, and does not consider
    the problems such as\n   time-lag, insufficient storage resources, low computational\n
    \  efficiency and waste of bandwidth resources.  This document\n   introduces
    an efficient data collection, aggregation and correlation\n   method in which
    the Twin Network sends instructions to the Physical\n   Network to collect data
    on demand, and then the Physical Network\n   completes instructions such as knowledge
    representation, Telemetry\n   Streaming Element of Physical Network completes
    data aggregation and\n   correlation.  Finally Telemetry Streaming Element sends
    the processed\n   data to the Twin Network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
