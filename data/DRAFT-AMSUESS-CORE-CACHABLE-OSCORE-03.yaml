abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Group communication with the Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP)\n   can be secured end-to-end using Group Object Security for Constrained\n
    \  RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE), also across untrusted\n   intermediary
    proxies.  However, this sidesteps the proxies' abilities\n   to cache responses
    from the origin server(s).  This specification\n   restores cacheability of protected
    responses at proxies, by\n   introducing consensus requests which any client in
    a group can send\n   to one server or multiple servers in the same group.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
