abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo puts forth a set of questions regarding Mobile Ad
    hoc\n   Network (MANET) routing protocol functionality and applicability.\n   Authors
    of MANET routing protocol draft submissions are requested to\n   include these
    questions (and corresponding answers) in a section in\n   their submissions.  The
    intent of this 'Applicability Section' is to\n   aid readers unfamiliar with the
    details of each protocol's design in\n   understanding the protocol's basic characteristics,
    functioning and\n   mechanisms, as well as to provide a general description of
    the\n   networking context for which the protocol was designed, and in which\n
    \  it is expected to perform well.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
