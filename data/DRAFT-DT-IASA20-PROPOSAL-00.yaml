abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally\n
    \  established in 2005.  In the intervening years, the needs of the IETF\n   have
    evolved in ways that require changes to its administrative\n   structure.  The
    IETF Chair started an effort in November of 2016 to\n   begin the process of changing
    the IETF administrative structure,\n   starting with a set of virtual workshops
    to get input from the IETF\n   community, and then encompassing a series of BOF
    sessions at IETF\n   meetings to define the problem, develop requirements, explore\n
    \  potential options for changes, and a Design Team - the authors of\n   this
    document - that would make recommendations.  The purpose of this\n   document
    is to collect all of the various materials that have lead up\n   to the Design
    Team recommendation that IETF be a Disregarded Limited\n   Liability Company (LLC)
    of the Internet Society.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
