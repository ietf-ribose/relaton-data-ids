abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) methods only allow
    access to a complete resource. This does not permit applications to access parts
    of a resource. In case of resources with larger or complex data, or in situations
    where a resource continuity is required, replacing or requesting the whole resource
    is undesirable. Several applications using CoAP will need to perform partial resource
    accesses. Similar to HTTP, the existing Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    GET method only allows the specification of a URI and request parameters in CoAP
    options, not the transfer of a request payload detailing the request. This leads
    to some applications to using POST where actually a cacheable, idempotent, safe
    request is desired. Again similar to HTTP, the existing Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) PUT method only allows to replace a complete resource. This also
    leads applications to use POST where actually a cacheable, possibly idempotent
    request is desired. This specification adds new CoAP methods, FETCH, to perform
    the equivalent of a GET with a request body; and the twin methods PATCH and iPATCH,
    to modify parts of an existing CoAP resource.</p>"
