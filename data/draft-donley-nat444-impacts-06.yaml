abstract:
- content: "<p>NAT444 is an IPv4 extension technology being considered by Service
    Providers as a means to continue offering IPv4 service to customers while transitioning
    to IPv6. This technology adds an extra Carrier- Grade NAT (CGN) in the Service
    Provider network, often resulting in two NATs. CableLabs, Time Warner Cable, and
    Rogers Communications independently tested the impacts of NAT444 on many popular
    Internet services using a variety of test scenarios, network topologies, and vendor
    equipment. This document identifies areas where adding a second layer of NAT disrupts
    the communication channel for common Internet applications. This document was
    updated to include the Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) impacts also.</p>"
