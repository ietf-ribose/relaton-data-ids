abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Bulk data applications are posing serious challenges to the Internetinfrastructure
    and more mass adoption of such applications would onlyincrease that challenge.
    P2P bulk data applications and other largevolume HTTP traffic such as video currently
    dominate the Internettraffic. These applications do not generally benefit from
    thetraffic engineering techniques developed for the Internet. In theHTTP traffic
    case, the traffic optimization issues are oftenaddressed using the CDN infrastructure.
    For P2P bulk dataapplications, the problem is about picking the right peers tocommunicate
    with and the criteria for doing this vary greatly basedon the application. Hence,
    intelligent peer selection is thefundamental problem to address for these applications.
    This documentexplains the multiple dimensions of the peer selection problem withrespect
    to obtaining information from the network as well from otherpeers and argues for
    an integrated, common framework to share suchinformation.</p>"
