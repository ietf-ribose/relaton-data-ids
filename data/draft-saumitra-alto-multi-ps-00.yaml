abstract:
- content: "<p>Bulk data applications are posing serious challenges to the Internet
    infrastructure and more mass adoption of such applications would only increase
    that challenge. P2P bulk data applications and other large volume HTTP traffic
    such as video currently dominate the Internet traffic. These applications do not
    generally benefit from the traffic engineering techniques developed for the Internet.
    In the HTTP traffic case, the traffic optimization issues are often addressed
    using the CDN infrastructure. For P2P bulk data applications, the problem is about
    picking the right peers to communicate with and the criteria for doing this vary
    greatly based on the application. Hence, intelligent peer selection is the fundamental
    problem to address for these applications. This document explains the multiple
    dimensions of the peer selection problem with respect to obtaining information
    from the network as well from other peers and argues for an integrated, common
    framework to share such information.</p>"
