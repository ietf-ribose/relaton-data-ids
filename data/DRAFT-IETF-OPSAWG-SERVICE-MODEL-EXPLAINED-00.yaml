abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF has produced a considerable number of data modules
    in the\n   YANG modelling language.  The majority of these modules are used to\n
    \  construct data models to model devices or monolithic functions and\n   they
    allow access for configuration and to read operational status.\n\n   A small number
    of YANG modules have been defined to model services\n   (for example, the Layer
    Three Virtual Private Network Service Model\n   produced by the L3SM working group
    and documented in RFC 8049).\n\n   This document briefly sets out the scope of
    and purpose of an IETF\n   service model, and it also shows where a service model
    might fit into\n   a Software Defined Networking architecture.  Note that service
    models\n   do not make any assumption of how a service is actually engineered\n
    \  and delivered for a customer; details of how network protocols and\n   devices
    are engineered to deliver a service are captured in other\n   models that are
    not exposed through the Customer-Provider Interface.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
