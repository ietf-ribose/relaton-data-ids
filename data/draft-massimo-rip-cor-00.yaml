abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft is intended to point out a difference of behaviour betweenthe
    RIP protocol as described in the RFC 2453 (also STD 56) and theRIP protocol as
    implemented by many vendors.If all the vendors apply the same rule, no problem
    arises. But, on thecontrary, serious problems of interoperability can occur.</p>"
