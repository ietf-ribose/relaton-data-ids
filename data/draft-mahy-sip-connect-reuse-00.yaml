abstract:
  content: "<p>When SIP entities use a connection oriented protocol to send arequest,
    they typically originate their connections from an ephemeralport. The SIP protocol
    includes mechanisms which insure thatresponses to a request, and new requests
    sent in the originaldirection reuse an existing connection. However, new requests
    sentin the opposite direction are unlikely to reuse the existingconnection. This
    frequently causes a pair of SIP entities to use oneconnection for requests sent
    in each direction, and can result inpotential scaling and performance problems.
    This document proposesrequirements and a mechanism which address this deficiency.</p>"
