abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC7575 defines Intent as an abstract high-level policy used
    to\n   operate the network. Intent management system includes an interface\n   for
    users to input requests and an engine to translate the intents\n   into the network
    configuration and manage their lifecycle. Up to\n   now, there is no commonly
    agreed definition, interface or model of\n   intent.\n\n   This document discusses
    what intent means to different stakeholders,\n   describes different ways to classify
    intent, and an associated\n   taxonomy of this classification. This is a foundation
    for discussion\n   intent related topics.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
