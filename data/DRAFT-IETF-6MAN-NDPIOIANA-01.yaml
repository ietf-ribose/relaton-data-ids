abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Prefix Information Option in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
    Router\n   Advertisement defines an 8-bit flag field with two flags defined and\n
    \  the remaining 6 bits reserved (Reserved1).  RFC 6275 has defined a\n   new
    flag from this field without creating a IANA registry or updating\n   RFC 4861.
    \ The purpose of this document is to request that IANA to\n   create a new registry
    for the PIO flags to avoid potential conflict\n   in the use of these flags.  This
    document updates RFC 4861.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
