abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The completion of IPv4 address allocations from IANA and the RIRs
    is\ncausing service providers around the world to question how they will\ncontinue
    providing IPv4 connectivity service to their subscribers\nwhen there are no longer
    sufficient IPv4 addresses to allocate them\none per subscriber.  Several possible
    solutions to this problem are\nnow emerging based around the idea of shared IPv4
    addressing.  These\nsolutions give rise to a number of issues and this memo identifies\nthose
    common to all such address sharing approaches.  Solution-\nspecific discussions
    are out of scope.\n\t </p>\n      "
