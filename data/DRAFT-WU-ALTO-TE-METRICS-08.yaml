abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the\n   Endpoint
    Cost Service.  Future extensions to ALTO may also use Cost\n   Metric.\n\n   Different
    applications may benefit from different Cost Metrics.  For\n   example, a Resource
    Consumer may prefer Resource Providers that have\n   low delay to the Resource
    Consumer.  However the base ALTO protocol\n   [ALTO] has defined only a single
    cost metric, i.e., the generic\n   \"routingcost\" metric (Sec. 14.2 of ALTO base
    specification [ALTO]).\n\n   In this document, we proposes a set of Cost Metrics,
    derived and\n   aggregated from routing protocols with different granularity and\n
    \  scope, such as BGP-LS,OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE, or from end to end traffic\n   management
    tool.  We currently define 11 new Performance Metric to\n   measure network delay,
    jitter, packet loss, hop count, and bandwidth.\n   The metrics defined in this
    document provide a relatively\n   comprehensive set of Cost Metrics for ALTO and
    allow applications to\n   determine \"where\" to connect based on end to end network
    performance\n   criteria.  Additional Cost Metrics such as financial cost metrics
    may\n   be defined in other documents.\n\n   \n\t </p>\n      "
