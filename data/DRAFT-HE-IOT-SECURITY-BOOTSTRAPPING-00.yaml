abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network level security bootstrapping and joining device level\n
    \  security bootstrapping mechanisms are described in this document.\n   They
    are proposed for security bootstrapping of the Internet of\n   Things networks,
    which implement IETF protocols (e.g. 6LoWPAN, 6lo,\n   RPL, AODV, DSR) over IEEE
    802.15.4.  The network level security\n   bootstrapping is useful at the very
    beginning of a newly deployed IoT\n   network.  It automatically and hierarchically
    adds all the devices to\n   security domain and helps establish security communication.
    \ The\n   joining device level security bootstrapping provides comprehensive\n
    \  mechanism for different IoT devices joining an existing IoT network.\n\n\t
