abstract:
- content: "<p>Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) uses
    AEAD algorithms to ensure confidentiality and integrity of exchanged messages.
    Due to known issues allowing forgery attacks against AEAD algorithms, limits should
    be followed on the number of times a specific key is used for encryption or decryption.
    This document defines how two OSCORE peers must follow these limits and what steps
    they must take to preserve the security of their communications. Therefore, this
    document updates RFC8613. Furthermore, this document specifies a lightweight method
    that two peers can use to update their keying material and establish a new OSCORE
    Security Context.</p>"
