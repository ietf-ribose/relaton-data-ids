abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In support of Segment Routing(SR), routing protocols advertise
    a\n   variety of identifiers used to define the segments that direct packet\n
    \  forwarding.\n\n   In cases where the information advertised by a given protocol\n
    \  instance is either internally inconsistent or conflicts with\n   advertisements
    from another protocol instance a means of notifying\n   the originator about the
    inconsistency is required.  This document\n   defines a generic mechanism to notify
    the BGP originator about the\n   inconsistency in the network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
