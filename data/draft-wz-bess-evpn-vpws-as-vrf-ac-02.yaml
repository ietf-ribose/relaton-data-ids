abstract:
- content: <p>When a VRF Attachment Cirucit (VRF-AC) is far away from its IP-VRF instance,
    we can deploy an EVPN VPWS ([RFC8214]) between that VRF-AC and its IP-VRF instance.
    From the viewpoint of the IP-VRF instance, a local virtual interface takes the
    place of that remote "VRF-AC". The IP address for that VRF-AC is now configured
    to the virtual interface, in other words, the virtual interface is the actual
    VRF-AC of the IP-VRF instance. The virtual interface is also the AC of that VPWS
    instance, in other words, the virtual interface is cross- connected to that remote
    "VRF-AC" by the VPWS instance. This document proposes an extension to [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-inter-subnet-forwarding]
    to support this scenario.</p>
