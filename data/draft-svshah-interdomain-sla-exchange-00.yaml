abstract:
- content: "<p>Network administrators typically provision QoS policies for their application
    traffic (such as voice, video etc) based on SLAs with their providers and translating
    those SLAs to vendor specific provisioning language. Both learning of SLA, either
    thru SLA documents or via some other out of band method, and translating them
    to vendor specific provisioning language is a complex, many times manual, process
    and prone to errors. This draft proposes an in-band method of SLA signaling which
    can help to simplify some of the complexities. An optional transitive BGP attribute
    proposed in this document intends to signal SLA details in-band, across administrative
    boundaries (considered as Autonomous Systems (AS)), and thus simplify/speed-up
    some of the complex tasks. Though the use-case with the proposed attribute is
    explicitly defined in this document, purpose of this attribute is not limited
    to this use-case only.</p>"
