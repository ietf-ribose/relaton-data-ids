abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Explicit congestion notification (ECN) allows a forwarding
    element to\n   notify downstream devices, including the destination, of the onset
    of\n   congestion without having to drop packets. This can improve network\n   efficiency
    through better flow control without packet drops. This\n   document extends ECN
    to TRILL switches, including integration with IP\n   ECN, and provides for ECN
    marking in the TRILL Header Extension Flags\n   Word (see RFC 7179).\n\n\n\t </p>\n
