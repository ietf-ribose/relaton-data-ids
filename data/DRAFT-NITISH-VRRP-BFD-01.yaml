abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft presents an enhanced failure detection mechanism
    to detect\n   the failure of VRRP Master router on the LAN using a peer learning\n
    \  mode.  Typically the VRRP protocol is able to perform the transparent\n   fail-over
    detection within a time period of 3 seconds with default\n   fail-over timers.
    \ Real-time protocols (voice/video/real-time\n   transactional) require a maximum
    network disruption in the order of\n   150ms for traffic on the network.  A failure
    detection and fail-over\n   time of 150ms on conventionally configured VRRP protocol
    is extremely\n   aggressive and may impact the reliability and performance of
    the\n   network.\n\n   A more efficient mechanism for real-time failure detection
    can be\n   enabled in VRRP protocol by building a peer table, using a new VRRP\n
    \  Advert packet type.  This will help in forming a mesh of BFD\n   sessions.
    \ Once the BFD sessions are created, VRRP can receive faster\n   notification
    of failures, without the overhead of increased VRRP\n   protocol Advert messages.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
