abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To diagnose performance and connectivity problems, metrics
    on real\n   (non-synthetic) transmission are critical for timely end-to-end\n
    \  problem resolution. Such diagnostics may be real-time or after the\n   fact,
    but must not impact an operational production network. The base\n   metrics are:
    packet sequence number and packet timestamp.  Metrics\n   derived from these will
    be described separately. This document\n   provides the background and rationale
    for the requirement for end-to-\n   end response time.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
