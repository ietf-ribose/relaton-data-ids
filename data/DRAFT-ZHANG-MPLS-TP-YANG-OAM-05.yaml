abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP),\n
    \  specified in RFC 5921, is a packet-based transport technology based\n   on
    the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and pseudowire (PW) data-\n   plane architectures.
    \ A comprehensive set of Operations,\n   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
    procedures that fulfill the\n   MPLS-TP OAM requirements for fault, performance,
    and protection-\n   switching management had been defined.  YANG, defined in RFC
    6020 and\n   RFC 7950, is a data model definition language that was introduced
    to\n   define the content of a conceptual data stores that allows networked\n
    \  devices to be managed using NETCONF, as specified in RFC 6241.  This\n   document
    presents the YANG Data model for MPLS-TP OAM, including the\n   basic functions
    of Fault Management and Performance Monitoring.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
