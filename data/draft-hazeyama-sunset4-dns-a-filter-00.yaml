abstract:
- content: "<p>Filtering out of A records of a DNS response on a DNS proxy, we call
    it ``DNS A record filtering'', is an effective and efficient solution as a smooth
    migration to IPv6 only networks. DNS A record filtering can mitigate fallback
    problems of dual stack nodes on IPv6 only environment. This memo mentions the
    components of the DNS A record filter solution, procedure of DNS queries and refers
    current issues.</p>"
