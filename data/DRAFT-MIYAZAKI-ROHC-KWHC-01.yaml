abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Header Compression has proven to be essential for using RTP over\nbandwidth
    limited links. While all of these links have only a\nlimited bandwidth, some are
    additional extremely unreliable, e.g.\nwireless links. It is shown, that existing
    Header Compression\nschemes, that work well over reliable links, perform very
    bad, if\nmany errors occur.\nThis led to the development of a new robust Header
    Compression\nmechanism, that is introduced in this paper. The core idea is the\ndefinition
    of keyword packets, which reduces the amount of discarded\npackets at the decompressor.\nThe
    Header Compression scheme, the used packet formats and the\ndecompression algorithm,
    are described in detail.\n\t </p>\n      "
