abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Virtual network overlays are being designed and deployed in
    various\n   types of networks, including data center networks.  These network\n
    \  overlays serve several purposes including flexible network\n   virtualization,
    increased scale, multi-tenancy, and mobility.  Such\n   overlay networks may be
    used to provide both Layer-2 and Layer-3\n   network services to hosts at the
    network edge.  New encapsulations\n   are being defined and standardized to support
    these virtual networks.\n   These encapsulations are primarily based on IP, such
    as VxLAN and\n   NvGRE.\n\n   BGP based Layer-3 VPNs, as specified in RFC 4364,
    provide an industry\n   proven and well-defined solution for supporting Layer-3
    virtual\n   network services.  RFC 4364 mechanisms use MPLS labels to provide
    the\n   network virtualization capability in the data plane.  This document\n
    \  specifies a simple mechanism to use the new IP-based virtual network\n   overlay
    encapsulations, while continuing to leverage the BGP based\n   Layer-3 VPN control
    plane techniques and extensions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
