abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a set of extensions for the Extensible Peer\nProtocol
    (XPP) required for creating a P2PSIP overlay network based\non the CAN distributed
    hash table algorithm.  It specifies how peers\nand clients must behave in order
    to maintain the overlay and use it\nfor the establishment of multimedia communication
    sessions.\n\nTo limit the overhead due to maintenance operations and to allow
    the\nadoption of security policies for preventing malicious nodes to\ndamage the
    overlay, joins are always initiated and controlled by\nexisting peers (hence the
    passive in PCAN).\n\t </p>\n      "
