abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work
    through\n   a consensus process, taking into account the different views among\n
    \  IETF participants and coming to (at least rough) consensus on\n   technical
    matters.  In particular, the IETF is supposed not to be run\n   by a \"majority
    rules\" philosophy.  This is why we engage in rituals\n   like \"humming\" instead
    of voting.  However, more and more of our\n   actions are now indistinguishable
    from voting, and quite often we are\n   letting the majority win the day, without
    consideration of minority\n   concerns.  This document is a collection of thoughts
    on what rough\n   consensus is, how we have gotten away from it, and the things
    we can\n   do in order to really achieve rough consensus.\n\n      Note: This
    document contains the musings of an individual.  Right\n      now, it is just
    some rough notes and has lots of holes that need\n      to be filled in.  Even
    if those holes are filled, in its current\n      form, it is not intended to be
    published as an RFC, let alone\n      being a BCP for a change of IETF policy.
    \ If it evolves into such\n      a thing, great.  If it simply sparks discussion
    as an Internet\n      Draft, that's a perfectly fine outcome.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
