abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an extension to PIM Receiver RLOC Join/
    Prune\n   attribute that supports the construction of multicast distribution\n
    \  trees where the root and receivers are located in different Locator/\n   ID
    Separation Protocol (LISP) sites and are connected using underlay\n   IP Multicast.
    \ This attribute allows the receiver site to signal the\n   underlay multicast
    group to the control plane of the root ITR\n   (Ingress Tunnel Router).\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
