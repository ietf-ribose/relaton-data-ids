abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are heated discussion over the unified address format
    and\n   mapping algorithm.  In order to converge the solutions, it is\n   desirable
    to discuss the requirements and principles for the design.\n   This document tries
    to propose practical principles for 4v6\n   deployment.  The requirements have
    been derived from this deployment\n   consideration.  Based on that, a unified
    address format has been\n   proposed for easying 4v6 solution implementation .\n\n\t
