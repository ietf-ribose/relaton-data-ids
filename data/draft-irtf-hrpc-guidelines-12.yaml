abstract:
- content: "<p>This document sets guidelines for human rights considerations for developers
    working on network protocols and architectures, similar to the work done on the
    guidelines for privacy considerations [RFC6973]. This is an updated version of
    the guidelines for human rights considerations in [RFC8280]. This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes. This informational document has consensus for publication from the Internet
    Research Task Force (IRTF) Human Right Protocol Considerations Research Group.
    It has been reviewed, tried, and tested by both by the research group as well
    as by researchers and practitioners from outside the research group. The research
    group acknowledges that the understanding of the impact of internet protocols
    and architecture on society is a developing practice and is a body of research
    that is still in development.</p>"
