abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo shows an example of how to provide and implement IPv4/IPv6
    dual stack anycast DNS services, which are based on the experience of IPv4/IPv6
    anycast DNS implementation. In order to provide a reference model to DNS operators
    who have a plan to deploy IPv4/IPv6 anycast DNS services onto their own DNS servers
    in the future, this memo mainly specifies a way to configure IPv6-related functions
    without IPv4-related matters.</p>"
