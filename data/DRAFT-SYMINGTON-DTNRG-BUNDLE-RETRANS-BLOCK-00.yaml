abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an optional extension block, called a\n
    \  Retransmission Block, that may be used with the Bundle Protocol [2]\n   within
    the context of a Delay-Tolerant Network architecture [4].  The\n   Retransmission
    Block (RB) is designed to be inserted by a custodian\n   when re-forwarding a
    bundle, so as to mark the bundle as a legitimate\n   custody-based retransmission
    rather than an unauthorized bundle\n   duplicate.  By providing a way for nodes
    that receive the re-\n   forwarded bundle to distinguish it from an unauthorized
    duplicate,\n   the RB enables those nodes whose local security policies do not\n
    \  permit them to forward replayed bundles to detect and delete\n   unauthorized
    bundle replays but forward authorized custody-based\n   bundle retransmissions.
    \ This document defines the format and\n   processing of this new Retransmission
    Block.\n\t </p>\n      "
