abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RFC 2533, 'A syntax for describing media feature sets', defines
    a\nformat to express media feature sets that represent media handling\ncapabilities.
    \ It also describes an algorithm for matching these\nfeature sets, which may be
    used, for example, to determine whether\nthe capabilities of a sender and receiver
    are compatible.\nThis memo describes a revised form of the feature set matching\nalgorithm,
    which incorporates lessons learned while implementing\nthe original algorthm.
    \ It is anticipated that this revised\nalgorithm description will be included
    in a future revision of RFC\n2533.  This memo does not affect any of the normative
    content of\nRFC 2533.\n\t </p>\n      "
