abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the architecture of NFV configuration
    in the\n   provider's network through a centralized management system and focus\n
    \  on the virtualisation characteristics related issues.  It is also a\n   typical
    scenario in cloud computing environment where end users do\n   not have to install
    or manage their applications on their end hosts,\n   but can install and manage
    their own featured powerful software\n   application in the cloud.  This specification
    describes an\n   architecture of NFV configuration.  It is also applicable to
    other\n   use cases with similar requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
