abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a scheme named network-assisted dynamic\n
    \  adaptation (NADA), a novel congestion control approach for\n   interactive
    real-time media applications, such as video conferencing.\n   In the proposed
    scheme, the sender regulates its sending rate based\n   on either implicit or
    explicit congestion signaling, in a unified\n   approach. The scheme can benefit
    from explicit congestion\n   notification (ECN) markings from network nodes. It
    also maintains\n   consistent sender behavior in the absence of such markings,
    by\n   reacting to queuing delays and packet losses instead.\n\n   We present
    here the overall system architecture, recommended\n   behaviors at the sender
    and the receiver, as well as expected network\n   node operations. Results from
    extensive simulation studies of the\n   proposed scheme are available upon request.\n\n\t
