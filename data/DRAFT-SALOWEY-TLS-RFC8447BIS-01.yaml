abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a number of changes to TLS and DTLS
    IANA\n   registries that range from adding notes to the registry all the way\n
    \  to changing the registration policy.  These changes were mostly\n   motivated
    by WG review of the TLS- and DTLS-related registries\n   undertaken as part of
    the TLS 1.3 development process.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC8447 and updates
    the following RFCs: 3749,\n   5077, 4680, 5246, 5705, 5878, 6520, 7301.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
