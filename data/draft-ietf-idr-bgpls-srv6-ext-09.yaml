abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) allows for a flexible definition of
    end-to-end paths within various topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological
    or functional sub-paths, called "segments". These segments are advertised by various
    protocols such as BGP, IS-IS and OSPFv3. This document defines extensions to BGP
    Link-state (BGP-LS) to advertise SRv6 segments along with their behaviors and
    other attributes via BGP. The BGP-LS address-family solution for SRv6 described
    in this document is similar to BGP-LS for SR for the MPLS data-plane defined in
    a separate document.</p>
