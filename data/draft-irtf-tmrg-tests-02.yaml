abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document presents an evaluation test suite for the initialevaluation
    of proposed TCP modifications. The goal of the test suiteis to allow researchers
    to quickly and easily evaluate their proposedTCP extensions in simulators and
    testbeds using a common set of well-defined, standard test cases, in order to
    compare and contrastproposals against standard TCP as well as other proposedmodifications.
    This test suite is not intended to result in anexhaustive evaluation of a proposed
    TCP modification or newcongestion control mechanism. Instead, the focus is on
    quickly andeasily generating an initial evaluation report that allows thenetworking
    community to understand and discuss the behavioral aspectsof a new proposal, in
    order to guide further experimentation thatwill be needed to fully investigate
    the specific aspects of a newproposal.</p>"
