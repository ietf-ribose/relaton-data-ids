abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL protocol provides multicast data forwarding based on
    IS-IS link\n   state routing. Distribution trees are computed based on the link\n
    \  state information through Shortest Path First calculation. When a\n   link
    on the distribution tree fails, a campus-wide recovergence of\n   this distribution
    tree will take place, which can be time consuming\n   and may cause considerable
    disruption to the ongoing multicast\n   service.\n\n   This document specifies
    how to build backup distribution trees to\n   protect links on the primary distribution
    tree. Since the backup\n   distribution tree is built up ahead of the link failure,
    when a link\n   on the primary distribution tree fails, the pre-installed backup\n
    \  forwarding table will be utilized to deliver multicast packets\n   without
    waiting for the campus-wide recovergence. This minimizes the\n   service disruption.
    This document updates RFC 6325.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
