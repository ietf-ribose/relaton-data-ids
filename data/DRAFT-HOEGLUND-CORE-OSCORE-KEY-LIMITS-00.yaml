abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)
    uses\n   AEAD algorithms to ensure confidentiality and integrity of exchanged\n
    \  messages.  Due to known issues allowing forgery attacks against AEAD\n   algorithms,
    limits should be followed on the number of times a\n   specific key is used for
    encryption or decryption.  This document\n   defines how two peers using OSCORE
    must take these limits into\n   account and what steps they must take to preserve
    the security of\n   their communications.  Therefore, this document updates RFC8613.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
