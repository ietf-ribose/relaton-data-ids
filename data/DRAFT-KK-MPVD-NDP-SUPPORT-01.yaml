abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MIF working group is producing a solution to solve the
    issues\n   that are associated with nodes that can be attached to multiple\n   networks.
    \ One part of the solution requires associating\n   configuration information
    with provisioning domains.  This document\n   details how configuration information
    provided through IPv6 Neighbor\n   Discovery Protocol can be associated with provisioning
    domains.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
