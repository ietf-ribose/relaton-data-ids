abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a new way to provide returned location\n
    \  information in LoST responses that is either of a completed or\n   similar
    form to the original input civic location, based on whether\n   valid or invalid
    civic address elements are returned within the\n   findServiceResponse message.
    \ This document defines a new extension\n   to the findServiceResponse message
    within the LoST protocol [RFC5222]\n   that enables the LoST protocol to return
    in it's response a completed\n   civic address element set for a valid location
    response, and one or\n   more suggested sets of similar location information for
    an invalid\n   location.  These two types of civic addresses are referred to as\n
    \  either \"complete location\" or \"similar location\", and are included as\n
    \  a compilation of CAtype xml elements within the existing LoST\n   findServiceResponse
    message structure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
