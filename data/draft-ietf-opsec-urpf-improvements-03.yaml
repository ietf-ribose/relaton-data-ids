abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies a need for improvement of the unicast Reverse
    Path Filtering techniques (uRPF) (see BCP 84) for detection and mitigation of
    source address spoofing (see BCP 38). The strict uRPF is inflexible about directionality,
    the loose uRPF is oblivious to directionality, and the current feasible-path uRPF
    attempts to strike a balance between the two (see BCP 84). However, as shown in
    this draft, the existing feasible-path uRPF still has shortcomings. This document
    describes an enhanced feasible-path uRPF technique, which aims to be more flexible
    (in a meaningful way) about directionality than the feasible-path uRPF. It can
    potentially alleviate ISPs' concerns about the possibility of disrupting service
    for their customers, and encourage greater deployment of uRPF techniques.</p>"
