abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 6040 on \"Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion Notification\"
    made the\n   rules for propagation of ECN consistent for all forms of IP in IP\n
    \  tunnel.  This specification updates RFC 6040 to clarify that its\n   scope
    includes tunnels where two IP headers are separated by at least\n   one shim header
    that is not sufficient on its own for wide area\n   packet forwarding.  It surveys
    widely deployed IP tunnelling\n   protocols that use such shim header(s) and updates
    the specifications\n   of those that do not mention ECN propagation (L2TPv2, L2TPv3,
    GRE,\n   Teredo and AMT).  This specification also updates RFC 6040 with\n   configuration
    requirements needed to make any legacy tunnel ingress\n   safe.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
