abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   VoIP is commonly perceived to be a low quality, but low cost,\n
    \  alternative to standard telephony.  This poor perception is often\n   well
    deserved, being fueled by implementations designed without\n   regard to characteristics
    of IP networks.  This problem statement\n   attempts to catalog the shortcomings
    of current implementations, in\n   order to explore the IETF community's interest
    in working to improve\n   this situation.\n\t </p>\n      "
