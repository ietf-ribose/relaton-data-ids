abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how service function chains (SFC) can
    be\n   applied to traffic flows using routing in a virtual (overlay)\n   network
    to steer traffic between service nodes. Chains can include\n   services running
    in routers, on physical appliances or in virtual\n   machines. Service chains
    have applicability at the subscriber edge,\n   business edge and in multi-tenant
    datacenters. The routing function\n   into SFCs and between service functions
    within an SFC can be\n   performed by physical devices (routers), be virtualized
    inside\n   hypervisors, or run as part of a host OS.\n\n   A BGP control plane
    for route distribution is used to create virtual\n   networks implemented using
    IP MPLS, VXLAN or other suitable\n   encapsulation, where the routes within the
    virtual networks cause\n   traffic to flow through a sequence of service nodes
    that apply\n   packet processing functions to the flows.\n\n   Two techniques
    are described: in one the service chain is\n   implemented as a sequence of distinct
    VPNs between sets of service\n   nodes that apply each service function; in the
    other, the routes\n   within a VPN are modified through the use of special route
    targets\n   and modified next-hop resolution to achieve the desired result.\n\n
    \  In both techniques, service chains can be created by manual\n   configuration
    of routes and route targets in routing systems, or\n   through the use of a controller
    which contains a topological model\n   of the desired service chains.\n\n   This
    document also contains discussion of load balancing between\n   network functions,
    symmetric forward and reverse paths when stateful\n   services are involved, and
    use of classifiers to direct traffic into\n   a service chain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
