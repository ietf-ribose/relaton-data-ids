abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent opinions and sentiments expressed in the Internet Service Provider
    (ISP) community, as well as the Internet community at-large, have voiced concern
    over the applicability and scalability of RSVP and the Integrated Service model
    in the global Internet infrastructure. Convincing arguments have been made for
    a differential services model which offers packet delivery services better than
    traditional best effort, especially in the face of congestion, yet not as resource
    intensive as RSVP. As a result, the Differentiated Service (diffserv) working
    group in the IETF has been examining methods to provide simpler, less resource
    intensive methods of offering differentiated services. This draft provides a practical
    method to use bit values expressed in the IP Type or Service (TOS) and IP precedence
    subfields of the TOS byte in the IP packet header for delay indication and packet
    drop preference, respectively.</p>"
