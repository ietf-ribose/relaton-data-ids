abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is a specification of the basic protocol for
    Internet\n   electronic mail transport.  It consolidates, updates, and clarifies\n
    \  several previous documents, making all or parts of most of them\n   obsolete.
    \ It covers the SMTP extension mechanisms and best practices\n   for the contemporary
    Internet, but does not provide details about\n   particular extensions.  The document
    also provides information about\n   use of SMTP for other than strict mail transport
    and delivery.  This\n   document replaces RFC 5321, the earlier version with the
    same title.\n\n   // JcK 20211029 Note in Draft: Adjusted in version -06.  Decided
    the\n   // details belong in either the Introduction or the A/S, not the\n   //
    Abstract.  And it makes the Abstract a tad shorter, which is good.\n\n\t </p>\n
