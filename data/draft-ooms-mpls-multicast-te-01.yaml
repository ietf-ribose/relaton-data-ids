abstract:
- content: "<p>There are several reasons for operators to construct multicast trees
    by another means than multicast routing protocols. This document lists these reasons
    and describes 2 ways of building a multicast traffic-engineered tree: root-initiated
    tree and leaf-initiated tree. Finally it defines extensions to CR-LDP to support
    MPLS multicast traffic engineering.</p>"
