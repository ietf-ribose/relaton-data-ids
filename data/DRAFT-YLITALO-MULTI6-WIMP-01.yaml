abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Weak Identifier Multihoming Protocol Framework (WIMP-F) is
    a wedge\n   layer 3.5 framework to be applied with different kind of routable\n
    \  application layer identifiers (AIDs) and layer 3.5 context\n   identifiers
    (CIDs) presented in Group-F.  WIMP-F consists of context\n   establishment and
    re-addressing exchanges that are protected with\n   one-way hash chains and a
    technique called as secret splitting.  The\n   hash chain protects a host from
    re-direction attacks, but not\n   directly from an CID or AID theft.  The ownerships
    can be provided in\n   variable ways presented in other Multi6 drafts.\n\t </p>\n
