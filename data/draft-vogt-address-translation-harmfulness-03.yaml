abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Address translation is widely considered harmful because it conflictswith
    design principles highly regarded within the Internetengineering community. Still,
    address translation has become commonpractice despite technical problems because
    it constitutes an easy-to-deploy solution to a set of common operational needs.
    Since someof these needs will continue to exist in IP version 6, there isconcern
    within the Internet engineering community about the potentialproliferation of
    harmful technology from IP version 4 to IP version6. This document investigates
    this concern. It compares feasibleaddress translator designs with respect to the
    harmful impact theymay have, explains why the problems of address translation,
    as usedtoday, are to a significant extent entailed by the shortage of globaladdresses
    in IP version 4, and shows how the problems can bemitigated in IP version 6.</p>"
