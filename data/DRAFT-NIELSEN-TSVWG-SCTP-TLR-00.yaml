abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Loss Recovery by means of T3-Retransmission has significant\n
    \  detrimental impact on the delays experienced through an SCTP\n   association.
    \ The throughput achievable over an SCTP association also\n   is negatively impacted
    by the occurence of T3-Retransmissions.  Loss\n   Recovery by Fast Retransmission
    operation is in most situations\n   superior to T3-Retransmission from a latency
    and a throughput\n   perspective.  The present SCTP Fast Recovery algorithms as
    specified\n   by [RFC4960] are not able to adequately or timely recover losses
    in\n   certain situations, thus resorting to loss recovery by lengthy\n   T3-Retransimissions
    or by non-timely activation of Fast Recovery.  In\n   this document we propose
    for a number of enhancements to the SCTP\n   Loss Recovery algorithms aimed to
    amend some of these deficiencies\n   with a particular focus on Loss Recovery
    for drops in Traffic Tails.\n   The enhancements supplements the existing algorithms
    of [RFC4960]\n   with proactive probing and timer driven accelerated activation
    of the\n   Fast Retransmission algorithm as well as a number of enhancements of\n
    \  the Fast Retransmission algorithm in itself are proposed.  The\n   enhancement
    are proposed as supplements to the Loss Recovery\n   algorithms of [RFC4960] and
    as such they do not deprecate or replace\n   any of the mechanisms defined by
    [RFC4960].\n\n   The solution proposed draws on prior art in the area of SCTP
    and TCP\n   Loss Recovery improvements.  The mechanisms proposed include the\n
    \  adjustment to SCTP Fast Retransmission of certain improvements\n   specified
    for TCP Fast Retransmission by [RFC6675] as well as the\n   proposal embeds SCTP
    Early Retransmit [RFC5827] in a delayed variant.\n   The proposal heavily draws
    on the ideas put forward for TCP by\n   [DUKKIPATI01] for proactive probing and
    timer driven entering of Fast\n   Recovery procedures.  The proposal embeds certain
    aspects from\n   [HURTIG] when applicable.  The procedures proposed are sender-side\n
    \  only and do not impact the SCTP receiver.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
