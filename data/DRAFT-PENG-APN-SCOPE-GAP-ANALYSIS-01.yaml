abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The APN work in IETF is focused on developing a framework and
    set of\n   mechanisms to derive, convey and use an identifier to allow for the\n
    \  implementation of fine-grain user (group)-, application (group)-, and\n   service-level
    requirements at the network layer.  APN aims to apply\n   various policies in
    different nodes along a network path onto a\n   traffic flow altogether, that
    is, at the headend to steer into\n   corresponding path, at the midpoint to collect
    corresponding\n   performance measurement data, and at the service function to
    execute\n   particular policies.  Currently there is still no way to realise this\n
    \  composite network service provisioning along the path very\n   efficiently.
    \ This document further clarifies the scope of the APN\n   work and describesthe
    solution gap analysis.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
