abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to meet the needs of some customers
    or\n   applications, including the customers and applications that are\n   associated
    with 5G, which requires connectivity services with\n   advanced characteristics,
    such as the assurance of some Service Level\n   Objectives (SLOs) and specific
    Service Level Expectations (SLEs).\n   VPN+ could be used for network slice realization
    both in the context\n   of 5G and in more generic scenarios, such as enterprise
    services\n   which have requirement on the performance assurance.  With the demand\n
    \  for VPN+ services increases, scalability would become an important\n   factor
    for the large scale deployment of VPN+. This document\n   describes the scalability
    considerations about the network control\n   plane and data plane in enabling
    VPN+ services, some optimization\n   mechanisms are also proposed.\n\n\t </p>\n
