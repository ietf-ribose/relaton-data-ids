abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>One of the best chances for a Service Provider to face the complex\ngrowth
    of IP Services, and their challenging requirements/SLAs along\nthe Core network,
    is to enrich the current Performance metrics - mainly\nderived from a Network-oriented
    point of view, and therefore a general\nperspective, not focused on specific services
    - with some more\nPerformance factors, so to include a Service-oriented point
    of view,\nmore centred on the particular kind of service, with its own\ncharacteristics
    in terms of protocol, application, manageability,\nand so on.\nTo achieve the
    above goal, and starting from the one-to-group\nperformance metrics outlined in
    RFC 5644 [RFC5644], an effort to a\ndeeper analysis and definition of spatial
    aggregation metrics (as a\npart of the framework for metric composition defined
    in RFC 5835\n[RFC5835])is proposed in this memo, where the main focus is on\nmultiparty
    communications (e.g. video providers, online biding,\nonline stock market, etc.).\nThis
    memo lends itself to passive measurement as well as active\nmeasurement.\nFinally
    this memo is tuned to RFC 6390 [RFC6390] in terms of scopes,\nframework concepts,
    and need to widen the current performance metrics\ndepending on the application,
    service etc.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
