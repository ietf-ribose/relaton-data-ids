abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In DSR, a node can generate a route reply in response to a
    received\n   route request if it has a fresh route to the destination in its\n
    \  route cache. However, this can incur the cached route reply\n   implosion problem
    and DSR just tries to mitigate this problem\n   by reducing the possibility of
    cached route reply collisions.\n   This document describes how DSR can be extended
    for the resolution\n   of the cached route reply problem.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
