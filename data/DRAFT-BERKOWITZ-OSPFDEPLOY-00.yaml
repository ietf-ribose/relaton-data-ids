abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>OSPF is the preferred interior routing protocol of the Internet.
    \ It is\na complex protocol intended to deal with complex networks.  While it
    is\na powerful mechanism, it does not handle all situations, and its\nappropriate
    use may not be obvious to beginners.  Standards track documents\ndeal with protocol
    design, but deployment of OSPF in many enterprise\nnetworks has been limited by
    lack of information on best current practice\ninformation for interior routing.
    \ Best Current Practices documents have\nfocused on general exterior connectivity.
    This memorandum is intended to\ncomplement the protocol specification by describing
    the experience-based,\nvendor-independent techniques of OSPF and complementary
    technologies in\nrepresentative networks.  Better understanding of the use of
    OSPF features\nto help exterior connectivity will help reduce the demand for complex
    user\nBGP configuration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
