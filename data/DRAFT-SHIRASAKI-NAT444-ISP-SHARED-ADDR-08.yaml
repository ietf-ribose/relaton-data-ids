  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes addressing models of NAT444.  There
    are some\n   addressing models of NAT444.  The addressing models have some issues\n
    \  of network behaviors, operations, and addressing.  This document\n   helps
    network architects to use NAT444 after IPv4 address exhaustion.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
