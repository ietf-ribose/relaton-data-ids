abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Describing numbering tiers has been informal to date.  This document
    \nproposes a simple recognition principle for tiers in terms of the \nprotocol
    mapping of an E.164 numbering resource to a DNS domain \nname, as described for
    ENUM in RFC 2916.  Tier value is a formal \nattribute of the digit string for
    an arbitrary E.164 resource, and \nit applies also to the resulting domain name.
    \ No assumptions about \nassignment, existence, or delegation are involved.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
