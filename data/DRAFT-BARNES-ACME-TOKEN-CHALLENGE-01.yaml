abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A number of proposed challenges for the Automated Certificate\n
    \  Management Environment (ACME) effectively rely on an external\n   authority
    issuing a token according to a particular policy.  This\n   document specifies
    a generic Authority Token challenge for ACME which\n   admits of subtypes for
    different identifiers or namespaces.  This\n   document specifies a generic Authority
    Token challenge for ACME which\n   consists of subtype for different identifiers
    or namespace.  The\n   Authority Token is issued by an Authority with whom the
    Certification\n   Authority (CA) has a trust relationship.  The entity requesting
    a\n   certificate also has a relationship with the Authority, such that the\n
    \  authority assigns a unique code to the entity.  This entity code is\n   included
    as part of the token that the administrative authority\n   issues.\n\n\t </p>\n
