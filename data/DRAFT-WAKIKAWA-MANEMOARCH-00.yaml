abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document outlines the MANEMO architecture including
    possible\n   topology configuration and addressing assignment.  The issues of\n
    \  MANEMO (previously known as nested NEMO) are already summarized in\n   several
    documents.  However, there are several ways how to comprehend\n   what is MANEMO.
    \ The MANEMO problems are related to several existing\n   working groups.  This
    document provides the MANEMO architecture model\n   and differences of existing
    solutions so that IETF can classify the\n   problems and start working on the
    solutions.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
