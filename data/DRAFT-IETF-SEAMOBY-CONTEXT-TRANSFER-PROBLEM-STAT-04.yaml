abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In IP access networks that support host mobility, the routing
    paths \nbetween the host and the network may change frequently and rapidly. \nIn
    some cases, the host may establish certain routing-related \nservices on subnets
    that are left behind when the host moves. \nExamples of such services are AAA,
    header compression, and QoS. In \norder for the host to obtain those services
    on the new subnet, the \nhost must explicitly re-establish the service by performing
    the \nnecessary signaling flows from scratch. In some cases, this process \nwould
    considerably slow the process of establishing the mobile host \non the new subnet.
    An alternative is to transfer information on the \nexisting state associated with
    these services, or context, to the \nnew subnet, a process called 'context transfer'.
    This document \ndiscusses the desirability of context transfer for facilitating
    \nseamless IP mobility.\n\t </p>\n      "
