abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round
    trip\n   times to the closest DNS root server.  Such resolvers can greatly\n   decrease
    the rount trip time by running a copy of the full root zone\n   on a loopback
    address (such as 127.0.0.1).  This document shows how\n   to start and maintain
    such a copy of the root zone in a manner that\n   is secure for the operator of
    the recursive resolver and does not\n   pose a threat to other users of the DNS.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
