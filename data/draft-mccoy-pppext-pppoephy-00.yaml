abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a definition for encapsulating the PPP protocol
    directly on the various full duplex point-to-point Ethernet physical layers. The
    later includes transmission bit rates of 10Mbps, 100Mbps, 1Gbps, and 10Gbps. Note
    this is a distinct protocol from PPPoE, as the Ethernet frame is not existent
    here. All PPP packet semantics and syntax are retained. The proposed methods in
    this document may be especially useful for low cost, high bandwidth physical channel
    implementations. In particular it specifies and redefines all necessary Ethernet
    Medium Independent Interface functional 'clauses.'</p>"
