abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document provides a definition for encapsulating the PPPprotocol
    directly on the various full duplex point-to-point Ethernetphysical layers. The
    later includes transmission bit rates of10Mbps, 100Mbps, 1Gbps, and 10Gbps. Note
    this is a distinct protocolfrom PPPoE, as the Ethernet frame is not existent here.
    All PPPpacket semantics and syntax are retained. The proposed methods inthis document
    may be especially useful for low cost, high bandwidthphysical channel implementations.
    In particular it specifies andredefines all necessary Ethernet Medium Independent
