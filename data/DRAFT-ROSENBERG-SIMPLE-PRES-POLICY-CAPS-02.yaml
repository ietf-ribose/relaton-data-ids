abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>An important component of presence services is policy. Policy
    systems\n   allow the presentity to grant access to specific pieces of\n   information
    to specific watchers. To allow for interoperability\n   between clients which
    set such policies, and servers which execute\n   them, it is necessary for clients
    to be able to determine the\n   capabilities of the server to which it is connected.
    This\n   specification defines a set of Extensible Markup Language (XML)\n   elements
    for expressing presence policy capabilities.\n\t </p>\n      "
