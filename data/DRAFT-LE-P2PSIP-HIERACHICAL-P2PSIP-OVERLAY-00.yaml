abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft discusses the hierarchical overlay architecture in
    Peer-\n   to-Peer (P2P) SIP system. The P2P SIP is defined as a distributed\n
    \  network and each peer is equal in it. But actually peers are\n   different
    from each other on many aspects, e.g., physical performance,\n   network performance
    or system performance (e.g., uptime). So node\n   heterogeneity should been considered
    enough in P2P SIP system, which\n   affects the scalability and service availability
    of P2P SIP overlays.\n   This draft introduces the performance concerns of P2P
    SIP overlay\n   without consideration of node heterogeneity at first. After that,
    an\n   alternative architecture of hierarchical P2P SIP overlay is brought\n   up.\n\t
