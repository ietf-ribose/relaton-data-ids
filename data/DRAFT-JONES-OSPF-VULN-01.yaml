abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internet infrastructure protocols were designed at the very early
    \nstages of computer networks when 'cyberspace' was still perceived as \na benign
    environment. As a consequence, malicious attacks were not \nconsidered to be a
    major risk when these protocols were designed, \nleaving today's Internet vulnerable.
    This paper provides an analysis \nof OSPF vulnerabilities that could be exploited
    to modify the normal \nrouting process across a single domain together with an
    assessment\nof when internal OSPF mechanisms can or cannot be leveraged to \nbetter
    secure a domain.\n\t </p>\n      "
