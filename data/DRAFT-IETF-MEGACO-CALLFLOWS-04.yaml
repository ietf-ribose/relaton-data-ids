abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Megaco/H.248 call flow examples draft illustrates the usage
    \nof Megaco - Version 1 protocol [Ref:3] defined between the Media Gateway \nController
    and Media Gateway. In light of the vast features presently \nincorporated and
    continuously evolving features of the protocol, it \nserves the purpose of representing
    typical use case scenarios. There \nare a lot of possible scenarios for usage
    of MEGACO protocol. It is not \nthe intent of the draft to represent the inter-working
    functionality \namong various protocols, however, an attempt is made to depict
    \nits usage in such a case for the purpose of completeness in the \nlarger perspective.
    An attempt has been made to illustrate the \nsupplementary call  services using
    MEGACO. The call flows can \nbe categorized in to two sub sections,\n\t </p>\n
