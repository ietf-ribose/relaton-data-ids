abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN services to
    support\n   some applications' needs of enhanced isolation and stringent\n   performance
    requirements.  VPN+ requires integration between the\n   overlay VPN connectivity
    and the characteristics provided by the\n   underlay network.  A Virtual Transport
    Network (VTN) is a virtual\n   underlay network which consists of a customized
    network topology and\n   a set of network resource allocated from the physical
    network.  A VTN\n   could be used as the underlay to support one or a group of
    VPN+\n   services.\n\n   This document specifies the BGP-LS mechanisms with necessary\n
    \  extensions to advertise the information of Segment Routing (SR) based\n   VTNs
    to a centralized network controller.  Each VTN can have a\n   customized topology
    and a set of network resources allocated.\n   Multiple VTNs may shared the same
    topology, and multiple VTNs may\n   share the same set of network resources on
    some network segments.\n   This allows flexible combination of network topology
    and network\n   resource attributes to build a large number of VTNs with a relatively\n
    \  small number of logical topologies.  The proposed mechanism is\n   applicable
    to both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and\n   segment routing
    with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
