abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables\n
    \  receiving asynchronous notification of events related to SIP systems.\n   This
    framework defines the procedures for creating, refreshing and\n   terminating
    subscriptions, as well as fetching and periodic polling\n   of resource state.
    \ These procedures have a serious deficiency in\n   that they do not allow state
    to persist over a subscription refresh,\n   or between two consecutive polls.
    \ Another related but different\n   problem relates to the relative intolerance
    of the framework to\n   interferences in networking connectivity of subscribers
    in long-\n   lasting subscriptions.  This document explains the problems in more\n
    \  detail and discusses possible solutions.\n\t </p>\n      "
