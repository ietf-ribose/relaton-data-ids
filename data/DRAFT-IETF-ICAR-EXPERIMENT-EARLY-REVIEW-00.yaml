abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo captures current working group rough consensus on\n
    \  procedures for improved cross-area early review in the IETF.  It is a\n   product
    of the ICAR working group.\n\n   This memo describes an experiment to improve
    early cross-area review\n   in the IETF.  Early cross-area review aims to improve
    quality of IETF\n   work by identifying problems early in document development.
    Improved\n   quality may, in turn, mean that documents can be processed faster
    in\n   the IESG.\n\t </p>\n      "
