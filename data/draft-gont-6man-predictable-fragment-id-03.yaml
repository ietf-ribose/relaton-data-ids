abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 specifies the Fragment Header, which is employed for the fragmentation
    and reassembly mechanisms. The Fragment Header contains an "Identification" field
    which, together with the IPv6 Source Address and the IPv6 Destination Address
    of the packet, identifies fragments that correspond to the same original datagram,
    such that they can be reassembled together at the receiving host. The only requirement
    for setting the "Identification" value is that it must be different than that
    of any other fragmented packet sent recently with the same Source Address and
    Destination Address. Some implementations simply use a global counter for setting
    the Fragment Identification field, thus leading to predictable values. This document
    analyzes the security implications of predictable Identification values, and updates
    RFC 2460 specifying additional requirements for setting the Fragment Identification,
    such that the aforementioned security implications are mitigated.</p>
