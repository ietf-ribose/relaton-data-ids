abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering
    Label\n   Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and\n
    \  Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been\n   identified
    as a key requirement for P2P and P2MP scenarios.\n   Backward-Recursive PCE-Based
    Computation (BRPC) [RFC5441] defines\n   VSPT [Virtual Shortest Path Tree] as
    a default de-facto data\n   structure for PCRep message in inter-domain scenarios.\n\n
    \  AS PCE will get used in newer scenarios like inter-domain,\n   protection,
    P2MP etc.  As well as PCE is being explored to be used in\n   Cross Stratrum Optimization
    (CSO) environment (see [CSO-PCE]).\n   Limiting PCEP protocol to just one data
    structure limits the usage of\n   PCEP.  Its important to keep PCEP generic enough
    to use differnt data\n   structure and apply different algorithms.\n\n   This
    document defines extensions to the PCE communication Protocol\n   (PCEP) to allow
    multiple data structures.  Extensions are defined for\n   PCE to indicate the
    set of Data Structure (DS) it supports; also PCC/\n   PCE can indicate in a path
    computation request the required DS, and a\n   PCE can report in a path computation
    reply the Data Structure that\n   was used in the path reply message.\n\n\t </p>\n
