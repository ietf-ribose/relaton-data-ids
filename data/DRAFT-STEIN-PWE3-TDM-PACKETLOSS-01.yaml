abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The effect of packet loss on voice quality has been the subject
    of\ndetailed study in the VoIP community, but these results are not\ndirectly
    applicable to TDM transport as being studied in the PWE WG.\nThe present document
    presents an analysis of packet loss for the TDM\nover PW case, and demonstrates
    that packet loss of a few percent can\nbe tolerated.  We propose that robustness
    to packet loss of a few\npercent be a requirement for any proposed method for
    transport of TDM\nover pseudowires.\n\t </p>\n      "
