abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a survey of commonly used or notable
    network\n   security protocols, with a focus on how they interact and integrate\n
    \  with applications and transport protocols.  Its goal is to supplement\n   efforts
    to define and catalog transport services [RFC8095] by\n   describing the interfaces
    required to add security protocols.  It\n   examines Transport Layer Security
    (TLS), Datagram Transport Layer\n   Security (DTLS), Quick UDP Internet Connections
    with TLS (QUIC +\n   TLS), tcpcrypt, Internet Key Exchange with Encapsulating
    Security\n   Protocol (IKEv2 + ESP), SRTP (with DTLS), WireGuard, CurveCP,\n   MinimalT.
    \ This survey is not limited to protocols developed within\n   the scope or context
    of the IETF, and those included represent a\n   superset of features a TAPS system
    may need to support.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
