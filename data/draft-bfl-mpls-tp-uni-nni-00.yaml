abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The framework for MPLS in transport networks [RFC5921] providesreference
    models for an MPLS-TP User-to-Network Interface (UNI), andan MPLS-TP Network-to-Network
    interface (NNI). This document updatesthose reference models to show detailed
    reference points for theseinterfaces, along with further clarification of the
    functionalarchitecture of MPLS-TP at a UNI and NNI.This document is a product
    of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunication
    Union TelecommunicationStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    TransportProfile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge(PWE3)
    architectures to support the capabilities and functionalitiesof a packet transport
    network as defined by the ITU-T.This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at
    achieving IETFConsensus before publication as an RFC and will be subjet to an
    IETFLast Call.[RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC
    andinsert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the publishedRFC has
    IETF onsensus.]</p>"
