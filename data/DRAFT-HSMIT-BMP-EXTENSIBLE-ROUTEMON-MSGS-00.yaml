abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) is defined in RFC7854.  Most
    of the\n   types of messages in BMP are extensible via the mechanism of TLVs.\n
    \  However, the most important type of message, the route-monitoring\n   message,
    has a fixed format.\n\n   This document proposes a relatively small change to
    the format of BMP\n   route-monitoring messages.  The new format of route-monitoring\n
    \  messages is no longer fixed-format, but tlv-encoded.  This document\n   also
    proposes to split the route-monitoring message-type into 3 new\n   message-types.
    \ For Adj-RIB-In, Adj-RIB-Out and Loc-RIB.\n\n   This document proposes two types
    of TLVs to be used in this new\n   format.  A TLV to report the BGP update message
    itself.  And a flags-\n   field TLV, to report state of the reported routes.\n\n\n\t
