abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines optional ECN and filter related attributes
    that\n   can be used for improved traffic identification, support of ECN and\n
    \  minimized filter administration within Diameter.\n\n   RFC 5777 defines a Filter-Rule
    AVP that accommodates extensions for\n   classification, conditions and actions.
    It does not support traffic\n   identification for packets using Explicit Congestion
    Notification as\n   defined in RFC 3168 and does not provide specific actions
    when the\n   flow(s) described by the Filter-Rule are congested.\n\n   A Filter-Rule
    can describe multiple flows but not the exact number of\n   flows. Flow count
    and other associated data (e.g. packets) is not\n   captured in Accounting applications,
    leaving administrators without\n   useful information regarding the effectiveness
    or understanding of\n   the filter definition.\n\n   These optional attributes
    are forward and backwards compatible with\n   RFC 5777.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
