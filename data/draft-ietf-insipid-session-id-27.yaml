abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an end-to-end session identifier for use in
    IP-based multimedia communication systems that enables endpoints, intermediary
    devices, and management systems to identify a session end-to-end, associate multiple
    endpoints with a given multipoint conference, track communication sessions when
    they are redirected, and associate one or more media flows with a given communication
    session. While the identifier is intended to work across multiple protocols, this
    document describes its usage in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This document
    also describes a backwards-compatibility mechanism for an existing session identifier
    implementation (RFC 7329) that is sufficiently different from the procedures defined
    in this document. This document obsoletes RFC 7329.</p>"
