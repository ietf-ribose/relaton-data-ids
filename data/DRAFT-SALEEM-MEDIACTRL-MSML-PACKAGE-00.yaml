abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Media Server Markup Language [RFC5707] is used to control
    and\n   invoke many different types of services on IP media servers. MSML can\n
    \  be used, for example, to control media server conferencing features\n   such
    as video layout and audio mixing, create sidebar conferences or\n   personal mixes,
    and set the properties of media streams.  As well,\n   clients can use MSML to
    define media processing dialogs, which may be\n   used as parts of application
    interactions with users or conferences.\n   This document describes the use of
    MSML [RFC5707] language used\n   within the context of Media Control Channel Framework
    [RFC6230]. The\n   use of MSML [RFC5707] is described here as a standalone package
    for\n   use within and compliant with the Media Control Channel Framework\n   [RFC6230].\n\n\t
