abstract:
- content: <p>This document introduces an application programming interface (API)
    to the web-based "Network Looking Glass" software. Its purpose is to provide application
    programmers uniform access to the Looking Glass service and to analyze standardized
    response. The API interface is supposed to provide the same level of information
    as web-based interfaces, but in a computer-readable format.</p>
