abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes IBM's support for running LU6.2 applications\n
    \  over a TCP/IP network. This support is provided using a subset of the\n   X/Open
    architecture for Multiprotocol Transport Networking, which is\n   a general protocol
    conversion architecture for running any\n   application over any transport protocol.
    \ This draft is being\n   distributed to members of the Internet community in
    order to solicit\n   their reactions to the proposals contained in it.  While
    the issues\n   discussed may not be directly relevant to the research problems
    of\n   the Internet, they may be interesting to a number of researchers and\n
    \  implementers.\n \n   Any questions or comments relative to the contents of
    this draft\n   should be sent to the following Internet address:\n   carmich@us.ibm.com.\n\t
