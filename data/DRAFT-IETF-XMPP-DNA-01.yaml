abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The current authentication process in XMPP requires the XMPP server\n
    \  for a domain to present a certificate that contains that domain's\n   name.
    \ This requirement causes several problems in scenarios where\n   XMPP services
    have been delegated from one domain to another,\n   especially when one domain
    provides XMPP services for many domains.\n   This document describes an extension
    to the XMPP authentication\n   process that allows domains to be securely delegated,
    simplifying\n   authorization in delegation scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
