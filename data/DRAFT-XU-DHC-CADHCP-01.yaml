abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a technique that can provide both entity\n
    \  authentication and message authentication based on certificate.  This\n   protocol
    combines three existing options, authentication option as\n   specified in delay
    authentication mechanism in [RFC3118] and the user\n   authentication protocol
    option defined in [RFC2485].  The goal of\n   this specification is to define
    methods based certificate to protect\n   the integrity of DHCP message and stop
    the gaps of the existing delay\n   authentication mechanism.  In order to meet
    these goals, we use the\n   asymmetrical cryptography protection and some options
    about\n   authentication that have been defined in other specifications.\n\n\t
