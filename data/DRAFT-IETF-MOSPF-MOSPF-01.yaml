abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This memo documents the MOSPF protocol. MOSPF, which stands
    for the\n    Multicast extensions to OSPF, is an enhancement to the OSPF protocol\n
    \   enabling the routing of IP multicast datagrams. The extensions have\n    been
    implemented so that a multicast routing capability can be\n    introduced piecemeal
    into an OSPF Version 2 routing domain. Some of\n    the OSPF Version 2 routers
    may run the multicast extensions, while\n    others may continue to be restricted
    to the forwarding of regular IP\n    traffic (unicasts).\n \n    An implementation
    of this memo will interoperate with\n    implementations of the previous MOSPF
    specification, RFC 1584.\n    Differences between this memo and RFC 1584 include
    bug fixes,\n    modifications which track changes to the base OSPF specification,\n
    \   and an assumption that IGMPv2 (instead of IGMPv1) will now be used\n    to
    communicate group membership from IP hosts to MOSPF routers. See\n    Appendix
    D for details.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
