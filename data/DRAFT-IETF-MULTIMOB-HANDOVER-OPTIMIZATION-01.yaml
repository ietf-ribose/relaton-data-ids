abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a multicast handover optimization mechanism\n
    \  for Proxy Mobile IPv6 to accelerate the delivery of multicast traffic\n   to
    mobile nodes after handovers.  The mechanism is based on speeding\n   up the acquisition
    of mobile nodes' multicast context by the mobile\n   access gateways.  To do that,
    extensions to the current Proxy Mobile\n   IPv6 protocol are proposed.  These
    extensions are not only applicable\n   to the base solution for multicast support
    in Proxy Mobile IPv6, but\n   they can also be applied to other solutions being
    developed to avoid\n   the tunnel convergence problem.  Furthermore, they are
    also\n   independent of the role played by the mobile access gateway within\n
    \  the multicast network (either acting as multicast listener discovery\n   proxy
    or multicast router).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
