abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Bulk Mail Transfer Protocol (BMTP) provides a channel for the
    delivery\nof ''bulk mail'' electronic mail. BMTP is a service parallel to but
    sepa-\nrate from SMTP.  The specification of BMTP is intended to be similar\nenough
    to SMTP that existing SMTP clients and servers can easily be\nadapted for BMTP.
    \ Extensions provide for categorizing messages by\nclass, and for authorizing
    the client to the server, to aid in the\nimplementation of cost-sharing systems.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
