abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a method to achieve Fast Handoffs in Mobile\nIPv4.
    Fast Handoffs are required in Mobile IPv4 in order to limit the\nperiod of service
    disruption experienced by a wireless Mobile Node\nwhen moving between Foreign
    Agents. This requirement becomes even\nmore important when supporting real-time
    services. Fast Handoffs\ninvolve anticipating the movement of MNs by sending multiple
    copies\nof the traffic to potential Mobile Node movement locations (i.e. FAs).\nBoth
    a flat and a Hierarchical Mobile IPv4 model are considered. The\nHierarchical
    MIPv4 model in Regional Tunnel Management [1] already\noffers improvements to
    Mobile IP handoffs by providing local Home\nAgent functionality. Some additions
    are made to the operation of this\nexisting Hierarchical model to achieve Fast
    Handoffs and limit or\navoid triangle routing within the hierarchical domain.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
