abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Simple Certificate Enrolment Protocol\n
    \  (SCEP), a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) communication protocol\n   which
    leverages existing technology by using CMS (formerly known as\n   PKCS #7) and
    PKCS #10 over HTTP.  SCEP is the evolution of the\n   enrolment protocol sponsored
    by Cisco Systems, which now enjoys wide\n   support in both client and server
    implementations, as well as being\n   relied upon by numerous other industry standards
    that work with\n   certificates.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
