abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines how to use the WebRTC data channel mechanism
    in\n   order to realize a data channel, referred to as a CLUE data channel,\n
    \  for transporting CLUE protocol messages between two CLUE entities.\n\n   The
    document defines how to describe the SCTPoDTLS association used\n   to realize
    the CLUE data channel using the Session Description\n   Protocol (SDP), and defines
    usage of SDP-based \"SCTP over DTLS\" data\n   channel negotiation mechanism for
    establishing a CLUE data channel.\n\n   Details and procedures associated with
    the CLUE protocol, and the SDP\n   Offer/Answer procedures for negotiating usage
    of a CLUE data channel,\n   are outside the scope of this document.\n\n\t </p>\n
