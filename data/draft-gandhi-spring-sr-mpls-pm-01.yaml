abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6374 specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and
    accurate measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as related
    metrics such as delay variation in MPLS networks. This document reviews how these
    mechanisms can be used for Delay and Loss Performance Measurements (PM) in Segment
    Routing (SR) networks with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS), for both SR links and end-to-end
    SR Policies. The measured performance values for SR links are used to compute
    extended metrics for delay and loss and are advertised in the network.</p>"
