abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) defines an extension
    to\nthe offer/answer model used by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\nThis
    extension allows endpoints to traverse firewalls and NATs.\nHowever, in cases
    where highly restrictive firewalls exist, or where\nnetwork failures have occurred,
    ICE may not be able to successfully\nfind a media path.  This document provides
    an error response code\nthat can be used with SIP in these cases.\n\t </p>\n      "
