abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents requirements specific to home control and automation
    applications for Routing Over Low power and Lossy (ROLL) networks. In the near
    future, many homes will contain high numbers of wireless devices for a wide set
    of purposes. Examples include actuators (relay, light dimmer, heating valve),
    sensors (wall switch, water leak, blood pressure), and advanced controllers (radio-frequency-based
    AV remote control, central server for light and heat control). Because such devices
    only cover a limited radio range, routing is often required. The aim of this document
    is to specify the routing requirements for networks comprising such constrained
    devices in a home-control and automation environment. This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
