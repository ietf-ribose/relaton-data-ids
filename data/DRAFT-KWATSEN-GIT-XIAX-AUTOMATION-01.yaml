abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes motivations behind and solutions for
    tooling\n   to automate the extraction/insertion of artwork and source code to/\n
    \  from `rfc2xml` documents.\n\n   While much may appear to be working, the author
    believes that, in\n   order for such automation to be maximally useful, it is
    necessary to\n   solicit broad input from the community (co-authors are welcomed,
    both\n   on the draft and the tool).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
