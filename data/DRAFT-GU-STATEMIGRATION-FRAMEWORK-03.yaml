abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents an initial framework and discussion
    of the\n   problem of transferring middlebox (for example, firewall or NAT)\n
    \  flow-coupled state from one middlebox to another while the flow is\n   still
    active.  This has most recently come up in the context of\n   virtual machine
    (VM) migration between hypervisors, but it is a\n   problem that has appeared
    in other situations, as well.  We present\n   some of the parameters of the problem,
    define some language for\n   discussing the problem, and begin to identify a path
    forward for\n   addressing it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
