abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a set of state machines for EAP Peer,
    EAP\nAuthenticator (supporting local, passthrough and backend), for EAP\nPassthrough
    method, and for 'backend adapter' that adapts EAP traffic\ncarried by an AAA protocol
    such as RADIUS or Diameter to a Backend\nAuthenticator. This set of state machines
    shows how EAP can be\nimplemented to support deployment in either a Peer/AP or
    Peer/AP/AAA\nServer environmnet. The Peer and Authenticator machines are\nillustrative
    of how the EAP protocol defined in\n[I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis]  may be implemented.
    \ The Passtrhough\nmethod and 'backend adapter' illustrate how EAP protocol support\ndefined
    in [I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis] may be implemented. Where\nthere are differences
    [I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis]/\n[I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis] are authoritative.\nThis
    document describes a state machine based on an EAP 'Switch'\nmodel. This model
    includes  events and actions for the interaction\nbetween the EAP Switch and EAP
    methods. The State Machine and\nassociated model are informative only. Implementations
    may achieve\nthe same results using different methods.\nA brief description of
    the EAP 'Switch' model is given in the\nIntroduction section.\nThis document is
    still a work in progress.  The authors believe it\ncorresponds to the current
    state of revisions to the defining\n[I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis]/[I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis]
    documents,\nbut it has not been vetted by the EAP working group as a whole. An\nappendix
    to this document points out issues the authors believe still\nneed to be resolved
    between the documents. The intent is to\nsynchronize this document with [I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis]
    \  and\n[I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis]  revisions when they are released and\nthen
    submit it as an RFC.\n\t </p>\n      "
