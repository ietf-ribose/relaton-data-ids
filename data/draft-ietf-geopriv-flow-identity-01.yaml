abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6155 specifies an extension for the HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery
    (HELD) Protocol allowing the use of an IP address and port number to request a
    Device location based on an individual packet flow. However, certain kinds of
    NAT require that identifiers for both ends of the packet flow must be specified
    in order to unambiguously satisfy the location request. This document specifies
    an XML Schema and URN Sub-Namespace for a Flow Identity Extension for HELD to
    support this requirement. This document updates RFC 6155 by deprecating the port
    number elements specified therein.</p>"
