abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   PNMP, precise network measurement protocol, is used for out-of-band\n
    \  network measurement.  As 5G is continuously evolving, there become\n   many
    more time sensitive services which require high precision of\n   measurements.
    \ In addition, in order to better simulate the\n   transmission of packets of
    monitored services, the length and\n   priorities of the measurement packets SHOULD
    be customized,\n   especially for some network that is inclined to get congested.
    \ PNMP\n   can not only support PTP, precise time protocol, but also allow some\n
    \  customization on packet payload.  It only introduces a little\n   overhead
    by adding an extendable header over IP header.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
