abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the queries that a DNS resolver should
    emit\n   to initialize its cache.  The result is that the resolver gets both a\n
    \  current NS Resource Record Set (RRset) for the root zone and the\n   necessary
    address information for reaching the root servers.\n\n   This document, when published,
    obsoletes RFC 8109.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
