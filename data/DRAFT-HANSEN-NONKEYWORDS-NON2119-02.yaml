abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Specifications in RFCs contain normative keywords, as defined
    in RFC\n   2119, to signify requirements, permission or prohibitions.  These\n
    \  include MUST, SHOULD and MAY, which are commonly recorded in all\n   CAPITALS
    (but need not be). The words are sometimes also intended\n   with non-normative
    meaning; this different usage can be confusing.\n   Happily there are adequate
    alternatives for non-normative meanings.\n   For such situations, this document
    provides some alternatives to the\n   normative vocabulary of RFC 2119.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
