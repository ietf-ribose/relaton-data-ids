abstract:
- content: "<p>For future vehicular networks, some advanced features might be needed
    to facilitate use cases as platooning, proximity service awareness, autonomous
    driving and so forth. Thus, this draft intends to present two functions, known
    as vehicular grouping and socialization, for enabling some future-oriented use
    cases. These two functions could be built upon cross-layer identifiers, such as
    MAC, IP, and ID, which also have potential to formulate more value-added services
    for future vehicular networks.</p>"
