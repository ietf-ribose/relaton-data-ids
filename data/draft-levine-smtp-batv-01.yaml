abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The envelope of Internet mail contains an RFC2821.MailFrom command,which
    may supply an address to be used as the recipient oftransmission and delivery
    notices about the original message.Existing Internet mail permits unauthorized
    use of addresses in theMailFrom command, causing notices to be sent to unwitting
    andunwilling recipients. Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) definesan extensible
    mechanism for validating the MailFrom address. It alsodefines an initial use of
    that mechanism which requires noadministrative overhead and no global implementation.This
    document is a revision of draft-levine-mass-batv-02.</p>"
