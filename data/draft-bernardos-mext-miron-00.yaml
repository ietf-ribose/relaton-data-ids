abstract:
  content: "<p>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roamand
    attach to different access networks without disrupting theongoing sessions that
    nodes of the network may have. By extendingthe Mobile IPv6 support to Mobile Routers,
    nodes of the network arenot required to support any kind of mobility, since packets
    must gothrough the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA) bi-directional tunnel.Communications
    from/to a mobile network have to traverse the HomeAgent, and therefore better
    paths may be available. Additionally,this solution adds packet overhead, due to
    the encapsulation.This document describes an approach to the Route Optimisation
    forNEMO, called Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation for NEMO (MIRON). MIRONenables
    mobility-agnostic nodes within the mobile network to directlycommunicate (i.e.
    without traversing the MRHA bi-directional tunnel)with Correspondent Nodes. The
    solution is based on the Mobile Routerperforming the Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation
    signalling on behalf ofthe nodes of the mobile network.This document (in an appendix)
    also analyses how MIRON fits each ofthe currently identified NEMO Route Optimisation
    requirements forOperational Use in Aeronautics and Space Exploration.</p>"
