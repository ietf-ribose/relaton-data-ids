abstract:
  content: "<p>Peer-to-peer (p2p) protocols, like all distributed protocols, arecomplex,
    and therefore harder to debug and study in the wild. Thisis more true of existing
    p2p protocols, where changing the behaviourof the protocol --- however minor the
    change may be --- may result inunknown manifestations on the dynamics of the swarm
    using thatprotocol. In lieu of the unintended consequences of perturbing alive
    swarm, researchers have resorted to simulation frameworks.However, simulation
    results obtained from one simulator are oftenhard to reproduce when using another
    simulation framework. Thisdocument surveys existing simulator frameworks prevalent
    insimulating p2p protocols today in order to quantify any assumptionsand characteristics
    inherent in the simulator. This, we hope, willaid future researchers in choosing
    the right simulation framework fortheir abstraction.</p>"
