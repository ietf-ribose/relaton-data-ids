abstract:
- content: "<p>Peer-to-peer (p2p) protocols, like all distributed protocols, are complex,
    and therefore harder to debug and study in the wild. This is more true of existing
    p2p protocols, where changing the behaviour of the protocol --- however minor
    the change may be --- may result in unknown manifestations on the dynamics of
    the swarm using that protocol. In lieu of the unintended consequences of perturbing
    a live swarm, researchers have resorted to simulation frameworks. However, simulation
    results obtained from one simulator are often hard to reproduce when using another
    simulation framework. This document surveys existing simulator frameworks prevalent
    in simulating p2p protocols today in order to quantify any assumptions and characteristics
    inherent in the simulator. This, we hope, will aid future researchers in choosing
    the right simulation framework for their abstraction.</p>"
