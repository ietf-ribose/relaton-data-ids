abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When the path characteristics between two hosts change abruptly,
    TCP\ncan experience significant delays before resuming transmission in an\nefficient
    manner or TCP can behave unfairly to competing traffic.\nThis document describes
    TCP extensions that improve transmission\nbehavior in response to advisory, lower-layer
    connectivity-change\nindications.  The proposed TCP extensions modify the local
    behavior\nof TCP and introduce a new TCP option to signal locally received\nconnectivity-change
    indications to remote peers.  Performance gains\nresult from a more efficient
    transmission behavior and there is no\ndifference in aggressiveness in comparison
    to a newly-started\nconnection.\n\t </p>\n      "
