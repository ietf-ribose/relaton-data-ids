abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The MPEG Committee (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29 WG11) is a working group
    in ISO \nthat recently produced the MPEG-4 [1] standard. MPEG defines tools to
    \ncompress content such as audio-visual information into elementary \nstreams.
    In [6] a generic RTP payload format is defined for transport \nof any non-multiplexed
    MPEG-4 elementary stream. To achieve the generic \nMPEG-4 functionality, [6] addresses
    detailed issues related to the \nMPEG-4 SL layer. However, many initial applications
    will not use the SL \nLayer. To facilitate usage of [6] by such applications,
    this document \ndescribes how to use [6] when no SL layer is used.\n\t </p>\n
