abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath transmission is regarded as an effective way to improve
    the\n   quality of service of data delivery. This document defines a\n   multipath
    message transport protocol based on application level relay\n   (MPMTP-AR), which
    is a special profile of multipath transport\n   protocol suite defined in Multipath
    Transport System Based on\n   Application-level Relay (MPTS-AR). MPMTP-AR provides
    reliable data\n   delivery service over multiple paths. This document discusses
    related\n   message format and mechanism to support MPMTP-AR.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
