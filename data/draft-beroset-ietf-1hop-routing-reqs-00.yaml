abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Wireless mesh routing for low cost wireless mesh devices can be
    doneat a layer under IPv6. This document examines the functionalrequirements of
    this kind of routing and to explore why this approachmight be used in some contexts.
    It should be noted that this kind ofrouting is orthogonal to IP-level routing;
    there is no inherentconflict between the two.</p>"
