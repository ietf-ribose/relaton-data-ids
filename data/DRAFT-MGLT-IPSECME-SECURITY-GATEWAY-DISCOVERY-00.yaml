abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Modern Virtual Private Network (VPN) services are typically
    deployed\n   using several security gateways and are frequently accessed over
    a\n   wireless network.  There are several reasons for such a deployment\n   ranging
    from enhancing system resilience to improving performance.\n\n   For example,
    in order to handle traffic efficiently and reduce the\n   burden in the core network,
    the VPN service may be implemented in a\n   distributed manner using multiple
    Security Gateways.  A mobile VPN\n   End User is attached to one of them using
    a WLAN interface and over\n   time is likely to change its Security Gateway of
    attachment.  In this\n   case, in order to optimize the overall user Quality of
    Experience\n   (QoE), a VPN End User should select the next most appropriate\n
    \  Security Gateway based on the characteristics of the available\n   Security
    Gateways.  This draft specifies how a VPN End User can\n   securely collect information
    about Security Gateways in its network\n   neighborhood in order to optimize its
    VPN experience.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
