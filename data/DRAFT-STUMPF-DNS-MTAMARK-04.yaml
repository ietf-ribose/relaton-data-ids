abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In contrast to other more extensive approaches to deal with\n
    \  unsolicited email, commonly called \"spam\", this memo discusses a very\n   simple
    authentication scheme.  It uses marking of hosts in reverse\n   DNS (IN-ADDR.ARPA
    and IP6.ARPA zones) to allow the receiving mail\n   transfer agents to decide
    whether the connecting (sending) host is a\n   designated mail transfer agent
    (MTA) or not.\n\n   Despite being a weaker scheme than most of the other proposals\n
    \  currently discussed, it can reduce the amount of spam and viruses/\n   worms
    significantly and has the advantage that it can be implemented\n   based on existing
    and well-established Internet technology like DNS\n   without any changes to that
    technology.\n\n   This document is part of the LMAP work of the Anti-Spam Research\n
    \  Group (ASRG) of the IRTF.\n\t </p>\n      "
