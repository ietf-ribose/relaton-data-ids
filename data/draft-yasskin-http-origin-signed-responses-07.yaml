abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how a server can send an HTTP exchange--a request
    URL, content negotiation information, and a response--with signatures that vouch
    for that exchange's authenticity. These signatures can be verified against an
    origin's certificate to establish that the exchange is authoritative for an origin
    even if it was transferred over a connection that isn't. The signatures can also
    be used in other ways described in the appendices. These signatures contain countermeasures
    against downgrade and protocol-confusion attacks.</p>"
