abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a framework for providing fast reroute
    in an\n   IP or MPLS network through encapsulation and forwarding to \"not-via\"\n
    \  addresses.  The general approach described uses a single level of\n   encapsulation
    and could be used to protect unicast, multicast, and\n   LDP traffic against link,
    router, and shared risk group failure,\n   regardless of network topology and
    metrics.\n\n   The mechanisms presented in this document are purely illustrative
    of\n   the general approach and do not constitute a protocol specification.\n
    \  The document represents a snapshot of the work of the Routing Area\n   Working
    Group at the time of publication and is published as a\n   document of record.
    \ Further work is needed before implementation or\n   deployment.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
