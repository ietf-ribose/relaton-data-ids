abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document, if approved, formally deprecates Transport Layer\n
    \  Security (TLS) versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346).\n   Accordingly,
    those documents (will be moved|have been moved) to\n   Historic status.  These
    versions lack support for current and\n   recommended cryptographic algorithms
    and mechanisms, and various\n   government and industry profiles of applications
    using TLS now\n   mandate avoiding these old TLS versions.  TLSv1.2 has been the\n
    \  recommended version for IETF protocols since 2008, providing\n   sufficient
    time to transition away from older versions.  Removing\n   support for older versions
    from implementations reduces the attack\n   surface, reduces opportunity for misconfiguration,
    and streamlines\n   library and product maintenance.\n\n   This document also
    deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version 1.0\n   (RFC6347), but not DTLS version
    1.2, and there is no DTLS version\n   1.1.\n\n   This document updates many RFCs
    that normatively refer to TLSv1.0 or\n   TLSv1.1 as described herein.  This document
    also updates the best\n   practices for TLS usage in RFC 7525 and hence is part
    of BCP195.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
