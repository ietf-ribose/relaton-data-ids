abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Explicit congestion notification (ECN) allows a forwarding
    element to\n   notify downstream devices of the onset of congestion without having\n
    \  to drop packets. Coupled with a means to expose congestion by feeding\n   back
    information about it to upstream nodes, this can improve network\n   efficiency
    through better congestion control, frequently without\n   packet drops. This document
    specifies ECN and congestion feedback\n   support through use of the Network Service
    Header (NSH, RFC 8300) and\n   IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX, draft-ietf-tsvwg-tunnel-\n
    \  congestion-feedback).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
