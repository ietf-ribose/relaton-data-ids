abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes CCFS(Congestion Control based on Forward
    path\n   Status), a rate adaptation scheme for interactive real-time media\n   applications,
    such as video conferencing. CCFS classifies the forward\n   paths's status as
    throttled, competing, probing and default which is\n   managed based on estimated
    parameters - bottleneck bandwidth, queue\n   delay and loss ratio. Considering
    only forward path status minimizes\n   influence of backward path's network events
    such as congestion. It is\n   also free from compatibility issues because it defines
    generalized\n   feedback message.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
