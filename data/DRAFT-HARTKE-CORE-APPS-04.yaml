abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The interfaces of RESTful, hypertext-driven applications consist
    of\n   reusable components such as Internet media types and link relation\n   types.
    \ This document defines a simple standard that application\n   designers can use
    to describe the interface of their application in a\n   structured way so that
    other parties can develop interoperable\n   clients and servers or reuse the components
    in their own\n   applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
