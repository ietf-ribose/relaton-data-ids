abstract:
- content: "<p>An architecture is described for content distribution using a secondary
    server that might be operated with reduced privileges. This architecture allows
    a primary server to delegate the responsibility for delivery of the payload of
    an HTTP response to a secondary server. The secondary server is unable to modify
    this content. The content is encrypted, which in some cases will prevent the secondary
    server from learning about the content.</p>"
