abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol
    has been\n   standardized in RFC7285 to ease better-than-random overlay connection\n
    \  management.  However, through the base protocol it is not possible to\n   differenciate
    paths from a given source to a given destination and\n   provide an ALTO client
    with a detailed information of sending traffic\n   through these paths.\n\n   This
    document describes an extension to the ALTO protocol allowing\n   for representation
    of paths in the network maps, cost maps, and\n   endpoint cost calculation.  Morever,
    this document defines a new path\n   computation service.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
