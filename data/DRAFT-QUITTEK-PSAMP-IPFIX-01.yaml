abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo discusses the relationship between the packet sampling
    \n(PSAMP) Working Group and the IP flow information export (IPFIX) \nWorking Group.
    \ The goals of writing this memo are: avoiding \nduplication of work, increase
    mutual benefits between the groups, \nand harmonize the documents and standards
    developed by the groups. \nTherefore, potential overlap of both group's activities
    is analyzed, \nactivities in both groups that potentially complement each other
    are \npointed out, and common issues are listed that should be harmonized \nbetween
    the groups. \n \n\t </p>\n      "
