abstract:
  content: "<p>The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type supports the indication
    of units for a quantity represented. This short document registers a number of
    additional unit names in the IANA registry for Units in SenML. It also defines
    a registry for secondary units that cannot be in SenML's main registry as they
    are derived by linear transformation from units already in that registry; RFC
    8428 is updated to also accept these units.</p>"
