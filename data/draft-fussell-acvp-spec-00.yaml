abstract:
- content: "<p>The ACV Protocol provides a method for communication between a cryptographic
    module that is embedded inside of a device or otherwise running on a platform
    accessible via computer network, and an external testing system, using standard
    network communication interfaces and protocols. This communication protocol can
    also be used to validate the correctness of the algorithm implementations in the
    cryptographic module with a validation authority.</p>"
