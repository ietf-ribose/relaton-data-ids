abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The documents defines a terminology for discussing routingrequirements
    and solutions for networks referred to as Low power andLossy Networks (LLN). A
    LLN is typically composed of many embeddeddevices with limited power, memory,
    and processing resourcesinterconnected by a variety of links. There is a wide
    scope ofapplication areas for LLNs, including industrial monitoring, buildingautomation
    (e.g. Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning, lighting,access control, fire),
    connected home, healthcare, environmentalmonitoring, urban sensor networks, energy
    management, assetstracking, refrigeration.Requirements LanguageThe key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",
    \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in thisdocument are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</p>"
