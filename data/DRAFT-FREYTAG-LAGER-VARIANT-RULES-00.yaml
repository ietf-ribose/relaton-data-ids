abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document gives guidance on designing well-behaved Label\n
    \  Generation Rulesets (LGRs) that support variant labels.  Typical\n   examples
    of labels and LGRs are IDNs and zone registration policies\n   defining permissible
    IDN labels.  Variant labels are labels that are\n   either visually or semantically
    indistinguishable from an applied for\n   label and are typically delegated together
    with the applied-for\n   label, or permanently reserved.  While [RFC7940] defines
    the\n   syntactical requirements for specifying the label generation rules\n   for
    variant labels, additional considerations apply that ensure that\n   the label
    generation rules are consistent and well-behaved in the\n   presence of variants.\n\n\t
