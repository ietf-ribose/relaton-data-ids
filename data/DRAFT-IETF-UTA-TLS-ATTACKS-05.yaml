abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Over the last few years, there have been several serious attacks
    on Transport Layer Security (TLS), including attacks on its most commonly used
    ciphers and modes of operation.  This document summarizes these attacks, with
    the goal of motivating generic and protocol-specific recommendations on the usage
    of TLS and Datagram TLS (DTLS).\n\t </p>\n      "
