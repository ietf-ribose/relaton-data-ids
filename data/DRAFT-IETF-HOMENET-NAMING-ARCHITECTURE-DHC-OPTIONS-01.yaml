abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CPEs are usually constraint devices with reduced network and
    CPU\n   capacities.  As such, a CPE hosting on the Internet the authoritative\n
    \  naming service for its home network may become vulnerable to resource\n   exhaustion
    attacks.  One way to avoid exposing CPE is to outsource\n   the authoritative
    service to a third party.  This third party can be\n   the ISP or any other independent
    third party.\n\n   Outsourcing the authoritative naming service to a third party\n
    \  requires setting up an architecture which may be unappropriated for\n   most
    end users.  To leverage this issue, this document proposes DHCP\n   Options so
    any agnostic CPE can automatically proceed to the\n   appropriated configuration
    and outsource the authoritative naming\n   service for the home network.  This
    document shows that in most\n   cases, these DHCP Options make outsourcing to
    a third party (be it\n   the ISP or any ISP independent service provider) transparent
    for the\n   end user.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
