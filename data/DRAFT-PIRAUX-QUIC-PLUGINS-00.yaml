abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The extensibility of Internet protocols is a key factor to
    their\n   success.  Yet, their implementations are often not designed with\n   agility
    in mind.  In this document, we leverage the features of the\n   QUIC protocol
    and propose a solution to dynamically extend QUIC\n   implementations.  Our solution
    relies on QUIC Plugins that allow\n   tuning and extending the QUIC protocol on
    a per-connection basis.\n   These platform-independent plugins are executed inside
    a sandboxed\n   environment which can be included in QUIC implementations.  We\n
    \  describe how such plugins can be used in different use cases.\n\n   This document
    is a straw-man proposal.  It aims at sparking\n   discussions on the proposed
    approach.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
