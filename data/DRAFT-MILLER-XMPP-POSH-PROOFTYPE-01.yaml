abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a prooftype involving PKIX over Secure
    HTTP\n   (POSH) for associating a domain name with an XML stream in the\n   Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  It also defines a\n   method involving
    HTTPS redirects (appropriate for use with the POSH\n   prooftype) for securely
    delegating a source domain to a derived\n   domain in XMPP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
