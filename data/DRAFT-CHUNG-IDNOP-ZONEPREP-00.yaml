abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Zoneprep intends to provide a framework for applying Charprep
    \nvariants to zone file management.  More specifically, Charprep \nprofiles are
    used to generate a set of perceptually equivalent \ndomains from a given primary
    domain, Zoneprep policy profiles are \nused to determine which among the generated
    set of Charprep variants \nto include into the DNS zone file. \nThis document
    does NOT provide any specific Zoneprep policy profiles, \ninstead it describes
    a framework for Zone Administrators (e.g. \nregistries) to consider when implementing
    IDN.  More importantly, to \nconsider the policy on reserving and publishing variants
    from the \ngiven primary domain to the DNS zone files. \nThis framework also leads
    into the discussion of provisioning \nprotocol for IDN, more importantly for a
    server to announce its \npolicies on reserved variants and zone variants, as well
    as for the \nclient to further manage the IDN.  This document will NOT describe
    \nextensively this issue, for further discussion please refer to [EPP-\nI], which
    incorporates this framework into EPP. \n \n\t </p>\n      "
