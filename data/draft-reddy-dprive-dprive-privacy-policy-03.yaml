abstract:
- content: "<p>Users may want to control how their DNS queries are handled by DNS
    servers so they can configure their system to use DNS servers that comply with
    their privacy and DNS filtering expectations. This document defines a mechanism
    for a DNS server to communicate its privacy statement URL and filtering policy
    to a DNS client. This communication is cryptographically signed to attest its
    authenticity. By evaluating the DNS privacy statement, filtering policy and the
    signatory, the user can choose a DNS server that best supports his/ her desired
    privacy and filtering policy. This token is particularly useful for DNS-over-TLS
    and DNS-over-HTTPS servers that are either public resolvers or are discovered
    on a local network.</p>"
