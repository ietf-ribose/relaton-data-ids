abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Routing header type 3 (termed as RH3) is defined and used
    in\n   Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) that are typically constrained in\n
    \  resources (limited communication data rate, processing power, energy\n   capacity,
    memory).  Based on the mechanisms introduced by RH3, this\n   document specifies
    an new IPv6 Routing Header type that provides\n   encapsulation capability of
    segments with various lengths and can be\n   applied to more scenarios.\n\n\t
