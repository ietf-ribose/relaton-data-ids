abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo registers the Enumservice \"foaf\" using the URI schemes\n\"http\"
    and \"https\" according to the IANA Enumservice registration\nprocess defined
    in RFC3671.  The Enumservice \"foaf\" is to be used to\nrefer from an ENUM domain
    name to the location of a FOAF RDF file\nusing the corresponding E.164 telephone
    number.\n\nClients may use data retrieved from a FOAF RDF file to provide caller\nor
    callee with information available within the Friend-Of-A-Friend\n(FOAF) Semantic
    Web application.  For example, the caller might be\npresented with personal information
    on the callee (e.g. name, gender\nand various online attributes) as well as information
    on the callee's\nsocial context (e.g. relations to friends or colleagues).\nInformation
    collected from FOAF can be used before, during or after a\ncommunication is established.\n\n\t
