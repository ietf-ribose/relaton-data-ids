abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.ietf-6tisch-enrollment-enhanced-beacon] defines a method by which
    a potential [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security] enrollment proxy can announce itself
    as a available for new Pledges to enroll on a network. The announcement includes
    a priority for enrollment. This document provides a mechanism by which a RPL DODAG
    root can disable enrollment announcements, or adjust the base priority for enrollment
    operation.</p>"
