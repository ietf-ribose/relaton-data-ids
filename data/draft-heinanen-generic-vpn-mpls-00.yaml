abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of generic mechanisms which can be used
    to set up network based Virtual Private Networks (VPN) across IP networks. In
    particular, it describes how these mechanisms can be mapped into a network running
    the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) specification. The mechanisms described,
    however, can apply to any type of IP network running various forms of IP tunneling
    mechanisms, and are not solely restricted to MPLS networks. This Draft serves
    to introduce these generic mechanisms, which are part of the broader VPN framework
    which will be described more fully in forthcoming Drafts.</p>"
