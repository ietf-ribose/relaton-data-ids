abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The specification for how a client discovers its network's
    NAT64\n   prefix [RFC7050] defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for this\n
    \  purpose, but declares it to be a non-special name in that\n   specification's
    Domain Name Reservation Considerations section.\n\n   Consequently, despite the
    well articulated special purpose of the\n   name, (at the time of writing) 'ipv4only.arpa'
    still does not appear\n   as one of the names with special properties recorded
    in the Special-\n   Use Domain Names registry.\n\n   This document formally declares
    the actual special properties of the\n   name, and adds similar declarations for
    the corresponding reverse\n   mapping names.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
