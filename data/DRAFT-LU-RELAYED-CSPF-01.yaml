abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For LSPs that span across multiple areas or multiple autonomous\n
    \  systems (AS), the path computation element (PCE) in each area or each\n   AS
    can cooperate and conclude the optimal results if so exist.  An\n   upstream PCE,
    though incapable to carry out the path computation for\n   the tailend outside
    of its domain, can provide the history of the\n   computation to its downstream
    PCEs which will assume the computation\n   job till it is accomplished or relay
    the baton to the next runner.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
