abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Identifying overlay networks and the resources found within in
    them\npresents a number of bootstrapping problems.  While those hard\nproblems
    are under discussion, this draft proposes a small set of\nURI-based mechanisms
    which are intended to be generically useful for\nproviding pointers to peer-to-peer
    overlay networks in web pages,\nemail messages, and other textual media.\n\t </p>\n
