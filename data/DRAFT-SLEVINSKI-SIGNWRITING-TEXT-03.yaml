abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For concreteness, because the universal character set is not
    yet\n   universal, and because an international standard for the internet\n   community
    should be documented and stable, this I-D has been released\n   with the intention
    of producing an RFC to document the character use\n   and naming conventions of
    the SignWriting community on the Internet.\n\n   The SignWriting Script is an
    international standard for writing sign\n   languages by hand or with computers.
    \ From education to research,\n   from entertainment to religion, SignWriting
    has proven useful because\n   people are using it to write signed languages.  The
    SignWriting\n   Script has two major families: Block Printing for the reader and\n
    \  Handwriting for the writer.\n\n   The SignWriting Text encoding model defines
    the structures of\n   SignWriting Block Printing.  The plain-text mathematical
    names are\n   explained with tokens and regular expressions patterns.  The visual\n
    \  image is supported with SVG and PNG generated by a SignWriting Icon\n   Server.
    \ An experimental TrueType Font is available.\n\n   Formal SignWriting strings
    define a lite ASCII markup to name each\n   sign logogram.  The text is defined
    with regular expressions.  The\n   included query language defines several productive
    searching\n   possibilities.  The transformation from query language to regular\n
    \  expression is defined.\n\n   For Unicode, the current use of the Private Use
    Area font characters\n   is documented.  A character proposal for plane 1 is included
    that is\n   isomorphic with the characters that are currently used by the\n   community.\n\n
    \  Three appendices discuss additional topics to the standard.  The\n   first
    discusses the Modern SignWriting theory and example document,\n   stable since
    January 12, 2012.  The second discusses the symbol\n   encoding of the International
    SignWriting Alphabet 2010.  The third\n   discusses the SignPuddle Standards:
    licences, infrastructure, and\n   compatibility.\n\n   This memo concretely defines
    a conceptual character encoding map for\n   the Internet community.  It is published
    for reference, examination,\n   implementation, and evaluation.  Distribution
    of this memo is\n   unlimited.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
