abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) defines a set of topological "segments" within
    an IGP topology to enable steering over a specific SR path. These segments are
    advertised by the link-state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF). This document
    describes extensions to the IS-IS and OSPF required to support the signaling of
    Resource Partition (NRP) segments that operate over SR-MPLS and SRv6 dataplanes.
    Multiple SR NRP segments can be associated with the same topological element to
    allow offering of different forwarding treatments (e.g. scheduling and drop policy)
    associated with each NRP.</p>
