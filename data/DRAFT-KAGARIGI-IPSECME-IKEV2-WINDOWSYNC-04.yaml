abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IKEv2 and IPsec protocols are widely used for deploying VPN.  In\norder
    to make such VPN highly available and failure-prone, these VPNs\nare implemented
    as IKEv2/IPsec Highly Available (HA) cluster.  But\nthere are many issues in IKEv2/IPsec
    HA cluster.  The draft \"IPsec\nCluster Problem Statement\" enumerates all the
    issues encountered in\nIKEv2/IPsec HA cluster environment.\n\nThis draft proposes
    an extension to IKEv2 protocol to solve main\nissues of \"IPsec Cluster Problem
    Statement\" in Hot Standby cluster\nand gives implementation advice for others.
    \ The main issues to be\nsolved are:\no  IKE Message Id synchronization : This
    is done by obtaining the\n\nmessage Id values from the peer and updating the values
    at the\n\nnewly active cluster member after the failover.\no  IPsec SA Counter
    synchronization : This is done by sending\n\nincremented the values of replay
    counters by the newly active\n\ncluster member to the peer as expected replay
    counter value.\n\t </p>\n      "
