abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a set of requirements for signaling QoS across
    different network environments. To achieve wide applicability of the requirements,
    the starting point is a diverse set of user scenarios concerning both access and
    core networks, application interactions, and use within cellular networks. We
    also provide an outline structure for the problem, including QoS related terminology.</p>"
