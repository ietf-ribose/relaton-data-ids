  content: "\n\t <p>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general
    term\nthat refers to detecting and reporting link failures. OAM mechanisms\nhave
    been defined for various layers in the protocol stack, and are\nused with a variety
    of protocols.\n\nThis document presents an overview of the OAM mechanisms that
    have\nbeen defined and are currently being defined by the IETF, as well as\na
    comparison to other OAM mechanisms that have been defined by the\nIEEE and ITU-T.\n\t
