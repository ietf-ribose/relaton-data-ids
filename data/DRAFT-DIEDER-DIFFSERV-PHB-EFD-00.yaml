abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a new per-hop behavior (PHB) for\nDifferentiated
    Services, the so-called 'Expedited Forwarding with\nDropping' PHB. Packets marked
    for this PHB are forwarded with the\nsame low-delay, low-jitter characteristics
    as packets marked with\nthe Expedited Forwarding PHB, but may experience a certain\nprobability
    of packet loss. This PHB is especially suited to provide\nlow-delay services in
    cellular wireless networks\n\t </p>\n      "
