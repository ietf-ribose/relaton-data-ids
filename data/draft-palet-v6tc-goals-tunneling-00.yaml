abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the set of goals for a tunneling setup protocol
    that could be used in several network cases to jumpstart its IPv6 offering to
    its customers by providing them IPv6 connectivity through a simplistic tunneling
    mechanism. The basic network cases, which may have different sets of goals, are
    also introduced, including 3GPP and other Service Providers. Two cases are analyzed
    in the Service Provider scenario, one which apply to simplistic mechanism where
    the user is already authenticated by other network existing means, and another
    which also takes care of the user authentication.</p>"
