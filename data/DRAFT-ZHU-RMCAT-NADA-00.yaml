abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a scheme named network-assisted dynamic\n
    \  adaptation (NADA), a novel congestion control approach for\n   interactive
    real-time media applications, such as video conferencing.\n   In the proposed
    scheme, the sender regulates its sending rate based\n   on either implicit or
    explicit congestion signaling, in a unified\n   approach. The scheme can reap
    the benefits of explicit congestion\n   notification markings from network nodes.
    It also maintains\n   consistent sender behavior in the absence of such markings,
    by\n   reacting to queuing delays instead.\n\n   We present here the overall system
    architecture, recommended\n   behaviors at the sender and the receiver, as well
    as expected network\n   nodes operations. Results from extensive simulation studies
    of the\n   proposed scheme are available upon request.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
