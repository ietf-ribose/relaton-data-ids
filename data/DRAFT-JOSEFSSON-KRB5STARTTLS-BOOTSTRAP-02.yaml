abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes how clients can use the Kerberos V5 over
    TLS\nprotocol together with its long term key to 1) avoid having to\nvalidate
    the server certificate, 2) securely learn a KDC's server\ncertificate, and 3)
    learn the trust anchors used by the KDC.\n\nWe also describe how the Kerberos
    V5 over TLS protocol can be used to\n4) avoid the need for a long term shared
    key between the client and\nthe KDC by instead using TLS client authentication.\n\nThese
    goals are achieved by introducing a new Kerberos V5 pre-\nauthentication type
    that modify how the Kerberos V5 reply key is\nderived.\n\t </p>\n      "
