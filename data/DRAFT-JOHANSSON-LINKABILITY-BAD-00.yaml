abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Current debate on pervasive monitoring often focus on passive
    attacks\n   on the protocol and transport layers but even if these issues were\n
    \  eliminated through the judicious use of encryption, roughly the same\n   information
    would still be available to an attacker who is able to\n   (legally or otherwize)
    obtain access to linked data sets which are\n   being maintained by large content
    and service providers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
