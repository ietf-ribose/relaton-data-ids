abstract:
  content: "\t <t>At present based on a different protocol architecture, 3G wirelessstandards
    start to become more and more IP-based. The upcoming setof 3G wireless specifications
    defined by 3GPP will include SIP[RFC2543] as the session control protocol for
    IP-based voice andmultimedia. An important requirement for introducing SIP is
    thedefinition of a security architecture protecting the session controlsignaling.This
    Internet Draft collects requirements for a SIP securityarchitecture that are related
    to the use of SIP in 3GPP wirelessnetworks. It is intended to stimulate the discussion
    about SIPsecurity and is meant as a source of input for a requirements drafton
    SIP security.</p>"
