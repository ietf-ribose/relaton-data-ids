abstract:
- content: <p>This document captures initial thoughts about having IETF meetings that
    are completely virtual. It explores the issues involved with both a "planned"
    virtual meeting and an "emergency" virtual meeting. The intent is to evolve this
    document to provide answers to the questions posed throughout the text. This is
    currently a thought experiment. There are no current plans to hold a completely
    virtual IETF meeting.</p>
