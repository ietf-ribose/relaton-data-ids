abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS is a query / response protocol.  Failure to respond
    or to\n   respond correctly to queries causes both immediate operational\n   problems
    and long term problems with protocol development.\n\n   This document identifies
    a number of common kinds of queries to which\n   some servers either fail to respond
    or else respond incorrectly.\n   This document also suggests procedures for TLD
    and other zone\n   operators to apply to help reduce / eliminate the problem.\n\n
    \  The document does not look at the DNS data itself, just the structure\n   of
    the responses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
