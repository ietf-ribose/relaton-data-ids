abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IPv6 128-bit address space was designed as a solution for
    the\n   32-bit limitation of IPv4, but the proliferation of IPv4 in the\n   global
    Internet continues via private addressing domains behind\n   Network Address Translators
    (NATs). For these reasons, deployment of\n   IPv6 at the end nodes with minimal
    perturbation of IPv4 networks\n   presents a natural long-term transition and
    coexistence alternative.\n   This document proposes a coexistence scenario with
    IPv6 for end to\n   end addressing and IPv4 for network traversal.\n\t </p>\n
