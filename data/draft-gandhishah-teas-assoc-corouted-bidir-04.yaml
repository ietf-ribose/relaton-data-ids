abstract:
- content: "<p>Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) association signaling can be used
    to bind two unidirectional LSPs into an associated bidirectional LSP. When an
    associated bidirectional LSP is co-routed, the reverse LSP follows the same path
    as its forward LSP. This document describes Fast Reroute (FRR) procedures for
    both single-sided and double-sided provisioned associated bidirectional LSPs.
    The FRR procedures are applicable to co-routed and non co-routed LSPs. For co-routed
    LSPs, the FRR procedures can ensure that traffic flows on co-routed paths in the
    forward and reverse directions after a failure event.</p>"
