abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Flow selection is the process in charge of electing a limited numberof
    flows from all of those observed at an observation point to beconsidered into
    the measurement process chain. The flow selectionprocess can be enabled at different
    stages of the monitoringreference model. It can be performed at metering time
    once thepacket classification has been executed, i.e. flow state dependentpacket
    selection, or at recording/exporting time by limiting thenumber of flows to be
    stored and/or exported to the collectorapplications. This document illustrates
    the motivations which mightlead flow selection to be performed and presents a
    classification ofthe related techniques. The document furthermore provides aninformation
    model for configuring flow selection techniques anddiscusses what information
    about the flow selection process isbeneficial to be exported by adopting a suitable
    information model.</p>"
