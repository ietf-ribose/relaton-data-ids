abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer\nSecurity
    (DTLS) protocol over the Stream Control Transmission\nProtocol (SCTP).\n\nThe
    user of DTLS over SCTP can take advantage of all features\nprovided by SCTP and
    its extensions, especially support of\no  multiple streams to avoid head of line
    blocking.\n\no  multi-homing to provide network level fault tolerance.\n\no  unordered
    delivery.\n\no  partial reliable data transfer.\n\t </p>\n      "
