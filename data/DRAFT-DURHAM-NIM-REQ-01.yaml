abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As networking technology has evolved, a diverse set of technologies
    \nhas been deployed to manage the resulting products.  These very from \nWeb based
    products, standard management protocols, and text scripts.  \nThe underlying systems
    to be manipulated are represented in varying \nways including implicitly in the
    programmatics, with proprietary \ndata descriptions, or with standardized descriptions
    using a range \nof technologies including MIBs, PIBs, or LDAP schemas.  The result
    \nis that a single application such as DHCP or Differentiated Services \nmay be
    represented in many different inconsistent fashions.  Even \nthe existing standard
    descriptive technologies have not been \nfocussed on re-use across domains and
    commonality.  The situation \nwould be significantly improved if there were to
    be a common \nrepresentation of data (an 'information model') from which \ntechnology-specific
    data models can be derived to suit application-\nspecific configuration and management
    needs.  This would allow the \nindustry to build common descriptions, resulting
    in consistency \nacross the paradigms, and better interoperability.  Such an \n'information
    model' would also assist other IETF working groups by \nreducing the work needed
    to determine how to represent those parts \nof their technology that are already
    in the common model.\n\t </p>\n      "
