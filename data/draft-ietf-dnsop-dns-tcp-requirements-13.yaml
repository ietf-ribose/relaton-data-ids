abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC 1123 and RFC 1536. This document strongly
    encourages the operational practice of permitting DNS messages to be carried over
    TCP on the Internet as a Best Current Practice. Such encouragement is aligned
    with the implementation requirements in RFC 7766. The use of TCP includes both
    DNS over unencrypted TCP, as well as over an encrypted TLS session. The document
    also considers the consequences with this form of DNS communication and the potential
    operational issues that can arise when this Best Current Practice is not upheld.</p>"
