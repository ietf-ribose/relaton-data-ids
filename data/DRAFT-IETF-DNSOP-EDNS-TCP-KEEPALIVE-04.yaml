abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS messages between clients and servers may be received over
    either\n   UDP or TCP.  UDP transport involves keeping less state on a busy\n
    \  server, but can cause truncation and retries over TCP.  Additionally,\n   UDP
    can be exploited for reflection attacks.  Using TCP would reduce\n   retransmits
    and amplification.  However, clients commonly use TCP\n   only for fallback and
    servers typically use idle timeouts on the\n   order of seconds.\n\n   This document
    defines an EDNS0 option (\"edns-tcp-keepalive\") that\n   allows DNS servers to
    signal a variable idle timeout.  This\n   signalling facilitates a better balance
    of UDP and TCP transport\n   between individual clients and servers, reducing
    the impact of\n   problems associated with UDP transport and allowing the state\n
    \  associated with TCP transport to be managed effectively with minimal\n   impact
    on the DNS transaction time.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
