abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines
    an\n   architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize\n   information
    exchange between the control plane and the forwarding\n   plane in a ForCES Network
    Element (ForCES NE).  RFC5812 has defined\n   the ForCES Model which provides
    a formal way to represent the\n   capabilities, state, and configuration of forwarding
    elements(FEs)\n   within the context of the ForCES protocol.  More specifically,
    the\n   model describes the logical functions that are present in an FE, what\n
    \  capabilities these functions support, and how these functions are or\n   can
    be interconnected.  The control elements (CEs) can control the\n   FEs using the
    ForCES model definition.\n\n   The ForCES WG charter has been extended to allow
    the LFB topology to\n   be across FEs.  This documents describes a non-intrusive
    way to\n   extend the LFB topology across FEs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
