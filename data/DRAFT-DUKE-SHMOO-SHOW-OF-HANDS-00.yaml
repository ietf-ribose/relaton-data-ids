abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is the specification for an experimental show of hands
    tool for\n   the Meetecho system to be used in online meetings to help chairs\n
    \  quickly poll the meeting.  This tool is different from the previous\n   experimental
    virtual hum tool as it addresses a different use case\n   with different functionality.
    \ Following mixed feedback in the IETF\n   108 post-meeting survey, the experimental
    virtual hum tool has been\n   withdrawn from the Meetecho client for IETF 109.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
