abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) has
    been\n   extended with a Leasequery capability that allows a requestor to\n   request
    information about DHCPv6 bindings.  That mechanism is limited\n   to queries for
    DHCPv6 binding data updates prior to the time the\n   DHCPv6 server receives the
    Leasequery request.  Continuous update of\n   an external requestor with Leasequery
    data is sometimes desired.\n   This document expands on the DHCPv6 Leasequery
    protocol, and allows\n   for active transfer of real-time DHCPv6 binding information
    data via\n   TCP.  This document also updates DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery (RFC5460)
    by\n   adding new options.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
