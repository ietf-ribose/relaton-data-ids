abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC8200 specifies the HBH header that is assumed to be processed by
    each hop in the delivery path of the packet. However, RFC8200 also expects that
    nodes processing the HBH header have been explicitly configured to do so. Therefore,
    it cannot be assumed that a HBH header present in the packet is processed. It
    all depends on the configuration of each node across the path. Moreover, in most
    of networks today, the processing of the HBH header is done in the control plane
    (slow processing path) which incurs several limitations among which resources
    consumption and security risk. For these reasons, over time, the Hop-by-Hop Options
    header has been sparsely used without any form of large scale deployment. Also,
    most of already defined HBH options are forwarding options which contain forwarding
    plane information that needs not to be sent to the control plane. This document
    proposes a new Hop-by-Hop Forwarding Options Header in order to carry Hop-by-Hop
    options that are solely intended to and processed by the forwarding plane. This
    new HBH header is confined in and dedicated to the forwarding plane while the
    current HBH header can still be used for control plane options.</p>"
