abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 6443 'Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia'\n
    \  describes how devices use the Internet to place emergency calls and\n   how
    Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) can handle Internet\n   multimedia emergency
    calls natively.  The exchange of multimedia\n   traffic typically involves a SIP
    session establishment starting with\n   a SIP INVITE that negotiates various parameters
    for that session.\n\n   In some cases, however, the transmission of application
    data is\n   everything that is needed.  Examples of such environments include
    a\n   temperature sensors issuing alerts, or vehicles sending crash data.\n   Often
    these alerts are conveyed as one-shot data transmissions.\n   These type of interactions
    are called 'data-only emergency calls'.\n   This document describes a container
    for the data based on the Common\n   Alerting Protocol (CAP) and its transmission
    using the SIP MESSAGE\n   transaction.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
