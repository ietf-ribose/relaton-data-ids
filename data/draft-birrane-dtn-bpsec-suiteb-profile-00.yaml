abstract:
- content: <p>The United States Government has published guidelines for "NSA Suite
    B Cryptography" dated July, 2005, which defines cryptographic algorithm policy
    for national security applications. This document specifies the conventions for
    using Suite B cryptography with Bundle Protocol Security (BPSec). Since many of
    the Suite B algorithms enjoy uses in other environments as well, the majority
    of the conventions needed for the Suite B algorithms are already specified in
    other documents. This document references the source of these conventions, with
    some relevant details repeated to aid developers that choose to support Suite
    B within BPSec.</p>
