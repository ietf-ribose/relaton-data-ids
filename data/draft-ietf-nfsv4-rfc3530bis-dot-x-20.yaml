abstract:
  content: "<p>The Network File System (NFS) version 4 is a distributed filesystem
    protocol which owes its heritage to NFS protocol version 2, RFC 1094, and version
    3, RFC 1813. Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4 protocol supports traditional
    file access, while integrating support for file locking and the mount protocol.
    In addition, support for strong security (and its negotiation), compound operations,
    client caching, and internationalization have been added. Of course, attention
    has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an Internet environment.
    RFC3530bis formally obsoleting RFC 3530. This document, together with RFC3530bis
    replaces RFC 3530 as the definition of the NFS version 4 protocol.</p>"
