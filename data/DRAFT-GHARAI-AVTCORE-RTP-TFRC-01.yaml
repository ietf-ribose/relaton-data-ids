abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies how the TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC)
    of RTP\n   flows can be supported using the RTP/AVPF profile and the general RTP\n
    \  header extension mechanism.  AVPF feedback packets and RTP header\n   extensions
    are defined to support the exchange of control information\n   between RTP TFRC
    senders and receivers.  TFRC is an equation-based\n   congestion control scheme
    for unicast flows operating in a best\n   effort Internet environment.\n\n\t </p>\n
