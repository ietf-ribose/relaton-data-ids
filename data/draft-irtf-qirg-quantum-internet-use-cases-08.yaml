abstract:
- content: "<p>The Quantum Internet has the potential to improve application functionality
    by incorporating quantum information technology into the infrastructure of the
    overall Internet. This document provides an overview of some applications expected
    to be used on the Quantum Internet, and then categorizes them using various classification
    schemes. Some general requirements for the Quantum Internet are also discussed.
    The intent of this document is to describe a framework for applications, and describe
    a few selected application scenarios for the Quantum Internet. This document is
    a product of the Quantum Internet Research Group (QIRG).</p>"
