abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks, network-performance criteria (e.g., latency)
    are\n   becoming as critical to data-path selection as other metrics.  This\n
    \  document describes extensions to IS-IS Traffic Engineering (TE)\n   Metric
    Extensions (RFC 8570).  This draft provides the necessary IS-\n   IS extensions
    about the link bit error ratio (LBER) that need to be\n   used to describe network-performance.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
