abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an OSPF extension for routers to advertise the
    running status and environment of the directly attached 5G Edge Computing servers.
    The AppMetaData can be used by the routers in the 5G Local Data Network to make
    intelligent decisions to optimize the forwarding of flows from UEs. The goal is
    to improve latency and performance for 5G Edge Computing services.</p>"
