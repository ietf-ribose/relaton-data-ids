abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version
    4 minor\n   version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS\n
    \  version 4 minor version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and\n   protocol
    extensions made subsequently.  The later minor version has\n   no dependencies
    on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and is considered a\n   separate protocol.\n\n
    \  This document obsoletes RFC5661.  It substantialy revises the\n   treatment
    of features relating to multi-server namesapce superseding\n   the description
    of those features appearing in RFC5661.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
