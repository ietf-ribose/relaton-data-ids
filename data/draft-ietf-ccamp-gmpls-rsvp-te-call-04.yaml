abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networking topologies, it may be advantageous to maintain
    associations between endpoints and key transit points to support an instance of
    a service. Such associations are known as Calls. A Call does not provide the actual
    connectivity for transmitting user traffic, but only builds a relationship by
    which subsequent Connections may be made. In Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) such Connections
    are known as Label Switched Paths (LSPs). This document specifies how GMPLS Resource
    Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling may be used and
    extended to support Calls. These mechanisms provide full and logical Call/Connection
    separation. The mechanisms proposed in this document are applicable to any environment
    (including multi-area), and for any type of interface: packet, layer-2, time-division
    multiplexed, lambda, or fiber switching. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
