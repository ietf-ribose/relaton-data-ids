abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes BGMP, a protocol for inter-domain multicastrouting.
    BGMP builds shared trees for active multicast groups, andallows receiver domains
    to build source-specific, inter-domain,distribution branches where needed. Building
    upon concepts from CBT andPIM-SM, BGMP requires that each multicast group be associated
    with asingle root (in BGMP it is referred to as the root domain). BGMPassumes
    that at any point in time, different ranges of the class D spaceare associated
    (e.g., with MASC [MASC]) with different domains. Each ofthese domains then becomes
    the root of the shared domain-trees for allgroups in its range. Multicast participants
    will generally receivebetter multicast service if the session initiator's address
    allocatorselects addresses from its own domain's part of the space, thereby</p>"
