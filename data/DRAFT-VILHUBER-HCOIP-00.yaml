abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Bandwidth consumption of RTP flows can be reduced by tunneling
    and\ncompressing headers.  This draft defines an IP protocol number and a\nheader
    which can be used to transport IP Header Compressed [IPHC],\nCompressed RTP [CRTP],
    and Enhanced Compressed RTP [ECRTP] packets\nover an arbitrary IP tunnel (IP-in-IP
    or ESP, for example) to reduce\nbandwidth consumption for RTP flows.\n\t </p>\n
