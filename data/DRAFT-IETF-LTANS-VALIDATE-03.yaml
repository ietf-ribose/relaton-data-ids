abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Digitally signed documents and data in a LTANS service receive
    the\nsignature renwal procedures and non-repudiation services.  As\ndocuments
    can be stored for very long (theoretically inifinite)\ntimes, it is very important
    to understand which data is and will be\nnecessary for the verification of the
    contained digital signatures\nand the applied timestamps and the evidence records.
    \ This document\nshall describe various pieces of information which SHOULD and
    MUST be\nprovided to effectively verify evidence records and their protected\ndata
    and signatures.\n\t </p>\n      "
