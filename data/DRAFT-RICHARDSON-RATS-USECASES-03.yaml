abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document details mechanisms created for performing Remote\n
    \  Attestation that have been used in a number of industries.  The\n   document
    intially focuses on existing industry verticals, mapping\n   terminology used
    in those specifications to the more abstract\n   terminology used by RATS.\n\n
    \  The document aspires to describe possible future use cases that would\n   be
    enabled by common formats.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
