abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document analyzes the timeline of the specification and\n
    \  implementation of different types of \"transient numeric identifiers\"\n   used
    in IETF protocols, and how the security and privacy properties\n   of such protocols
    have been affected as a result of it.  It provides\n   empirical evidence that
    advice in this area is warranted.  This\n   document is a product of the Privacy
    Enhancement and Assessment\n   Research Group (PEARG) in the IRTF.\n\n\t </p>\n
