abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the last decade a substantial amount of work has occurred in the
    space of federated access management. Most of this effort has focused on two use-cases:
    network and web-based access. However, the solutions to these use-cases that have
    been proposed and deployed tend to have few common building blocks in common.
    This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions to the commonly
    used security mechanisms for both federated and non- federated access management,
    including the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) and the Diameter
    protocol, the Generic Security Service (GSS), the GS2 family, the Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP) and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). The architecture
    addresses the problem of federated access management to primarily non-web-based
    services, in a manner that will scale to large numbers of identity providers,
    relying parties, and federations.</p>"
