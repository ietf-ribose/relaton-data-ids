abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a new Mobile IPv4 extension which is used
    to\nnegotiate the Multicast-Broadcast Encapsulation Delivery style in the\ncase
    of Mobile IPv4 Foreign Agent Care-of Address mode registration.\nWith this extension
    the mobile node is able to negotiate the type of\ntraffic that needs to be encapsulated
    for delivery to the foreign\nagent while other types of traffic use the direct
    delivery style.\nThis mechanism eliminates the tunnel overhead between the mobile
    node\nand the foreign agent.  Multicast and broadcast applications on a\nmobile
    IPv4 mobile node are better served with this extension.\n\t </p>\n      "
