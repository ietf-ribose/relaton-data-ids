abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The QUIC transport protocol has several features that are desirable\n
    \  in a transport for HTTP, such as stream multiplexing, per-stream flow\n   control,
    and low-latency connection establishment.  This document\n   describes a mapping
    of HTTP semantics over QUIC.  This document also\n   identifies HTTP/2 features
    that are subsumed by QUIC, and describes\n   how HTTP/2 extensions can be ported
    to HTTP/3.\n\nDO NOT DEPLOY THIS VERSION OF HTTP\n\n   DO NOT DEPLOY THIS VERSION
    OF HTTP/3 UNTIL IT IS IN AN RFC.  This\n   version is still a work in progress.
    \ For trial deployments, please\n   use earlier versions.\n\nNote to Readers\n\n
    \  Discussion of this draft takes place on the QUIC working group\n   mailing
    list (quic@ietf.org), which is archived at\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=quic.\n\n
    \  Working Group information can be found at https://github.com/quicwg;\n   source
    code and issues list for this draft can be found at\n   https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/labels/-http.\n\n\t
