abstract:
- content: "<p>Dual-Stack Lite is a solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity
    to customers which are addressed only with an IPv6 prefix. DS-Lite requires to
    pre-configure the AFTR tunnel information on the B4 element. In many networks,
    the customer profile information may be stored in AAA servers while client configurations
    are mainly provided through DHC protocol. This document specifies two new RADIUS
    attributes to carry Dual-Stack Lite Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) IPv6
    address and name; the RADIUS attributes are defined based on the equivalent DHCPv6
    options already specified in draft-ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option. These
    RADIUS attributes are meant to be used between the RADIUS Server and the NAS,
    they are not intended to be used directly between the B4 element and the RADIUS
    Server.</p>"
