abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this document is proposed a protocol for intra-domain mobility\nmanagement.
    This is intended to offer a transparent point-to-point\ntransport service for
    IP datagrams that need to be delivered to\nmobile nodes. SIMPLE (Scalable Intra-domain
    Mobility Protocol using\nLocal Encapsulation) makes it possible for a mobile node
    to change\nits point of attachment to a LAN, a group of LANs or even a MAN\nwithout
    changing its IP address, this link being the home or a\nforeign one.\n\n\t </p>\n
