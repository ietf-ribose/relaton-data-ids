abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Applications often use HTTP as a substrate to create HTTP-based
    APIs.\n   This document specifies best practices for writing specifications\n
    \  that use HTTP to define new application protocols.  It is written\n   primarily
    to guide IETF efforts to define application protocols using\n   HTTP for deployment
    on the Internet, but might be applicable in other\n   situations.\n\n\t </p>\n
