abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are end-users who believe encryption technologies like
    IPSec\n   alone are insufficient to protect the confidentiality of their highly\n
    \  sensitive traffic flows.  These end-users want their flows to\n   traverse
    devices which have been freshly appraised and verified for\n   trustworthiness.
    \ This specification describes Trusted Path Routing.\n   Trusted Path Routing
    protects sensitive flows as they transit a\n   network by forwarding traffic to/from
    sensitive subnets across\n   network devices recently appraised as trustworthy.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
