  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a simple protocol for retrieving metadata
    about\n   named entities, or named collections of entities.  The goal of the\n
    \  protocol is to profile various aspects of HTTP to allow requesters to\n   rely
    on certain, rigorously defined, behaviour.\n\n   This document is a product of
    the Research and Education Federations\n   (REFEDS) Working Group process.\n\n\t
