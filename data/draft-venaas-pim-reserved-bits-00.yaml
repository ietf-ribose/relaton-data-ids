abstract:
- content: "<p>The currently defined PIM version 2 messages share a common message
    header format. The common header definition contains eight reserved bits. This
    document specifies how these bits may be used by individual message types, and
    creates a registry containing the per message type usage. This document also extends
    the PIM type space by defining a new message type where four of the flag bits
    are used as an extended type range. This document Updates RFC7761 and RFC3973
    by defining the use of the currently Reserved field in the PIM common header.
    This document further updates RFC7761 and RFC3973, along with RFC5015, RFC6754
    and I-D.ietf-pim-source-discovery-bsr, by specifying the use of the currently
    Reserved bits for each PIM message.</p>"
