abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Modern users of messaging systems usually have multiple devices,
    and\n   often desire to send and receive encrypted messages on some or all of\n
    \  their devices.  Using encryption on multiple devices often results in\n   situations
    where messages cannot be decrypted on the device used to\n   read the message
    due to a missing private key.\n\n   This document specifies a protocol for secure
    peer-to-peer\n   synchronization of private keys across devices belonging to the
    same\n   user (pEp Key Synchronization Protocol).\n\n   The pretty Easy privacy
    (pEp) protocols describe a set of conventions\n   for the automation of operations
    traditionally seen as barriers to\n   the use and deployment of secure end-to-end
    interpersonal messaging.\n   These include, but are not limited to, key management,
    key discovery,\n   and private key handling.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
