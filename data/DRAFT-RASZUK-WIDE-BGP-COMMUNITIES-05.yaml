abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Route tagging plays an important role in external BGP [RFC4271]\n
    \  relations, in communicating various routing policies between peers.\n   It
    is also a very common best practice among operators to propagate\n   various additional
    information about routes intra-domain.  The most\n   common tool used today to
    attach various information about routes is\n   through the use of BGP communities
    [RFC1997].\n\n   Such information is important to allow BGP speakers to perform
    some\n   mutually agreed actions without the need to maintain a separate\n   offline
    database for each tuple of prefix and associated set of\n   action entries.\n\n
    \  This document defines a new encoding which will enhance and simplify\n   what
    can be accomplished today with the use of BGP communities.  The\n   most important
    addition this specification makes over currently\n   defined BGP communities is
    the ability to specify, carry as well as\n   use for execution an operator's defined
    set of parameters.  It also\n   provides an extensible platform for any new community
    encoding needs\n   in the future.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
