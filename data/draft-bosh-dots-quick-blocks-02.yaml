abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies new DOTS signal channel configuration parameters
    that are negotiated between DOTS peers to enable the use of Q-Block1 and Q-Block2
    Options. These options enable faster transmission rates for large amounts of data
    with less packet interchanges as well as supporting faster recovery should any
    of the blocks get lost in transmission.</p>"
