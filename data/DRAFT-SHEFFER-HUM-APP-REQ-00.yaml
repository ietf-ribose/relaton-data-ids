abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF has been having virtual meetings for a long time.
    \ Until\n   recently these have been interim meetings, and following the all-\n
    \  virtual IETF-107 we expect to see more and more WG meetings take the\n   virtual
    route.  A common practice at the IETF is to use room\n   \"humming\" to gauge
    working group consensus, though the final\n   consensus is determined by the working
    group chairs and typically\n   requires a mailing list poll as well.  We do not
    have a technique\n   equivalent to the hum for virtual meetings, and arguably
    this reduces\n   the effectiveness of these meetings.\n\n   This document defines
    the requirements from a web application whose\n   goal is to most faithfully replicate
    the \"feel\" of hums, through the\n   use of a traditional web user interface.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
