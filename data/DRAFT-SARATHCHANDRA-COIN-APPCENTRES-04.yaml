abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The application-centric deployment of 'Internet' services has\n
    \  increased over the past ten years with many millions of applications\n   providing
    user-centric services, executed on increasingly more\n   powerful smartphones
    that are supported by Internet-based cloud\n   services in distributed data centres,
    the latter mainly provided by\n   large scale players such as Google, Amazon and
    alike. This draft\n   outlines a vision for evolving those data centres towards
    executing\n   app-centric micro-services; we dub this evolved data centre as an\n
    \  AppCentre. Complemented with the proliferation of such AppCentres at\n   the
    edge of the network, they will allow for such micro-services to\n   be distributed
    across many places of execution, including mobile\n   terminals themselves, while
    specific micro-service chains equal\n   today's applications in existing smartphones.\n\n
    \  We outline the key enabling technologies that needs to be provided\n   for
    such evolution to be realized, including references to ongoing\n   standardization
    efforts in key areas.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
