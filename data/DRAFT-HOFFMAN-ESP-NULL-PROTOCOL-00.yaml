abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>It is desirable to allow firewalls and intrusion detection systems
    to\nbe able to inspect the payload of an ESP packet that has been\nencrypted with
    the NULL cipher.  This would allow a firewall to read\nthe contents and apply
    the normal policies to it.  However, a device\nin the network cannot reliably
    determine which ESP packets are NULL\nencrypted, and cannot easily determine other
    ESP format parameters\nsuch as the ICV length.  These issues can cause misclassification
    of\npackets and wasted computational resources.\n\nThis document solves this problem
    by defining an authentication-only\nprofile of ESP and reserving IP protocol numbers
    for it.\n\t </p>\n      "
