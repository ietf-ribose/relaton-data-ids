abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The HTTP Session Management Mechanism provides a mean of securely\n
    \  establishing a persistent authentication session between a HTTP\n   client
    and server that does not rely on the presentation of a\n   confidential bearer
    token.  The Session Management Mechanism is\n   intended to provide a replacement
    for the existing HTTP State\n   Management Mechanism (Cookies) for this purpose.\n\n
    \  This document defines the HTTP Accept-Session, Set-Session and\n   Session
    headers and specifies their use to establish symmetric\n   authentication keys
    and their use to authenticate and verify specific\n   parts of an HTTP message.
    \ Other means by which keys used to\n   authenticate the messages are established
    are outside the scope of\n   this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
