abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft is standards track proposal to update to the Cryptographic
    Algorithm Implementation Requirements for ESP and AH; it also adds usage guidance
    to help in the selection of these algorithms. The Encapsulating Security Payload
    (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH) protocols makes use of various cryptographic
    algorithms to provide confidentiality and/or data origin authentication to protected
    data communications in the IP Security (IPsec) architecture. To ensure interoperability
    between disparate implementations, the IPsec standard specifies a set of mandatory-to-
    implement algorithms. This document specifies the current set of mandatory-to-implement
    algorithms for ESP and AH, specifies algorithms that should be implemented because
    they may be promoted to mandatory at some future time, and also recommends against
    the implementation of some obsolete algorithms. Usage guidance is also provided
    to help the user of ESP and AH best achieve their security goals through appropriate
    choices of cryptographic algorithms.</p>"
