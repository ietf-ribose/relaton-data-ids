abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1)\n
    \  allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on\n   a
    server.  IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote\n   message folders)
    in a way that is functionally equivalent to local\n   folders.  IMAP4rev1 also
    provides the capability for an offline\n   client to resynchronize with the server.\n\n
    \  IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming\n   mailboxes,
    checking for new messages, permanently removing messages,\n   setting and clearing
    flags, RFC 5322 and RFC 2045 parsing, searching,\n   and selective fetching of
    message attributes, texts, and portions\n   thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev1 are
    accessed by the use of numbers.\n   These numbers are either message sequence
    numbers or unique\n   identifiers.\n\n   IMAP4rev1 supports a single server.  A
    mechanism for accessing\n   configuration information to support multiple IMAP4rev1
    servers is\n   discussed in RFC 2244.\n\n   IMAP4rev1 does not specify a means
    of posting mail; this function is\n   handled by a mail transfer protocol such
    as RFC 5321.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
