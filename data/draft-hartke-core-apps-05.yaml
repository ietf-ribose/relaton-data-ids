abstract:
- content: "<p>The interfaces of RESTful, hypertext-driven applications consist of
    reusable components such as Internet media types and link relation types. This
    document defines a simple standard that application designers can use to describe
    the interface of their application in a structured way so that other parties can
    develop interoperable clients and servers or reuse the components in their own
    applications.</p>"
