abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Devices using zeroconf networking protocols can communicate using
    IP\nwithout requiring user configuration or infrastructure services like\nDHCP
    and DNS.\nThe options available to secure zeroconf networks are canvassed.  A\ncomparison
    is made between bootstrapping IPSec and securing sample\nprotocols from each area
    listed in the zeroconf working group\ncharter.  This shows IPSec to be the most
    promising approach for\nsecuring zeroconf protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
