abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation \n
    \   functions in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label \n    Switching
    (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. \n     \n    MPLS and GMPLS networks
    may be constructed from layered service \n    networks. It is advantageous for
    overall network efficiency to \n    provide end-to-end traffic engineering across
    multiple network \n    layers through a process called inter-layer traffic engineering.
    \n    PCE is a candidate solution for such requirements.\n\t </p>\n      "
