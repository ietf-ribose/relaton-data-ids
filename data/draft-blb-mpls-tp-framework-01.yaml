abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies an archiectectural framework for theapplication
    of MPLS in transport networks. It describes a profile ofMPLS that enables operational
    models typical in transport networksnetworks, while providing additional OAM,
    survivability and othermaintenance functions not currently supported by MPLS.</p>"
