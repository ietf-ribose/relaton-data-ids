abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of a Network Policy System is to manage and control a network
    as a whole. To achieve this purpose, network operators need to control the behavior
    of the individual entities that comprise the network, and this control needs to
    be harmonized across multiple entities. For example, to control the access to
    a network, the operator must control the behavior at all of network elements at
    the edge of the network, and must apply consistent policies at those elements.
    Network Services are provided by network operators to their customers using the
    resources of the network. To effectively control a network, the operator must
    have knowledge of network services supported by the network, as well as knowledge
    of the network resource utilization and the capabilities of each network entity.
    Control of the network to deliver the network services will involve applying policy
    at individual network entities and across the whole network, as well as controlling
    and allocating the resources within the network. This document describes a common
    framework and common core YANG data model for network policies. The framework
    can be applied to deliver various different network services by controlling the
    policies that enable features such as Constraint-based Routing, Network QoS, Traffic
    engineering, network management, etc. In future, the core data model could be
    augmented by additional YANG data modules modeling and configuring policy-related
    protocols and functions. The policy data model described in this document provides
    common building blocks for such extensions.</p>"
