abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a mechanism to indicate which traffic\n
    \  engineering protocols are enabled on a link in OSPF.  It does so by\n   introducing
    a new Traffic-Engineering Protocol sub-TLV for the Link\n   TLV in the OSPFv2
    TE Opaque LSA.  This document also describes\n   mechanisms to address backward
    compatibility issues for routers that\n   have not yet been upgraded to software
    that understands this new sub-\n   TLV.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
