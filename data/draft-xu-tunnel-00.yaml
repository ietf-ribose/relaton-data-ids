abstract:
  content: "<p>Virtual Aggregation (VA) is a mechanism for shrinking the size of theDFZ
    FIB in routers [I-D.francis-intra-va]. VA can result in longerpaths and increased
    load on routers within the ISP that deploys VA.This document describes a mechanism
    that allows an AS that originatesa route to associate a tunnel endpoint terminating
    at itself with theroute. This allows routers in a remote AS to tunnel packets
    to theoriginating AS. If transit ASes between the remote AS and theoriginating
    AS install the prefixes associated with tunnel endpointsin their FIBs, then tunneled
    packets that transit through them willtake the shortest path. This results in
    reduced load for the transitAS, and better performance for the customers at the
    source anddestination.</p>"
