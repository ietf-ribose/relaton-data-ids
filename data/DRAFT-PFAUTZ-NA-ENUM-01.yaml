abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses a number of the administrative issues
    that\nmust be resolved before effective deployment of ENUM[2,3] services\nin complex
    environments with number portability and multiple\nproviders for using DNS for
    translation of E.164 (telephone)\nnumbers. North America is examined critically
    because its\nenvironment may be more complex than most and because current\nderegulation
    trends may drive other countries/regions in similar\ndirections. In particular
    the current mechanisms for number\nadministration and number portability in North
    America will require\nestablishment of a new administrative function for managing
    the\ndomain name entries for ported numbers.\n\t </p>\n      "
