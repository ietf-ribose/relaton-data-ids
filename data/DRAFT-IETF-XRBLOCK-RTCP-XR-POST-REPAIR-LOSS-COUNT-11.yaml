abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended
    Report (XR) block that allows reporting of a post-repair loss count metric for
    a range of RTP applications.  In addition, another metric, repaired loss count,
    is also introduced in this report block for calculating the pre-repair loss count
    when needed, so that the RTP sender or a third-party entity is able to evaluate
    the effectiveness of the repair methods used by the system.\n\t </p>\n      "
