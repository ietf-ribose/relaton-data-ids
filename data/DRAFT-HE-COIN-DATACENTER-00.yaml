abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft wants to review the existing research and the open
    issues\n   that relate to the addition of data plane programmability in Data\n
    \  Center.  While some of the research hypotheses that are at the center\n   of
    in-network-computing have been investigated since the time of\n   active networking,
    recent developments in software defined\n   networking, virtualization programmable
    switches and new network\n   programming languages like P4 have generated a new
    enthusiasm in the\n   research community and a flourish of new projects in systems
    and\n   applications alike.  This is what this draft is addressing.\n\n\t </p>\n
