abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are intended to serve as persistent,\n
    \  location-independent, resource identifiers.  To structure and\n   organize
    their usage, the URN syntax (RFC 2141bis) specifies a\n   hierarchy that divides
    the set of possible URNs into \"URN Namespaces\"\n   that can be individually
    defined and managed.  URN Namespaces in\n   particular serve to map existing identifier
    systems into the URN\n   system and thereby make available generic, network-based
    resolution\n   services for the identified documents, artifacts, and other objects\n
    \  (and metadata related to them).\n\n   To achive these goals, URN Namespaces
    need to be specified in a\n   comparable manner, and their Namespace Identifiers
    (NIDs) need to be\n   registered with IANA, so that naming conflicts are avoided
    and\n   implementers of services can follow a structured approach in support\n
    \  of various namespaces, guided by the registry to the related\n   documents
    and the particularities of specific namespaces, as\n   described in these Namespace
    registration documents.\n\n   This RFC serves as a guideline for authors of URN
    Namespace\n   definition and registration documents and the process to be followed\n
    \  to register a URN Namespace with IANA.  It describes the essential\n   content
    of such documents and how they shall be structured to allow\n   readers familar
    with the scheme to quickly assess the properties of a\n   specific URN Namespace.\n\n
    \  This document is a companion document to the revised URN Syntax\n   specification,
    RFC 2141bis; it supersedes and replaces RFC 3406.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
