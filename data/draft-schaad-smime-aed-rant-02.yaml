abstract:
  content: "<p>The Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content Type allows for the use ofAuthenticated-Enveloped
    modes with block cipher algorithms. At thetime of the original design there was
    discussion about the relativelocation of the authenticated attributes and the
    encrypted content inthe ASN.1 structure. With the benefits of implementation experienceI
    revisit the discussion made at the time and re-evaluate thedecision made.</p>"
