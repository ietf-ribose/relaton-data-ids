abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Detecting and isolating network faults in IP networks has\n
    \  traditionally been done using tools like ping and traceroute (see\n   [RFC7276])
    or more complex systems built on similar concepts of\n   active probing and path
    tracing.  While using active synthetic probes\n   is proven to be helpful in detecting
    data-plane faults, isolating\n   fault location has proven to be a much harder
    problem, especially in\n   diverse networks with multiple active forwarding planes
    (e.g.  IP and\n   MPLS).  Moreover, existing end-to-end tools do not generally
    support\n   functionality beyond dealing with packet loss - for example, they
    are\n   hardly useful for detecting and reporting transient (i.e. milli- or\n
    \  even micro-second) network congestion.\n\n   Modern network forwarding hardware
    can enable more sophisticated\n   data-plane functionality that provides substantial
    improvement to the\n   isolation and identification capabilities of network elements.
    \ For\n   example, it has become possible to encode a snapshot of a network\n
    \  elements forwarding state within the packet payload as it transits\n   the
    device.  One example of such device/network state would be queue\n   depth on
    the egress port taken by that specific packet.  When\n   combined with a unique
    device identifier embedded in the same packet,\n   this could allow for precise
    time and topological identification of\n   the the congested location within the
    network.\n\n   This document proposes a standard format for embedding telemetry\n
    \  information in UDP-based probing packets, i.e. packets designated for\n   testing
    the network while not carrying application traffic.  These\n   active probes could
    be conveyed over multiple protocols (ICMP, UDP,\n   TCP, etc.) but this document
    specifically focuses on UDP, given its\n   simple semantics.  In addition this
    document provides recommendations\n   on handling the active probes by devices
    that do not support the\n   required data-plane functionality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
