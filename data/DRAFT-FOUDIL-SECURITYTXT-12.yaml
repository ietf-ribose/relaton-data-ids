abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When security vulnerabilities are discovered by researchers,
    proper\n   reporting channels are often lacking.  As a result, vulnerabilities\n
    \  may be left unreported.  This document defines a machine-parsable\n   format
    (\"security.txt\") to help organizations describe their\n   vulnerability disclosure
    practices to make it easier for researchers\n   to report vulnerabilities.\n\n\t
