abstract:
- content: "<p>The organizational separation between operators of TLS and DTLS endpoints
    and the certification authority can create limitations. For example, the lifetime
    of certificates, how they may be used, and the algorithms they support are ultimately
    determined by the certification authority. This document describes a mechanism
    to to overcome some of these limitations by enabling operators to delegate their
    own credentials for use in TLS and DTLS without breaking compatibility with peers
    that do not support this specification.</p>"
