abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document compiles the requirements for a lightweight\n
    \  authenticated key exchange protocol for OSCORE.  This draft has\n   completed
    a working group last call (WGLC) in the LAKE working group.\n   Post-WGLC, the
    requirements are considered sufficiently stable for\n   the working group to proceed
    with its work.  It is not currently\n   planned to publish this draft as an RFC.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
