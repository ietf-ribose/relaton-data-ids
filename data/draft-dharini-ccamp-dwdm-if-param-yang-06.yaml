abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a Yang model related to the Optical Transceiver parameters
    characterising coherent 100G and above interfaces. 100G and above Transceivers
    support coherent modulation, multiple modulation formats, multiple FEC codes including
    some not yet specified (or by in phase of specification by) ITU-T G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2]
    or any other ITU-T recommendation. More context about the state of the Coherent
    transceivers is described in draft-many- coherent-DWDM-if-control. Use cases are
    described in RFC7698 The Yang model defined in this memo can be used for Optical
    Parameters monitoring and/or configuration of the endpoints of a multi-vendor
    IaDI optical link. The use of this model does not guarantee interworking of transceivers
    over a DWDM. Optical path feasibility and interoperability has to be determined
    by means outside the scope of this document. The purpose of this model is to program
    interface parameters to consistently configure the mode of operation of transceivers.</p>"
