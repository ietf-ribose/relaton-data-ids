abstract:
- content: "<p>(This document is a description of the decentralized viechle to viechle
    probe mechanism currently being prototyped. The main purpose of disclosing this
    -00 document is to introduce the application idea and start discussion within
    the DTNRG. Because of this, the current mechanism described in this docment does
    not conform to the protocols defined in the DTNRG at this moment. The mechanism
    should be updated based on the discussion in this group.) This document describes
    the application message format used for the decentralized probe system for vehicles.
    The probe system exchanges the application messages between vehicles using the
    transport protocol defined in the separate specification.</p>"
