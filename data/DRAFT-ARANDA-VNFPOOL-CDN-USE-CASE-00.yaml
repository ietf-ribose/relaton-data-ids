abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This use case document provides requirements for moving Content\n
    \  Distribution Networks (CDNs) from physical servers to a virtualized\n   environment.
    This new kind of CDN, known as virtualized CDN (vCDN),\n   allows for new constructs
    that simplify the CDN architecture. The\n   main elements of the CDN are analyzed
    with regards to the degree of\n   elasticity demanded from them in terms of computation,
    storage and\n   network resources.\n\n   This use case document provides resiliency
    requirements for\n   virtualization of the Content Distribution Network, known
    as\n   virtualized CDN (vCDN).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
