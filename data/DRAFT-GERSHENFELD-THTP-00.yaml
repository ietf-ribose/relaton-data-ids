abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   THTP, the Trivial Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is an implementation\n
    \  of HTTP over UDP transport.  THTP is designed for environments with\n   limited
    computational power or bandwidth and single-packet exchanges.\n   As such, THTP
    is best suited for the emerging class of applications\n   running on embedded
    devices and sensor networks.  THTP decouples HTTP\n   from TCP and provides a
    subset of HTTP's functionality, in particular\n   leveraging HTTP's URI naming
    scheme.  This document describes the\n   THTP protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
