abstract:
- content: "<p>In data-center networks it is common to use Clos network topologies
    [clos] in order to provide a non-blocking switched network. In these topologies
    it is often not desirable to provide native IP multicast service. This document
    defines a multicast replication algorithm along with its control and data forwarding
    procedures that provides a multicast service for a BGP IP VPN network without
    assuming that the underlying infrastructure supports IP multicast.</p>"
