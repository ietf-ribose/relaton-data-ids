    with applicable TCP RFCs and fully interoperable with\nexisting TCP implementations.
    \ This protocol is being offered as\nan alternative to to the proposal offered
    in [MPA].\nThe protocol offers to two things, definition of the DDP record\nboundaries
    within the TCP stream, and added data integrity \nby means of added CRC protection.\n\t
