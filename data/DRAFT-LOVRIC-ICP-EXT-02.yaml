abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>ICP (see [RFC2186]) is a protocol allowing standardized communication\nmanagement
    between caches.\nThis document describes an extension to the ICP protocol whose
    aim is\nto reach the following three goals :\n- locating requested data more efficiently
    among a cache hierarchy,\n- reducing network traffic between caches by exchanging
    compressed\ndata over different protocols,\n- offering a suitable protocol for
    the forthcoming techniques of\npush and intelligent prefetching.\n\t </p>\n      "
