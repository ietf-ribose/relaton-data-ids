abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes some security risks of the Reliable Multicast
    Transport (RMT) Working Group set of building blocks and protocols. An emphasis
    is placed on risks that might be resolved in the scope of transport protocol design.
    However, relevant security issues related to IP Multicast control-plane and other
    concerns not strictly within the scope of reliable transport protocol design are
    also discussed. The document also begins an exploration of approaches that could
    be embraced to mitigate these risks. The purpose of this document is to provide
    a consolidated security discussion and provide a basis for further discussion
    and potential resolution of any significant security issues that may exist in
    the current set of RMT standards.</p>"
