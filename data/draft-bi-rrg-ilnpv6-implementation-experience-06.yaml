abstract:
- content: "<p>The Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) defines an evolutionary
    enhancement to IP to address multi-homing, mobility as well as other issues. This
    document provides experience of implementing ILNPv6 which is a specific engineering
    instance of ILNP based on IPv6. This document describes the problems arisen and
    our choices to solve the issues which may be helpful to others in implementing
    the protocol.</p>"
