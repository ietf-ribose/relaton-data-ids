abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Operational calamaties in the DNS happen from time to time,
    and in\n   many cases problems persist due to DNS caching of bad data.  Lacking\n
    \  any robust mechanism to signal that bad data has been flushed, the\n   operators
    of DNS authority servers often resort to unauthenticated\n   requests for help
    being sent to mailing lists, the results of which\n   are frequently unsatisfying
    to all concerned.\n\n   This document aims to present requirements for a more
    robust\n   mechanism by which authoritative server operators can signal to\n   recursive
    server operators that bad data has been published, and that\n   targetted cache
    flushes may be beneficial.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
