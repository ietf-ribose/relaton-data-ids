abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the problem statement and use cases
    of IP-\n   based vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation Systems\n
    \  (ITS).  The main scenarios of vehicular communications are vehicle-\n   to-vehicle
    (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-\n   everything (V2X) communications.
    \ First, this document surveys use\n   cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.
    \ Second, it analyzes\n   proposed protocols for IP-based vehicular networking
    and highlights\n   the limitations and difficulties found on those protocols.
    \ Third, it\n   presents a problem exploration for key aspects in IP-based vehicular\n
    \  networking, such as IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management, and\n   Security
    &amp; Privacy.  For each key aspect, this document discusses a\n   problem statement
    to evaluate the gap between the state-of-the-art\n   techniques and requirements
    in IP-based vehicular networking.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
