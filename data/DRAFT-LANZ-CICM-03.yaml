abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo presents a programming interface to standardize the
    way\n   software programs manage cryptographic modules and use cryptographic\n
    \  services offered by modules.  Although a number of interfaces for\n   commercial
    environments have been standardized and are in use, this\n   is the first generic
    cryptographic interface to be developed that\n   supports cryptographic modules
    separating two security domains and is\n   thus ideal for the high assurance environment.
    \ The interface has\n   been designed to also allow less demanding environments
    to take\n   advantage of its features.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
