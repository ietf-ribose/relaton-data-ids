abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
    \ TCP\n   is an important transport layer protocol in the Internet protocol\n
    \  stack, and has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of\n   the
    Internet.  Over this time, a number of changes have been made to\n   TCP as it
    was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been\n   documented in a piecemeal
    fashion.  This document collects and brings\n   those changes together with the
    protocol specification from RFC 793.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well
    as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093,\n   6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793.
    \ It updates RFC\n   1122, and should be considered as a replacement for the portions
    of\n   that document dealing with TCP requirements.  It also updates RFC\n   5961
    by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the\n   SYN-RECEIVED
    state.  The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have\n   also been updated based
    on RFC 3168.\n\n   RFC EDITOR NOTE: If approved for publication as an RFC, this
    should\n   be marked additionally as \"STD: 7\" and replace RFC 793 in that role.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
