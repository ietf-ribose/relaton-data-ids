abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Practice has shown that there are a number of zones all full
    service\n   resolvers should, unless configured otherwise, automatically serve.\n
    \  RFC4193 already specifies that this should occur for D.F.IP6.ARPA.\n   This
    document extends the practice to cover the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones\n   for RFC1918
    address space and other well known zones with similar\n   usage constraints.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
