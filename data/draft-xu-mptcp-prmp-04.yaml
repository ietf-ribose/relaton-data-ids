abstract:
- content: <p>This memo presents an extension to the Multipath Transmission Control
    Protocol (MPTCP) that allows MPTCP endpoints in which case both sender side and
    receiver side support this function to provide partially reliable data transmission
    service to the upper layer applications. In order to achieve the above goal, this
    memo extents MPTCP by adding two new subtypes which are expressed as "PR_CAPABLE"
    and "ACK_NOTIFY" and the corresponding processes are also introduced. The extension
    can provide the backward-compatibility with MPTCP if the new features are not
    available.</p>
