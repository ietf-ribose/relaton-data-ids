abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an Fast ReRoute (FRR) extension to the
    BIER-TE\n   Architecture [I-D.eckert-bier-te-arch].  The FRR procedure has to
    be\n   supported by the BIER-TE Controller host and the BFRs that are\n   attached
    to a link/adjacency for which FRR support is required.\n   Thus, the FRR concept
    can be incrementally deployed in the data plane\n   to only those BFR adjacent
    to adjacencies for which FRR protection is\n   desired.\n\n   The FRR procedure
    does not require changes to the packet format\n   described in [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]
    that is also used for BIER-\n   TE.  Existing BIER-TE tables do not have to be
    altered.  FRR\n   procedures do require additional forwarding plane logic on the
    BFR\n   that need to support FRR.\n\n   An additional table is needed that carries
    information about pre-\n   computed backup paths.  This table is used to modify
    upon detection\n   of failure the bitstring in the BIER header.  To prevent packet\n
    \  duplicates, tunneling mechanisms such as remote adjacencies or BIER-\n   in-BIER
    encapsulation can be leveraged.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
