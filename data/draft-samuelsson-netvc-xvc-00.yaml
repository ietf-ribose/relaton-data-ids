abstract:
  content: "<p>This document presents a high-level technical description of the xvc
    video codec. The xvc video codec is a novel video codec that was released in its
    first version in September 2017. This document provides some technical information
    as well as a discussion section around how the xvc codec meets the objectives
    of the NETVC Working Group. The document also includes results comparing a recent
    revision of xvc with recent revisions of AV1 and HM for three different test cases;
    All-Intra, single pass Random-Access, and multi-pass Random-Access. The average
    compression gain (BD-rate for PSNR-Y) for xvc ranges from 3% to 20% for the different
    test cases.</p>"
