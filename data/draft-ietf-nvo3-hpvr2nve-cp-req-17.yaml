abstract:
- content: <p>In the Split Network Virtualization Edge (Split-NVE) architecture, the
    functions of the NVE are split across a server and a piece of external network
    equipment that is called an "External NVE". The server-resident control-plane
    functionality resides in control software, which may be part of hypervisor or
    container-management software; for simplicity, this document refers to the hypervisor
    as the "location" of this software. One or more control-plane protocols between
    a hypervisor and its associated External NVE(s) are used by the hypervisor to
    distribute its virtual-machine networking state to the External NVE(s) for further
    handling. This document illustrates the functionality required by this type of
    control-plane signaling protocol and outlines the high-level requirements. Virtual-machine
    states as well as state transitioning are summarized to help clarify the protocol
    requirements.</p>
