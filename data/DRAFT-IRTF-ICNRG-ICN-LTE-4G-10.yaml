abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   4G mobile network uses IP-based transport for the control plane
    to\n   establish the data session at the user plane for the actual data\n   delivery.
    \ In the existing architecture, IP-based unicast is used for\n   the delivery
    of multimedia content to a mobile terminal, where each\n   user is receiving a
    separate stream from the server.  From a\n   bandwidth and routing perspective,
    this approach is inefficient.\n   Evolved multimedia broadcast and multicast service
    (eMBMS) provides\n   capabilities for delivering contents to multiple users\n
    \  simultaneously, but its deployment is very limited or at an\n   experimental
    stage due to numerous challenges.  The focus of this\n   draft is to list the
    options for use of Information centric\n   technology (ICN) in 4G mobile networks
    and elaborate the experimental\n   setups for its further evaluation.  The experimental
    setups discussed\n   provide for using ICN either natively or with existing mobility\n
    \  protocol stack.  With further investigations based on the listed\n   experiments,
    ICN with its inherent capabilities such as, network-\n   layer multicast, anchorless
    mobility, security, and optimized data\n   delivery using local caching at the
    edge may provide a viable\n   alternative to IP transport in 4G mobile networks.\n\n\t
