abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A new flexible grid of DWDM has been developed within the ITU-T\n
    \  Study Group 15 to allow a more efficient spectrum allocation. In\n   such environment
    a data plane connection is switched based on the\n   allocated variable width
    optical spectrum frequency slot. This new\n   switching capability is referred
    to as Spectrum Switched Optical\n   Networks (SSON). This draft describes the
    framework for the\n   application of a GMPLS control plane to a SSON.\n\n\n\t
