abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DTNRG research group has defined the experimental Licklider\n
    \  Transmission Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326] and the Compressed Bundle\n   Header
    Encoding (CBHE) [RFC6260] mechanism for the 'ipn' URI scheme.\n   Finally, RFC5050
    [RFC5050] defines values for the Bundle\n   Administrative Record Type.  All of
    these describe fields that are\n   subject to a registry.  For the purpose of
    its research work, the\n   group has created ad-hoc registries.  As the specifications
    are\n   stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group\n   would
    like to hand off the registries to IANA for official custody.\n   This document
    describes the actions needed to be executed by IANA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
