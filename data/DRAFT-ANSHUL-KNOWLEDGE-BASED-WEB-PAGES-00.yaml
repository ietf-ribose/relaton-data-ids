abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document tries to address a problem of delivering redundant\ncontent
    of a dynamic web page to the same client over the\nInternet. The dynamic web page
    made up of two kind of data first\none comes from external sources such as database
    or some text\nfiles etc which is dynamic in the nature and may change over\nthe
    next request made from the same client, the second one is\nstatic in the nature
    such as formatting tag of html[3] which\nremain unchanged until the program of
    dynamic web page does\nnot modified.\nInstead of sending the whole page at each
    subsequent request\nfrom the same client it is better to send the dynamic data
    and\nclient can use the static data from the cache of previous\nresponse to format
    the dynamic data of current response.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
