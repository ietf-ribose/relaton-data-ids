abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes an optional mechanism as part of IPv6\nStateless
    Address Autoconfiguration for distribution of unique\ninterface identifiers to
    IPv6 hosts on a link.  Hosts can then use\nthese unique interface identifiers
    to generate unique autoconfigured\nlink local and global unicast addresses.\n\nThis
    mechanism is intended for use in networks where link layer\nidentifiers are used
    for generating interface identifiers and where\nnon unique link layer identifiers
    will result in duplicate link local\naddresses.  An example of such network is
    Ethernet Broadband access\nnetworks.\n\t </p>\n      "
