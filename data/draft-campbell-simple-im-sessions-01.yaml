abstract:
  content: "<p>The SIP MESSAGE method is used to send instant messages, where eachmessage
    is independent of any other message. This is often calledpager-mode messaging,
    due to the fact that this model is similar tothat of most two-way pager devices.
    Another model is calledsession-mode. In session-mode, the instant messages are
    part of amedia session that provides ordering, a security context, and otherfunctions.
    This media session is established using a SIP INVITE, justas an audio or video
    session would be established.This document describes a The Message Session Relay
    Protocol (MSRP),a mechanism for transmitting session-mode messages with minimal
    relaysupport. Additionally, this document describes using the SDP offer/answer
    model to initiate such sessions.</p>"
