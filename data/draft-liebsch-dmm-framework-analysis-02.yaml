abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile operators consider the distribution of mobility anchors to enable
    offloading some traffic from their core network. The Distributed Mobility Management
    (DMM) Working Group is investigating the impact of decentralized mobility management
    to existing protocol solutions, while taking into account well defined requirements,
    which are to be met by a future solution. This document discusses DMM using a
    functional framework. Functional Entities to support DMM as well as reference
    points between these Functional Entities are introduced and described. The described
    functional framework allows distribution and co-location of Functional Entities
    and build a DMM architecture that matches the architecture of available protocols.
    Such methodology eases the analysis of best current practices with regard to functional
    and protocol gaps.</p>"
