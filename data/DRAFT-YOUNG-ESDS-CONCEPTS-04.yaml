abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p> This document is intended to seed discussion about the Extensible\n
    \  Supply-chain Discovery Service (ESDS), an application layer protocol\n   for
    the distributed sharing and discovery of notification events\n   between associated
    partners within a supply chain.  Specified\n   initially as a web service interface,
    the protocol defines event\n   tracking and tracing operations as well as core
    object management\n   operations.  This document obsoletes \"Extensible Supply-chain\n
    \  Discovery Service Concepts draft-young-esds-concepts-03\".\n\n   Comments are
    solicited and should be addressed to the mailing list at\n   esds@ietf.org and/or
    the author(s).\n\t </p>\n      "
