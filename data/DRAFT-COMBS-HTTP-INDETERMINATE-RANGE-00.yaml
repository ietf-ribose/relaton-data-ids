abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level\n
    \  protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information\n   systems.
    HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global\n   information initiative since
    1990. This document updates Part 5 of the\n   eight-part specification that defines
    the protocol referred to as\n   \"HTTP/1.1\". Part 5 defines range-specific requests
    and the rules for\n   constructing and combining responses to those requests.
    This document\n   improves support for responding to range requests for resources
    of\n   indeterminate size.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
