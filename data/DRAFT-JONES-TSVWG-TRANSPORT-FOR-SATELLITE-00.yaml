abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IETF transport protocols such as TCP, SCTP and QUIC are designed
    to\n   function correctly over any network path.  This includes networks\n   paths
    that utilise a satellite link or network.  While transport\n   protocols function,
    the characteristics of satellite networks can\n   impact performance when using
    the defaults in standard mechanisms,\n   due to the specific characteristics of
    these paths.\n\n   RFC 2488 and RFC 3135 describe mechanisms that enable TCP to
    more\n   effectively utilize the available capacity of a network path that\n   includes
    a satellite system.  Since publication, both application and\n   transport layers
    and satellite systems have evolved.  Indeed, the\n   development of encrypted
    protocols such as QUIC challenges currently\n   deployed solutions, for satellite
    systems the capacity has increased\n   and commercial systems are now available
    that use a range of\n   satellite orbital positions.\n\n   This document describes
    the current characterises of common satellite\n   paths and describes considerations
    when implementing and deploying\n   reliable transport protocols that are intended
    to work efficiently\n   over paths that include a satellite system.  It discusses
    available\n   network mitigations and offers advice to designers of protocols
    and\n   operators of satellite networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
