abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document lists logging capabilities originally defined in\n
    \  RFC3871 and needed to support the current practices, including those\n   described
    in the Operational Security Current Practices\n   document[CURPRAC] Logging is
    defined as the delivery to another\n   entity or system of messages about the
    device, the data passing\n   through the device, or the device's interaction with
    another device.\n\n   Capabilities are defined without reference to specific technologies.\n
    \  This is done to leave room for deployment of new technologies that\n   implement
    the capability.  Each capability cites the practices it\n   supports.  Current
    implementations that support the capability are\n   cited.  Special considerations
    are discussed as appropriate listing\n   operational and resource constraints,
    limitations of current\n   implementations, trade offs, etc.\n\t </p>\n      "
