abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft specifies two Key Derivation Functions \n(KDFs) that
    may be used to derive symmetric keying \nmaterial for participating parties from
    a secret value \nand application specific information. Each KDF is \nbased on
    a concatenation technique and a secure hash \nfunction. The length in bits of
    secret keying material \nthat can be generated by either of the KDFs is limited
    \nto (2**32 - 1) times the length in bits of the output \nblock of the hash function.
    The derived keying \nmaterial is a concatenation of the outputs of the \nhashing
    operations. Outputs from the KDFs are either \n\"Invalid\" or desired secret keying
    material. \n\nThe HKDFs specified in this document are intended for \nuse in scenarios
    where the communicating parties \nderive keying material for their own use.  This
    \nspecification is not intended for implementation of \nkey hierarchies. \n\t
    </p>\n      "
