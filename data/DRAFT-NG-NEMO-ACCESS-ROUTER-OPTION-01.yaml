abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Through the establishment of bi-directional tunnels between a
    mobile \nrouter and home agent, global connectivity can be extended to nodes \nwithin
    a network in motion.  However, the multiple levels of bi-\ndirectional tunnels
    in nested mobile networks lead to undesirable \neffects.  This memo proposes using
    a new mobility header option \ncalled the Access Router Option to allow a mobile
    router to inform \nits home agent the home-address of the access router it is
    currently \nattached to.  From there, this memo lays out a mechanism that allows
    \nmobile routers to securely achieve nested tunnels optimization.\n\t </p>\n      "
