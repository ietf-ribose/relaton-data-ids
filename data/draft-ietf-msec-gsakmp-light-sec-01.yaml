abstract:
  content: "<p>A protocol specification must balance two often conflicting goals:to
    produce as general a protocol as possible, and to produce asimple protocol. The
    Group Secure Association Key ManagementProtocol (GSAKMP) is a general protocol
    for creating and managingcryptographic groups on a network. This document describesthe
    GSAKMP-Light (GL) profile, a way to shorten the number ofmessages exchanged during
    secure group establishment. The GSAKMPprotocol assumed that group members joining
    a secure group hadno information about the specific security mechanisms used by
    thegroup (for example, the key length, encryption protocol, etc).GSAKMP-Light
    provides a profile for the case where group membershave been previously notified
    of these security mechanisms, usedfor joining a group, during the group announcement
    or invitation.This simplification removes 2 messages from the group establishmentportion
    of the GSAKMP protocol, eliminates the need for initiatinga unicast security association,
    and removes the need for manyof the optional fields of individual messages. The
    profiledoes not sacrifice any of the security properties of the fullprotocol.
    To facilitate the transmission of security mechanismsettings during session invitation
    or announcement, this documentalso describes a useful default set of security
    algorithms andconfigurations, Security Suite 1. Full specification of this suiteallows
    an entire set of algorithms and settings to be describedto prospective group members
    in a concise manner. Future securitysuites can be defined as needed.</p>"
