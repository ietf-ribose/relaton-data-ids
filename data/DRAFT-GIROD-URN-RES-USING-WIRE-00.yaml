abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The identifier resolution extensions proposed in WIRE [11] add
    new\nmechanisms for redirection and resolver delegation to HTTP. While these\nmechanisms
    are generalized to support resolution of all URIs, they were\ndesigned in part
    to meet the specific needs of URN resolution systems.\n \nThis document describes
    how the WIRE model maintains consistency with\nexisting models of URN resolution,
    how WIRE can be used as a URN resolution\nprotocol, and how WIRE fits into the
    existing URN resolution infrastructure,\nincluding NAPTR [8] and THTTP [9].\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
