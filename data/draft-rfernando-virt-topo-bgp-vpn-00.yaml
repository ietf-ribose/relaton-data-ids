abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents techniques that build on MPLS/VPN control plane
    mechanisms to construct virtual service topologies in data centers. These virtual
    service topologies interconnect network zones and help to constrain the flow of
    traffic that go between zones so that interesting services can be applied to them.
    The techniques suggested are required to create a rich overlay network that mimics
    topology and routing functions of physical networks. Steps to create a virtual
    service topology and the ability to constrain routing and traffic to flow in this
    topology are outlined in this document.</p>"
