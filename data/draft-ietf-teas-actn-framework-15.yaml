abstract:
- content: <p>Traffic Engineered (TE) networks have a variety of mechanisms to facilitate
    the separation of the data plane and control plane. They also have a range of
    management and provisioning protocols to configure and activate network resources.
    These mechanisms represent key technologies for enabling flexible and dynamic
    networking. The term "Traffic Engineered network" refers to a network that uses
    any connection-oriented technology under the control of a distributed or centralized
    control plane to support dynamic provisioning of end-to- end connectivity. Abstraction
    of network resources is a technique that can be applied to a single network domain
    or across multiple domains to create a single virtualized network that is under
    the control of a network operator or the customer of the operator that actually
    owns the network resources. This document provides a framework for Abstraction
    and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) to support virtual network services and connectivity
    services.</p>
