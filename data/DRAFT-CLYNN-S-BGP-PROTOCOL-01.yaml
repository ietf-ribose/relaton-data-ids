abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used to distribute\nrouting
    information between autonomous systems (ASes), is a critical\ncomponent of the
    Internet's routing infrastructure.  It is highly\nvulnerable to a variety of malicious
    attacks both in theory and in\npractice, due to the lack of a scalable means of
    verifying the\nauthenticity and legitimacy of BGP control traffic.  This document
    is\na protocol specification for Secure BGP (S-BGP), an extension to\nBGP-4.  S-BGP
    adheres to the principle of least privilege and uses\ncountermeasures that create
    an authentication and authorization\nsystem that addresses most of the security
    problems associated with\nBGP.  To facilitate adoption and deployment, S-BGP is
    designed to\nminimize the overhead (processing, bandwidth, storage) added by its\ncountermeasures
    and to be interoperable with the current BGP so as to\nbe incrementally deployable.\n\t
