abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document presents a Pre-IKE Credential (PIC) provisioning protocol.PIC
    is a method to bootstrap IPsec authentication via an 'AuthenticationServer' (AS)
    and user authentication mechanisms such as RADIUS. PIChappens before IKE (the
    Internet Key Exchange protocol). The clientmachine communicates with the AS using
    a key exchange protocol whereonly the server is authenticated, and the derived
    keys are used toprotect the user authentication. Once the user is authenticated,
    theclient machine obtains credentials from the AS that can be later used toauthenticate
    the client in a standard IKE exchange, with no userintervention. The proposed
    key exchange is based on ISAKMP (the InternetSecurity Association and Key Management
    Protocol), similar to asimplified IKE exchange. Arbitrary user authentication
    is supported viathe use of EAP (the PPP Extensible Authentication Protocol).</p>"
