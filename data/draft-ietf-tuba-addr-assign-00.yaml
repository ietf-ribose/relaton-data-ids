abstract:
- content: "<p>There are currently two mechanisms defined for dynamic assignment of
    OSI NSAP addresses. This memo specifies a single mechanism for hosts to use that
    maximizes flexibility while allowing administrative control, and requires no configuration
    on the host. The method described in the memo is intended to be implemented universally
    in all end systems supporting CLNP, both for TUBA and pure OSI systems. This document
    will be submitted to ISO for consideration as a standard. Additionally, the method
    described could also be used in CATNIP networks.</p>"
