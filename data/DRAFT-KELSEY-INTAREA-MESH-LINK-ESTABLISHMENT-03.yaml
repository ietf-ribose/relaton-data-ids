abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the mesh link establishment (MLE) protocol
    for\n   establishing and configuring secure links in an ad hoc mesh radio\n   network.
    \ Effective mesh networking using radio links requires\n   identifying, configuring,
    and securing usable links to neighboring\n   devices.  In an ad hoc mesh network
    a device's neighbors may come and\n   go as the network's membership and physical
    environment change.\n   Newly usable links need to be identified and configured\n
    \  automatically, where configuration values can include link-layer\n   addresses,
    transmit and receive modes, security parameters, and so\n   forth.  MLE includes
    the option of securing the configuration\n   messages themselves, as link-layer
    security is typically not\n   available prior to configuration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
