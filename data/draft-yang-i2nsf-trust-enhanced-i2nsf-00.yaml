abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the architecture of Trust Enhanced I2NSF. In
    this architecture, technologies like TPM [tpm12][tpm20] and [TCGRoT] will act
    as RoT (root of trust), integrity measurement and remote attestation will be used
    to enhance the trustworthiness of NSF. Relevant interfaces of Trust Enhanced I2NSF
    will also be illustrated in this document.</p>"
