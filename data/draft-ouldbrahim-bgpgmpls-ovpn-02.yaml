abstract:
- content: "<p>Consider a service provider network that offers Optical/TDM Virtual
    Private Network service. An important goal of such service is the ability to support
    what is known as 'single end provisioning', where addition of a new port to a
    given Optical/TDM VPN would involve configuration changes only on the devices
    connected to that port. Another important goal in the Optical/TDM VPN service
    is the ability to establish/terminate an optical connection between a pair of
    (existing) ports within an Optical/TDM VPN without involving configuration changes
    in any of the provider devices.</p>"
