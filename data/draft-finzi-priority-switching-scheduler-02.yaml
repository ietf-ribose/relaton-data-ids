abstract:
- content: "<p>We detail the implementation of a network scheduler that aims at isolating
    time constrained and elastic traffic flows from best-effort traffic. This scheduler
    inherits from the priority scheduler (PS) but dynamically changes the priority
    of one or several queues. Usual implementations of rate scheduler schemes (such
    as WRR, DRR, ...) do not allow to efficiently guarantee the capacity dedicated
    to both AF and BE classes as they mostly provide soft bounds. This means excessive
    margin is used to ensure the capacity requested and this impacts the number of
    additional users that could be accepted in the network. To cope with this issue,
    this memo presents a credit based scheduler mechanism called Priority Switching
    Scheduler (PSS) that allows a more predictable output rate per traffic class.</p>"
