abstract:
- content: <p>This memo defines the term "opportunistic security". In contrast to
    the established approach of delivering strong protection some of the time, opportunistic
    security strives to deliver at least some protection most of the time. The primary
    goal is therefore broad interoperability, with security policy tailored to the
    capabilities of peer systems.</p>
