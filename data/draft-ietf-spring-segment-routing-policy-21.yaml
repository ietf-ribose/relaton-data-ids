abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) allows a node to steer a packet flow along any
    path. Intermediate per-path states are eliminated thanks to source routing. SR
    Policy is an ordered list of segments (i.e., instructions) that represent a source-routed
    policy. Packet flows are steered into a SR Policy on a node where it is instantiated
    called a headend node. The packets steered into an SR Policy carry an ordered
    list of segments associated with that SR Policy. This document updates RFC8402
    as it details the concepts of SR Policy and steering into an SR Policy.</p>"
