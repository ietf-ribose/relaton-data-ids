abstract:
- content: "<p>Designation of services and devices of a home network is not user friendly,
    and mechanisms should enable a user to designate services and devices inside a
    home network using names. In order to enable internal communications while the
    home network experiments Internet connectivity shortage, the naming service should
    be hosted on a device inside the home network. On the other hand, home networks
    devices have not been designed to handle heavy loads. As a result, hosting the
    naming service on such home network device, visible on the Internet exposes this
    device to resource exhaustion and other attacks, which could make the home network
    unreachable, and most probably would also affect the internal communications of
    the home network. As result, home networks may prefer not serving the naming service
    for the Internet, but instead prefer outsourcing it to a third party. This document
    describes a mechanisms that enables the Home Network Authority (HNA) to outsource
    the naming service to the Outsourcing Infrastructure.</p>"
