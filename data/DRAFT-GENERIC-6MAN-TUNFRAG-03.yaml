abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the\n
    \  network.  Instead, links with restricting MTUs must either drop each\n   too-large
    packet and return an ICMP Packet Too Big message or perform\n   link-specific
    fragmentation (also known as \"link adaptation\") at a\n   layer below IPv6.  This
    latter category of links is often\n   performance-challenged to accommodate steady-state
    link-specific\n   fragmentation and reassembly to the point that it would be highly\n
    \  desirable to push the workload back to the IPv6 communication\n   endpoints.
    \ A common case that exhibits these link characteristics is\n   seen for IPv6-within-IP
    tunnels.  Additionally, IPv6 nodes could\n   better adapt to path MTUs of various
    sizes by using either a small\n   amount of host-based fragmentation and/or path
    probing as\n   necessary.This document therefore proposes an update to the base
    IPv6\n   specification to better accommodate path MTU issues.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
