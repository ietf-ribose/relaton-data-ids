abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In many environments the final step of certificate issuance is
    \npublishing the certificate to a repository. Unfortunately, there \nis no way
    for a Certification Authority (CA) to have a secure \napplication-level acknowledgement
    that the proper repository \ndid, in fact, receive the certificate. This issue
    is of greater \nconcern when considering the publication of Certificate \nRevocation
    Lists (CRLs) -- if an adversary manages to interpose \nitself between the CA and
    its intended repository, then clients \ncould end up relying on outdated revocation
    lists.\nThis document defines a set of controls so that an LDAP client, \nsuch
    as a CA, can receive a cryptographically secure \nacknowledgement that an LDAP
    server has received a request, and \nthat the integrity of the server's reply
    has not been \ncompromised.\n  \n    Whenever possible, the definitions here use
    mechanisms and \n    datatypes defined by the IETF PKIX working group. This document
    \n    references RFC 2459 [RFC2459]. Knowledge of the RFC is required \n    for
    proper implementation of this document, although it should \n    be possible to
    understand this document without much knowledge \n    of that RFC.\n    \n    It
    is expected that future versions of this document will \n    reference 2459's
    successor(s).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
