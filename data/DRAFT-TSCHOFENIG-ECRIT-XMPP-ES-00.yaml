abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a
    technology\n   that enjoys widespread deployment in the instant messaging\n   application
    domain.  While many features for XMPP had been\n   standardized in the IETF as
    well as in the XMPP Standards Foundation\n   emergency services functionality
    was not part of it.\n\n   This document aims to initiate a discussion about the
    necessary\n   emergency services functionality for XMPP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
