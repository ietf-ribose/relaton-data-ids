abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The number and type of Internet connected devices continues
    to grow\n   rapidly.  Sensors are a new category of devices that are becoming\n
    \  Internet connected.  While sensors have existed for a long time, it\n   is
    only now that we see sensors being capable of communicating via an\n   IP stack.
    \ Sensors are used in a multitude of industries and\n   applications.  By enabling
    these devices to be Internet connected,\n   they open up new vistas in terms of
    applications and uses.  Most\n   sensors are generally small with minimal power
    and processing\n   capabilities.  The ability to configure these devices is a
    challenge.\n   However, in order to make the usage and deployment of Internet\n
    \  connected sensors easier, it is essential that there exist a well\n   defined
    configuration, control, and service discovery mechanism.\n   This document illustrates
    various use cases of sensors in different\n   types of deployments and a solution
    for configuring and controlling\n   them in addition to the ability for sensors
    and devices to discover\n   services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
