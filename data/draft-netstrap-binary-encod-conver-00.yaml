abstract:
- content: "<p>A patent-pending method of encoding binary data for transfer between
    computers connected via a network, in which the encoded data optimally has an
    expansion ratio of about 1.22 (22%). Generally, the method relates to transfering
    binary data over the network using 94 ASCII printable characters by fast encoding.
    Specifically, the method includes breaking the data into a plurality of chunks,
    and substantially performing some MOD and INT operations on these chunks according
    to predefined combinatorial conditions. NOTE: This RFC includes Background, Summary,
    and Detailed Description Sections - for those wanting to understand the method;
    and a Working Prototype (section 2.0) - for those wanting to quickly implement
    and measure the qualities of improvement described; specifically as 'C-LANGUAGE
    IMPLEMENTATION DEMO' (section 5.0).</p>"
