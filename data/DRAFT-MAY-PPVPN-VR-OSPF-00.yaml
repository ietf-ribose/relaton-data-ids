abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides a generalized Virtual Router (VR)\narchitecture
    and specifies the required extensions for [OSPFv2]\nto adapt the protocol to this
    architecture, such that separate\n'instances' of OSPF can be used for different
    Service Provider (SP)\ncustomers connected to different PE to CE links of a single
    PE box.\nThis architecture accommodates the deployment of layer 3 IP VPNs to \nfacilitate
    \ services such as Intranet connectivity, and allows the \nconsolidation of multiple
    Service Provider (SP) customers onto a \nsingle Provider Edge (PE) device, while
    enforcing all necessary \nsecurity between different customer data.  \n\n\t </p>\n
