abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A number of Internet applications rely on the Domain Name System\n
    \  (DNS) to support their operations.  Many applications use the DNS to\n   locate
    services for a domain, for example; more recently, some\n   applications have
    begun transforming identifiers other than domain\n   names into formats that the
    DNS can process.  Proposals to\n   incorporate more sophisticated application
    behavior into the DNS,\n   however, have raised questions about the applicability
    and\n   extensibility of the DNS.  This document explores the architectural\n
    \  consequences of installing certain application features in the DNS,\n   and
    provides guidance to future application designers as to the sorts\n   of ways
    that application can make use of the DNS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
