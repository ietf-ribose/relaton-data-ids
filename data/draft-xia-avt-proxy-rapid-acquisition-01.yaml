abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a proxy rapid acquisition mechanism whichreduces
    acquisition delay for an RTP receiver without supporting anyrapid acquisition
    related functionality. The network is responsiblefor managing rapid acquisition
    on behalf of the RTP receiver,including detecting SFGMP message as proxy specified
    in [RFC4605]from the RTP receiver and launching the required rapid acquisitionsignaling
    instead of the RTP receiver. This proxy rapid acquisitionof multicast RTP session
    in this document is referred to as ProxyRapid Acquisition of Multicast Sessions.</p>"
