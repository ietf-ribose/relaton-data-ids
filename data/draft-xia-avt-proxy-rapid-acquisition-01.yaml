abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proxy rapid acquisition mechanism which reduces
    acquisition delay for an RTP receiver without supporting any rapid acquisition
    related functionality. The network is responsible for managing rapid acquisition
    on behalf of the RTP receiver, including detecting SFGMP message as proxy specified
    in [RFC4605] from the RTP receiver and launching the required rapid acquisition
    signaling instead of the RTP receiver. This proxy rapid acquisition of multicast
    RTP session in this document is referred to as Proxy Rapid Acquisition of Multicast
    Sessions.</p>"
