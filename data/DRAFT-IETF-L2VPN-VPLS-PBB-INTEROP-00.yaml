abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The scalability of H-VPLS with Ethernet access network can be
    \nimproved by incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge functionality in \nVPLS access.
    Provider Backbone Bridging has been standardized as \nIEEE 802.1ah-2008, and aims
    to improve the scalability of MAC \naddresses and service instances in Provider
    Ethernet networks. This \ndocument describes different interoperability scenarios
    where \nProvider Backbone Bridge functionality is used in H-VPLS with \nEthernet
    or MPLS access network to attain better scalability in \nterms of number of customer
    MAC addresses and number of service \ninstances. The document also describes the
    scenarios and the \nmechanisms for incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge functionality
    \nwithin H-VPLS with existing Ethernet access and interoperability \namong them.
    Furthermore, the document discusses the migration \nmechanisms and scenarios by
    which Provider Backbone Bridge \nfunctionality can be incorporated into H-VPLS
    with existing MPLS \naccess. \n \n \n  Conventions used in this document \n \nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n\t </p>\n      "
