abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       This document describes the requirements and challenges
    to employ\n       artificial intelligence (AI) into the constraint Internet of
    Things\n       (IoT) service environment for embedding intelligence and increasing\n
    \      efficiency.\n\n       The IoT service environment includes heterogeneous
    and multiple IoT\n       devices and systems that work together in a cooperative
    and\n       intelligent way to manage homes, buildings, and complex autonomous\n
    \      systems. Therefore, it is becoming very essential to integrate IoT\n       and
    AI technologies to increase the synergy between them. However,\n       there are
    several limitations to achieve AI enabled IoT as the\n       availability of IoT
    devices is not always high, and IoT networks\n       cannot guarantee a certain
    level of performance in real-time\n       applications due to resource constraints.\n\n
    \      This document intends to present a right direction to empower AI in\n       IoT
    for learning and analyzing the usage behaviors of IoT\n       devices/systems
    and human behaviors based on previous records and\n       experiences. With AI
    enabled IoT, the IoT service environment can be\n       intelligently managed
    in order to compensate for the unexpected\n       performance degradation often
    caused by abnormal situations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
