abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a set of recommendations and guidelines for
    how networking software should be designed to enable the development, testing,
    and deployment of new protocols and protocol features. The focus is primarily
    on the API contract that a client-side networking library should present to applications
    using networking features, and how that library can be architected to maximize
    flexibility and longevity. Specific areas of protocol development that should
    be enabled include: o Making security and privacy easy to use o Reducing latency
    with 0-RTT protocols o Allowing wider use of multi-stream protocols o Providing
    a simple interface for multi-path protocols</p>"
