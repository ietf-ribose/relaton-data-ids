abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes
    and\n   networks.  Through the Observe option, clients can observe changes in\n
    \  the state of resources and obtain a current representation of the\n   last
    resource state.  This document defines a new mechanism in CoAP\n   Observe so
    that a CoAP client can conditionally observe a resource on\n   a CoAP server,
    only being informed about state changes meeting a\n   specific condition or set
    of conditions.  This offers possibilities\n   to extend network intelligence,
    enhance scalability, and optimize the\n   lifetime and performance in order to
    address the requirements from\n   the Constrained Nodes and Networks.\n\n\t </p>\n
