abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The increase in complexity of modern networks makes it challenging
    to\n   deploy new services and to keep networks up to date whilst\n   maintaining
    stability and availability for critical business\n   services. This is a major
    challenge that network operators (service\n   providers, SME, etc) face today.
    The operators aim of streamlining\n   both operations and the deployment of new
    services, is being met by\n   increasingly relying on (1) software abstractions
    to simplify the\n   design and configuration of monitoring and control operations
    and (2)\n   the use of programmatic control over the configuration and operation\n
    \  of such networks.\n   In this context, providing network operators with a generic
    policy-\n   based management model that can be used to express policies on top\n
    \  of arbitrary configuration data models is essential.\n\n   In particular, SUPA
    addresses the needs of operators and application\n   developers to use a generic
    policy-based management model for\n   defining and representing multiple types
    of policy rules.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
