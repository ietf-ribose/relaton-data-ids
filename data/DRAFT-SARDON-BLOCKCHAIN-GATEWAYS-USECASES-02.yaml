abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the past five years there has been a growing interest in
    using\n   blockchains and DLT systems as a means to create a new mechanism to\n
    \  issue, distribute and manage virtual assets.  However, as DLT systems\n   consisting
    of peer-to-peer (P2P) network of nodes increase in number,\n   there is an increasing
    need to interconnect these networks to permit\n   virtual assets to flow into
    and out of them.  This document captures\n   a number of use-cases driving the
    need for interoperability between\n   DLT systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
