abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document shares problem statements of the routing of optical
    \n   Label Switched Paths(LSPs) over network elements with blocking switch\n   architecture
    in fiber port selectivity. Also, this document provides a\n   direction of solution
    to take into account the switching constraint\n   within the scope of GMPLS Traffic
    Engineering (TE) over network elements\n   with blocking switch architecture in
    fiber port selectivity in addition \n   to wavelength selectivity. \n\n\t </p>\n
