abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many Internet protocols have as an essential element a mapping
    from a\ntextual name to some resource.  There is a technique, popular in some\ncircles,
    of providing a default resource, which is returned in\nresponse to a lookup that
    does not match any known name, rather than\nreturning an indication that there
    is no resource of that name.  This\ntechnique is dangerous and is to be discouraged
    in all contexts.\nThis memo discusses the issues.\n\t </p>\n      "
