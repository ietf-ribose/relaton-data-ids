abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Billing information protocol is a simple protocol that can be
    used \nby servers to indicate the charging information incurred due to a \nspecific
    operation with a client. In many situations a client, like \na SIP user agent
    may need to know the charging information about a \nspecific interaction with
    the server.  This document defines the \nBIP (Billing Information Protocol) that
    can be used as a standard \nway to share this charging information.  BIP supports
    simple \nindication of charging information.  The protocol defines a generic \nrepresentation
    on the number of units charged, the charge incurred \nper unit etc.  This will
    be useful for implementing services like \nadvice of charge.  The protocol is
    targeted for VoIP usages, \nhowever any generic client-server interaction can
    use this \nprotocol. \n\t </p>\n      "
