abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the past decade, Voice over IP (VoIP) systems based on SIP have
    replaced many traditional telephony deployments. Interworking VoIP systems with
    the traditional telephone network has reduced the overall security of calling
    party number and Caller ID assurances by granting attackers new and inexpensive
    tools to impersonate or obscure calling party numbers when orchestrating bulk
    commercial calling schemes, hacking voicemail boxes or even circumventing multi-
    factor authentication systems trusted by banks. Despite previous attempts to provide
    a secure assurance of the origin of SIP communications, we still lack of effective
    standards for identifying the calling party in a VoIP session. This document examines
    the reasons why providing identity for telephone numbers on the Internet has proven
    so difficult, and shows how changes in the last decade may provide us with new
    strategies for attaching a secure identity to SIP sessions.</p>"
