abstract:
  content: <p>This document describes a JSON-based format for simple DNS queries and
    responses. In this case, "simple" means "only useful for getting A and AAAA records".
    This document also defines the application/ simpledns+json media type. The primary
    use case of this format is programs that do not want to take on the programmatic
    overhead needed to use messages in the application/dns-udpwireformat media type.
