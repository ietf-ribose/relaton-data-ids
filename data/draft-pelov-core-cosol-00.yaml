abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a new type of far-reaching, low-rate radio technologies
    and an extensible mechanism to operate these networks based on CoAP. The emerging
    Wide Area Networks based on them - Low- Rate WAN (LR-WAN) preset a particular
    set of constraints, which places them at the intersection of infrastructure networks,
    ultra- dense networks, delay-tolerant networks and low-power and lossy networks.
    The main objectives of LR-WAN signaling is to minimize the number of exchanged
    messages, minimize the size of each message in a secure and extensible manner.
    This document describes the use of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    as the main signaling protocol for LR-WANs, over which minimal messages are exchanged
    allowing the full operation of the network, such as authentication, authorization,
    and management. The use of CoAP signaling provides a generic mechanism that can
    be applied to different LR-WAN technologies.</p>"
