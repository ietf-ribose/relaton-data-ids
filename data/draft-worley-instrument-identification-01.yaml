abstract:
  content: "\t <t>When requesting and reporting dialog status in SIP, users often
    wantto know the status of a particular telephone instrument, rather thanthe status
    of an Address of Record (AOR). The architecture of SIPmakes it difficult to obtain
    the status of a telephone instrument ina way that is convenient for use in common
    situations, in particular,in an organization's PBX.This document describes two
    methods for identifying which telephoneinstrument is making each registration
    request that is convenient todeploy in PBXs. This information can be used to obtain
    the status ofindividual telephone instruments.</p>"
