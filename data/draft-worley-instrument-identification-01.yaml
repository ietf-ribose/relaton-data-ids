abstract:
- content: "<p>When requesting and reporting dialog status in SIP, users often want
    to know the status of a particular telephone instrument, rather than the status
    of an Address of Record (AOR). The architecture of SIP makes it difficult to obtain
    the status of a telephone instrument in a way that is convenient for use in common
    situations, in particular, in an organization's PBX. This document describes two
    methods for identifying which telephone instrument is making each registration
    request that is convenient to deploy in PBXs. This information can be used to
    obtain the status of individual telephone instruments.</p>"
