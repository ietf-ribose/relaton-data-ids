abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification describes the format of a manifest.  A manifest
    is\n   a bundle of metadata about code/data obtained by a recipient (chiefly\n
    \  the firmware for an IoT device), where to find the that code/data,\n   the
    devices to which it applies, and cryptographic information\n   protecting the
    manifest.  Software updates and Trusted Invocation\n   both tend to use sequences
    of common operations, so the manifest\n   encodes those sequences of operations,
    rather than declaring the\n   metadata.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
