abstract:
- content: "<p>The document defines a mechanism that allows communication of DNS resolver
    information to DNS clients for use in selection decisions. In particular, the
    document defines a mechanism for a DNS server to communicate its filtering policy
    and privacy statement URL to DNS clients. This information is cryptographically
    signed to attest its authenticity. Such information is used for the selection
    of DNS resolvers. Typically, evaluating the DNS privacy statement, filtering policy,
    and the signatory, DNS clients with minimum human intervention can select the
    DNS server that best supports the user's desired privacy and filtering policy.
    This assertion is useful for DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers that are
    either public resolvers or are discovered in a local network.</p>"
