abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (RFC 5213) requires that all mobile access gateways
    use a fixed link-local address and a fixed link-layer address on any of their
    access links that they share with mobile nodes.  This requirement was intended
    to ensure that a mobile node does not detect any change with respect to its Layer
    3 attachment, even after it roams from one mobile access gateway to another.  In
    the absence of any reserved addresses for this use, coordination across vendors
    and manual configuration of these addresses on all of the mobility elements in
    a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain are required.  This document attempts to simplify this
    operational requirement by making a reservation for special addresses that can
    be used for this purpose.  This document also updates RFC 5213. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t
