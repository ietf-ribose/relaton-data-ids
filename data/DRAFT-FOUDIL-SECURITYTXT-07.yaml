abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When security vulnerabilities are discovered by independent
    security\n   researchers, they often lack the channels to report them properly.\n
    \  As a result, security vulnerabilities may be left unreported.  This\n   document
    defines a format (\"security.txt\") to help organizations\n   describe the process
    for security researchers to follow in order to\n   report security vulnerabilities.\n\n\t
