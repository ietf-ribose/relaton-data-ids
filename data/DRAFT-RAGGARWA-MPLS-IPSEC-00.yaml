abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In various applications of MPLS, label stacks with multiple entries\nare
    used. In some cases, it is possible to replace the top label of\nthe stack with
    an IP-based encapsulation, thereby enabling the\napplication to run over networks
    which do not have MPLS enabled in\ntheir core routers. MPLS-in-IP and MPLS-in-GRE
    encapsulations have\nalready been specified by the MPLS WG. In some cases, in
    addition to\nIP and GRE tunnels, it may be desirable to use IPsec for transporting\nMPLS
    packets securely over non-MPLS networks, using standard IPsec\nauthentication
    and/or encryption functions. This draft describes\nprocedures for encapsulating
    MPLS packets in IPsec.\n\t </p>\n      "
