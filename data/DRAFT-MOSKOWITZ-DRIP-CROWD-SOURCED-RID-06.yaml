abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes using the ASTM Broadcast Remote ID
    (B-RID)\n   specification in a \"crowd sourced\" smart phone environment to provide\n
    \  much of the ASTM and FAA envisioned Network Remote ID (N-RID)\n   functionality.
    \ This crowd sourced B-RID data will use\n   multilateration to add a level of
    reliability in the location data on\n   the Unmanned Aircraft (UA).  The crowd
    sourced environment will also\n   provide a monitoring coverage map to authorized
    observers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
