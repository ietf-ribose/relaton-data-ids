abstract:
- content: "<p>In customer sites having IPv4-only CPEs, Teredo provides a last resort
    IPv6 connectivity [RFC4380] [RFC5991] [RFC6081]. However, because it is designed
    to work without involvement of Internet service providers, it has significant
    limitations (connectivity between IPv6 native addresses and Teredo addresses is
    uncertain; connectivity between Teredo addresses fails for some combinations of
    NAT types). 6a44 is a complementary solution that, being base on ISP cooperation,
    avoids these limitations. 6a44 uses specific prefixes assigned by local ISPs (rather
    than the anycast address used by Teredo, an evolution similar to that from 6to4
    to 6rd). The specification is complete enough for actual deployment, including
    with independently written codes.</p>"
