abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC3552 provides guidance to authors in crafting RFC text on\n
    \  Security Considerations. The RFC is more than fifteen years old.\n   With the
    threat landscape and security ecosystem significantly\n   changed since the RFC
    was published, RFC3552 is a candidate for\n   update. This draft proposes that,
    prior to drafting an update to\n   RFC3553, an examination of recent, published
    Security Considerations\n   sections be carried out as a baseline for how to improve
    RFC3553. It\n   suggests a methodology for examining Security Considerations\n
    \  sections in published RFCs and the extraction of both quantitative\n   and
    qualitative information that could inform a revision of the\n   older guidance.
    It also reports on a recent experiment on textual\n   analysis of sixteen years
    of RFC Security Consideration sections.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
