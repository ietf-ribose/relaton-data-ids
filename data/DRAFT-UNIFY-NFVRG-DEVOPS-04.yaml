abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Carrier-grade network management was optimized for environments
    built\n   with monolithic physical nodes and involves significant deployment,\n
    \  integration and maintenance efforts from network service providers.\n   The
    introduction of virtualization technologies, from the physical\n   layer all the
    way up to the application layer, however, invalidates\n   several well-established
    assumptions in this domain. This draft opens\n   the discussion in NFVRG about
    challenges related to transforming the\n   telecom network infrastructure into
    an agile, model-driven production\n   environment for communication services.
    We take inspiration from data\n   center DevOps regarding how to simplify and
    automate management\n   processes for a telecom service provider software-defined\n
    \  infrastructure (SDI). Among the identified challenges, we consider\n   scalability
    of observability processes and automated inference of\n   monitoring requirements
    from logical forwarding graphs, as well as\n   initial placement (and re-placement)
    of monitoring functionality\n   following changes in flow paths enforced by the
    controllers. In\n   another category of challenges, verifying correctness of behavior
    for\n   network functions where flow rules are no longer necessary and\n   sufficient
    for determining the forwarding state (for example,\n   stateful firewalls or load
    balancers) is very difficult with current\n   technology. Finally, we introduce
    challenges associated with\n   operationalizing DevOps principles at scale in
    software-defined\n   telecom networks in three areas related to key monitoring,\n
    \  verification and troubleshooting processes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
