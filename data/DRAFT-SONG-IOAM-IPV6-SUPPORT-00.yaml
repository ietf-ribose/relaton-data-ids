abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It has been proposed to encapsulate IOAM tracing option data
    fields\n   in IPv6 HbH options header.  However, due to size of the trace data\n
    \  and its location in the IPv6 header packets, this arrangement creates\n   practical
    challenges for implementation, especially when other\n   extension headers, such
    as routing header, also exist and require in-\n   network processing.  We propose
    several alternative approaches to\n   address this challenge, including separating
    the IOAM trace data to a\n   different extension header, using the postcard-based
    telemetry (e.g.,\n   IOAM DEX) instead, and applying the segment IOAM trace export
    scheme,\n   based on the network scenario and application requirements.  We\n
    \  discuss the pros and cons of each approach and foster standard\n   convergence
    and industry adoption.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
