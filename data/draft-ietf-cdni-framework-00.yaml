abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a framework for Content Distribution Network
    Interconnection (CDNI). The purpose of the framework is to provide an overall
    picture of the problem space of CDNI and to describe the relationships among the
    various components necessary to interconnect CDNs. CDN Interconnection requires
    the specification of several interfaces and mechanisms to address issues such
    as request routing, metadata exchange, and the acquisition of content by one CDN
    from another. The intent of this document is to outline what each interface needs
    to accomplish, and to describe how these interfaces and mechanisms fit together,
    while leaving their detailed specification to other documents.</p>"
