abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents Topology Independent Loop-free Alternate
    Fast\n   Re-route (TI-LFA), aimed at providing protection of node and\n   adjacency
    segments within the Segment Routing (SR) framework.  This\n   Fast Re-route (FRR)
    behavior builds on proven IP-FRR concepts being\n   LFAs, remote LFAs (RLFA),
    and remote LFAs with directed forwarding\n   (DLFA).  It extends these concepts
    to provide guaranteed coverage in\n   any IGP network.  A key aspect of TI-LFA
    is the FRR path selection\n   approach establishing protection over the expected
    post-convergence\n   paths from the point of local repair, dramatically reducing
    the\n   operational need to control the tie-breaks among various FRR options.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
