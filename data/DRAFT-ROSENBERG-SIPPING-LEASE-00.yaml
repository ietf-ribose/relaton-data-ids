abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    require\na user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI which can be used\nby
    anyone on the Internet to route a call to that specific UA\ninstance.  An example
    of such an application is call transfer, based\non the REFER method.  To date,
    a variety of techniques have been\nproposed for the contruction of such URI.  All
    of them have fatal\ndrawbacks.  This document proposes that the problem is actually
    one\nof URI leasing - a feature whereby a UA can dynamically request the\ncreation
    of an address-of-record (AOR) within a domain.  Requirements\nfor a URI leasing
    mechanism are outlined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
