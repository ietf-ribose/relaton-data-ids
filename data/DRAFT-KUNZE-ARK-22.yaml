abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ARK (Archival Resource Key) naming scheme is designed to\n
    \  facilitate the high-quality and persistent identification of\n   information
    objects.  A founding principle of the ARK is that\n   persistence is purely a
    matter of service and is neither inherent in\n   an object nor conferred on it
    by a particular naming syntax.  The\n   best that an identifier can do is to lead
    users to the services that\n   support robust reference.  The term ARK itself
    refers both to the\n   scheme and to any single identifier that conforms to it.
    \ An ARK has\n   five components:\n\n   [http://NMAH/]ark:[/]NAAN/Name[Qualifier]\n\n
    \  an optional and mutable Name Mapping Authority Hostport (usually a\n   hostname),
    the \"ark:\" label, the Name Assigning Authority Number\n   (NAAN), the assigned
    Name, and an optional and possibly mutable\n   Qualifier supported by the NMA.
    \ The NAAN and Name together form the\n   immutable persistent identifier for
    the object independent of the URL\n   hostname.  An ARK is a special kind of URL
    that connects users to\n   three things: the named object, its metadata, and the
    provider's\n   promise about its persistence.  When entered into the location
    field\n   of a Web browser, the ARK leads the user to the named object.  That\n
    \  same ARK, inflected by appending a single question mark (`?'),\n   returns
    a brief metadata record that is both human- and machine-\n   readable.  When the
    ARK is inflected by appending dual question marks\n   (`??'), the returned metadata
    contains a commitment statement from\n   the current provider.  Tools exist for
    minting, binding, and\n   resolving ARKs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
