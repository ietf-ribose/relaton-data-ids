abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes Post Sockets, an asynchronous abstract\n
    \  programming interface for the atomic transmission of messages in an\n   inherently
    multipath environment.  Post replaces connections with\n   long-lived associations
    between endpoints, with the possibility to\n   cache cryptographic state in order
    to reduce amortized connection\n   latency.  We present this abstract interface
    as an illustration of\n   what is possible with present developments in transport
    protocols\n   when freed from the strictures of the current sockets API.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
