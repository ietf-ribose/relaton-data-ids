abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0) option
    that is in active use to carry information about the network that originated a
    DNS query and the network for which the subsequent response can be cached. It
    is inspired by EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) with some privacy considerations, goals
    to reduce the "guess geolocation of client's IP" work on Authoritative Nameservers.</p>
