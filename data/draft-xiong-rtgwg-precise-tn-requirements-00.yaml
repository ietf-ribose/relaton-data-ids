abstract:
- content: "<p>The future networks not only need to offer the Service Level Agreements
    (SLA) guarantees such as low lantency and jitter, low packet loss and high reliability,
    but also need to support the precise services such as flexible resource allocation
    and service isolation. This document proposes a set of performance requirements
    and precise properties for Precise Transport Networking in various industries
    such as 5G networks.</p>"
