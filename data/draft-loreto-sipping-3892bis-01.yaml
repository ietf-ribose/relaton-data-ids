abstract:
  content: "<p>SIP has a mechanism for conveying the identity of the referrer of arequest
    by means of the Referred-By header field. This header fieldmay be used when exploding
    a SIP MESSAGE request to a pre-definedgroup URI and when exploding a SIP INVITE
    request to an ad-hoc groupor to a pre-defined group URI. The Referred-By header
    is onlyincluded if the P-Asserted-Identity header field or From header fieldin
    the exploded SIP requests needs to carry another value, e.g. theURI of a pre-defined
    group, or a conference focus URI. In thosecases, the Referred-By header field
    in the resulting explodedrequests is set to the P-Asserted-Identity header field
    or to theFrom header field of the original SIP request received beforeexploding
    to convey to the receiver the identity of the originalinviting sender.RFC 3892
    restricts the value of the header to only one SIP URI.However the P-Asserted-Identity
    header field currently allows two URIvalues and may be expanded in the future
    to carry more than twovalues as described in draft-ietf-sipping-update-pai-09.
    Thisdocument extends the Referred-By definition to support more than onevalue
    as well.</p>"
