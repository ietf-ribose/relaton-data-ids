abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for traceability in the Interface
    to the Routing System (I2RS) and information model for that framework. It specifies
    the motivation, requirements, use cases, and defines an information model for
    recording interactions between elements implementing the I2RS protocol. This framework
    provides a consistent tracing interface for components implementing the I2RS architecture
    to record what was done, by which component, and when. It aims to improve the
    management of I2RS implementations, and can be used for troubleshooting, auditing,
    forensics, and accounting purposes.</p>"
