abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends Directory-Based Information Services
    (DBIS)\n   described in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support netgroup\n
    \  and netservice databases.\n\n   A netgroup database schema SHALL be backwards
    compatible with the\n   Network Information Service [NIS] but stored within [X.500]
    entries\n   so that they may be resolved with the Lightweight Directory Access\n
    \  Protocol [RFC4510].  A netgroup database represents groups of hosts,\n   users
    and domains.\n\n   A netservice database schema is a new extension to netgroups
    that\n   allows administrators to describe services or configuration options\n
    \  for a user or system based upon their netgroup membership.\n\n   This document
    describes configuration maps [draft-bannister-dbis-\n   mapping-00] for netgroup
    and netservice databases, and database\n   entries referenced by those maps.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
