abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is proposed as an update of RFC4601 and describes\n
    \  procedures allowing exchanges of PIM Hellos to complete earlier when\n   a
    new link comes up, to mitigate the multicast traffic blackholing\n   issues that
    result from inconsistencies between links advertised by\n   unicast routing and
    the links on which PIM adjacencies are fully set\n   up.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
