abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the pervasiveness of passive monitoring and ubiquity of\n
    \  unencrypted Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP), it is desirable to\n   mitigate
    passive monitoring without causing an undue burden on HTTP\n   user agents and
    servers.  This document describes the rationale and\n   process for using Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) in an\n   unauthenticated manner for exchanging HTTP messages.
    \ The application\n   of unauthenticated TLS - particularly when Perfect Forward
    Secrecy\n   (PFS) algorithms are used - change monitoring from being a passive\n
    \  attack into an active attack.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
