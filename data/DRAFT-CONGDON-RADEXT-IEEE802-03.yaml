abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>      In certain network scenarios it is desirable to either filter
    user \n      traffic or redirect it to a specific location. This document \n      describes
    several methods that are available to be used with \n      Remote Authentication
    Dial In User Service (RADIUS) Protocol and \n      proposes additional attributes
    to be used by AAA clients, whether \n      in an IEEE 802.1X or Internet Service
    Provider environment. \n\t </p>\n      "
