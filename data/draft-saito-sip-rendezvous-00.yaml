    and authentication/authorization. This document describes what technologies can
    be usedto solve these issues and analyzes the utility of SIP as a rendezvousmechanism
    for this use case.Conventions used in this documentThe key words "MUST", "MUST
    NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
