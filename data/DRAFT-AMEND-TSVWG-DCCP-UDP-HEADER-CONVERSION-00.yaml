abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Datagram Congestion Control protocol (DCCP) is a non-widely\n
    \  deployed transport protocol in the Internet.  The reason for that is\n   a
    typical chicken-egg problem.  Even if there would be a use for\n   application
    developer to rely on DCCP, middle-boxes like firewalls\n   and NATs will prevent
    DCCP end-to-end since they lack support for\n   DCCP.  However, as long as the
    protocol penetration of DCCP will not\n   increase, middle-boxes will not handle
    DCCP properly.  To overcome\n   this challenge NAT/NATP traversal and UDP encapsulation
    for DCCP is\n   already defined.  However the first requires special middle-box\n
    \  support and the latter introduces overhead.  The proposal of a\n   multipath
    extension for DCCP further stresses the question of\n   efficient middle-box passing
    as its main goal is to be applied over\n   the Internet, traversing numerous uncontrolled
    middle-boxes.  This\n   document introduces a new approach, disguising DCCP during\n
    \  transmission as UDP without requiring middle-box modification nor\n   introducing
    any overhead.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
