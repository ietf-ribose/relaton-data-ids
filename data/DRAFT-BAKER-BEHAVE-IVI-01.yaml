abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This note proposes an address and service architecture designed
    to\nfacilitate transition from an IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 Internet.\nThis service
    contains three parts: A DNS Application Layer Gateway, a\nstateful Network Address
    Translator that enables IPv6 clients to\ninitiate connections to IPv4 servers
    and peers, and a stateless\nNetwork Address Translator that enables IPv4 and IPv6
    systems to\ninteroperate freely.\n\nIt is couched as an update to RFCs 2765 and
    2766.  This is because\nthe stateless service is essentially the SIIT with a different\naddress
    format, and because the DNS Application Layer Gateway and the\nstateful translator
    have significant similarities to NAT-PT.  There\nare, however, important differences
    from NAT-PT, responsive to the\nissues raised in RFC 4966.\n\t </p>\n      "
