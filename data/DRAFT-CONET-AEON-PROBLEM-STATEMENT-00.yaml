abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Identification and treatment of application flows are important
    to\n   many application providers and network operators.  They often rely on\n
    \  these capabilities to deploy and/or support a wide range of\n   applications.
    \ These applications, and the packet flows they generate\n   and consume, may
    have specific connectivity requirements that can be\n   met if made known to the
    network.  Historically, this functionality\n   has been implemented to the extent
    possible using heuristics, which\n   inspect and infer flow characteristics.  Heuristics
    may be based on\n   port ranges, network separation (e.g. subnets or VLANs, Deep
    Flow\n   Inspection (DFI), or Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).  But many\n   application
    flows in current usages are dynamic, adaptive, time-\n   bound, encrypted, peer-to-peer,
    asymmetric, used on multipurpose\n   devices, and have different priorities depending
    on direction of\n   flow, user preferences, and other factors.  Any combination
    of these\n   properties renders heuristic based techniques less effective and
    may\n   result in compromises to application security or user privacy.\n\n\t </p>\n
