    has attracted more and more attention in the development of network. However,
    the current network measurement technology has the problem that the measurement
    method and the measurement purpose cannot match well. To solve this problem, this

    or network operator to allocate network states as needed. And it can be as a specified
    user case of intent based network.</p>"
