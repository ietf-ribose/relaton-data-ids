abstract:
- content: "<p>Application-aware IPv6 Networking (APN6) framework makes use of IPv6
    encapsulation in order to convey the application-aware information along with
    the data packet to the network so to facilitate the service deployment and SLA
    guarantee. This document defines the encodings of the application characteristic
    information, for the APN6 framework, that can be exchanged between an application
    or a network edge device such as CPE (Customer-Premises Equipment) and the network
    infrastructure through the use of IPv6 extension headers.</p>"
