abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the usage of Datagram Transport Layer\n
    \  Security (DTLS) as a transport protocol for Session Traversal\n   Utilities
    for NAT (STUN).  It provides guidances on when and how to\n   use DTLS with the
    currently standardized STUN Usages.  It also\n   specifies modifications to the
    STUN URIs and TURN URIs and to the\n   TURN resolution mechanism to facilitate
    the resolution of STUN URIs\n   and TURN URIs into the IP address and port of
    STUN and TURN servers\n   supporting DTLS as a transport protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n
