abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this draft context, things are powered by micro controllers
    units\n   (MCU) comprising a set of memories such as static RAM (SRAM), FLASH\n
    \  and EEPROM. The total memory size, ranges from 10KB to a few\n   megabytes.
    In this context code and data integrity are major\n   security issues, for the
    deployment of Internet of Things\n   infrastructure. The goal of the bijective
    MAC (bMAC) is to compute\n   an integrity value, which cannot be guessed by malicious
    software.\n   In classical keyed MACs, MAC is computing according to a fixed\n
    \  order.\n   In the bijective MAC, the content of N addresses is hashed according\n
    \  to a permutation P (i.e. bijective application).\n   The bijective MAC key
    is the permutation P.\n   The number of permutations for N addresses is N!. So
    the computation\n   of the bMAC requires the knowledge of the whole space memory;
    this\n   is trivial for genuine software, but could very difficult for\n   corrupted
    software, especially for time stamped bMAC.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
