abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  The Widely Hosted Object Data Protocol (WhoDP) exists to\n  communicate
    the current location and state of large numbers of\n  dynamic, relocatable objects.
    Initially and most commonly, these\n  objects are people, and the groupings or
    spaces that people use\n  to enable communication.\n \n  Loosely patterned after
    HTTP, WhoDP implements a publish-and-\n  subscribe model, with objects' location
    and identity specified\n  via URLs. A WhoDP program ''subscribes'' to locate and
    receive\n  information about an object; a WhoDP program ''publishes'' to\n  control
    the location and visible state of an object.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
