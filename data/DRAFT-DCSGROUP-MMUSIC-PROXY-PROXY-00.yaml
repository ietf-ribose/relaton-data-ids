abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In order to deploy a residential telephone service at very large\nscale
    across different domains, it is necessary for trusted elements\nowned by different
    service providers to exchange trusted information\nthat conveys customer-specific
    information and expectations about\nthe parties involved in the call. This document
    describes extensions\nto the Session Initiation Protocol (RFC2543) for supporting
    the\nexchange of customer information and billing information between\ntrusted
    entities in the architecture described in &lt;draft-dcsgroup-\nmmusic-arch-00.txt&gt;.\n\t
