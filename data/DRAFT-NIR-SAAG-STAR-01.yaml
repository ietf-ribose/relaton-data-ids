abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recently there has been renewed interest in an old idea: Issue\n
    \  certificates with short validity periods and forego revocation\n   processing,
    reasoning that expiration is a sufficient replacement for\n   revocation as long
    as that expiration is not too far off.\n\n   This document covers considerations,
    both security and operational,\n   for using such Short Term Auto Renewed (STAR)
    certificates for\n   various scenarios where Using a revocation protocol is considered\n
    \  inappropriate.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
