abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This documents aims to document the relation between Internet\n
    \  protocols and the right to freedom of assembly and association.  The\n   Internet
    increasingly mediates our lives and thus the ability to\n   excercise human rights.
    \ Since Internet protocols play a central role\n   in the management, development
    and use of the Internet the relation\n   between the two should be documented
    and adverse impacts on this\n   human right should be mitigated.  On the other
    hand there have also\n   been methods of protest, a form of freedom of assembly,
    on the\n   Internet that have been harmful to Internet connectivity and the\n
    \  Internet infrastructure, such as DDoS attacks.  This document aims to\n   document
    forms of protest, association and assembly that do not have\n   a negative impact
    on the Internet infrastructure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
