abstract:
- content: "<p>Route discovery for symmetric and asymmetric Point-to-Point (P2P) traffic
    flows is a desirable feature in Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). For that
    purpose, this document specifies a reactive P2P route discovery mechanism for
    hop-by-hop routing (storing mode) based on Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing
    (AODV) based RPL protocol. Two separate Instances are used to construct directional
    paths in case some of the links between source and target node are asymmetric.</p>"
