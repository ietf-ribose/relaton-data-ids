abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Services such as content distribution, distributed databases,
    or\n   inter-data center connectivity place a set of new requirements on the\n
    \  operation of networks.  They need on-demand and application-specific\n   reservation
    of network connectivity, reliability, and resources (such\n   as bandwidth) in
    a variety of network applications (such as point-to-\n   point connectivity, network
    virtualization, or mobile back-haul) and\n   in a range of network technologies
    from packet (IP/MPLS) down to\n   optical.  Additionally, existing services or
    capabilities like\n   pseudowire connectivity or global concurrent optimization
    can benefit\n   from a operational scheme that considers the application needs
    and\n   the network status.  An environment that operates to meet these types\n
    \  of requirement is said to have Application-Based Network Operations\n   (ABNO).\n\n
    \  ABNO brings together many existing technologies for gathering\n   information
    about the resources available in a network, for\n   consideration of topologies
    and how those topologies map to\n   underlying network resources, for requesting
    path computation, and\n   for provisioning or reserving network resources.  Thus,
    ABNO may be\n   seen as the use of a toolbox of existing components enhanced with
    a\n   few new elements.  The key component within an ABNO is the Path\n   Computation
    Element (PCE), which can be used for computing paths and\n   is further extended
    to provide policy enforcement capabilities for\n   ABNO.\n\n   This document describes
    an architecture and framework for ABNO\n   showing how these components fit together.
    \ It provides a cookbook of\n   existing technologies to satisfy the architecture
    and meet the needs\n   of the applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
