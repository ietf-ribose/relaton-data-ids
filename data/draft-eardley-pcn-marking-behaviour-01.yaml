  content: "\t <t>This document standardises the two marking behaviours of PCN-nodes:threshold
    marking and excess traffic marking. Threshold markingmarks all PCN-packets if
    the PCN traffic rate is greater than a firstconfigured rate. Excess traffic marking
    marks a proportion of PCN-packets, such that the amount marked equals the traffic
    rate inexcess of a second configured rate.Requirements LanguageThe key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",
