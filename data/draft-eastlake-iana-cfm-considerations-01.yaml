abstract:
- content: "<p>IEEE 802.1 has specified Continuity Fault Management (CFM) OAM facilities.
    CFM messages are structured with an Op-Code field and have provision for the inclusion
    of TLV (type, length, value) structured information. IEEE 802.1 has allocated
    blocks of CFM Op- Codes and TLV Types to the IETF. This document specifies the
    IANA Considerations for the assignment of values from these blocks. INTERNET-DRAFT
