abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines methods for presentation of a text\n
    \  conversation with focus on the real-time features.  The aim is to\n   give
    the participants in a conversation a good opportunity to\n   perceive the real-time
    flow of the conversation and also provide a\n   display of the history of the
    conversation that makes it easy to\n   read.  Both two-party and multi-party situations
    are defined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
