abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a framework to integrate a Network
    Address\n   Translation layer into an operator's network to function as a Carrier\n
    \  Grade NAT (also known as CGN or Large Scale NAT).  The CGN\n   infrastructure
    will often form a NAT444 environment as the subscriber\n   home network will likely
    also maintain a subscriber side NAT\n   function.  Exhaustion of the IPv4 address
    pool is a major driver\n   compelling some operators to implement CGN.  Although
    operators may\n   wish to deploy IPv6 to strategically overcome IPv4 exhaustion,
    near\n   term needs may not be satisfied with an IPv6 deployment alone.  This\n
    \  document provides a practical integration model which allows the CGN\n   platform
    to be integrated into the network, meeting the connectivity\n   needs of the subscriber
    while being mindful of not disrupting\n   existing services and meeting the technical
    challenges that CGN\n   brings.  The model included in this document utilizes
    BGP/MPLS IP\n   VPNs which allow for virtual routing separation helping ease the
    CGNs\n   impact on the network.  This document does not intend to defend the\n
    \  merits of CGN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
