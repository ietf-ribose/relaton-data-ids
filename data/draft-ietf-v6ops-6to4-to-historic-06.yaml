abstract:
- content: <p>Experience with the "Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds (6to4)"
    IPv6 transition mechanism has shown that the mechanism is unsuitable for widespread
    deployment and use in the Internet. This document requests that RFC3056 and the
    companion document "An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers" RFC3068 are made
    obsolete and moved to historic status. It also recommends that future products
    should not support 6to4 and that existing deployments should be reviewed.</p>
