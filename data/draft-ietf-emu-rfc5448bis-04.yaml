abstract:
- content: "<p>The 3rd Generation Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) is the primary
    authentication mechanism for devices wishing to access mobile networks. RFC 4187
    (EAP-AKA) made the use of this mechanism possible within the Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP) framework. RFC 5448 (EAP-AKA') was an improved version of EAP-AKA.
    This memo is an update of the specification for EAP-AKA'. This version obsoletes
    RFC 5448. EAP-AKA' differs from EAP-AKA by providing a key derivation function
    that binds the keys derived within the method to the name of the access network.
    The key derivation function has been defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership
    Project (3GPP). EAP-AKA' allows its use in EAP in an interoperable manner. EAP-AKA'
    is also an algorithm update, as it employs SHA-256 instead of SHA-1 as in EAP-AKA.
    This version of EAP-AKA' specification specifies the protocol behaviour for 5G
    deployments as well.</p>"
