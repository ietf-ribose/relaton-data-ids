abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents real-world data regarding the extent to which
    packets with IPv6 extension headers are filtered in the Internet (as measured
    in August 2014), and where in the network such filtering occurs. The aforementioned
    results serve as a problem statement that is expected to trigger operational advice
    on the filtering of IPv6 packets carrying IPv6 Extension Headers, so that the
    situation improves over time. This document also explains how the aforementioned
    results were obtained, such that the corresponding measurements can be reproduced
    by other members of the community.</p>"
