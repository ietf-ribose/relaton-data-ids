abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The OVAL community has spent more than ten years developing
    and\n   employing the OVAL Language.  During this time, the community has\n   made
    a number of design decisions and learned a number of lessons\n   that should be
    leveraged as next generation endpoint posture\n   assessment is formulated.  There
    are a number of places throughout\n   the SACM Information Model document that
    could be fulfilled by\n   portions of the OVAL Language, either in its current
    state or, in\n   some cases, with modifications.  Another output of the work executed\n
    \  under the OVAL project is a number of lessons that are applicable to\n   the
    SACM work.  These lessons include a clear separation of data\n   collection and
    evaluation; a call to focus on ensuring both primary\n   source vendors and third
    party security experts feel invited to the\n   discussion and are empowered to
    leverage their unique domain\n   knowledge; and to strive for simplicity and flexibility,
    where\n   possible.  Finally, the OVAL community has a set of clear\n   recommendations
    with respect to which parts of OVAL should be used by\n   SACM as a means to make
    best use of the efforts of those that have\n   worked on and supported OVAL over
    the past ten years.  Those\n   recommendations are:\n\n   o  Use the OVAL System
    Characteristics Model as a base data model for\n      at least one way to provide
    data collection.\n\n   o  Use the OVAL Definitions Model in parts as a base data
    model for\n      both evaluation and collection guidance.\n\n   o  Do not use
    the OVAL Results Model for a data model to encode\n      evaluation results.\n\n\t
