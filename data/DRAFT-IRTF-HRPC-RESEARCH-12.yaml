abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document aims to propose guidelines for human rights\n
    \  considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for\n   privacy
    considerations [RFC6973].  If you want to apply this work to\n   your own, you
    can directly go to Section 6.  The rest of the document\n   explains the background
    of the guidelines and how they were\n   developed.\n\n   This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\n   published for informational
    purposes.\n\n   This informational document has consensus for publication from
    the\n   Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) Human Right Protocol\n   Considerations
    Research Group.  It is the first milestone in a longer\n   term research effort
    and has been reviewed both by the research group\n   and by individuals from outside
    the research group.  Many of the\n   topics discussed are still under discussion
    in the research group and\n   will be subjects of continuing research.\n\n\t </p>\n
