abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The United States Government has published the NSA Commercial\n
    \  National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite, which defines cryptographic\n   algorithm
    policy for national security applications.  This document\n   specifies a profile
    of the Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)\n   protocol for managing X.509 public
    key certificates in applications\n   using the CNSA Suite.  It is a refinement
    of RFCs 5272, 5273, and\n   5274.  The profile applies to the capabilities, configuration,
    and\n   operation of all components of US National Security Systems that\n   manage
    X.509 public key certificates over CMS.  US National Security\n   Systems are
    described in NIST Special Publication SP-800-59.  It is\n   also appropriate for
    all other US Government systems that process\n   high-value information.  It is
    made publicly available for use by\n   developers and operators of these and any
    other system deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
