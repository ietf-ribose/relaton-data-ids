abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is a specification of the basic protocol for
    Internet\n   electronic mail transport.  It consolidates, updates, and clarifies\n
    \  several previous documents, making all or parts of most of them\n   obsolete.
    \ It covers the SMTP extension mechanisms and best practices\n   for the contemporary
    Internet, but does not provide details about\n   particular extensions.  Although
    SMTP was designed as a mail\n   transport and delivery protocol, this specification
    also contains\n   information that is important to its use as a \"mail submission\"\n
    \  protocol for \"split-UA\" (User Agent) mail reading systems and mobile\n   environments.
    \ This document replaces the earlier version with the\n   same title in RFC 5321.\n
    \  [[CREF1: Note in Draft: Except for the last sentence, the above is\n   unchanged
    from 5321 and may need adjusting in the light of RFC 6409\n   as an Internet Standard.]]\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
