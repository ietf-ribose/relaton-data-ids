abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the problem statement for IPv6-based vehicle-
    to-infrastructure networking. Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) is standardized
    as IEEE 802.11p for the wireless media access in vehicular networks. This document
    addresses the extension of IPv6 as the network layer protocol in vehicular networks
    and is focused on the networking issues in one-hop communication between a Road-Side
    Unit (RSU) and vehicle. The RSU is connected to the Internet and allows vehicles
    to have the Internet access if connected. The major issues of including IPv6 in
    vehicular networks are neighbor discovery protocol, stateless address autoconfiguration,
    and DNS configuration for the Internet connectivity over DSRC. Also, when a vehicle
    and an RSU have an internal network, respectively, the document discusses the
    issues of the internetworking between the vehicle's internal network and the RSU's
    internal network, such as prefix discovery, prefix exchange, and service discovery.</p>"
