abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Sometimes, it is attractive to add features to protocols or\n
    \  applications by specifying a particular structure for URIs (or parts\n   thereof).
    \ However, publishing standards that mandate URI structure\n   is inappropriate
    because the structure of a URI needs to be firmly\n   under the control of its
    owner, and the IETF (as well as other\n   organisations) should not usurp this
    ownership.\n\n   This document is intended to prevent this practice (sometimes
    called\n   \"URI Squatting\") in standards, but updating RFC3986 to indicate where\n
    \  it is acceptable.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
