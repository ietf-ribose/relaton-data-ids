abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Assured Service refers to the set of capabilities used to ensure
    \nthat mission critical communications are setup and remain connected. \n[Pierce1]
    describes the requirements, one of which is to provide \npreferential treatment
    to higher priority calls. IEPS refers to a \nset of capabilities used to provide
    a higher probability of call \ncompletion to emergency calls made by authorized
    personnel, usually \nfrom ordinary telephones. This also requires some form of
    \npreferential treatment. This memo describes some of the methods \nwhich may
    be applied to provide that preferential treatment.\n\t </p>\n      "
