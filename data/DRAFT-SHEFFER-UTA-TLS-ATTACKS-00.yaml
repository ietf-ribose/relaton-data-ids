abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Over the last few years there have been several serious attacks
    on\n   TLS, including attacks on its most commonly used ciphers and modes of\n
    \  operation.  This document summarizes these attacks, with the goal of\n   motivating
    generic and protocol-specific recommendations on the usage\n   of TLS and DTLS.\n\n\t
