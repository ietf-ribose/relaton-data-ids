abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the global and other specialized IPv4
    address\n   blocks that have been assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers\n
    \  Authority (IANA).  It does not address IPv4 address space assigned to\n   operators
    and users through the Regional Internet Registries, nor\n   does it address IPv4
    address space assigned directly by IANA prior to\n   the creation of the Regional
    Internet Registries.  It also does not\n   address allocations or assignments
    of IPv6 addresses or autonomous\n   system numbers.  This document obsoletes RFC
    5735 and updates RFC\n   6441.\n\n   The substantive change between this document
    and RFC 5735 is that it\n   includes 100.64.0.0/10, which was assigned in RFC
    6598.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
