abstract:
  content: "<p>This specification defines extensions to Mobile IPv4 protocol forallowing
    a mobile node with multiple interfaces to register a care-ofaddress for each of
    its network interfaces and to simultaneouslyestablish multiple Mobile IP tunnels
    with its home agent. Thisessentially allows the mobile node to utilize all the
    availablenetwork interfaces and build an higher aggregated data pipe with thehome
    agent for its home address traffic. Furthermore, theseextensions also allow the
    mobile node and the home agent to negotiateflow policies for binding individual
    traffic flows with theregistered care-of addresses.</p>"
