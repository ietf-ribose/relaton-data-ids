abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Off-The-Record Messaging protocol (OTR) exchanges public
    keys in-\n   band.  This document describes how to use DANE to securely associate\n
    \  an Instant Message user identified by their email address with an OTR\n   public
    key.  This association helps to authenticate users and protect\n   against MITM
    attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
