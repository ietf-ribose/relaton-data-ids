abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document tries to propose an architectural framework of
    the\n   internet in the real IP world. It shows how to reorganize the\n   provider
    network with a large address space. It describes how a\n   three-tier mesh structured
    hierarchy can be established based on\n   fragmenting the entire space into some
    regions and some sub regions\n   inside each of them. It addresses issues which
    could be relevant to\n   this architecture in the context of IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n
