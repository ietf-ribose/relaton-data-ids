abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a process experiment under RFC 3933 that temporarily
    updates the criteria for qualifying volunteers to participate in the IETF Nominating
    Committee. It therefore also updates the criteria for qualifying signatories to
    a community recall petition. The purpose is to make the criteria more flexible
    in view of increasing remote participation in the IETF and a probable decline
    in face-to-face meetings. This document temporarily varies the rules in RFC 8713.</p>"
