abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Layer 2 interfaces fundamentally operate as either broadcast or
    \npoint-to-point.  From these primitives, additional layer 3 interface \nconstructs
    such as non-broadcast multiple access and point-to-\nmultipoint are created as
    necessary.  This approach has served the \nwired Internet well.  However this
    memo argues that a third type of \nlayer 2 interface is necessary to seamlessly
    extend IP over dynamic \nnetworks, principally wireless.  This interface, here
    termed a \n'triggered' interface, combines traditional broadcast interface \naddressing
    semantics (i.e. support for unicast, multicast and \nbroadcast link layer addresses)
    with layer 2 trigger support for the \ndynamic creation of peer-to-peer interface
    associations within an \notherwise broadcast interface.  Its intended domain of
    applicability \ncovers cellular, WLAN, MANET, etc; in short all currently envisioned
    \nforms of dynamic wireless networking.\n\t </p>\n      "
