abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new password authenticated key exchange
    based\n   pre-authentication mechanism for performing Kerberos authentication.\n
    \  This mechanism has three goals.  First, it makes Kerberos pre-\n   authentication
    more resilient against time synchronization errors by\n   removing the need to
    transfer an encrypted timestamp.  Second, it\n   increases the security of the
    Kerberos pre-authentication exchange by\n   making offline brute-force attacks
    impossible.  Third, it enables the\n   use of secure second factor authentication
    without FAST by utilizing\n   the existing trust relationship established by the
    shared first\n   factor.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
