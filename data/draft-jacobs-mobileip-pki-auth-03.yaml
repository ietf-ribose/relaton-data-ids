abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to the Mobile IP base protocol(RFC
    2002) to allow Mobile Nodes (Hosts) and Mobility Agents (bothhome network and
    foreign network) to use X.509 digital certificates,public keys and digital signatures
    as the basis of authenticatingMobile IP control messages in addition to secret
    key authentication.The use of these mechanisms will allow Mobile IP to scale from
    smallresearch environments to potentially millions of mobile nodes acrossthousands
    of networks owned-operated by different organizations andservice providers. A
    Public Key Infrastructure is proposed thatfocuses specifically on authentication
    of Mobile IP knowledgeablenodes, NOT general use for authenticating individuals.</p>"
