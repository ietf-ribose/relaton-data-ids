abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There have been known issues with multicast, in an 802.11\n
    \  environment, which have prevented the deployment of multicast in\n   these
    wifi environments.  IETF multicast experts have been meeting\n   together to discuss
    these issues and provide IEEE updates.  The\n   mboned working group is chartered
    to receive regular reports on the\n   current state of the deployment of multicast
    technology, create\n   \"practice and experience\" documents that capture the
    experience of\n   those who have deployed and are deploying various multicast\n
    \  technologies, and provide feedback to other relevant working groups.\n   As
    such, this document will gather the problems of wifi multicast\n   into one problem
    statement document so as to offer the community\n   guidance on current limitations.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
