abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traditional ECMP can not balance loads well in the data center\n
    \  network because it splits loads at the granularity of flow.  Packets\n   belong
    to a single flow have to be delivered along the same path.\n   Though it is able
    to avoid packet reordering, it may degrade the\n   bandwidth utilization.\n\n
    \  This document describes method of splitting a single flow to across\n   multiple
    parallel paths without causing packet reordering, which is\n   more effective
    when large flows exist.  The specific path selection\n   algorithm is NOT discussed
    in this document.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
