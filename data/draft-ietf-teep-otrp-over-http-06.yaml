abstract:
- content: "<p>The Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning (TEEP) Protocol is used
    to manage code and configuration data in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
    This document specifies the HTTP transport for TEEP communication where a Trusted
    Application Manager (TAM) service is used to manage TEEs in devices that can initiate
    communication to the TAM. An implementation of this document can (if desired)
    run outside of any TEE, but interacts with a TEEP implementation that runs inside
    a TEE.</p>"
