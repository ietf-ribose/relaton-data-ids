abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In IPv6, the current IPv4 site multihoming practises have beenoperationally
    disabled, to prevent a creation of an unmanageableswamp of more specific routes.
    Some argue that the lack of acomprehensive site multihoming solution is hindering
    the deploymentof IPv6. This memo presents a few proposals for end-sites withautonomous
    system (AS) number to be able to derive a providerindependent block of addresses
    from the first half of the 16-bit AS-number space. This could enable a temporary
    IPv6 site multihomingsolution for those that already employ similar mechanisms
    in IPv4.</p>"
