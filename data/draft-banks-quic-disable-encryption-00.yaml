abstract:
- content: "<p>The disable_1rtt_encryption transport parameter can be used to negotiate
    the disablement of encryption on 1-RTT packets, allowing for reduced CPU load
    and improved performance. This extension is only meant to be used in environments
    where both endpoints completely trust the path between themselves; not, for instance,
    on the open internet.</p>"
