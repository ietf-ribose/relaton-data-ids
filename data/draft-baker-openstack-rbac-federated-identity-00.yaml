abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes an IPv6 option intended to carry a Federated Identity
    for use in Role-Based Access Control. Rather than identify a person, it identifies
    a group of systems that the sender is a member of. Role-Based Access Control permits
    specified sets of systems to communicate with other specified sets of systems,
    with the intention of scalability.</p>"
