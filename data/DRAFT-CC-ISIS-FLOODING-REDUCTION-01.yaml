abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an approach to flood ISIS link state
    protocol\n   data units on a topology that is a subgraph of the complete ISIS\n
    \  topology per underline physical network, so that the amount of\n   flooding
    traffic in the network is greatly reduced, and it would\n   reduce convergence
    time with a more stable and optimized routing\n   environment.  The approach can
    be applied to any network topology in\n   a single ISIS area.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
