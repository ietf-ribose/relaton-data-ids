abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes unknown key-share attacks on the use
    of\n   Datagram Transport Layer Security for the Secure Real-Time Transport\n
    \  Protocol (DTLS-SRTP).  Similar attacks are described on the use of\n   DTLS-SRTP
    with the identity bindings used in Web Real-Time\n   Communications (WebRTC) and
    SIP identity.  These attacks are\n   difficult to mount, but they cause a victim
    to be mislead about the\n   identity of a communicating peer.  Simple mitigation
    techniques are\n   defined for each.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
