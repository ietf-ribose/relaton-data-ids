abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traditionally, Ethernet MAC rates were constrained to match
    the rates\n   of the Ethernet PHY(s).  OIF's implementation agreement [OIFMLG3]
    was\n   the first step in allowing MAC rates to be different than the PHY\n   rates.
    \ OIF has recently approved another implementation agreement\n   [OIFFLEXE1] which
    allows complete decoupling of the MAC data rates\n   and the Ethernet PHY(s) that
    support them.  This includes support for\n   (a) MAC rates which are greater than
    the rate of a single PHY\n   (satisfied by bonding of multiple PHY(s)), (b) MAC
    rates which are\n   less than the rate of a PHY (sub-rate), (c) support of multiple
    FlexE\n   client signals carried over a single PHY, or over a collection of\n
    \  bonded PHY(s).  The FlexE SHIM functions which bond multipe Ethernet\n   PHY(s)
    to form a large \"pipe\" view the connectivity between two FlexE\n   aware devices
    as a collection of multiple point-to-point links (one\n   link per Ethernet PHY).
    \ These logical point-to-point links can\n   either be direct links (without an
    intervening transport network), or\n   realized via a Optical transport network.
    \ This draft catalogs the\n   usecases that capture the FlexE deployment scenarios
    -- including the\n   cases that include/exclude OTNs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
