abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are scenarios, typically in a hierarchical SDN context,
    in\n   which an orchestrator may not have detailed information to be able\n   to
    perform an end-to-end path computation and would need to request\n   lower layer/domain
    controllers to calculate some (partial) feasible\n   paths.\n\n   Multiple protocol
    solutions can be used for communication between\n   different controller hierarchical
    levels. This document assumes that\n   the controllers are communicating using
    YANG-based protocols (e.g.,\n   NETCONF or RESTCONF).\n\n   This document describes
    some use cases where a path computation\n   request, via YANG-based protocols
    (e.g., NETCONF or RESTCONF), can\n   be needed.\n\n   This document also proposes
    a yang model for a stateless RPC which\n   complements the stateful solution defined
    in [TE-TUNNEL].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
