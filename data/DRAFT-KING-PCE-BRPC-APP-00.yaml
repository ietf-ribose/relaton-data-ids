abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Computing optimum routes for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) across\nmultiple
    domains in Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering\n(MPLS-TE) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks presents a problem\nbecause no single point of path computation
    is aware of all of the\nlinks and resources in each domain. A solution may be
    achieved using\nthe Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture.\n\nWhere the
    sequence of domains is known a priori, various techniques\ncan be employed to
    derive an optimum path. If the domains are \nsimply- connected, or if the preferred
    points of interconnection are\nalso known, the Per-Domain Path Computation technique
    can be used. \nWhere there are multiple connections between domains and there
    is \nno preference for the choice of points of interconnection, the \nBackward
    Recursive Path Computation Procedure (BRPC) can be used.\n\t </p>\n      "
