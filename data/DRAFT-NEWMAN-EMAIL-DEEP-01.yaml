abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a set of requirements and facilities\n
    \  designed to improve email privacy.  The focus of this proposal is to\n   provide
    mechanisms intended to increase use of already deployed\n   Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) technology and enable deployment and\n   use of stronger cipher suites for
    email protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
