abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are use cases, specifically in Internet of Things (IoT)
    and\n   constrained environments that do not require confidentiality, though\n
    \  message integrity for all communications and at least server, if not\n   mutual
    authentication during tunnel establishment are both still\n   mandated.  Examples
    of such use cases are given, although a threat\n   model is necessary to determine
    whether or not a given situation\n   falls into this catergory of use cases.  In
    order to serve these use\n   cases, this document defines the use of HMAC only
    cipher suites for\n   TLS 1.3, which provides server and optionally mutual authentication\n
    \  and data authenticity, but not data confidentiality.  The approach\n   described
    in this document is not endorsed by the IETF and does not\n   have IETF consensus,
    but is presented here to enable interoperable\n   implementation of a reduced
    security mechanism that provides\n   authentication and message integrity without
    supporting\n   confidentiality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
