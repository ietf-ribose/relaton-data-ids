abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes challenges associated with securing smart object
    devices in constrained implementations and environments. The memo describes a
    possible deployment model suitable for these environments, discusses the availability
    of cryptographic libraries for small devices, presents some preliminary experiences
    in implementing small devices using those libraries, and discusses trade-offs
    involving different types of approaches.</p>"
