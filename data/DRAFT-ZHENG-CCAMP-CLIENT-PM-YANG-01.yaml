abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A transport network is a server-layer network to provide connectivity\n
    \  services to its client.  Given the client signal is configured, the\n   followup
    function for performance monitoring, such as latency and bit\n   error rate, would
    be needed for network operation.\n\n   This document describes the data model
    to support the performance\n   monitoring functionalities.  The module carefully
    maps to relevant\n   performance monitoring standards.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
