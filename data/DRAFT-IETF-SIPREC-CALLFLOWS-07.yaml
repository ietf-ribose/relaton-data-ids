abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications\n
    \  environments, such as call centers and financial trading\n   organizations.
    \ In some of these environments, all calls must be\n   recorded for regulatory,
    compliance, and consumer protection reasons.\n   The recording of a session is
    typically performed by sending a copy\n   of a media stream to a recording device.
    \ This document lists call\n   flows with metadata snapshots sent from a Session
    Recording\n   Client(SRC) to a Session Recording Server(SRS).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
