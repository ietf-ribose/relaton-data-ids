abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format\n
    \  whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code\n   size,
    fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need\n   for version
    negotiation.  These design goals make it different from\n   earlier binary serializations
    such as ASN.1 and MessagePack, or other\n   binary serializations that may be
    created in the future.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
