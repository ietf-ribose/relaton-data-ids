abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network requirements have evolved from data communications
    between\n   two hosts to large-scale information access through networks. The\n
    \  current Internet employs an address-centric network communication\n   model,
    which is efficient for communications between hosts, but not\n   efficient for
    communications between a host and a network. Given\n   this fact, Information-centric
    Networking (ICN) has become a hot\n   spot to meet the new requirement.  In ICN
    there exists a congestion\n   problem which hasn't been well solved. We provide
    a new congestion\n   control protocol, RRCP, since the congestion control protocols
    in IP\n   networks are not suitable for ICN transport.  RRCP, with XCP and ICN\n
    \  transport characteristics, advances a receiver-driven and router-\n   feedback
    mechanism.  RRCP can stay efficient, fair and stable via\n   the validation of
    simulation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
