abstract:
- content: "<p>The current definition of the IPv6 Flow Label focuses mainly on how
    the packet source forms the value of this field and how the forwarder in-path
    treats it. In network operations, there are needs to correlate an upstream session
    and the corresponding downstream session together. This document propose a flow
    label reflection mechanism that network devices copy the flow label value from
    received packets to the corresponding flow label field in return packets. This
    mechanism could simplify the network traffic recognition process in network operations
    and make the policy for both directions of traffic of one session consistent.</p>"
