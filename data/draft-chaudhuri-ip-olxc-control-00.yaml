abstract:
  content: "<p>This document details requirements and mechanisms for opticalbandwidth
    management and restoration in a dynamically reconfigurableoptical network. A management
    approach is described where IPalgorithms and mechanisms are used to control optical
    resources,paving the way for the optical Internet. The proposal isspecifically
    intended for optical internetworking in which IProuters are connected by the reconfigurable
    optical layer usinglightpaths. However, it is assumed that the same methodology
    willbe used for non-IP traffic as well.</p>"
