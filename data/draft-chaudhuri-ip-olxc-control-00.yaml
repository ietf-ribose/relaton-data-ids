abstract:
- content: "<p>This document details requirements and mechanisms for optical bandwidth
    management and restoration in a dynamically reconfigurable optical network. A
    management approach is described where IP algorithms and mechanisms are used to
    control optical resources, paving the way for the optical Internet. The proposal
    is specifically intended for optical internetworking in which IP routers are connected
    by the reconfigurable optical layer using lightpaths. However, it is assumed that
    the same methodology will be used for non-IP traffic as well.</p>"
