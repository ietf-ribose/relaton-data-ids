abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SCHC compression mechanism for LPWAN network enables IPv6 on
    devices\n   connected to a constrained network (LPWAN).  They can communicate\n
    \  with a CoAP server located anywhere in the Internet.  LPWAN network\n   characteristics
    limits the number of exchanges and may impose a long\n   RTT.  The CoAP server
    must be aware of these properties to manage\n   correctly requests.  The Time
    Scale option allows a device to inform\n   a CoAP server of the duration the message
    ID value should be kept in\n   memory to manage correctly message duplication.\n\n\t
