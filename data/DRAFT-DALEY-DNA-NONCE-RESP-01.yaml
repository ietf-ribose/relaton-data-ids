abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPv6 Neighbour Discovery does not provide a mechanism which allows
    a\n   node to match its router solicitations to advertised responses.\n\n   The
    Nonce Neighbour Discovery Option was originally defined for\n   Secured Neighbour
    Discovery.  This draft describes the use of the\n   Nonce Option for generic router
    reachability testing.\n\t </p>\n      "
