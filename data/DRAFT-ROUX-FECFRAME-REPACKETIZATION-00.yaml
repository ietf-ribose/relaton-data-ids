abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document addresses the subject of FEC-based protection of
    \n   multimedia streams. It is proposed to apply re-packetization on the \n   application
    source stream data units in order to get a constant data \n   unit size within
    each block. A reverse packetization operation should \n   also be applied in the
    receiver in order to provide the application \n   consumer with original application
    data units. By avoiding any \n   padding in the process of repair packet production,
    this proposal \n   brings a significant performance enhancement which is evaluated
    by \n   simulation. The proposed re-packetization operations can be used \n   without
    requiring change to the FEC framework. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
