abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft discusses Reliable UDP (RUDP). RUDP is a simple
    packet based transport protocol. RUDP is based on RFCs 1151 and 908 - Reliable
    Data Protocol. RUDP is layered on the UDP/IP Protocols and provides reliable in-order
    delivery (up to a maximum number of retransmissions) for virtual connections.
    RUDP has a very flexible design that would make it suitable for a variety of transport
    uses. One such use would be to transport telecommunication signaling protocols.</p>"
