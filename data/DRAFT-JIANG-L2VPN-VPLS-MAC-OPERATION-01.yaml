abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) using Label Distribution
    \   \n   Protocol (LDP) signaling is described in RFC 4762. That document   \n
    \  describes a mechanism called MAC Address Withdrawal to remove or    \n   unlearn
    MAC addresses which have been dynamically learned in a VPLS   \n   instance. Further
    work in progress defines an extension to MAC \n   Address Withdrawal procedure
    which can greatly restrict the scope of \n   MAC flushing. This document provides
    a flushing-free mechanism which \n   removes the need for MAC address flushing
    in a VPLS instance. This \n   mechanism is called MAC Address Switching. \n\t
