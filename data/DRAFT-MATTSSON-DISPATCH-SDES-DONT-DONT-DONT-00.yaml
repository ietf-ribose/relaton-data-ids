abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Key exchange without forward secrecy enables pervasive monitoring.\n
    \  Massive pervasive monitoring attacks relying on key exchange without\n   forward
    secrecy have been reported, and many more have likely\n   happened without ever
    being reported.  If key exchange without\n   Diffie-Hellman is used, access to
    long-term keys enable passive\n   attackers to compromise past and future sessions.
    \ Entities can get\n   access to long-term key material in different ways: physical
    attacks,\n   hacking, social engineering attacks, espionage, or by simply\n   demanding
    access to keying material with or without a court order.\n   Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions (RFC 4568)\n   does not offer PFS and has
    a large number of additional significant\n   security weaknesses.  This document
    specifies that use of the SDP\n   Security Descriptions is NOT RECOMMENDED.  New
    deployments SHOULD\n   forbid support of SDP Security Descriptions.\n\n   This
    document reclassifies RFC 4568 (SDP Security Descriptions) to\n   Historic Status
    and also obsoletes RFC 4568.\n\n   This document updates RFC 7201 (Options for
    Securing RTP Sessions) to\n   note that SDP Security Descriptions SHOULD NOT be
    used.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
