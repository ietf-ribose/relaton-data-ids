abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  We present a scalable method for establishing group session
    keys\n  for secure large, dynamic groups such as multicast sessions.\n  Our method
    is based on a novel application of One-Way Function\n  Trees (OFTs).  The number
    of keys stored by group members, the\n  number of keys broadcast to the group
    when new members are added\n  or evicted, and the computational efforts of group
    members, are\n  logarithmic in the number of group members.  The method provides\n
    \ perfect forward and backward security:  evicted members cannot\n  read future
    messages, even with collusion by arbitrarily many\n  evicted members, and newly
    admitted group members cannot read\n  previous messages.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
