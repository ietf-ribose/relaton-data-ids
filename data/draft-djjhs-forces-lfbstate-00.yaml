abstract:
- content: "<p>The ForCES LFB Topology currently defines that once an instance of
    an LFB class is created it becomes immediately active in the datatapath. This
    document makes a slight extension to add state to an instantiated LFB class allowing
    the CE to decide when an LFB instance becomes operational on the datapath.</p>"
