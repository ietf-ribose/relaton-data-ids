abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates
    for\n   the purposes of supporting validation of Autonomous System (AS) paths\n
    \  in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), as part of an extension to that\n   protocol
    known as BGPSEC. BGP is a critical component for the proper\n   operation of the
    Internet as a whole. The BGPSEC protocol is under\n   development as a component
    to address the requirement to provide\n   security for the BGP protocol. The goal
    of BGPSEC is to design a\n   protocol for full AS path validation based on the
    use of strong\n   cryptographic primitives. The end-entity (EE) certificates specified\n
    \  by this profile are issued under Resource PKI (RPKI) CA certificates,\n   containing
    the RFC 3779 AS number extension, to routers within the\n   autonomous system.
    The certificate asserts that the router(s) holding\n   the public key are authorized
    to send out secure route advertisements\n   on behalf of the specified autonomous
    system. Note that since these\n   certificates extend the RPKI [ID.sidr-arch],
    this profile is based on\n   the profile for RPKI resource certificates [ID.res-cert-prof].\n\n\t
