abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document has a normative description of the service flow\n
    \  management technology based on mobile IPv6 (MIPv6). It makes the\n   upgrade
    of management model in MIPv6 from the entire node granularity\n   to the single
    service flow granularity. It proposes a distributed\n   mobility management solution,
    DMIPv6, which is compatible with MIPv6\n   and takes different mobility management
    strategies according to the\n   Correspondent Node's position, network conditions
    and service\n   requirements of different service flows so as to achieve the service\n
    \  flow handoff and transmission path control. The standard also\n   provides
    route optimization mechanism between the Mobile Node and the\n   ordinary Correspondent
    Node that doesn't support mobile IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
