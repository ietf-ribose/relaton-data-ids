abstract:
  content: "<p>Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) requirea
    user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI which can be usedby anyone on
    the Internet to route a call to that specific UAinstance. An example of such an
    application is call transfer, basedon the REFER method. To date, a variety of
    techniques have beenproposed for the contruction of such URI. All of them have
    fataldrawbacks. This document proposes that the problem is actually oneof URI
    leasing - a feature whereby a UA can dynamically request thecreation of an address-of-record
    (AOR) within a domain. Requirementsfor a URI leasing mechanism are outlined.</p>"
