abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) framework
    in RFC\n   6707 defines a set of protocols to interconnect CDNs to achieve\n   multiple
    goals, including extending the reach of a given CDN.  A CDNI\n   Request Routing
    Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface\n   (FCI) is needed to achieve
    the goals of a CDNI.  RFC 8008 defines\n   precisely the semantics of FCI and
    provides guidelines on the FCI\n   protocol, but the exact protocol is not specified.
    \ This document\n   defines a new Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
    service\n   called \"CDNI Advertisement Service\" that provides an implementation\n
    \  of the FCI, following the guidelines defined in RFC 8008.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
