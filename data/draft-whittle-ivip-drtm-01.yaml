abstract:
  content: <p>Distributed Real Time Mapping (DRTM) is intended for Ivip, but may beuseful
    for other Core-Edge Separation solutions to the routingscaling problem, such as
    LISP. End-user networks - or otherorganizations they appoint - control the mapping
    of each or their oneor more micronets (ranges of "edge" space with a single mapping)
    viasending commands to the organizations from whom they lease thisspace. This
    is conveyed to all ITRs which need it in "real-time"such as a second or two, globally.
    There is no need for any singleset of servers to handle all the mapping updates,
    or to store all themapping databases for all the MABs (Mapped Address Block) of
    "edge"space. Networks with ITRs use purely caching Resolving query servers(QSRs),
    in contrast to previous Ivip arrangements which required themto run a query server
    which contained the real-time updated fullmapping database for all MABs.</p>
