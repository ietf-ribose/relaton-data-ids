abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of the Virtual Presence Protocol (VPP) protocol
    is to\n   enable the exchange of document based virtual presence information.\n
    \  Virtual presence information is the foundation for virtual\n   neighborhood
    services which provide users with information about\n   virtual neighbors, i.e.
    other users who are close within the virtual\n   document space. VPP enables the
    creation of dynamic vicinities based\n   on hypertext references. It is not meant
    to replace or supersede\n   presence notification protocols, but it augments online
    presence with\n   location information. The protocol described in this document
    is\n   based on 2 years of experience with location based virtual presence\n   and
    presence notification.\n\n   The purpose of presence notification protocols such
    as the drafted\n   [RVP] is to tell whether another individual is online or arrives\n
    \  online, etc. As opposed to such real online presence, the presence on\n   documents
    in the World Wide Web is a virtual one. The authors\n   recognize that VPP shares
    methods, mechanisms, and formats with HTTP,\n   and drafted presence notification
    protocols (e.g. RVP, IMPP), however\n   the functionality is significantly different.\n\n
    \  Changes since draft-wolf-vpp-00.txt: Added event types, IANA assigned\n   port
    677, extended service URL lookup to simplify VPP hosting, added\n   SELECT update
    method, adapted to latest XML name space spec, maxdata\n   and more-tag.\n\n\t
