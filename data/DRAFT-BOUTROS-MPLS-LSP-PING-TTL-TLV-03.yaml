abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>LSP-Ping is a widely deployed Operation, Administration, and \nMaintenance
    (OAM) mechanism in MPLS networks. However, in the present \nform, this mechanism
    is inadequate to verify connectivity of a \nsegment of a Multi-Segment PseudoWire
    (MS-PW) from any node on the \npath of the MS-PW. Similar shortcoming is seen
    on a bidirectional co-\nrouted MPLS TP LSPs. This document defines a TLV to address
    these \nshortcomings. \n\nRequirements Language \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST
    NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL \nNOT\",\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in \nthis document are to be interpreted as described
    in RFC 2119 [3].\n\t </p>\n      "
