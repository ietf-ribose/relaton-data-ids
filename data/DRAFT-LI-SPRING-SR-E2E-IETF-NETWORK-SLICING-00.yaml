abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network slicing can be used to meet the connectivity and performance\n
    \  requirement of different services or customers in a shared network.\n   An
    IETF network slice can be realized as enhanced VPNs (VPN+), which\n   is delivered
    by integrating the overlay VPN service with a Virtual\n   Transport Network (VTN)
    as the underlay.  An end-to-end IETF network\n   slice may span multiple network
    domains.  Within each domain, traffic\n   of the end-to-end network slice service
    is mapped to a local VTN.\n\n   When segment routing (SR) is used to build a multi-domain
    IETF\n   network slice, information of the local network slices in each domain\n
    \  can be specified using special SR binding segments called VTN binding\n   segments
    (VTN BSID).  The multi-domain IETF network slice can be\n   specified using a
    list of VTN BSIDs in the packet, each of which can\n   be used by the corresponding
    domain edge nodes to steer the traffic\n   of end-to-end IETF network slice into
    the specific VTN in the local\n   domain.\n\n   This document describes the functionality
    of VTN binding segment and\n   its instantiation in SR-MPLS and SRv6.\n\n\n\t
