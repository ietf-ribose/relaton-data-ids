abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft presents several use cases in which WiSUN technology
    can\n   be applied, including Advanced Metering Infrastructure and\n   Intelligent
    Street Lights.  The draft can stand alone as an\n   independent draft, but also
    represents a potential contribution to\n   the \"WiSUN overview\" section of [I-D.ietf-lpwan-overview].\n\n\t
