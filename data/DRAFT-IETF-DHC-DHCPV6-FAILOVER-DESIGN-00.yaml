abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DHCPv6 defined in [RFC3315] does not offer server redundancy.
    \ This\n   document defines a design for DHCPv6 failover, a mechanism for\n   running
    two servers on the same network with capability for either\n   server to take
    over clients' leases in case of server failure or\n   network partition.  This
    is a DHCPv6 Failover design document, it is\n   not protocol specification document.
    \ It is a second document in a\n   planned series of three documents.  DHCPv6
    failover requirements are\n   specified in [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-requirements].
    \ A protocol\n   specification document is planned to follow this document.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
