abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mailbox names often represent the names of human users. Many of
    these\nusers throughout the world have names that are not normally represented\nby
    the users with just the ASCII repertoire of characters, and would\ntherefore like
    to use their real names in their mailbox names. This\nprotocol describes how mail
    clients can be enhanced to display mailbox\nnames in non-ASCII characters through
    the use of a new RFC 2822 header\nfield called 'Address-map'.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
