abstract:
- content: "<p>Provisioning Domains (PvDs) are defined as consistent sets of network
    configuration information. PvDs allows hosts to manage connections to multiple
    networks and interfaces simultaneously, such as when a home router provides connectivity
    through both a broadband and cellular network provider. This document defines
    a mechanism for explicitly identifying PvDs through a Router Advertisement (RA)
    option. This RA option announces a PvD identifier, which hosts can compare to
    differentiate between PvDs. The option can directly carry some information about
    a PvD and can optionally point to PvD Additional Information that can be retrieved
    using HTTP over TLS.</p>"
