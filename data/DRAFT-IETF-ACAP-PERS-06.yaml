abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>It has become common for Internet mail users to receive and compose\nmail
    in the capacity of different roles or identities (for example,\npersonal and work),
    to receive and compose mail at different\nmachines, and to use multiple programs
    which require mail\ncomposition configuration information.  These different roles
    or\nidentities have become known as email personalities.\n \nThe Application Configuration
    Access Protocol [ACAP] provides an\nideal mechanism for storage of email personality
    data.\n \nThis specification defines a standard ACAP dataset class for email\npersonalities,
    and a common option for indicating a default.\nAn SMTP URL scheme is also defined.\n\t
