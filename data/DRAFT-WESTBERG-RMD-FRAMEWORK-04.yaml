abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft presents the work on the framework for the Resource\nManagement
    in Diffserv (RMD) designed for edge-to-edge resource\nreservation in a Differentiated
    Services (Diffserv) domain.  The RMD\nextends the Diffserv architecture with new
    resource reservation\nconcepts and features. Moreover, this framework enhances
    the Load\nControl protocol described in [WeTu00].\nThe RMD framework defines two
    architectural concepts:\n- the Per Hop Reservation (PHR)\n- the Per Domain Reservation
    (PDR)\nThe PHR protocol is used within a Diffserv domain on a per-hop basis\nto
    augment the Diffserv Per Hop Behavior (PHB) with resource\nreservation. It is
    implemented in all nodes in a Diffserv domain. On\nthe other hand, the PDR protocol
    manages the resource reservation per\nDiffserv domain, relying on the PHR resource
    reservation status in\nall nodes.  The PDR is only implemented at the boundary
    of the domain\n(at the edge nodes).\nThe RMD framework presented in this draft
    describes the new\nreservation concepts and features. Furthermore it describes
    the:\n- relationship between the PHR and PHB\n- interaction between the PDR and
    PHR\n- interoperability between the PDR and external resource\nreservation schemes\nThis
    framework is an open framework in the sense that it provides the\nbasis for interoperability
    with other resource reservation schemes\nand can be applied in different types
    of networks as long as they are\nDiffserv domains. It aims at extreme simplicity
    and low cost of\nimplementation along with good scaling properties.\n\t </p>\n
