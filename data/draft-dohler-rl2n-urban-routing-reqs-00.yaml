abstract:
  content: "<p>The application specific routing requirements for Urban Low Power andLossy
    Networks (U-L2Ns) are presented in this document. In the nearfuture, sensing and
    actuating nodes will be placed outdoors in urbanenvironments so as to improve
    the citizens' living conditions as wellas to monitor compliance with increasingly
    strict environmental laws.These field nodes are expected to measure and report
    a wide gamut ofdata, such as required in smart metering, waste disposal,meteorological,
    pollution and allergy reporting applications. Themajority of these nodes is expected
    to communicate wirelessly which- given the limited radio range - requires the
    use of suitablemulti-hop routing protocols. The design of such protocols will
    bemainly impacted by the limited resources of the nodes (memory,processing power,
    battery, etc) and the particularities of theoutdoors urban application scenario.
    As such, for a wireless RL2Nsolution to be competitive with other incumbent and
    emergingsolutions, the protocol ought to be energy-efficient, scalable andautonomous.
    This documents aims to specify a set of requirementsreflecting these and further
    U-L2Ns tailored characteristics.</p>"
