abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a problem statement for the Trust Anchor\n
    \  Management Birds of a Feather (BOF).  A trust anchor represents an\n   authoritative
    entity via a public key and associated data.  The\n   public key is used to verify
    digital signatures and the associated\n   data is used to constrain the types
    of information for which the\n   trust anchor is authoritative.  Relying parties
    use trust anchors to\n   determine if digitally signed objects are valid by verifying
    digital\n   signatures using the trust anchor's public key and by enforcing the\n
    \  constraints expressed in the associated data.  This document\n   describes
    some of the problems associated with the lack of a standard\n   trust anchor management
    mechanism as well as problems that must be\n   addressed by such a mechanism.\n\n\t
