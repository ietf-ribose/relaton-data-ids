abstract:
- content: "<p>After sun-setting of IPv4, many devices will be connected to IPv6 single
    stack network. In this document we describe a workaround for IPv6 enabled network
    configuration. At this moment, the condition of IPv6 adoption on the consumer
    devices such as PC, tablet, mobile terminal and entertainment device are various.
    For example, some devices are fully support IPv6 client but some are not. It is
    very hard to provide IPv6 network service with these various conditioned devices.
    To solve this problem, we tried to verify some configurations to connect these
    devices into IPv6 enabled consumer network for termination of IPv4 network services.</p>"
