abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides benchmarking terminology and methodology for
    next-generation network security devices including next-generation firewalls (NGFW),
    intrusion detection and prevention solutions (IDS/ IPS) and unified threat management
    (UTM) implementations. The document aims to strongly improve the applicability,
    reproducibility, and transparency of benchmarks and to align the test methodology
    with today's increasingly complex layer 7 application use cases. The main areas
    covered in this document are test terminology, traffic profiles and benchmarking
    methodology for NGFWs to start with.</p>"
