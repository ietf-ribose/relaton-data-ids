abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes the dynamic allocation of shared IPv4 addresses\n
    \  to clients using DHCPv4.  Address sharing allows a single IPv4\n   address
    to be allocated to multiple active clients simultaneously,\n   each client being
    differentiated by a unique set of transport layer\n   source port numbers.  The
    necessary changes to existing DHCPv4 client\n   and server behavior are described
    and a new DHCPv4 option for\n   provisioning clients with shared IPv4 addresses
    is included.\n\n   Due to the nature of IP address sharing, some limitations to
    its\n   applicability are necessary.  This memo describes these limitations\n
    \  and recommends suitable architectures and technologies where address\n   sharing
    may be utilized.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
