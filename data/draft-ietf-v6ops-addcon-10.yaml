abstract:
- content: "<p>One fundamental aspect of any IP communications infrastructure is its
    addressing plan. With its new address architecture and allocation policies, the
    introduction of IPv6 into a network means that network designers and operators
    need to reconsider their existing approaches to network addressing. Lack of guidelines
    on handling this aspect of network design could slow down the deployment and integration
    of IPv6. This document aims to provide the information and recommendations relevant
    to planning the addressing aspects of IPv6 deployments. The document also provides
    IPv6 addressing case studies for both an enterprise and an ISP network. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
