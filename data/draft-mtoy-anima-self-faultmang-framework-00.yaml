abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a self-managed network identifying network
    problems during failures and repairing them. Self-managed Network Element (sNE)
    architectures and Network Management System (sNMS) architectures for centrally
    and distributedly managed networks are described. A hierarchy among repairing
    entities is defined. An in- band message format for Metro Ethernet networks is
    proposed for the fault management communication.</p>"
