abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Somecast is a multi-point delivery technology that allows a packet
    to\nbe sent to a set of destinations.  Somecast delivery means that the\nnetwork
    delivers one copy of a packet to each destination listed in\nthe packet.  Somecast
    can be used in small multi-user sessions, such\nas multimedia conferences and
    multiplayer games, or used with endhost\nmulticast for larger sessions.  This
    document describes a possible\nimplementation of somecast in IPv4.  Somecast is
    implemented by using\nan IPv4 header option that includes a list of up to 9 additional\ndestination
    addresses.  This document also describes how somecast can\nbe incrementally deployed.\n\n\t
