abstract:
  content: "<p>The NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) [1] specifies amechanism
    that allows a source station (e.g., a host or a router) onan NBMA subnetwork to
    find the NBMA subnetwork address address of adestination station when the destination
    station is connected to theNBMA subnetwork. For the case where the destination
    station is offthe NBMA subnetwork the mechanism described in [1] allows todetermine
    the NBMA subnetwork address of an egress router from theNBMA subnetwork that is
    'nearest' to the destination station. Ifused to locate an egress router wherein
    the destination station isdirectly behind the egress router, the currently document
    NHRPbehaviors are sufficient. However, as documented elsewhere [2],there are cases
    where if used between routers for generalizedtransit, NHRP can produce loops.
    This document describes extensions to the NBMA Next Hop ResolutionProtocol (NHRP)
    [1] that allow to acquire and maintain theinformation about the egress router
    without constraining thedestination(s) to be directly connected to the egress
    router.</p>"
