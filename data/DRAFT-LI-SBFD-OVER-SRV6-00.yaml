abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) can be used to monitor
    paths\n   between node.  Seamless BFD (S-BFD) provides a simplified mechanism\n
    \  which is suitable for monitoring of paths that are setup dynamically\n   and
    on a large scale network.  This draft describes a method to\n   simplify the implementation
    of S-BFD over SRv6 by using SRH.flag to\n   instruct the S-BFD peer node to do
    reverse operation of SRv6 SID\n   list.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
