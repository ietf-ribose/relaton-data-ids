abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes version 2.0 of the Certificate Transparency
    (CT) protocol for publicly logging the existence of Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    server certificates as they are issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone
    to audit certification authority (CA) activity and notice the issuance of suspect
    certificates as well as to audit the certificate logs themselves. The intent is
    that eventually clients would refuse to honor certificates that do not appear
    in a log, effectively forcing CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs.
    Logs are network services that implement the protocol operations for submissions
    and queries that are defined in this document.</p>"
