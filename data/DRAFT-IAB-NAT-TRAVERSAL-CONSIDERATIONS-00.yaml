abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are many protocols designed and deployed on the Internet
    today\n   which do not naturally traverse Network Address Translators (NAT).\n
    \  In order to allow these protocols to work in the presence of NAT,\n   additional
    logic needs to be added to the network.  This logic\n   modifies the behavior
    of the protocol in some way.  There are choices\n   where this logic can be placed
    in the network.  It can reside in the\n   NATs themselves, transparently altering
    the protocol; when this\n   occurs, it is called an Application Layer Gateway
    (ALG).  It can\n   reside in server components, hiding the changes from NATs and
    clients\n   alike, it can reside in the clients, or it can reside in a\n   combination
    thereof.  The choice of the placement of this logic\n   typically has implications
    on many aspects of the protocol, including\n   security, deployability, manageability
    and availability.  This\n   document provides a set of considerations that should
    be taken into\n   account by protocol and network designers when making this choice.\n\t
