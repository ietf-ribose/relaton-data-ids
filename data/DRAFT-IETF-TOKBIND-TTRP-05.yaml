abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines HTTP header fields that enable a TLS\n
    \  terminating reverse proxy to convey information to a backend server\n   about
    the validated Token Binding Message received from a client,\n   which enables
    that backend server to bind, or verify the binding of,\n   cookies and other security
    tokens to the client's Token Binding key.\n   This facilitates the reverse proxy
    and backend server functioning\n   together as though they are a single logical
    server side deployment\n   of HTTPS Token Binding.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
