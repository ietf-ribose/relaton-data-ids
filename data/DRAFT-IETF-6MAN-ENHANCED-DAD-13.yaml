abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Loopback Suppression and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)
    are\n   discussed in Appendix A of RFC4862.  That specification mentions a\n   hardware-assisted
    mechanism to detect looped back DAD messages.  If\n   hardware cannot suppress
    looped back DAD messages, a software\n   solution is required.  Several service
    provider communities have\n   expressed a need for automated detection of looped
    back Neighbor\n   Discovery (ND) messages used by DAD.  This document includes\n
    \  mitigation techniques and outlines the Enhanced DAD algorithm to\n   automate
    the detection of looped back IPv6 ND messages used by DAD.\n   For network loopback
    tests, the Enhanced DAD algorithm allows IPv6 to\n   self-heal after a loopback
    is placed and removed.  Further, for\n   certain access networks the document
    automates resolving a specific\n   duplicate address conflict.  This document
    updates RFC4861, RFC4862,\n   and RFC4429.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
