  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the problems in obtaining IP Performance\n
    \  Metrics (IPPM) one-way and two-way active measurements across\n   Internet
    paths that traverse Network Address Translators (NATs).  It\n   also documents
    the requirements, guidelines and best practices when\n   such measurements are
    obtained across NATs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
