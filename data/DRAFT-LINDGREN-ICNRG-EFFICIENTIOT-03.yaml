abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document outlines the tradeoffs involved in utilizing\n
    \  Information Centric Networking (ICN) for the Internet of Things (IoT)\n   scenarios.
    \ It describes the contexts and applications where the IoT\n   would benefit from
    ICN, and where a host-centric approach would be\n   better.  The requirements
    imposed by the heterogeneous nature of IoT\n   networks are discussed (e.g., in
    terms of connectivity, power\n   availability, computational and storage capacity).
    \ Design choices\n   are then proposed for an IoT architecture to handle these\n
    \  requirements, while providing efficiency and scalability.  An\n   objective
    is to not require any IoT specific changes of the ICN\n   architecture per se,
    but we do indicate some potential modifications\n   of ICN that would improve
    efficiency and scalability for IoT and\n   other applications.\n\n   This document
    mainly serves as a problem statement and will not\n   present a conclusive architecture
    design.  It can be used as a basis\n   for further discussion and to design architectures
    for the IoT.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
