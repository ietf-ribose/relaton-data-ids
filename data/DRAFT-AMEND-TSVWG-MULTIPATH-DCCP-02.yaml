abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DCCP communication is currently restricted to a single path
    per\n   connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The\n   simultaneous
    use of these multiple paths for a DCCP session could\n   improve resource usage
    within the network and, thus, improve user\n   experience through higher throughput
    and improved resilience to\n   network failure.\n\n   Multipath DCCP provides
    the ability to simultaneously use multiple\n   paths between peers.  This document
    presents a set of extensions to\n   traditional DCCP to support multipath operation.
    \ The protocol offers\n   the same type of service to applications as DCCP and
    it provides the\n   components necessary to establish and use multiple DCCP flows
    across\n   potentially disjoint paths.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
