- content: "<p>This document describes the conventions for using the SHA-3 family
    of hash functions in the Internet X.509 PKI as one-way hash functions and with
    the ECDSA signature algorithm; the conventions for the associated ECDSA subject
    public keys are also described. Digital signatures are used to sign certificates
    and CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists).</p>"
