abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines Monitor, an additional Option for the Constrained\n
    \  Application Protocol (CoAP) especially targeted at sleepy sensors.\n\n   The
    Monitor Option complements the typical Observe pattern, enabling\n   the tracking
    of a resource hosted by a node sleeping most of the\n   time, by taking care of
    establishing and maintaining an Observe\n   relationship with the (sleepy) origin
    on behalf of the (sleepy)\n   client.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
