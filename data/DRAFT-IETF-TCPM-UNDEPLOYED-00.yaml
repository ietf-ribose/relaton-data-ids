abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document reclassifies several TCP extensions that have
    either\n   been superceded or never seen widespread use to Historic status.  The\n
    \  affected RFCs are RFC 675, RFC 721, RFC 879, RFC 1078, and RFC 6013.\n   Additionally,
    it reclassifies RFC 813, RFC 814, RFC 816, RFC 817, RFC\n   872, RFC 896, and
    RFC 964 to Informational status.  Most of those\n   RFCs are today part of RFC
    1122.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
