abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace
    for the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) and a Namespace
    Specific String (NSS) for the International Mobile station Equipment Identity
    (IMEI), as well as an associated parameter for the International Mobile station
    Equipment Identity and Software Version number (IMEISV). The IMEI and IMEISV were
    introduced as part of the specification for the GSM and are also now incorporated
    by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as part of the 3GPP specification
    for GSM, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), and 3GPP Long Term
    Evolution (LTE) networks. The IMEI and IMEISV are used to uniquely identify Mobile
    Equipment within these systems and are managed by the GSMA. URNs from this namespace
    almost always contain personally identifiable information and need to be treated
    accordingly.</p>"
