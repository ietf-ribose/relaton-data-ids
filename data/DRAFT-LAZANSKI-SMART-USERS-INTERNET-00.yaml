abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 3552 introduces a threat model that does not include endpoint\n
    \  security. In the fifteen years since RFC 3552 security issues and\n   cyber
    attacks have increased, especially on the endpoint. This\n   document proposes
    a new approach to Internet cyber security protocol\n   development that focuses
    on the user of the Internet, namely those\n   who use the endpoint and are the
    most vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
