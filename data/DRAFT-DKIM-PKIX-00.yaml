abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism for using X.509v3 certificates
    \nthat comply with the PKIX profile with Domain Keys Identified Mail \n(DKIM).
    \ \n          \nAn email signer MAY inform potential relying parties that a key
    \ndescribed in a DKIM key record has a corresponding PKIX certificate \nor certificate
    path by means of an attribute in the key record that \nprovides the URL of the
    certificate data. An email verifier MAY \nchoose to make use of this information
    in deciding the disposition \nof the signed email message.\n\t </p>\n      "
