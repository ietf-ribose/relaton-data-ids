abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an IP-based packet capture format that can
    be used to transport exact copies of packets to a network probe to analyze and
    characterize the operational load and protocol distribution of a network as well
    as to detect anomalies such as network-based worms or viruses. This replication
    and transport mechanism operates over one or multiple switch or router ports whose
    traffic can be mirrored and forwarded to a destination device in charge of traffic
    analysis and reporting.</p>"
