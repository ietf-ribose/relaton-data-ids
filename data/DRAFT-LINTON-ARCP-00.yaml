abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Automatic Router Configuration Protocol is a method by which Routers\nmay
    be automatically configured according to a predefined or default\nscheme of behavior
    and address allocation. It is routing protocol\nindependent and is based on on
    a Client-Server model, working in\nconjunction with DHCP [2] and using a system
    of IP messages for\ncommunication between participating Router Clients and Servers.
    It is\neasy to use as a labor-saving device in less secure environments and\nwill
    work even in conjunction with unmodified DHCP Server\nimplementations. However,
    it also has inherent security features and\nis capable of highly secure implementation.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
