abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a method of algorithmic load balancing for IPv6
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) traffic. It enables multiple, cooperating
    servers to decide which one should service a client, without necessarily exchanging
    any information between the servers. The server selection is based on the servers
    hashing client DHCP Unique Identifiers (DUIDs) when multiple DHCPv6 servers are
    available to service DHCPv6 clients. The proposed technique provides for efficient
    server selection when multiple DHCPv6 servers offer services on a network without
    requiring any changes to existing DHCPv6 clients. This algorithm is an extension
    of an already defined and proven algorithm used for DHCPv4, as described in RFC
    3074.</p>"
