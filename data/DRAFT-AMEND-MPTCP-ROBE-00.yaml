abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath TCP extends the plain, singlepath limited, TCP towards
    the\n   capability of multipath transmission.  This greatly improves the\n   reliability
    and performance of TCP communication.  For backwards\n   compatiblity reason the
    Multipath TCP was designed to setup\n   successfully an inital path first, after
    which subsequent paths can\n   be added for multipath transmission.  For that
    reason the Multipath\n   TCP has the same limitations as the plain TCP during
    connection\n   setup, in case the selected path is not functional.\n\n   RobE
    provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths for\n   connection setup.
    \ This document presents with RobE a set of\n   extensions to Multipath TCP to
    overcome its singlepath limitation\n   during connection initialisation and extends
    it to a full fledged\n   multipath protocol.  RobE ensures connecitivity if at
    least one\n   functional path out of a bunch of paths is given and offers beside\n
    \  that the opportunity to significantly improve loading times of\n   Internet
    services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
