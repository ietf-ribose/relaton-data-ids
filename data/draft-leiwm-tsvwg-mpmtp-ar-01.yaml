abstract:
  content: "<p>Multipath transmission is an important way to improve the quality of
    service for message transport. This document defines a multipath message transmission
    protocol, which is a special application profile of multipath transport protocol
    suite defined in Multipath Transport System Based on Application-level Relay (MPTS-AR).
    Apart from behaviors of user agent defined in MPTS-AR, user agent should be also
    responsible for message reliable transmission,including connective session establishment,
    sequenced deliver, select acknowledgement, retransmission, recombination and congestion
    avoidance, etc. This document describes those new or changed behaviors, and expands
    the MPTP format to meet them.Moreover this document illustrates the details of
    multipath transmission mechanism reference to the reliable transmission characteristics.</p>"
