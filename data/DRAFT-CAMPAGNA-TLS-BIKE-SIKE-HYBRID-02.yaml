abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Hybrid key exchange refers to executing two independent key
    exchanges\n   and feeding the two resulting shared secrets into a Pseudo Random\n
    \  Function (PRF), with the goal of deriving a secret which is as secure\n   as
    the stronger of the two key exchanges.  This document describes\n   new hybrid
    key exchange schemes for the Transport Layer Security 1.2\n   (TLS) protocol.
    \ The key exchange schemes are based on combining\n   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
    (ECDH) with a post-quantum key\n   encapsulation method (PQ KEM) using the existing
    TLS PRF.  In\n   particular, this document specifies the use of the Bit Flipping
    Key\n   Exchange (BIKE) and Supersingular Isogeny Key Exchange (SIKE) schemes\n
    \  in combination with ECDHE as a hybrid key agreement in a TLS 1.2\n   handshake.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
