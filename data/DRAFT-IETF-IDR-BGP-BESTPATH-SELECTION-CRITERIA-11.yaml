abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP specification prescribes 'BGP next-hop reachability' as
    one\n   of the key 'Route Resolvability Condition' that must be satisfied\n   before
    the BGP bestpath candidate selection. This condition,\n   however, may not be
    sufficient (as explained in the Appendix\n   section) and would desire further
    granularity.\n\n   This document defines enhances the \"Route Resolvability Condition\"\n
    \  to facilitate the next-hop to be resolved in the chosen data plane.\n\n\n\n\t
