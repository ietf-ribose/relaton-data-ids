abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes a simple out-of-band protocol to ease setup of
    the RPKI provisioning and publication protocols between two parties. The protocol
    is encoded in a small number of XML messages, which can be passed back and forth
    by any mutually agreeable means which provides acceptable data integrity and authentication.
    This setup protocol is not part of the provisioning or publication protocol, rather,
    it is intended to simplify configuration of these protocols by setting up relationships
    and exchanging keying material used to authenticate those relationships.</p>"
