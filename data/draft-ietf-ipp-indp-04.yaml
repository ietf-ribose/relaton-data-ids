abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPP event notification specification [ipp-ntfy] is an OPTIONAL
    extension to IPP/1.0, IPP/1.1, and future versions. [ipp-ntfy] which enables IPP
    clients to request notification of printer and job events. The IPP notification
    extension gives IPP Printers the flexibility to choose how many Subscriptions
    objects (individual requests for notification), what delivery methods, and what
    natural languages to support, among others. In practice, it's the working environment
    where an IPP Printer is deployed what ultimately dictates the notification requirements
    for that printer. Notification Delivery Services exist to help event producers,
    such as IPP Printers, meet the varying notification needs of disparate environments.
    Specifically, an IPP Notification Delivery Service may extend the notification
    capabilities of IPP Printers and help customize the type of notification required
    in a highly specialized environment. This documents defines the IPP Notification
    Delivery Protocol (INDP), a protocol for IPP Printers to communicate with Notification
    Delivery Services using 'application/ipp' as the encoding mechanism and HTTP as
    the transport. The definition of INDP lends itself nicely for use by IPP Printers
    and Notification Delivery Services for dispatching IPP Notifications to Notification
    Recipients as well.</p>"
