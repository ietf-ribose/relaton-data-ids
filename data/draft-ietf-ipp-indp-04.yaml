abstract:
  content: "<p>The IPP event notification specification [ipp-ntfy] is an OPTIONALextension
    to IPP/1.0, IPP/1.1, and future versions. [ipp-ntfy] whichenables IPP clients
    to request notification of printer and job events.The IPP notification extension
    gives IPP Printers the flexibility tochoose how many Subscriptions objects (individual
    requests fornotification), what delivery methods, and what natural languages tosupport,
    among others. In practice, it's the working environment wherean IPP Printer is
    deployed what ultimately dictates the notificationrequirements for that printer.
    Notification Delivery Services exist tohelp event producers, such as IPP Printers,
    meet the varyingnotification needs of disparate environments. Specifically, an
    IPPNotification Delivery Service may extend the notification capabilitiesof IPP
    Printers and help customize the type of notification required ina highly specialized
    environment. This documents defines the IPPNotification Delivery Protocol (INDP),
    a protocol for IPP Printers tocommunicate with Notification Delivery Services
    using 'application/ipp'as the encoding mechanism and HTTP as the transport. The
    definition ofINDP lends itself nicely for use by IPP Printers and NotificationDelivery
    Services for dispatching IPP Notifications to NotificationRecipients as well.</p>"
