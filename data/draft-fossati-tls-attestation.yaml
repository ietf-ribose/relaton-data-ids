abstract:
- content: "<p>Various attestation technologies have been developed and formats have
    been standardized. Examples include the Entity Attestation Token (EAT) and Trusted
    Platform Modules (TPMs). Once attestation information has been produced on a device
    it needs to be communicated to a relying party. This information exchange may
    happen at different layers in the protocol stack. This specification provides
    a generic way of passing attestation information in the TLS handshake.</p>"
