abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents necessary clarifications and corrections concerning
    features related to the use of location-related attributes in NFSv4.1. These include
    migration, which transfers responsibility for a file system from one server to
    another, and trunking which deals with the discovery and control of the set of
    network addresses to use to access a file system. This document updates RFC5661.</p>"
