abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an extension to IP Flow Information \n\n
    \ eXport (IPFIX) protocol specification in [RFC5101] and the IPFIX \n\n  information
    model specified in [RFC5102] to support hierarchical \n\n  structured data and
    lists (sequences) of Information Elements in \n\n  data records.  This extension
    allows definition of complex data \n\n  structures such as variable-length lists
    and specification of \n\n  hierarchical containment relationships between Templates.
    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Conventions used in this document \n\n\n  The key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL \n\n  NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD
    NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \n\n  \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to
