abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>      This document describes the problems associated with the
    accumulation\n   of TCP TIME_WAIT states at a network server, such as a web server,\n
    \  and details two methods for avoiding that accumulation.  Servers that\n   have
    many TCP connections in TIME_WAIT state experience performance\n   degradation,
    and can collapse.  One solution is a TCP modification\n   that causes clients
    to enter TIME_WAIT state rather than servers.\n   The other is an HTTP modification
    that allows the client to close the\n   transport connection, maintaining the
    TIME_WAIT state at the client.\n   The goal of both approaches is ensure that
    TIME_WAIT states accumu-\n   late at the less loaded endpoint.\n\n   The document
    also presents initial performance data from reference\n   implementations of these
    solutions, which suggest that the modifica-\n   tions improve HTTP connection
    rates at the server by as much as 50%,\n   and allow servers to operate at small
    transaction throughputs that\n   they cannot sustain their default configuration.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
