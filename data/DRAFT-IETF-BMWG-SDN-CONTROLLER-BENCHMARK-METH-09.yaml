abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines methodologies for benchmarking the control-plane
    performance of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) Controllers.  The SDN Controller
    is a core component in the SDN architecture that controls the behavior of the
    network.  SDN Controllers have been implemented with many varying designs in order
    to achieve their intended network functionality.  Hence, the authors of this document
    have taken the approach of considering an SDN Controller to be a black box, defining
    the methodology in a manner that is agnostic to protocols and network services
    supported by controllers.  This document provides a method for measuring the performance
    of all controller implementations.\n\t </p>\n      "
