abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Sieve defines an email filtering language that can, in principle,
    plug into any point in the processing of an email message.  As defined in the
    base specification, it plugs into mail delivery.  This document defines how Sieve
    can plug into points in IMAP where messages are created or changed, adding the
    option of user-defined or installation-defined filtering (or, with Sieve extensions,
    features such as notifications).  Because this requires future Sieve extensions
    to specify their interactions with this one, this document updates the base Sieve
    specification, RFC 5228. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t </p>\n      "
