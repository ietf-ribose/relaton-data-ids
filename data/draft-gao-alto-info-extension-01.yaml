abstract:
- content: <p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol enables the
    distribution of certain network information to applications. Hence, a fundamental
    functionality of an ALTO server is to collect general network information, especially
    from multiple "information sources". In this document, we propose a preliminary
    solution to standardize the process of information collection for ALTO servers
    by extending the ALTO protocol with some new services, which can also serve as
    a unified approach of network information distribution.</p>
