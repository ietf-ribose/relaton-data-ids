abstract:
  content: "\t <t>As emerging real-time services on the Internet, such as Voice over
    IP(VoIP), increase their visibility, a security framework has to beprovided. In
    particular, confidentiality is a main concern in themultimedia scenario.To support
    full flexibility of the services, a solution with IP allthe way (to the terminal)
    is believed to offer advantages, iftechnically and economically feasible. Therefore,
    new requirementshave to be met on cellular access networks, and this has an impact
    onthe security solutions.</p>"
