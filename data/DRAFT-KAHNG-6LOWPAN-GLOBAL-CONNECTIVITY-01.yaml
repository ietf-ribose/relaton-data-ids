abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the translation mechanism mapping IPv6\n
    \  address with 128 bits to the Adaptation Identifier (AID) with 16 bits.\n   When
    a device in IEEE 802.15.4 domain needs to communicate with other\n   nodes in
    IPv6 domain, it should acquire source AID and destination\n   AID corresponding
    to source IPv6 address and destination IPv6 address,\n   respectively from an
    IPv6 translation-capable gateway. The node will\n   send packets using these AIDs
    to the gateway, and then the gateway\n   will translate them to normal IPv6 addresses
    using the mapping table\n   already associated.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
