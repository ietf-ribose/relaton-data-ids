abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as pieces
    of information or server processes, which are available in several equivalent
    replicas on different hosts. This includes, but is not limited to, peer-to-peer
    file sharing applications. The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications, which have to select one or several
    hosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired resource. This
    guidance shall be based on parameters that affect performance and efficiency of
    the data transmission between the hosts, e.g., the topological distance. The ultimate
    goal is to improve performance (or Quality of Experience) in the application while
    reducing resource consumption in the underlying network infrastructure. This document
    enumerates requirements for ALTO, which should be considered when specifying,
    assessing, or comparing protocols and implementations, and it solicits feedback
    and discussion.</p>"
