abstract:
  content: "<p>Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such aspieces
    of information or server processes, which are available inseveral equivalent replicas
    on different hosts. This includes, butis not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing
    applications. The goalof Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provideguidance
    to applications, which have to select one or several hostsfrom a set of candidates,
    that are able to provide a desiredresource. This guidance shall be based on parameters
    that affectperformance and efficiency of the data transmission between thehosts,
    e.g., the topological distance. The ultimate goal is toimprove performance (or
    Quality of Experience) in the applicationwhile reducing resource consumption in
    the underlying networkinfrastructure.This document enumerates requirements for
    ALTO, which should beconsidered when specifying, assessing, or comparing protocols
    andimplementations, and it solicits feedback and discussion.</p>"
