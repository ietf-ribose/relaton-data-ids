abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a Fast Reroute (FRR) approach aimed at providing
    link and node protection of node and adjacency segments within the Segment Routing
    (SR) framework. This FRR behavior builds on Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT) FRR
    algorithm [I-D.atlas-rtgwg- mrt-mc-arch]. Fast-Reroute with Maximally Redundant
    Trees (MRT-FRR) using Segment routing is a technology that gives link-protection
    and node- protection with 100% coverage in any network topology that is still
    connected after the failure. MRT is computational efficient. For any router in
    the network, the MRT computation is less than the LFA computation for a node with
    three or more neighbors in SR domain (Ex: Topology Independent Fast Reroute).</p>"
