abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines the Security Event Token, which
    may be\n   distributed via a protocol such as HTTP.  The Security Event Token\n
    \  (SET) specification profiles the JSON Web Token (JWT), which can be\n   optionally
    signed and/or encrypted.  A SET describes a statement of\n   fact from the perspective
    of an issuer that it intends to share with\n   one or more receivers.\n\n\t </p>\n
