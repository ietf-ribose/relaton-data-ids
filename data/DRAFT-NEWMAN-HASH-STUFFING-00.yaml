abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Test engineers take pains to declare all factors that affect
    a given\n   measurement, including offered load, packet length, test duration,\n
    \  and traffic orientation.  However, current benchmarking practice\n   overlooks
    two factors that have a profound impact on test results.\n   First, existing methodologies
    do not require the reporting of\n   addresses or other test traffic contents,
    even though these fields\n   can affect test results.  Second, \"stuff\" bits
    and bytes inserted in\n   test traffic by some link-layer technologies add significant
    and\n   variable overhead, which in turn affects test results.  This document\n
    \  describes the effects of these factors; recommends guidelines for\n   test
    traffic contents; and offers formulas for determining the\n   probability of bit-
    and byte-stuffing in test traffic.\n\t </p>\n      "
