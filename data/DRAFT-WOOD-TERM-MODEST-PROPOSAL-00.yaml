abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Certain established and longstanding terms of art, used as
    technical\n   terminology, are now considered contentious and can be considered\n
    \  harmful when used in discussion, in debate, and in reading,\n   following,
    accepting the authority of, and complying with, existing\n   technical documentation
    that unfortunately uses those terms that were\n   not considered to be at all
    contentious, but clear and entirely\n   uncontroversial normal use, when that
    technical documentation was\n   originally authored or published.  The use of
    such now-deplorable\n   terms of art should be deprecated, and those terms should
    ideally be\n   replaced with approved, accepted, more effective, inoffensive terms\n
    \  of art wherever possible.  Any new use of those original terms must\n   be
    carefully considered and fully justified before that use is agreed\n   by consensus
    and submitted for careful approval in documents.\n   Recommended replacement substitute
    terms should be considered for\n   inclusion instead.  A process for identifying
    and recommending\n   replacements to those harmful terms is outlined here.\n\n\t
