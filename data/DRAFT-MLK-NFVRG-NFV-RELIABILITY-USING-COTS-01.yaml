abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft discusses the results of a recent study on the feasibility\n
    \  of using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware for virtualized\n   network
    functions in telecom equipment.  In particular, it explores\n   the conditions
    under which the COTS hardware can be used in the NFV\n   (Network Function Virtualization)
    environment.  The concept of silent\n   error probability is introduced in order
    to take software error or\n   undetectable hardware failures into account.  The
    silent error\n   probability is included in both the theoretical work and the\n
    \  simulation work.  It is difficult to theoretically analyze the impact\n   of
    site maintenance and site failure events.  Therefore, simulation\n   is used for
    evaluating the impact of these site management related\n   events which constitute
    the undesirable feature of using COTS\n   hardware in telecom environment.\n\n\t
