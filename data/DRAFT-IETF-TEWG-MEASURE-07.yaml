abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this document, we identify requirements for supporting the
    \ntraffic engineering of IP networks.  Requirements for traffic \nmeasurement
    in service provider environments are presented and \njustified, and related issues
    are discussed. \nHighlights of requirements are: \n1. To aid network dimensioning,
    mechanisms to collect node-pair-\nbased traffic data are required to facilitate
    the derivation of per-\nservice-class traffic matrix statistics.  \n2. For service
    assurance, the use of higher-order statistics is \nrequired. \n3. To preserve
    representative traffic detail at manageable sample \nvolumes, packet-sampled measurements
    are required. \n4. To manage large volumes of measured data, use of bulk transfer
    \nand filtering/aggregation mechanisms are required.\n\t </p>\n      "
