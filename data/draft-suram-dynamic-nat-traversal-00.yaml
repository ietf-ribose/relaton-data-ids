abstract:
- content: "<p>NAT can be enabled on a Security Gateway by administrator at any point
    of time. This can be called as Dynamic NAT. The existing IKEv2 RFC does not address
    the scenario of NAT being enabled on a security gateway after IKEv2 negotiation.
    In such a scenario, traffic sent over the IPsec SA will either be dropped or does
    not reach the peer security gateway. This document defines a method to ensure
    that IPsec traffic flow seamlessly in such a scenario.</p>"
