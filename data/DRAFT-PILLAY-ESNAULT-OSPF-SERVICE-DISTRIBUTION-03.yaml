abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol is used to carry
    data on\n   behalf of other services using the Opaque Link State Advertisements.\n
    \  The protocol's flooding mechanism is well suited to cover the data\n   propagation
    requirements of services such as Traffic Engineering.\n   However, the current
    mechanism cannot scale for a large number of\n   services nor satisfy some of
    their new set of requirements.  This\n   document describes a new mechanism in
    OSPF to support service and\n   data distribution for a large number of services,
    computation of\n   preferred service access points and a controlled service data\n
    \  exchange.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
