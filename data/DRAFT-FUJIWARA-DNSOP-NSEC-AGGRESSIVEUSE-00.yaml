abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS highly depends on cache, however, cache usage of non-existence\n
    \  information was limited to exact matching.  This draft proposes the\n   aggressive
    use of NSEC/NSEC3 resource record, which is able to\n   express non-existence
    of range of names authoritatively.  With this\n   proposal, shorter latency to
    many of negative response is expected as\n   well as some level of mitigation
    of random sub-domain attacks\n   (referred to as \"Water Torture\" attacks).  And
    more, non-existent TLD\n   queries to Root DNS servers will decrease.\n\n\t </p>\n
