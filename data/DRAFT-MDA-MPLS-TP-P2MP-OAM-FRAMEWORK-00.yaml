abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized
    to enable\n   carrier-grade packet transport.\n\n   This document discusses and
    specifies the P2MP framework primarily\n   related to OAM and related management
    in MPLS-TP networks. This\n   document mainly refers to RFC5654 and RFC6371. The
    main focus is on\n   the details that are not covered or not clarified in relevant
    RFCs\n   such as RFC5654, RFC5860, RFC5921, RFC5951, RFC6371, andRFC7167.\n\n
    \  Note: This I-D was made and updated including the discussions in\n   ITU-T
    SG15, which were described in Liaison Statements such as\n   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1235/)\n\n
    \  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task\n   Force (IETF)
    / International Telecommunications Union\n   Telecommunications Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include\n   an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF
    MPLS and PWE3\n   architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
    of a\n   packet transport network.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
