abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Vendors of consumer electronics and network gear have produced
    and\nsold hundreds of thousands of Internet hosts with globally routable\nInternet
    Protocol addresses embedded within their products' firmware.\nThese products are
    now in operation world-wide and primarily include,\nbut are not necessarily limited
    to, low-cost routers and middleboxes\nfor personal or residential use.\n\nThis
    'hard-coding' of globally routable IP addresses within the\nhost's firmware presents
    significant problems to the operation of the\nInternet and to the management of
    its address space.\n\nThis document means to clarify best current practices in
    the Internet\ncommunity.  It denouces the practice of embedding references to\nunique,
    globally routable IP addresses in Internet hosts, describes\nsome of the resulting
    problems, and considers selected alternatives.\nIt is also intended to remind
    the Internet community of the ephemeral\nnature of unique, globally routable IP
    addresses and that the\nassignment and use of such addresses is temporary and
    therefore\nshould not be used in fixed configurations.\n\t </p>\n      "
