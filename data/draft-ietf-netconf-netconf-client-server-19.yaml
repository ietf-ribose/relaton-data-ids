abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines two YANG modules, one module to configure a NETCONF
    client and the other module to configure a NETCONF server. Both modules support
    both the SSH and TLS transport protocols, and support both standard NETCONF and
    NETCONF Call Home connections. Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor) This
    draft contains placeholder values that need to be replaced with finalized values

    Reviewers (To be removed by RFC Editor) This document presents a YANG module or
    modules that is/are part of a collection of drafts that work together to produce
    the ultimate goal of the NETCONF WG: to define configuration modules for NETCONF
    client and servers, and RESTCONF client and servers. The relationship between
    the various drafts in the collection is presented in the below diagram. crypto-types
