    thanks to rapid development of wireless technology and de facto Mobile IP technology
    [1]. Mobile IP, as originally specified, defines the protocol enhancements that
    can provide IP mobility over the Internet. The mobile node, identified by its
    Home Address regardless its attaching point can have transparent routing of IP
    datagrams. However, the need for the user mobility support has identified by many
    wireless operators so as to keep up with nowadays competitive wireless mobile
    industry. The IP user mobility is as this document defines that the ability of
    end user to send and receive IP datagrams regardless of mobile terminal and current
    location. This document specify the definition of the user mobility, the merits
    of IP User Mobility, and finally provide IP user mobility support model.</p>"
