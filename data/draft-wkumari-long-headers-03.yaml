abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies requirements for IPv6 forwarders as they process
    packets with long header chains. It also provides guidance for application developers
    whose applications might rely on long headers chains. As background, this memo
    explains how many ASIC-based IPv6 forwarders process packets and why processing
    of packets with long header chains might be problematic.</p>"
