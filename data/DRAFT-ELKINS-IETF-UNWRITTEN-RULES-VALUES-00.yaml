abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The intent of this document is to speed up the process by which\n
    \  someone new to the IETF,  can understand the objectives, fathom the\n   environment,
    comprehend the culture, learn to navigate the problems,\n   overcome the obstacles,
    and become a more productive IETF\n   participant, in a shorter amount of time.
    Further, this document is\n   intended to pass along the learning and experiences
    of people who\n   have absorbed these values,  perhaps in a much longer amount
    of time\n   and with much greater effort and even hardship.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
