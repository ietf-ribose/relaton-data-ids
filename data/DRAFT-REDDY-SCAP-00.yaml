abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Distributed calendaring is gradually becoming more demanding than\n
    \  standalone calendaring and scheduling. The use of calendaring and\n   scheduling
    has grown exponentially  and enterprise and inter-\n   enterprise business has
    become so dependent on group scheudling\n   applications. But there is no Internet
    standard to provide\n   interoperability among various calendaring applications.\n
    \  Consequently, user need to install different conduit programs to\n   access
    these calendaring stores. This memo proposes a HTTP based\n   simple calendaring
    access protocol which allows web, email and any\n   HTTP compliant clients to
    access and manipulate calendar store.\n \n   The motivation for this proposal
    is the expanded scope and diversity\n   of the World Wide Web. The World Wide
    Web provides a simple and\n   effective means for users to search, browse, retrieve,
    and publish\n   information of their own available for others. Now that Web browsers\n
    \  and servers are ubiquitous on the Internet, it is worthwhile to use\n   HTTP
    as transport protocol and XML to encode calendar objects. The\n   power and extensibility
    of XML allows us to represent calendar data\n   objects as well-formed XML documents.\n
    \n   Simple Calendar Access Protocol(SCAP) allows exchanging calendaring\n   information
    between scheduling systems using the Hypertext Transfer\n   Protocol (HTTP). This
    allows users to schedule meetings with anyone\n   else, no matter what scheduling
    software they use.\n \n   This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and
    content-types\n   ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of calender properties,\n
    \  creation and management of calendar objects, and namespace\n   manipulation.\n\t
