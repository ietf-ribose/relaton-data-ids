abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The application layer of the internet is inherently insecure.
    \ This\npaper proposes a security solution, a modular apporach to separation\nwhere
    that separation provides alternative functionality to the\nlimits imposed by the
    solution, and dynamic protocol switching within\na given session.\n\t </p>\n      "
