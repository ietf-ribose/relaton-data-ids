abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Open Shortest Path First stub neighbor is an enhancement to
    the\n   protocol to support large scale of neighbors in some topologies with\n
    \  improved convergence behavior.  It introduces limited changes\n   protocol
    behavior to implement a scalable solution for hub and spoke\n   topologies by
    limiting the functionality changes to the hub.  The\n   concepts are also applicable
    to a host running in a virtual machine\n   environment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
