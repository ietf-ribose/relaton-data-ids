abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC3552/BCP72 describes an Internet Threat model that has been
    used\n   in Internet protocol design. More than seventeen years have passed\n
    \  since RFC3552 was written and the structure and topology of the\n   Internet
    have changed. With those changes comes a question: has the\n   Internet Threat
    Model changed? Or, is the model described in RFC3552\n   still mostly accurate?
    \ This draft attempts to describe a non-\n   exhaustive list of changes in the
    current threat environment. It\n   finds that there are both qualitative and quantitative
    differences\n   from the environment described in RFC3552 and is intended as input\n
    \  to the IAB program on the Internet threat model started in 2020.\n\n\t </p>\n
