abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An HTTP \"Nice\" header field is defined.  \"Nice\" marks a
    request as\n   low priority.  Gateways can choose to discard or delay the request,\n
    \  or provide a response from cache rather than forwarding it to an\n   origin
    server.  This enables constrained origin servers, such as\n   those that rely
    on battery power, to avoid expending limited\n   resources on serving requests.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
