abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering provides
    support\n   for the communication of exclusion information during label switched\n
    \  path (LSP) setup. This document specifies two new diversity\n   subobjects
    for the RSVP XRO and EXRS subobjects. Three different\n   mechanisms are supported
    how LSP diversity can be accomplished in\n   the provider or core network: the
    signaled diversity type, indicates\n   whether diversity is based on client, path
    computation engine (PCE),\n   or network assigned identifiers.\n   The solution
    described in this document is based on the assumption\n   that LSPs are requested
    sequentially, i.e., the time period between\n   the LSP setup requests for the
    two LSPs may be longer (days, weeks,\n   months). Re-routing the first LSP that
    may have existed for a longer\n   period of time is not considered.\n\n   \n\t
