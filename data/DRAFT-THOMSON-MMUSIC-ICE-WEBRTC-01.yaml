abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) has been selected
    as the\n   basis for establishing peer-to-peer UDP flows between Web Real-Time\n
    \  Communication (WebRTC) clients.  Using an unmodified ICE\n   implementation
    in this context enables the use of the web platform as\n   a denial of service
    platform.  The risks and complications arising\n   from this choice are discussed.
    \ A modified algorithm for sending ICE\n   connectivity checks from the web platform
    is described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
