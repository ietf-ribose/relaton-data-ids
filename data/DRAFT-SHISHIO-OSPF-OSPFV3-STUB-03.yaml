abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>OSPFv3 accommodates for the possibility to indicate through the
    R-bit\nif a router is an active router and should be taken into\nconsideration
    as a transit device.  Another method available is the\nv6-bit indicating if a
    router or link should be excluded from IPv6\nrouting calculations.\n\nA direct
    result is that OSPFv3 has \"no transit capability\"\npotentially based upon the
    setting of R-bit and V6-bit, unlike the\nstub OSPFv2 router functionality.  This
    feature proposal has as\npurpose to re-introduce existing OSPFv2 stub router behavior
    into\nOSPFv3 to keep the operational service provider experience used to\ndeploy,
    troubleshoot and be familiar with OSPFv2 stub routing.\n\nOSPFv3 has similar metric
    field information field of all of LSAs,\nwith exception of the Link-LSA, so RFC3137
    method can be re-utilized\nin OSPFv3.\n\nTo drive consistency between OSPFv2 and
    OSPFv3, there should be next\nto supporting both R-bit and v6-bit be support for\"max-metric\".\n\t
