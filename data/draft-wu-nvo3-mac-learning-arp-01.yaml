abstract:
- content: "<p>[I.D-ietf-nvo3-framework] discusses using Dynamic data plane learning
    or control plane protocol to build and maintain the mapping tables and deliver
    encapsulated packets to their proper destination. However, there is no relevant
    work to discuss how those capabilities can be realized in details at the NVEs.
    This document goes into details to discuss how MAC address learning works through
    data plane and control plane.</p>"
