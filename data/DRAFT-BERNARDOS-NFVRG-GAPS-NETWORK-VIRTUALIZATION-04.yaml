abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The main goal of this document is to serve as a survey of the\n
    \  different efforts that have been taken and are currently taking place\n   at
    IETF and IRTF in regards to network virtualization, automation and\n   orchestration,
    putting them into context considering efforts by other\n   SDOs, and identifying
    current gaps and challenges that can be tackled\n   at IETF or researched at the
    IRTF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
