abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft considers a packet distribution scheme for bandwidth\n
    \  aggregation on the mobile network with a multi-interfaced router\n   (MIR).
    In the proposed scheme, the MIR with multiple heterogeneous\n   wireless network
    interfaces effectively and fairly distributes\n   packets over end-to-end multi-path
    through multiple network\n   interfaces. Each network interface is considered
    to have a\n   distribution counter associated with corresponding end-to-end path.\n
    \  This distribution counter varied by both weighted capacity and\n   distributed
    packets is used to determine if a network interface has\n   enough credits to
    distribute incoming packets on corresponding\n   end-to-end path. As a useful
    design parameter, the capacity unit can\n   be shown to make the performance of
    the proposed scheme as good as\n   possible.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
