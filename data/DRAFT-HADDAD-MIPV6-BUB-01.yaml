abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IPv6 [1] defines two different modes to handle the \nmobility
    problem (i.e., mobile node moving accross different \nnetworks and changing its
    IP address). The two modes had been \nmainly designed for scenarios involving
    one mobile node and \none static node (correspondent node). This document answers
    \nissues related to scenarios involving two mobile nodes (i.e., \nthe correspodent
    node is also a mobile node). The document \naddresses also the double jumping
    problem where two mobile nodes \nmove at the same time (i.e., switch to new subnets).\nThe
    document proposes a new mode called 'BUB' (Binding Update \nBackhauling) allowing
    a more secure, reliable and optimized \nexchange of Binding Updates (BUs) between
    two mobile endpoints.\n\t </p>\n      "
