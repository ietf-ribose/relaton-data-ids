abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internet Service Providers (operators) are facing problems where\nlocalized
    congestion prevents full utilization of the path between\nsender and receiver
    at today's \"broadband\" speeds.  Operators desire\nto control this congestion,
    which often appears to be caused by a\nsmall number of users consuming a large
    amount of bandwidth.\nBuilding out more capacity along all of the path to handle
    this\ncongestion can be expensive and may not result in improvements for\nall
    users so network operators have sought other ways to manage\ncongestion.  The
    current mechanisms all suffer from difficulty\nmeasuring the congestion (as distinguished
    from the total traffic).\n\nThe ConEx Working Group is designing a mechanism to
    make congestion\nalong any path visible at the Internet Layer.  This document\ndescribes
    example cases where this mechanism would be useful.\n\t </p>\n      "
