abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects
    to\n   Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different\n
    \  domains, the current trend is to develop a unified de-fragmented IoT\n   platform
    so that objects can be made accessible to applications\n   across organizations
    and domains.  Towards this goal, quite a few\n   proposals have been made to build
    a unified IoT platform as an\n   overlay on top of today's Internet.  Such overlay
    solutions, however,\n   are inadequate to address the important challenges posed
    by a unified\n   IoT system, especially in terms of mobility, scalability, and\n
    \  communication reliability, due to the inherent inefficiencies of the\n   current
    Internet.  To address this problem, we propose to build a\n   unified IoT platform
    based on the Information Centric Network (ICN)\n   architecture, which we call
    ICN-IoT [20].  ICN-IoT leverages the\n   salient features of ICN, and thus provides
    seamless device-to-device\n   (D2D) communication, mobility support, scalability,
    and efficient\n   content and service delivery leveraging in-network computing,
    caching\n   and storage.\n\n   This draft begins by motivating the need for an
    unified ICN-IoT\n   platform to connect heterogenous IoT systems.  We then propose
    an\n   ICN-IoT system architecture and middleware components which includes\n
    \  device/network-service discovery, naming service, IoT service\n   discovery,
    contextual processing, pub/sub management to support\n   efficient naming, data
    discovery, data processing and data\n   distribution.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
