abstract:
- content: "<p>Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs) based on Frame Relay or ATM
    circuits have been around a long time; more recently, Ethernet VPNs, including
    Virtual Private LAN Service, have become popular. Traditional L2VPNs often required
    a separate Service Provider infrastructure for each type, and yet another for
    the Internet and IP VPNs. In addition, L2VPN provisioning was cumbersome. This
    document presents a new approach to the problem of offering L2VPN services where
    the L2VPN customer's experience is virtually identical to that offered by traditional
    Layer 2 VPNs, but such that a Service Provider can maintain a single network for
    L2VPNs, IP VPNs and the Internet, as well as a common provisioning methodology
    for all services.</p>"
