abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet mail suffers from the fact that much unwanted mail
    is sent\n   using spoofed addresses -- 'spoofed' in this case means the address\n
    \  is used without the permission of the domain owner.  This document\n   describes
    the following:  mechanisms by which a domain owner can\n   publish its set of
    outgoing MTAs, mechanisms by which SMTP servers\n   can determine what email address
    is allegedly responsible for most\n   proximately introducing a message into the
    Internet mail system, and\n   whether that introduction is authorized by the owner
    of the domain\n   contained in that email address.\n\n   The specification is
    carefully tailored to ensure that the\n   overwhelming majority of legitimate
    emailers, remailers and mailing\n   list operators are already compliant.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
