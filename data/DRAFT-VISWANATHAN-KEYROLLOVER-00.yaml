abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo discusses the authentication for routing and management\n
    \  protocols based on preconfigured keys,the need and basis for key\n   rollover,
    and an mechanism to seamlessly rollover the authentication\n   keys.  It is intended
    for an application where secure administrative\n   access to all the end-points
    of the protocol connection is normally\n   available.\n\n   The strategy described
    herein improves upon the current practice\n   where a key is preconifigured at
    all endpoints and the key rollover\n   is done manually within a short synchronized
    window to avoid\n   connection drops due to key mismatch.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
