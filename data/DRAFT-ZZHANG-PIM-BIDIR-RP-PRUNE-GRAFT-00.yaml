abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a BIDIR-PIM network, data packets could be forwarded from
    the\n   source to the RP and then get dropped there because there is no\n   receiver
    on the other side of the distribution tree.  This document\n   specifies a way
    to prune the unnecessary traffic with minimum\n   additional states and procedures.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
