abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF TRILL protocol provides optimal pair-wise data forwarding\nwithout
    configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of\ntemporary loops, and support
    for multipathing of both unicast and\nmulticast traffic. TRILL accomplishes this
    by using IS-IS link state\nrouting and by encapsulating traffic using a header
    that includes a\nhop count. Devices that implement TRILL are called RBridges.\n\nTRILL
    supports multi-access LAN links that can have multiple end\nstations and RBridges
    attached. Where multiple RBridges are attached\nto a link, native traffic to and
    from end stations on that link is\nhandled by a subset of those RBridges called
    Appointed Forwarders,\nwith the intent that native traffic in each VLAN be handled
    by at\nmost one RBridge.  The purpose of this document is to improve the\ndocumentation
    of the Appointed Forwarder mechanism.\n\t </p>\n      "
