abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EAP-pwd is an EAP method that uses a shared password for\n
    \  authentication using a technique that is resistant to dictionary\n   attack.
    \ It included support for raw keys and RFC2751-style double\n   hashing of a password
    but did not include support for salted\n   passwords.  There are many existing
    databases of salted passwords and\n   it is desirable to allow their use with
    EAP-pwd.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
