abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiple Interface Nodes (MIF Nodes) may use their Multiple Interfaces
    to perform Mobility, Multihoming. Then, these MIF Nodes may also manage traffic
    between these Multiple Interfaces. Because IPsec has not been designed for Multiple
    Interfaces, MIF Nodes have difficulties to benefit from MIF features with IPsec
    protected communications. This document provides use cases where IPsec protected
    communications would take advantage of MIF features. From these uses cases, we
    identify the different IPsec features MIF Nodes would require. Then, we expose
    the limitations of the IPsec related protocols IKEv2 and MOBIKE regarding to these
    MIF features before listing the MIF IPsec Security Requirements that should be
    address by a extension of IKEv2 or MOBIKE.</p>"
