abstract:
- content: "<p>This memoy defines the Accept-Any option, which provides a more flexible
    content negotiation than the one originally specified for the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) in [RFC7252]. As this is particularly useful with but ruled out
    in CoAP observation ([RFC7641]), that is updated to allow it.</p>"
