abstract:
- content: "<p>The Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) problem
    statement describes a problem that needs to be addressed before a wireless LAN
    (WLAN) network designer can construct a solution composed of Wireless Termination
    Points (WTP) and Access Controllers (AC) from multiple, different vendors. One
    of the primary goals is to find a solution that solves the interoperability between
    the two classes of devices (WTPs and ACs) that then enables an AC from one vendor
    to control and manage a WTP from another. In this document, we present a protocol
    that forms the common technology-independent framework and the ability to negotiate
    and add, on top of this framework, a control protocol that contains a technology-dependent
    component to arrive at a complete solution. We have also presented two such control
    protocols -- an 802.11 Control protocol, and another, more generic image download
    protocol, in this document. Even though the text in this document is written to
    specifically address the problem stated in RFC 3990, the solution can be applied
    to any problem that has a controller (equivalent to the AC) managing one or more
    network elements (equivalent to the WTP). This document defines a Historic Document
    for the Internet community.</p>"
