abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS traceroute implementations validate dataplane connectivity and
    isolate faults by sending messages along every end-to-end Label Switched Path
    (LSP) combination between a source and a destination node. This requires a growing
    number of path validations in networks with a high number of equal cost paths
    between origin and destination. Segment Routing (SR) introduces MPLS topology
    awareness combined with Source Routing. By this combination, SR can be used to
    implement an MPLS traceroute option lowering the total number of LSP validations
    as compared to commodity MPLS traceroute.</p>"
