abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  This document provides scalability extension to NAT-PT. The
    extension \n  is based on the use of DNS-ALG and exchange of load metrics amongst
    a\n  cluster of NAT-PT devices. We refer such a NAT-PT device as mNAT-PT. \n  mNAT-PT
    is valuable in connecting large V6 domains to legacy V4 \n  domain.  \n\t </p>\n
