abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document we consider and analyse the specific scenario
    of\n   IPv6 transition and deployment in a large department of a university\n
    \  campus network.  The department is large enough to operate its own\n   instances
    of all the conventional university services including (for\n   example) web, DNS,
    email, filestore, interactive logins, and remote\n   and wireless access.  The
    scenario is a dual-stack one, i.e.\n   transition to IPv6 means deploying IPv6
    in the first instance (and\n   probably for some time) alongside IPv4.  This analysis
    identifies the\n   available components for IPv6 transition, while validating
    the\n   applicability of the IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios informational\n
    \  text.  It focuses on the network and associated service elements of\n   the
    transition, rather than the application elements.\n\t </p>\n      "
