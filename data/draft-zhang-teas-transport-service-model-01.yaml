abstract:
- content: "<p>A transport network is a server-layer network designed to provide connectivity
    services for a client-layer network to carry the client traffic opaquely across
    the server-layer network resources. A transport network may be constructed from
    equipments utilizing any of a number of different transport technologies such
    as the evolving optical transport infrastructure (Synchronous Optical Networking
    (SONET) / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical Transport Network (OTN))
    or packet transport as epitomized by the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). This
    draft provides a transport service YANG model that can be used together with the
    RESTCONF protocol for a northbound client to initiate service requests toward
    the transport network controllers via the RESTful interface between them so as
    to enable automated service interations.</p>"
