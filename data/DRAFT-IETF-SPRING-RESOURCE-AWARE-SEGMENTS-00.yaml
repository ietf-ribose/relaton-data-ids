abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the mechanism to associate network
    resource\n   attributes to Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs).  Such SIDs are\n
    \  referred to as resource-aware SIDs in this document.  The resource-\n   aware
    SIDs retain their original forwarding semantics, but with the\n   additional semantics
    to identify the set of network resources\n   available for the packet processing
    action.  The resource-aware SIDs\n   can therefore be used to build SR paths or
    virtual networks with a\n   set of reserved network resources.  The proposed mechanism
    is\n   applicable to both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and\n
    \  segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
