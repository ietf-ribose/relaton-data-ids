abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses inter-domain WLAN handover management
    for \nmulti-homed mobile node (MN) in order to maintain Voice over IP \n(VoIP)
    quality during handover (HO). Switching a communication path \nfrom one Access
    Point (AP) to another in inter-domain WLANs is a \ncritical challenge for real-time
    applications such as VoIP because \ncommunication quality during HO is more likely
    to be deteriorated.\n\nTo maintain VoIP quality during HO, we need to solve many
    problems. In \nparticular, in bidirectional communication such as VoIP, an AP
    \nbecomes a bottleneck with the increase of VoIP calls. As a result, \npackets
    queued in the AP buffer may experience a large queuing\ndelay or packet losses
    due to increase in queue length or buffer\noverflow, thereby causing the degradation
    of VoIP quality for the MNs side.\nTo avoid this degradation, MNs need to appropriately
    and autonomously \nexecute HO in response to the changes in wireless network\ncondition,
    i.e., the deterioration of wireless link quality and the congestion  state at
    the AP. We then propose an HO management considering all of frame retries, AP
    queue length, and transmission rate at an MN for maintaining VoIP quality during
    HO. \n\t </p>\n      "
