abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The SIMPLE working group describes one or more messages sent\ncompletely
    independently as \"pager-mode\" messages, whereas messaging\nassociated with as
    part of a \"session\" with a definite start and end\nis called session mode messaging.
    \ The SIMPLE community has received\nnumerous comments and complaints from the
    larger IM community that\nsession mode is more complex than pager mode messaging.
    \ However,\nsession mode messaging has a number of benefits which are not\navailable
    in pager mode, but these benefits have not been widely\narticulated and this value
    is not well understood outside the SIP/\nSIMPLE community.  This document attempts
    to describe the benefits of\nsession mode, such as explicit rendezvous, integration
    with other\nmedia, direct client-to-client operation, and brokered privacy and\nsecurity,
    in an accessible manner.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
