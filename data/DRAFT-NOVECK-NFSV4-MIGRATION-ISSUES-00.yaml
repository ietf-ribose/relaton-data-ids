abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     RFC3530 described an fs_locations attribute which can be
    used to\n     allow an fs to migrate between servers without disrupting client\n
    \    access and to refer a client to another server providing access to\n     a
    specified file system.  Initial implementation work for this\n     feature has
    exposed a number of areas where RFC3530's handling of\n     the issues leaves
    something to be desired.  This document makes a\n     number of suggestions to
    remedy these issues when the NFSv4 spec\n     next undergoes a significant revision,
    most likely in connection\n     with implementing a new minor revision, such as
    NFSv4.1.\n\t </p>\n      "
