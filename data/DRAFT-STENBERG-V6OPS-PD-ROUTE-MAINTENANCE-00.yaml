abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The maintenance of Prefix Delegation (PD) routing state is an
    issue\nthat people have discussed in the IETF DHC WG, and there have been\ndrafts
    on the topic.  However, as the pros and cons of the different\nrouting state maintenance
    solutions have not been examined\nthoroughly, this text attempts to shed some
    light on both the actual\nproblem and the various alternative solutions.\n\t </p>\n
