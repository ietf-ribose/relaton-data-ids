abstract:
- content: "<p>Nimrod is a scalable routing architecture designed to support a dynamic
    internetwork of arbitrary size, to provide service-specific routing in the presence
    of multiple constraints, and to admit incremental deployment throughout an internetwork.
    The key features of Nimrod include representation of internetwork connectivity
    and services in the form of maps at multiple levels of abstraction; source- and
    destination-controlled route generation and selection based on maps and traffic
    service requirements; and source- and destination-controlled message forwarding
    according to the routes selected. This document contains a description of Nimrod
    functionality and a specification of the protocols constituting Nimrod. In particular,
    the operations pertinent to the map, locator, adjacency, route, and forwarding
    databases are described, and the Reliable Transaction, Update, Query-Response,
    Path Management, and Discovery protocols are specified.</p>"
