abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data source authentication is an important requirement to provide\n
    \  multicast security. Data source authentication assures that the \n   member
    claiming to send the data is the actual sender. An imposter\n   member should
    not be able to claim to be the sender of the data.\n   This document proposes
    a scheme by which data source authentication\n   can be acheived. The idea is
    to instead of digitally signing the data\n   packets, a digitally signed recall
    packet on detection of an imposter \n   transmission. The data packets are sent
    using symmetric MAC \n   authentication.\n\t </p>\n      "
