abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an integrated solution for multiple bitrates
    by defining the Bitrate header in RTSP. A client can inquire bitrate range of
    media source after a successful SETUP request by sending a GET_PARAMETER request
    with the bitrate parameter to the RTSP server, and then server responds with bitrate
    range parameter of media source. According to bitrate range parameter value, the
    client MAY apply for bandwidth reservation by RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol)
    [5] or apply for increasing access bandwidth. The client MAY select a suitable
    bitrate to start with or change transport bitrate during the playing by sending
    a PLAY request with the Bitrate header.</p>"
