abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides\n   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n
    \  computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n   The
    Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol\n   Label Switching
    (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs) using PCEP.\n\n
    \  This document defines PCEP extensions for grouping two unidirectional\n   MPLS
    TE LSPs (one in each direction in the network) into an\n   Associated Bidirectional
    LSP.  The mechanisms defined in this\n   document can be applied using a Stateful
    PCE for both PCE-Initiated\n   and PCC-Initiated LSPs, as well as when using a
    Stateless PCE.  The\n   procedures defined are applicable to the LSPs using Resource\n
    \  Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for signaling.\n\n\t </p>\n
