abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Diameter of Things (DoT) protocol is intended to provide
    a \n   realtime telemetry framework for IoT applications in \n   resource-constraint
    gateways. Such metering capability is needed\n   when lack of resources among
    competing applications dictates our\n   schedule and credit allocation. The DoT
    protocol can be incorporated\n   to implement real-time AAA of IoT services for
    prepaid subscribers. \n   The DoT employs mechanisms to meter the IoT composite
    application \n   units used/charged over a client credit. Such metering methods
    come \n   in two models of session-based and event-based patterns. The former
    \n   is used for scenarios where the charged units are continuously\n   consumed
    while the latter is typically used when units are implicit\n   invocation events.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
