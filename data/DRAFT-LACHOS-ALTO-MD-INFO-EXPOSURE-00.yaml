abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A common setting in emerging applications (e.g., data-intensive\n
    \  science applications, flexible inter-domain routing, multi-domain\n   service
    function chaining) is that the traffic from a source to a\n   destination traverses
    multiple networks domains.  Such multi-domain\n   applications can benefit from
    network information exposure using\n   ALTO.  This document summarizes the benefits
    of using such multi-\n   domain information and discusses the ALTO design issues
    for gathering\n   it.  Besides, it also presents key design requirements to be\n
    \  addressed in order to realize the proposal of providing multi-domain\n   information
    by ALTO services.  Finally, another important objective\n   of this document is
    to begin discussions into the ALTO WG concerning\n   potential new items to be
    considered for the re-charter.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
