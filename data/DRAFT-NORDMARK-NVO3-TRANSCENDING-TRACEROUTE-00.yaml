abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Tools like traceroute have been very valuable for the operation
    of\n   the Internet.  Part of that value comes from being able to display\n   information
    about routers and paths over which the user of the tool\n   has no control, but
    the traceroute output can be passed along to\n   someone else that can further
    investigate or fix the problem.\n\n   In overlay networks such as VXLAN and NVGRE
    the prevailing view is\n   that since the overlay network has no control of the
    underlay there\n   needs to be special tools and agreements to enable extracting
    traces\n   from the underlay.  We argue that enabling visibility into the\n   underlay
    and using existing tools like traceroute has been overlooked\n   and would add
    value in many deployments of overlay networks.\n\n   This document specifies an
    approach that can be used to make\n   traceroute transcend layers of encapsulation
    including details for\n   how to apply this to VXLAN.  The technique can be applied
    to other\n   encapsulations used for overlay networks.  It can also be implemented\n
    \  using current commercial silicon.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
