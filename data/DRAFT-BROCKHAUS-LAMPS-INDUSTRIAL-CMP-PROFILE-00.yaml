abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of this document is to facilitate interoperability
    and\n   automation by profiling the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP)\n   [RFC4210]
    and the related Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)\n   [RFC4211].  It specifies
    a subset of CMP and CRMF focusing on typical\n   uses cases relevant for managing
    certificates of devices in\n   industrial and IoT scenarios.  To limit the overhead
    of certificate\n   management for constrained devices only the most crucial types
    of\n   transactions are specified as mandatory.  To foster interoperability\n
    \  also in more complex scenarios, other types of transactions are\n   specified
    as recommended or optional.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
