abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile SCTP (mSCTP) is defined as SCTP with the ADDIP extension.
    The \n    mSCTP can be used for providing seamless handover by exploiting its
    \n    multi-homing feature. On the other hand, the Mobile IP basically \n    provides
    the location management. In this document, we discuss the \n    use of mSCTP along
    with Mobile IP for Internet mobility support in \n    the transport layer. The
    use of SCTP with Mobile IP is focused on the \n    mobile sessions that are initiated
    by CN to MN.\n\t </p>\n      "
