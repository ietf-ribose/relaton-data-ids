abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In order to allow the subordinate MANET to be connected to the
    \nexternal network, the MANET border router (MBR) has been defined. For \nproviding
    scalability and reliability to the subordinate MANET, \nmultiple MBRs may be deployed.
    One of the issues on the subordinate \nMANET with multiple MBRs is which network
    prefixes are to be \nadvertised by MBRs. In the case when MBRs advertise different
    network \nprefixes, if a MANET node changes its default MBR to a new one, the
    \nnode may have to transmit packets via non-optimal paths to keep using \nthe
    existing connection to the previous MBR, or change its address by \nusing the
    network prefix information from the new MBR. \nIn the former case, the MANET node
    may not communicate with the MBR \ndue to MANET partitioning. In the latter case,
    on-going sessions can \nbe terminated because of the address change. In this draft,
    we define \na PMIPv6 based address autoconfiguration mechanism that enables MANET
    \nnodes to operate properly when all MBRs advertise the same network \nprefix
    in the subordinate MANET.\n\t </p>\n      "
