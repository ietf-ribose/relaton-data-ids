abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The concept of fog computing has emerged driven by the Internet
    of\n   Things (IoT) due to the need of handling the data generated from the\n
    \  end-user devices.  The term fog is referred to any networked\n   computational
    resource in the continuum between things and cloud.  In\n   fog computing, functions
    can be stiched together composing a service\n   function chain.  These functions
    might be hosted on resources that\n   are inherently heterogeneous, volatile and
    mobile.  This means that\n   resources might appear and disappear, and the connectivity\n
    \  characteristics between these resources may also change dynamically.\n   This
    calls for new orchestration solutions able to cope with dynamic\n   changes to
    the resources in runtime or ahead of time (in anticipation\n   through prediction)
    as opposed to today's solutions which are\n   inherently reactive and static or
    semi-static.\n\n   A fog monitoring solution can be used to help predicting events
    so an\n   action can be taken before an event actually takes place.  This\n   solution
    is composed of agents running on the fog nodes plus a\n   controller hosted at
    another device (running in the infrastructure or\n   in another fog node).  Since
    fog environments are inherently volatile\n   and extremely dynamic, it is convenient
    to enable the use of\n   autonomic technologies to autonomously set-up the fog
    monitoring\n   platform.  This document aims at presenting this use case as well
    as\n   specifying how to use GRASP as needed in this scenario.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
