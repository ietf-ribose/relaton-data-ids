abstract:
- content: "<p>Lightweight MTA Authentication Protocol (LMAP) is the general term
    for a family of proposed protocols to help address the spam problem by permitting
    domains to publish the set of SMTP clients which may use their name in the EHLO/HELO
    and MAIL FROM fields. SMTP servers can use this information to determine if a
    client is consensually using a domains name. This document discusses the applicability,
    and the costs and benefits of wide-spread deployment of the protocol family.</p>"
