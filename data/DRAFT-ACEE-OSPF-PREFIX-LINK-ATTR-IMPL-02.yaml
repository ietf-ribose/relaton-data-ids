abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document reports the results of the OSPFv2 Prefix/Link\n
    \  Attributes implementation survey.  The survey has seven questions\n   related
    to the implementer's support of OSPFv2 Prefix/Link\n   Attributes.  After a brief
    summary of the results, each response is\n   listed.  This document contains responses
    from six implementers who\n   completed the survey.  No external means were used
    to verify the\n   accuracy of the information submitted by the respondents.  The\n
    \  respondents are considered experts on the products they reported on.\n   Additionally,
    responses were omitted from implementers who indicated\n   that they have not
    implemented the function yet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
