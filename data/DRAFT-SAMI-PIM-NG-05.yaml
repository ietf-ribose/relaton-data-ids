abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies protocol independent multicast- Next\n
    \  generation or simply called PIM-NG. like PIM-SM, PIM-NG uses the\n   underlying
    unicast routing information, but unlike PIM-SM it doesn't\n   necessarily need
    to build unidirectional shared trees rooted at a\n   Rendezvous Point (RP) per
    group, due to the fact that the processes\n   through which a source registers
    with the Rendezvous Point and a host\n   finds the source of the multicast destination
    groups it needs are\n   done in a whole new way. So at some points PIM-NG works
    faster than\n   its predecessor. Also the new Domain concept, unique to PIM-NG,
    along\n   the RPF check method used in PIM-NG specifications provides many\n   features
    along a robust and flexible control and administration over\n   multicast networks.\n\n\t
