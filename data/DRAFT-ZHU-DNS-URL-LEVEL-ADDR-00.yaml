abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Recently there are a number of efforts [sw1, sw2, in,tpc, etc.]
    of trying to\nconnect the packet-switching network with circuit-switching network,
    especially\nconnecting the Internet with public telephone networks.  The first
    problem\nof such interconnection is naming and addressing, later will come with\ndirectory
    services and routing problems.  This draft concentrates on\nnaming for DNS and
    URL.  Other problems are discussed in other documents\n[utrpt, framework].\n\t
