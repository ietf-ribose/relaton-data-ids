abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is commonly used
    for\n   access authentication in many wireless networks.  EAP methods often\n
    \  involve AAA servers to effect the required authentications;\n   notifications
    about success or failure are then relayed back to a\n   functional module in the
    access network known as the Network Access\n   Server.  The Binding Authentication
    Data option has been defined for\n   enabling alternative methods for authentication
    in the context of\n   Mobile IPv6, and there is a subtype allocated for AAA-based\n
    \  authentication methods such as EAP.  However, some EAP methods\n   require
    additional handling that requires specification not yet\n   available in the existing
    documentation for the Binding\n   Authentication Data option.  This document provides
    the required\n   specification for at least some very widely deployed EAP methods.
    \ In\n   many situations requiring the use of EAP, this enables much faster\n
    \  operation for Mobile IPv6 tunnel redirection to a wireless device's\n   new
    care-of address by avoiding having to do multiple\n   authentications.\n\n\t </p>\n
