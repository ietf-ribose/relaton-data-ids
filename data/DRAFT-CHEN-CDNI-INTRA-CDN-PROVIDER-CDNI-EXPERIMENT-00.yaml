abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In [I-D.ietf-cdni-use-cases], the Inter-Affiliates CDN\n   Interconnection
    use case is described.  In this scenario, a large CDN\n   Provider may have several
    autonomous or semi-autonomous subsidiaries\n   that each operates on their own
    CDN.  The CDN Provider needs to make\n   these down-stream CDNs interoperate to
    provide a consistent service\n   to its customers on the whole collective footprint.\n\n
    \  This document illustrates in details the CDNi experiment that has\n   been
    carried out by China Telecom, and the lessons and experiences to\n   CDNi standardization
    work.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
