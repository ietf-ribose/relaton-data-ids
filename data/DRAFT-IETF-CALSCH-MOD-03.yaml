abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internet Calendaring and Scheduling protocols require the definition
    of\nobjects to encapsulate an event to be scheduled, a calendar on which\nthe
    event will be stored, and means for exchanging these objects across\nthe Internet
    between calendars on behalf of people for whom the\ncalendars are meaningful.
    \ This document gives an abstract model of the\nobjects and the protocols necessary
    to accomplish this kind of\ninformation exchange.  It will establish the context
    in which other\nCalendaring and Scheduling RFCs can be interpreted.  Included
    are brief\nintroductions to the other components of Internet calendar protocols\nand
    definitions of nomenclature common to all documents defining these\nprotocols.
    \ Reading this document will enable implementors and users of\nInternet Calendaring
    and Scheduling protocols to understand the goals\nand constraints chosen for related
    protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
