abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies UMAC-AE, a shared-key algorithm that\n
    \  simultaneously encrypts data using a block cipher in counter mode\n   while
    also authenticating the data with UMAC.  At its peak rate,\n   using AES as the
    block cipher, UMAC-AE encrypts and authenticates\n   data at a cost of about 10%
    more than simple encryption.  UMAC is\n   unencumbered by intellectual property
    claims and can be used freely.\n   Pairing UMAC with a license-free block cipher,
    such as AES, provides\n   fast and license-free authenticated encryption.\n\t
