abstract:
  content: "<p>The current usage based IPv4 address assignment policies might haveprolonged
    the useful lifetime of IPv4 address space but this has tothe detriment of the
    the end-to-end architecture of the Internet.This memo proposes the adoption of
    an address assignment strategythat releases large blocks of IPv4 address space
    into the Internet.The objective of this policy is to encourage healthy Internetdeployment
    models with end-to-end transparency and association ofpermanent connectivity with
    a stable IP address. This is intended toencourage provider support for open transparent
    Internet serviceenvironments that can be sustained with the adoption of IPv6.</p>"
