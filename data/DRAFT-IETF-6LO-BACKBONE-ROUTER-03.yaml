abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification proposes an update to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery,
    to\n   enhance the operation of IPv6 over wireless links that exhibit lossy\n
    \  multicast support, and enable a large degree of scalability by\n   splitting
    the broadcast domains.  A higher speed backbone federates\n   multiple wireless
    links to form a large MultiLink Subnet.  Backbone\n   Routers acting as Layer-3
    Access Point route packets to registered\n   nodes, where an classical Layer-2
    Access Point would bridge.\n   Conversely, wireless nodes register or are proxy-registered
    to the\n   Backbone Router to setup routing services in a fashion that is\n   essentially
    similar to a classical Layer-2 association.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
