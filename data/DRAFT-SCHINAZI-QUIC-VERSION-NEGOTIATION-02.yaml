abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   QUIC does not provide a complete version negotiation mechanism
    but\n   instead only provides a way for the server to indicate that the\n   version
    the client offered is unacceptable.  This document describes\n   a version negotiation
    mechanism that allows a client and server to\n   select a mutually supported version.
    \ Optionally, if the original and\n   negotiated version share a compatible Initial
    format, the negotiation\n   can take place without incurring an extra round trip.\n\n
    \  Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF\n   mailing
    list quic@ietf.org [1] or on the GitHub repository which\n   contains the draft:
    http://github.com/ekr/draft-schinazi-quic-\n   version-negotiation [2].\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
