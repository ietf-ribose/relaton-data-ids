abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BIER WG has a charter item to work on mechanisms which
    use BIER\n   natively in IPv6.  This document is intended to help the WG with
    this\n   effort by specifying requirements for transporting packets, with Bit\n
    \  Index Explicit Replication (BIER) headers, in an IPv6 environment.\n   There
    will be a need to send IPv6 payloads, to multiple IPv6\n   destinations, using
    BIER.  There have been several proposed solutions\n   in this area.  But there
    hasn't been a document which describes the\n   problem and lists the requirements.
    \ The goal of this document is to\n   describe the BIER IPv6 requirements and
    summarize the pro's and con's\n   of the proposed solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
