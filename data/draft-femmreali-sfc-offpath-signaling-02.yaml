abstract:
- content: "<p>This document illustrates a reference protocol able to discover deployed
    instances of Service Functions (SFs), which can be located also off-path with
    respect to the IP datapath between flow source and flow destination. It is an
    application protocol organized in two layers: signaling transport, which deal
    lower layer signaling transport, and signaling application, which directly interfaces
    with the intended SF. Discovery of SFs is a primary step to for implementing Service
    Function Chaining (SFC).</p>"
