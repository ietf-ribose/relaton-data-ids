abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The NETCONF protocol defines a number of operations to read
    and write\n   configuration data.  However, it does not define actions on the\n
    \  managed nodes.  Such actions are useful for 1) operations that do not\n   change
    the configuration data (e.g. ping) 2) reading or writing a set\n   of data that
    forms a logical group but might be scattered in\n   different parts of the management
    data model.\n\n   This document defines a new Netconf capability supporting a
    generic\n   &lt;action&gt; operation.  A modeling view of how the content of the\n
    \  generic &lt;action&gt; operation can be defined is also described.\n\n   Please
    send comments to netconf@ops.ietf.org.  To subscribe, use\n   netconf-request@ops.ietf.org.\n\n\t
