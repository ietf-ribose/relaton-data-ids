abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose here a service that enables nodes located behind one or
    several IPv4 NATs to obtain IPv6 connectivity by tunneling packets over UDP; we
    call this the Teredo service. Running the service requires the help of 'Teredo
    servers' and 'Teredo relays'; the Teredo servers are stateless, and only have
    to manage a small fraction of the traffic between Teredo clients; the Teredo relays
    act as IPv6 routers between the Teredo service and the 'native' IPv6 Internet.</p>"
