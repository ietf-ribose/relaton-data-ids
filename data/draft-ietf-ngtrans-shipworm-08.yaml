abstract:
  content: "\t <t>We propose here a service that enables nodes located behind one
    orseveral IPv4 NATs to obtain IPv6 connectivity by tunneling packetsover UDP;
    we call this the Teredo service. Running the servicerequires the help of 'Teredo
    servers' and 'Teredo relays'; theTeredo servers are stateless, and only have to
    manage a smallfraction of the traffic between Teredo clients; the Teredo relaysact
    as IPv6 routers between the Teredo service and the 'native' IPv6Internet.</p>"
