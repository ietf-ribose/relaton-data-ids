abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol document
    defines a\n   way for a client to discover a conference control server that\n
    \  supports CCMP. However, it does not define a way for a client\n   involved
    in a conference to determine if the conference focus\n   supports CCMP. This information
    would allow a CCMP-enabled client\n   that joins a conference using SIP to also
    register for the XCON\n   conference event package and take advantage of CCMP
    operations on the\n   conference.\n\n   This document describes two mechanisms,
    depending upon the need of\n   the UA, to address the above limitation. The first
    mechanism uses the\n   Call-Info header, and the second mechanism defines a new
    value for\n   the 'purpose' parameter in the 'service-uris' element in the SIP\n
    \  conferencing event package.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
