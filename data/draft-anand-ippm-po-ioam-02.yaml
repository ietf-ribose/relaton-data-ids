abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a way to extend in-situ OAM techniques to include
    operational data from multiple network layers with a view to create an integrated
    record of OAM information as the data flows between two network entities. An instance
    of this technique that is elaborated here focuses on packet-optical networks that
    are traditionally transport centric. The mechanisms described are general enough
    to allow future extensibility of in-situ OAM techniques into other non-packet
    domains.</p>"
