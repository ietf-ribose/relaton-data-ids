abstract:
  content: <p>There has been significant recent work in increasing the capabilitiesof
    Ethernet switches. As a consequence, the role of Ethernet israpidly expanding
    into "transport networks" that previously were thedomain of other technologies
    such as SONET/SDH TDM and ATM. Thisdocument defines an architecture and framework
    for a GMPLS basedcontrol plane for Ethernet in this "transport network" capacity.GMPLS
    has already been specified for similar technologies. Someadditional extensions
    to the GMPLS control plane are needed and thisdocument provides a framework for
    these extensions.Contents</p>
