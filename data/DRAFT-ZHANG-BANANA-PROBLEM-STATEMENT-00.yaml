abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bandwidth aggregation for Internet access can increase the
    access\n   bandwidth and reliability. It has become a desirable network\n   function,
    especially for those Service Providers who operates\n   multiple heterogeneous
    networks.\n\n   This document describes the issues with bandwidth aggregation
    for\n   Internet access. The required network functions to be supported are\n
    \  specified. Several candidate solutions had been considered to support\n   bandwidth
    aggregation for Internet access in IETF. These techniques\n   are investigated.\n\n\t
