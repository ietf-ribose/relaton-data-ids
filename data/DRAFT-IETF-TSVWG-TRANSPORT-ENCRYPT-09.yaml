abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To protect user data and privacy, Internet transport protocols
    have\n   supported payload encryption and authentication for some time.  Such\n
    \  encryption and authentication is now also starting to be applied to\n   the
    transport protocol headers.  This helps avoid transport protocol\n   ossification
    by middleboxes, while also protecting metadata about the\n   communication.  Current
    operational practice in some networks inspect\n   transport header information
    within the network, but this is no\n   longer possible when those transport headers
    are encrypted.  This\n   document discusses the possible impact when network traffic
    uses a\n   protocol with an encrypted transport header.  It suggests issues to\n
    \  consider when designing new transport protocols, to account for\n   network
    operations, prevent network ossification, and enable\n   transport evolution,
    while still respecting user privacy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
