abstract:
- content: <p>Many resources provided on the Web are part of sets of resources that
    are provided in a context that is managed by one particular service provider.
    Often, these sets of resources are referred to as "Web Services" or "Web APIs".
    This specification defines link relations for representing relationships from
    those resources to ones that provide documentation or descriptions of the Web
    services. The difference between these concepts is that documentation is primarily
    intended for human consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily intended for
    automated consumers. It also defines a link relation to identify a status resource
    that is used to represent operational information about a service's status.</p>
