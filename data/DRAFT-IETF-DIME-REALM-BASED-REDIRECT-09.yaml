abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Diameter protocol allows a Diameter redirect agent to return
    to\n   the message sender one or more individual hosts as destinations of\n   the
    redirected message.  However, in some circumstances an operator\n   may wish to
    redirect messages to an alternate domain without\n   specifying individual hosts.
    \ This document specifies a mechanism by\n   which this can be achieved.  New
    applications may incorporate this\n   capability by reference to the present document.\n\n
    \  This memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC6733 with respect to\n   the
    usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time\n   AVPs.\n\n\t </p>\n
