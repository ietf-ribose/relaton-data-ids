abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines several protocols to support accessing
    general\n   graphical user interface (GUI) desktops and applications remotely,\n
    \  either by a single remote user or embedded into a multiparty\n   conference.
    \ The protocols are designed to allow sharing of, and\n   access to general windowing
    system applications that are not\n   expressly written to be accessed remotely.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
