abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo provides a brief analysis of existing IP quality of
    service\n(QoS) solutions and the implied signalling issues. This analysis is\nintended
    to point out open issues in QoS signalling.  Moreover, this\nanalysis is done
    in order to understand whether the strict QoS\nrequirements imposed by future
    fixed and mobile applications are\nsatisfied by the existing IP QoS solutions.
    \ The existing IP QoS\nsolutions can be categorized as follows:\n* End-to-end
    per-flow resource reservation protocols\n* Integrated Services over Differentiated
    Services\n* Statically assigned trunk reservations based on\nDifferentiated Services\n*
    Dynamic trunk reservations with Aggregated RSVP\n\t </p>\n      "
