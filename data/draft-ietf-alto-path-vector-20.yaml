abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) protocol. It extends the ALTO Cost Map and ALTO Property Map
    services so that an application can decide which endpoint(s) to connect based
    on not only numerical/ordinal cost values but also details of the paths. This
    is useful for applications whose performance is impacted by specified components
    of a network on the end-to-end paths, e.g., they may infer that several paths
    share common links and prevent traffic bottlenecks by avoiding such paths. This
    extension introduces a new abstraction called Abstract Network Element (ANE) to
    represent these components and encodes a network path as a vector of ANEs. Thus,
    it provides a more complete but still abstract graph representation of the underlying
    network(s) for informed traffic optimization among endpoints.</p>"
