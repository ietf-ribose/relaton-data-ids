abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We have identified the potential need for a UDP-based encapsulation\n
    \  protocol to allow explicit cooperation with middleboxes while using\n   new,
    encrypted transport protocols.  This document proposes an\n   initial set of requirements
    for such a protocol, and discusses\n   tradeoffs to be made in further refining
    these requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
