abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the\n
    \  network.  Instead, links with restricting MTUs must either drop each\n   too-large
    packet and return an ICMP Packet Too Big message or perform\n   link-specific
    fragmentation (also known as \"link adaptation\") at a\n   layer below IPv6.  This
    latter category of links is often\n   performance-challenged to accommodate steady-state
    link-specific\n   fragmentation to the point that it would be highly desirable
    to push\n   the fragmentation burden back to the IPv6 source.  A common case that\n
    \  exhibits these link characteristics is seen for IPv6-within-IP\n   tunnels.
    \ This document therefore proposes an update to the base IPv6\n   specification
    to support link adaptation avoidance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
