abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT) [RFC6013] deter spoofing of\n\n\n
    \ |\nconnections and prevent resource exhaustion, eliminating Responder\n(server)
    state during the initial handshake.  The Initiator (client)\nhas sole responsibility
    for ensuring required delays between\nconnections.  The cookie exchange may carry
    data, limited to inhibit\namplification and reflection denial of service attacks.\n\nThis
    document provides a sockets Application Program Interface (API)\nto support \"basic\"
    and \"advanced\" TCPCT applications.  TCP/IP\napplications written using the sockets
    API have enjoyed a high degree\nof portability.\n\nCopyright Notice\n\nCopyright
