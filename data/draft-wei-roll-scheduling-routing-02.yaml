abstract:
- content: "<p>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics compared
    with traditional wired and ad-hoc networks. Deterministic networks is specified
    in IEEE 802.15.4e which is for deterministic applications in the industrial environment.
    Some routing metrics and constraints has been described in [RFC6551],[RFC5867]
    [RFC5826], [RFC5673], and [RFC5548]. There are several special characteristics
    and requirements in the industrial environment. This document defines a new Link
    Metric/Constraint Object-Scheduling Waiting Time to make RPL support deterministic
    scheduling mechanism, which could improve the determinacy and reliability of the
    LLNs in industrial environment.</p>"
