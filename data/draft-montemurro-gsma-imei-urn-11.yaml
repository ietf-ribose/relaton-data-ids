abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace for the
    GSMA and a sub namespace for the IMEI (International Mobile station Equipment
    Identity), and associated parameter for the IMEISV (International Mobile station
    Equipment Identity and Software Version number). The IMEI is 15 decimal digits
    long and the IMEISV is 16 decimal digits long and both are encoded using Binary
    Encoded Decimal (BCD). The IMEI and IMEISV were introduced as part of the specification
    for Global System for Mobile (GSM) and are also now incorporated by the 3rd Generation
    Partnership Project (3GPP) as part of the 3GPP specification for GSM, the Universal
    Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and 3GPP LTE (Long Term Evolution). The
    IMEI and IMEISV are used to uniquely identify Mobile Equipment within these systems
    and are managed by the GSMA (GSM Association).</p>"
