abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to include trust into the proposed ASTM
    Remote ID specification defined in WK65041 by the F38 Committee under a Broadcast
    Remote ID (RID) scenario. It defines a few different message schemes (based on
    the authentication message) that can be used to assure past messages sent by a
    UA and also act as an assurance for UA trustworthiness in the absence of Internet
    connectivity at the receiving node.</p>"
