abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Bundle Protocol (RFC 5050) requires the use of real time clocks\nto
    handle bundle expiry.  This sometimes has some drawbacks; this\nspecification
    explains some such situations, briefly considers\ngeneric ways to ameliorate those,
    and defines some alternative\napproaches for handling bundle expiry that do not
    require real time\nclocks.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft is submitted
