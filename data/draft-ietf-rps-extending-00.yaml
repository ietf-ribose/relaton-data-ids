abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This Internet Draft describes guidelines for extending the Routing
    PolicySpecification Language (RPSL) [3, 4]. Our experiences with PRDB [2],RIPE-81
    [6], and RIPE-181 [5] taught us that RPSL had to be extensible.These languages
    were not extensible and each transition to a new languageturned out to be quite
    painful. As a result, extensibility was a primarydesign goal for RPSL. New routing
    protocols or new features to existingrouting protocols can be easily handled using
    RPSL's dictionary class. Newclasses or new attributes to the existing classes
    can also be added.</p>"
