abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo documents a DHCPv4 option that currently exists and
    was previously privately defined for the operation and usage of the Cisco Systems'
    Subnet Allocation Option for DHCPv4.  The option is passed between the DHCPv4
    Client and the DHCPv4 Server to request dynamic allocation of a subnet, give specifications
    of the subnet(s) allocated, and report usage statistics.  This memo documents
    the current usage of the option in agreement with RFC 3942, which declares that
    any preexisting usages of option numbers in the range 128-223 should be documented
    and that the working group will try to officially assign those numbers to those
    options.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
    published for informational purposes.\n\t </p>\n      "
