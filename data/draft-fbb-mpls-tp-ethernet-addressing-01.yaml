abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
    is the set of MPLS protocol functions applicable to the construction and operation
    of packet-switched transport networks. This document presents considerations for
    link-layer addressing of Ethernet frames carrying MPLS-TP packets. This document
    is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International
    Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort
    to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
    to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.</p>"
