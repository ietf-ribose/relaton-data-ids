abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the architecture solutions for BGP/MPLS L3
    and L2 Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) with virtual Provider Edge (vPE) routers.
    It provides a functional description of the vPE control, forwarding, and management.
    The proposed vPE solutions support both the Software Defined Networks (SDN) approach
    which allows physical decoupling of the control and the forwarding, and the traditional
    distributed routing approach. A vPE can reside in any network or compute devices,
    such as a server as co-resident with the application virtual machines (VMs), or
    a Top-of-Rack (ToR) switch in a Data Center (DC) network.</p>"
