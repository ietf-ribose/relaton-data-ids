abstract:
- content: "<p>This documentary provides a kind of routing optimization method. In
    the basic of RWA solution method, both the output power of the route and the OSNR
    value of the optical signal noise ratio are considered. The selected optimal route
    has a lower bit error rate and the whole communication network performance is
    improved.</p>"
