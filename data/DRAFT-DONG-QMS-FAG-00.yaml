abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document addresses the issue of provisioning end-to-end
    Quality\n   of Service (QoS) for multimedia services over heterogeneous networks\n
    \  and introduces a parametric model by using network calculus theory\n   for
    QoS class mapping between different QoS domains.  Then a QoS\n   Mapping Scheme
    based on Flow Aggregation (QMS-FAG) is proposed in\n   this document to mitigate
    the information loss problem due to mapping\n   between QoS domains with different
    granularity of QoS class and to\n   provide efficient network resources utilization
    by considering user's\n   Quality of Experience (QoE).  In QMS-FAG, the QoS requirements
    of\n   service flows are indicated by a unique FAG identifier which is\n   described
    in a service flow map of QoS parameters.  With FAG\n   identifier and mapping
    executors sitting at the border of different\n   QoS domains, QMS-FAG allows smooth
    QoS class mapping between networks\n   with different granularity of QoS class.
    \ Both numerical analysis and\n   simulation studies are given to demonstrate
    the efficiency of the\n   proposed method.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
