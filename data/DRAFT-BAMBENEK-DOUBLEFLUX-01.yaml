abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The memo provides information and suggests processes for developers\nof
    applications based on the DNS protocol and for administrators\nof servers and
    networks. It suggests new procedures for DNS and\nDNSSEC implementations that
    would prevent abuse of the DNS\nprotocol such as those seen by \"Double Flux\"
    service networks.\nSpecifically, this document recommends that all resource records
    for\nNS records with Time-To-Live (TTL) settings under 24 hours be\ndropped as
    potentially malicious records designed to attack users.\nThis document would update
    RFCs 1123, 1912, 2181 and 2535.\n\n\nConventions used in this document \n\n  The
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n  \"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \n  document
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [KWORDS].\n\t </p>\n      "
