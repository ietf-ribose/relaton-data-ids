abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ACME protocol provides a means for hosts to automatically
    request\n   and obtain X.509 certificates from certificate authorities.\n   Certification
    authorities which implement ACME may also choose to\n   implement the CAA DNS
    record, which allows a domain to communicate\n   issuance policy to CAs.  The
    CAA specification alone allows a domain\n   to define policy with CA-level granularity.
    \ However, the CAA\n   specification also provides facilities for extension to
    admit more\n   granular, CA-specific policy.  This specification defines such
    a\n   parameter.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
