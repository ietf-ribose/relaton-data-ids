abstract:
- content: "<p>Work has been done on privacy issues that should be considered when
    creating an Internet protocol. This draft suggests that similar considerations
    may apply for other human rights such as freedom of expression or freedom of association.
    A proposal is made for initiating IRTF work researching the possible connections
    between human rights and Internet standards and protocols. The goal would be to
    create an informational RFC concerning human rights protocol considerations. Discussion
    on this draft at: hrpc@article19.io</p>"
