abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This  document  provides  a  recommended  architecture  and
    \ network\n   operation  named  SARP.  SARP  is  based  on  fast  proxies  that\n
    \  significantly  reduce  broadcast  domains  and  ARP/ND  broadcast\n   transmissions.
    SARP supports smooth and fast virtual machine (VM)\n   mobility without any modification
    to the VM, while keeping the\n   connection up and running efficiently.  SARP
    is targeted for massive\n   scaling data centers with a significant number of
    VMs using ARP and\n   ND protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
