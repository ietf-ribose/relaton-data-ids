abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Many protocols currently being developed for seamless IP-levelhandovers,
    such as fast handovers and context transfers, possess aninherent requirement that
    the mobile node and/or it's current accessrouter have a priori knowledge concerning
    the target of the handover.In particular, the target access router (TAR) should
    be known to havethe appropriate set of capabilities necessary to meet the requirementsof
    the mobile node. Although the TAR selection process occurs at ornear the time
    of handover, applicable candidate access routers (CARs)can be identified in advance.
    In this draft, we propose a dynamic,distributed protocol, dyCARD, which allows
    geographically adjacentrouters to exchange capability information, thus providing
    criticalinformation to the target selection process.</p>"
