abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS-SPRING is a source routing paradigm in which a sender of a packet
    is allowed to partially or completely specify the route the packet takes through
    the network by using stacked MPLS labels. The current MPLS-SRPING architecture
    requires an end-to-end MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) between any two MPLS-SPRING-enabled
    routers (e.g., two adjacent hops of a given explicit path). In order to enable
    MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers to be deployed even when there are non-MPLS routers
    along the path between two MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers, it is desirable to have
    an alternative, which allows the use of IP-based tunnels (e.g., GRE tunnels) to
    connect two MPLS-SPRING- enabled routers. This document describes a mechanism
    for such usage.</p>"
