abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the extensions needed by certain \nfeatures
    for the purpose of RSVP Graceful Restart. One of \nthese extensions refers to
    the ability of a node to recover \nthe ERO in the case it has performed an ERO
    expansion before \ncontrol plane restart. Also a small modification is proposed
    \nin the basic procedure to support simultaneous multiple node \nrestarts in a
    network. Specifically, a node should use a non-\nzero Recovery Time while in the
    recovery phase. This allows a \nnode to determine at restart time if any of its
    neighbors has \npreviously restarted and it is currently in the recovery phase.
