abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
    in the Counter and CBC-MAC Mode (CCM) of operation within Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) to provide confidentiality and data-origin authentication. The AES-CCM algorithm
    is amenable to compact implementations, making it suitable for constrained environments,
    while at the same time providing a high level of security. The cipher suites defined
    in this document use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and are advantageous in
    networks with limited bandwidth.</p>"
