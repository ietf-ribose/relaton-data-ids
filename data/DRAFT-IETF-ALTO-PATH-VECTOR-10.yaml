abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer
    Traffic\n   Optimization protocol [RFC7285].  The current ALTO Cost Services\n
    \  allow applications to obtain cost values on an end-to-end path\n   defined
    by its source and destination.  The present extension\n   provides abstracted
    information on particular network parts or\n   elements traversed by a path between
    its source and destination.\n   Examples of such abstracted parts are networks,
    data centers or\n   links.  This is useful for applications whose performance
    is impacted\n   by particular network parts they traverse or by their properties.\n
    \  Applications having the choice among several connection paths may use\n   this
    information to select paths accordingly and improve their\n   performance.  In
    particular, they may infer that several paths share\n   common links and prevent
    traffic bottlenecks by avoiding such paths.\n   This document introduces a new
    cost type called Path Vector.  A Path\n   Vector is an array of entities that
    each identifies an abstracted\n   representation of a network part and that are
    called Abstract Network\n   Element (ANE).  Each ANE is defined by a set of properties.
    \ ANE\n   properties are conveyed by an ALTO information resource called\n   \"Property
    Map\", that can be packed together with the Path Vectors in\n   a multipart response.
    \ They can also be obtained via a separate ALTO\n   request to a Property Map.
    An ALTO Property Map is an extension to\n   the ALTO protocol, that is specified
    in another document entitled\n   \"Unified Properties for the ALTO Protocol\"\n
    \  [I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
