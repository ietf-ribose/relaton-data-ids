abstract:
- content: <p>The BULK DNS resource record type defines a method of pattern based
    creation of DNS resource records to be used in place of NXDOMAIN errors which
    would normally be returned. These records are currently restricted to registered
    DNS resource record types A, AAAA, PTR and CNAME. The key benefit of the BULK
    resource record type is the simplification of maintaining "generic" record assignments
    which would otherwise be too many to manage or require scripts or proprietary
    methods as bind's $GENERATE.</p>
