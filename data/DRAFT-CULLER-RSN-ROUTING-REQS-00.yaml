abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The need for high quality routing for Sensor networks comprised
    of\n   highly constrained devices (CPU, memory, ...) in sometimes unstable\n   wireless
    environments is critical now and will continue to increase.\n   Interest in this
    class of applications has grown dramatically in\n   recent years and a routing
    solution addressing the specific\n   environments of such networks is highly required
    considering the\n   numerous, incompatible open-source and proprietary routing
    protocols\n   as well as several industrial forums.  The aim of this document
    is to\n   define the routing requirements for Sensor Networks at the IP layer.\n
    \  Such routing protocol(s) would need to address several unique aspects\n   of
    this class of embedded devices and would operate in networks\n   comprising links
    of various nature.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
