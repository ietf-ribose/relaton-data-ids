abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IP Virtual Private Networks (IP-VPNs) allow Service Providers
    to\n   offer customers connectivity between sites across an IP Backbone.\n   These
    VPNs can be supported using BGP/MPLS and the connections can be\n   created by
    using MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs). The paths
    of these LSPs must be computed to provide the\n   connectivity between customer
    sites. Path selection may be dependent\n   on a variety of factors including traffic
    engineering constraints\n   and bandwidth requirements.\n\n   It is highly desirable
    for VPN customers to be able to dynamically\n   establish their MPLS TE LSPs for
    interconnectivity between BGP/MPLS\n   IP-VPN sites. The Path Computation Element
    (PCE) can determine the\n   optimal paths of TE LSPs within an MPLS network. This
    document\n   defines how to extend the PCEP to support the dynamic creation of\n
    \  MPLS TE LSPs between BGP/MPLS IP-VPN sites.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
