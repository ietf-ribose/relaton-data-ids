abstract:
  content: <p>In the March of 2006 the IAB held a workshop on the topic of"Unwanted
    Internet Traffic". The report from that workshop isdocumented in RFC 4948 [RFC4948].
    Section 8.2 of RFC 4948 calls for"[t]ightening the security of the core routing
    infrastructure." Fourmain steps were identified for improving the security of
    the routinginfrastructure. One of those steps was "securing the routingprotocols'
    packets on the wire," also called the routing protocoltransport. One mechanism
    for securing routing protocol transports isthe use of per-packet cryptographic
    message authentication, providingboth peer authentication and message integrity.
    Many differentrouting protocols exist and they employ a range of differenttransport
    subsystems. Therefore there must necessarily be variousmethods defined for applying
    cryptographic authentication to thesevarying protocols. Many routing protocols
    already have some methodfor accomplishing cryptographic message authentication.
    However, inmany cases the existing methods are dated, vulnerable to attack,and/or
    employ cryptographic algorithms that have been deprecated.The "Keying and Authentication
    for Routing Protocols" (KARP) effortaims to overhaul and improve these mechanisms.
    This document has twomain parts. The first describes the threat analysis for attacksagainst
    routing protocols' transports. The second enumerates therequirements for addressing
    the described threats. This document,along with the KARP Design Guide and KARP
    Framework documents, willbe used by KARP design teams for specific protocol review
    andoverhaul. This document reflects the input of both the IETF'sSecurity Area
    and Routing Area in order to form a jointly agreed uponguidance.</p>
