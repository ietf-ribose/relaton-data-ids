abstract:
- content: "<p>The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) [WEBRTC] working group is
    charged to provide protocol support for direct interactive rich communication
    using audio,video and data between two peers' web browsers. With in the WebRTC
    framework, Session Description protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] is used for negotiating
    session capabilities between the peers. Such a negotiataion happens based on the
    SDP Offer/Answer exchange mechanism described in the RFC 3264 [RFC3264]. This
    document serves a introductory purpose in describing the role of SDP for the most
    common WebRTC use-cases. This SDP examples provided in this document is still
    a work in progress, but aims to align closest to the evolving standards.</p>"
