abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an identity-based security scheme for\n
    \  wireless sensor network (WSN) on the basis of Identity-Based\n   Encryption
    (IBE). Each cluster head can perform as a private key\n   generator (PKG) in case
    that the sole PKG is captured, which will\n   lead to the whole network disabled.
    The proposed scheme can reduce\n   the consumption of key resources and improve
    the security of the WSN\n   by dispersing PKG function. The analysis shows that
    the scheme can\n   resist various attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
