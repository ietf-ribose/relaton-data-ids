abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an initial implementation of Media-\n
    \  independent Pre-Authentication (MPA) optimization.  MPA is a mobile-\n   assisted,
    secure handover optimization scheme that works over any\n   link-layer and with
    any mobility management protocol.  The\n   implementation described in this document
    shows how existing\n   protocols can be leveraged to realize the functionalities
    of MPA.  It\n   also includes empirical results gathered from experiments performed\n
    \  on a simulated network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
