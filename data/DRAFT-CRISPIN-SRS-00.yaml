abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This specification describes a protocol for a Shared Registry\n
    \   System (SRS) that allows multiple registrars to register domain\n    names
    within a single Top Level Domain (TLD).  The protocol is\n    high-level, text-based,
    and can be used over many underlying\n    transport mechanisms, including email.
    \ The semantic content of\n    the protocol is expressed as a set of keyword-value
    pairs; the\n    semantics and structure of this content is, in this document,\n
    \   loosely described as the 'payload'.\n \n    The protocol described herein
    is essentially identical to the SRS\n    version 1.5 protocol, specified by the
    CORE SRS RFP and developed\n    by Curt Meyer of Emergent Corporation.\n\n\t </p>\n
