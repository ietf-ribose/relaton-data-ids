abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for end-to-end (E2E) SD-WAN paths
    to traverse specific list of network segments, some of which are private networks
    which include SR enabled segments, some of which may be the public IP networks
    that do not support SR, to achieve the desired optimal E2E quality. The method
    described in this draft uses the principle of segment routing to enforce a SD-WAN
    path' head-end selected route traversing through a list of specific nodes of multiple
    network segments without requiring the nodes in each network segment to have the
    intelligence (or maintaining states) of selecting next hop or next domain.</p>"
