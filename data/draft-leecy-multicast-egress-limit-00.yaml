abstract:
  content: "<p>The amount of resources required by a source to send data to amulticast
    group within a network is dependent on the service levelthe source requested and
    the number of egress points for the group ina network. Since the egress points
    in a multicast group can changeduring a multicast session, a source node would
    not know how many orwhich egress points it would be sending to when it specifies
    theservice level it requires for multicast data.This document describes methods
    to control the number of egresspoints of a dynamic multicast group in a differentiated
    services (DS)network. A source node specifies the bandwidth, type of service and
    alimit on the number of egress points that it wants to send multicastdata to.
    If this limit on the number of egress points is reached, nofurther egress points
    will be grafted to the branch of the multicasttree rooted at this source node.</p>"
