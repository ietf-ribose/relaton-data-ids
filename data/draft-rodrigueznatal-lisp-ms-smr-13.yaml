abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis] to allow Map Servers
    to send SMR messages. This extension is intended to be used in some SDN deployments
    that use LISP as a southbound protocol with (P)ITRs that are compliant with [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis].
    In this use-case mapping updates do not come from ETRs, but rather from a centralized
    controller that pushes the updates directly to the Mapping System. In such deployments,
    Map Servers will benefit from having a mechanism to inform directly (P)ITRs about
    updates in the mappings they are serving. Although implementations of this extension
    exist, this extension is deprecated by [I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub] and it is being
    documented for informational purposes. Newer implementations should look into
    [I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub] to support PubSub in LISP deployments.</p>"
