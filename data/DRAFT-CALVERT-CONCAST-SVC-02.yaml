abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Concast is a many-to-one best-effort network service that allows
    a\nreceiver to treat a group of senders as a single entity, in much the\nsame
    way that IP multicast allows a sender to treat a group of\nreceivers as one.  Each
    concast datagram delivered to a receiver is\nderived from (possibly many) datagrams
    sent by different members of\nthe concast group to that receiver, according to
    a 'merge\nspecification'.  Concast allows the semantics of this merging\noperation
    to vary to suit the needs of different applications.  This\ndocument describes
    the concast service and presents a framework for\ndefining merge semantics.  It
    also describes the processing of\nconcast datagrams by concast-capable routers
    and hosts.  The concast\nsignaling protocol (CSP), an integral part of the concast
    service, is\nspecified in a separate document.\n\t </p>\n      "
