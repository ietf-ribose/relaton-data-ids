abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Pre-Congestion Notification Architecture document defines
    a PCN\ndomain and the PCN-ingress and PCN-egress nodes that form its\nboundary.
    \ The present document is an attempt to describe the\ndetailed behaviour of the
    PCN boundary nodes.  It is a contribution\ntoward the PCN WG milestone: \"Suggested
    Flow Admission and\nTermination Boundary Mechanisms\".  This first version is
    expected to\nevolve with discussion and further thought toward a more precise
    and\nprescriptive view of boundary node behaviour.\n\t </p>\n      "
