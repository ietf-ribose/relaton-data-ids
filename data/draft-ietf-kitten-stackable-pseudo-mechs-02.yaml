abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines and formalizes the concept of stackable pseudo-mechanisms,
    and associated concept of composite mechanisms, for theGeneric Security Service
    Application Programming Interface (GSS-API),as well as several utility functions.Stackable
    GSS-API pseudo-mechanisms allow for the composition of newmechanisms that combine
    features from multiple mechanisms. Stackablemechanisms that add support for Perfect
    Forward Security (PFS), datacompression, additional authentication factors, etc...
    arefacilitated by this document.</p>"
