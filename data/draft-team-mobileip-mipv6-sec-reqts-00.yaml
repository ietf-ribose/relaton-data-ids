abstract:
- content: "<p>The IESG returned the MIP v6 draft to the working group due to concerns
    about the security and scalability of binding updates and the associated IPSEC
    processing that is specified in the draft. Since that time discussions have continued
    to attempt to define what is really needed to make binding updates secure. In
    the course of discussing the requirements it became apparent that a threat model
    is needed in order to adequately specify the security requirements.</p>"
