abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. An ingress
    node steers a packet through a controlled set of instructions, called segments,
    by pre-pending the packet with an SR header. A segment can represent any instruction,
    topological or service-based. A segment can have a local semantic to an SR node
    or global within an SR domain. SR allows one to enforce a flow through any topological
    path and service chain while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node
    of the SR domain. This document introduces the segment routing in IP Radio Access
    Network (IP RAN, mobile backhaul network) use case. Additional requirements to
    support segment routing in the IP RAN scenarios are discussed.</p>"
