abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes a simple method that multiple HoAs obtained
    by \neach of heterogeneous interfaces should be registered to home agents \nas
    like CoAs to support benefits of multihoming, such as ubiquitous \naccessibility,
    redundancy, and inter interface handover. However, a protocol for using HoA as
    CoA was already referred by [ID.Multi_PB]. \nIn this draft, we should extend situation
    that HoAs are used as like \nCoAs, and modify registration protocol for multiple
    CoAs [ID.MCoA] \n[ID.MMI] to support reliable and robust network connectivity.
    \n\t </p>\n      "
