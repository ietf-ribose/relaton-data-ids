abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In Information-centric network (ICN), everything is an identifiable\n
    \  object with a name such as named data chunks, services and mobile\n   devices.
    \ Different from host-centric connectivity, ICN connects\n   these named entities
    using name-based routing and forwarding.  At the\n   same time, network entities,
    end devices, and applications have\n   variant demands to verify the integrity,
    authenticity, and validation\n   of these entities through names.  This document
    proposes a generic\n   naming schema, called PID (Principal, Identifier, and Domain),
    which\n   supports security provenance, content lookup, routing and inter-\n   domain
    resolution for ICN.  With P:I:D (or simply PID) schema, a name\n   consists of
    three components: Principal, Identifier, and Domain.  In\n   this specification,
    we only illustrate the principles and concepts of\n   PID schema and the functional
    role of each component, and leave the\n   encoding approaches as implementation
    options.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
