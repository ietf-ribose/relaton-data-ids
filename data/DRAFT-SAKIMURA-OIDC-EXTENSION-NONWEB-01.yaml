abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification describes the usage of the access token
    as a per\n   client \"password\" for non-web clients that utilizes password based\n
    \  authentication, and the mechanism to issue such access tokens. Since\n   the
    access token is used as the password for the client, the existing\n   client application
    can be used as-is without any change, which is a\n   considerable advantage for
    the deployment.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
