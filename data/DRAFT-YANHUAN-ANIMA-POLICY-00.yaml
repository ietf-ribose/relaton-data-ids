abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\tRecent years have witnessed a rapid development of wireless\n\tcommunication
    technologies. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are\n\twilling to provide customized
    network services in a very short\n\ttime to their customers. However, since network
    demands are highly\n\tdiverse, it is difficult to design the specific network
    policies\n\tthat implement the required network services for each scenario. In\n\tthis
    document, we propose a generic network policy model for\n\tfuture wireless network
    systems to meet different network demands\n\tbased on the typical scenarios. Meanwhile,
    to automatically and\n\tintelligently deploy the policies defined by this model,
    we design\n\ta novel architecture that orchestrates the high-level policies\n\tinto
    the low-level rules available in the underlying networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
