abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes considerations for benchmarking network performance
    in containerized infrastructures. In the containerized infrastructure, Virtualized
    Network Functions(VNFs) are deployed on an operating-system-level virtualization
    platform by abstracting the user namespace as opposed to virtualization using
    a hypervisor. Hence, the system configurations and networking scenarios for benchmarking
    will be partially changed by how the resource allocation and network technologies
    are specified for containerized VNFs. This draft compares the state of the art
    in the container networking architecture with VM-based virtualized systems networking
    architecture and provides several test scenarios for benchmarking network performance
    in containerized infrastructures.</p>"
