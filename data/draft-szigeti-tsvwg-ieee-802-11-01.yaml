abstract:
- content: "<p>As internet traffic is increasingly sourced-from and destined-to wireless
    endpoints, it is crucial that Quality of Service be aligned between wired and
    wireless networks; however, this is not always the case by default. This is due
    to the fact that two independent standards bodies provide QoS guidance on wired
    and wireless networks: specifically, the IETF specifies standards and design recommendations
    for wired IP networks, while a separate and autonomous standards- body, the IEEE,
    administers the standards for wireless 802.11 networks. The purpose of this document
    is to propose a set Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to IEEE 802.11 User
    Priority (UP) mappings to reconcile the marking recommendations offered by these
    two standards bodies, and, as such, to optimize wired-and-wireless interconnect
    QoS.</p>"
