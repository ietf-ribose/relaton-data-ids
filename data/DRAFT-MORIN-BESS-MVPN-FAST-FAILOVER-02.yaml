abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines multicast VPN extensions and procedures
    that\n   allow fast failover for upstream failures, by allowing downstream PEs\n
    \  to take into account the status of Provider-Tunnels (P-tunnels) when\n   selecting
    the upstream PE for a VPN multicast flow, and extending BGP\n   MVPN routing so
    that a C-multicast route can be advertized toward a\n   standby upstream PE.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
