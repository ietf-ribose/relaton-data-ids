abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to the Session Description Protocol
    (SDP) and to Session Description Protocol new generation (SDPng - work in progress).
    The intention of this draft is to provide descriptions in SDP and SDPng that specify
    the source port of media streams. Such specification within the session description
    is required in many network quality of service (QoS) management systems in order
    to be able to track the media streams from their source to their destination.
    Thus the QoS management system can differentiate the stream tracks end-to-end
    and guarantee QoS for every single media.</p>"
