abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The new Smart Energy (SE) Version 2 (SE 2) is aimed at providing
    end-\nto-end connectivity between energy providers, energy consumers, and\ntheir
    respective equipment.  This effort has been recognized as part\nof the Smart Grid
    roadmap by the US National Institute of Standards\nand Technology (NIST).  Whereas
    SE 1 was based on a proprietary\nZigBee stack, SE 2 will is based on IPv6 with
    support for IEEE\n802.15.4, HomePlug and use across the Internet.  The work in
    6LowApp\non application protocols and commissioning is an important component\nof
    SE 2.  This document introduces SE 2 along with requirements\nidentified for 6LowApp
    and considerations for future work.\n\t </p>\n      "
