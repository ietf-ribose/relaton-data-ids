abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft analyses the existing management plane OAM related
    works\n   in different SDOs, against the key objectives of Layer Independent\n
    \  OAM Management (LIME), to find the gap between them.  The results can\n   be
    used as the guidance for further work.  This gap analysis is not\n   targeted
    at L0-L2 transport OAM in ITU-T, either technology specific\n   or generic across
    those technologies.  Rather, it is intended to\n   leverage knowledge from that
    domain for the benefit of developing\n   generic layer independent OAM management
    for L3-L7 (and L2.5 MPLS\n   OAM).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
