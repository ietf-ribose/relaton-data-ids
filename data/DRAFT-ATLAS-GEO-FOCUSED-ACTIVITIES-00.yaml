abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document defines how Geographically-Focused IETF Activities
    are\n   organized and how IETF policies apply.  It is intended for eventual\n
    \  publication as a BCP but this is currently an initial strawman\n   proposal
    based upon the existing variety of experience with the\n   experimental activities
    in this space over the past several years.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
