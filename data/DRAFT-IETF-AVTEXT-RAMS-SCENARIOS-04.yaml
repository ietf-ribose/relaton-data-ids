abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions (RAMS) solution
    is a\n   method based on RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) that enables an\n
    \  RTP receiver to rapidly acquire and start consuming the RTP multicast\n   data.
    \ Upon a request from the RTP receiver, an auxiliary unicast RTP\n   retransmission
    session is set up between a retransmission server and\n   the RTP receiver, over
    which the reference information about the new\n   multicast stream the RTP receiver
    is about to join is transmitted at\n   an accelerated rate.  This often precedes,
    but may also accompany,\n   the multicast stream itself.  When there is only one
    multicast stream\n   to be acquired, the RAMS solution works in a straightforward
    manner.\n   However, when there are two or more multicast streams to be acquired\n
    \  from the same or different multicast RTP sessions, care should be\n   taken
    to configure each RAMS session appropriately.  This document\n   provides example
    scenarios and discusses how the RAMS solution could\n   be used in such scenarios.\n\n\t
