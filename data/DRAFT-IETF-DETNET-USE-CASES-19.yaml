abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft presents use cases from diverse industries which
    have in\n   common a need for \"deterministic flows\".  \"Deterministic\" in this\n
    \  context means that such flows provide guaranteed bandwidth, bounded\n   latency,
    and other properties germane to the transport of time-\n   sensitive data.  These
    use cases differ notably in their network\n   topologies and specific desired
    behavior, providing as a group broad\n   industry context for DetNet.  For each
    use case, this document will\n   identify the use case, identify representative
    solutions used today,\n   and describe potential improvements that DetNet can
    enable.  The Use\n   Case Common Themes section then extracts and enumerates the
    set of\n   common properties implied by these use cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
