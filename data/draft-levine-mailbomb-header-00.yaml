abstract:
- content: "<p>Many organizations have web forms that provoke an e-mail confirmation
    to the e-mail address provided in the form. Malicious entities do bulk form submissions
    with forged addresses, resulting in mail floods to the holders of those addresses.
    This document defines a message header to identify mail sent in response to web
    forms, so that recipient mail systems can better recognize and mitigate the mail
    floods.</p>"
