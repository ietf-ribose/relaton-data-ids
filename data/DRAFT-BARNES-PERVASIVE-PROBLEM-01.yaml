abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Documents published in 2013 have revealed several classes of\n
    \  \"pervasive\" attack on Internet communications.  In this document, we\n   review
    the main attacks that have been published, and develop a\n   threat model that
    describes these pervasive attacks.  Based on this\n   threat model, we discuss
    the techniques that can be employed in\n   Internet protocol design to increase
    the protocols robustness to\n   pervasive attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
