abstract:
- content: '<p>Control networks rely on application protocols like CoAP to enable
    RESTful communications in constrained environments. Many of these networks make
    use of "Sleepy Nodes": battery powered devices that switch off their (radio) interface
    during most of the time to conserve battery energy. As a result of this, Sleepy
    Nodes cannot be reached most of the time. This fact prevents using normal communication
    patterns as specified in the CoRE group, since the server-model is not applicable
    to these devices. This document discusses and specifies an architecture to support
    Sleepy Nodes such as battery-powered sensors in mesh networks with the goal of
    proposing a standardisation solution for Sleepy Node proxies.</p>'
