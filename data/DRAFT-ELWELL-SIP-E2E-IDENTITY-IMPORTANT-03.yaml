abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document surveys existing mechanisms in the Session Initiation\nProtocol
    (SIP) for identifying and authenticating the source of a SIP\nrequest (or caller
    identification).  It describes how identification\nand authentication are not
    always end-to-end and the problems that\nthis can lead to, particularly since
    media security based on\ntechniques such as DTLS-SRTP is dependent on end-to-end
    authenticated\nidentification of parties.\n\nThis work is being discussed on the
    sip@ietf.org mailing list.\n\t </p>\n      "
