abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the management of the mobility eventsconsidered
    in SPIRITS protocol and the definition of their relatedparameters.The mobility
    events management will allow a SPIRITS server tosubscribe to and to be notified
    of location changes of a mobileuser. The events would only be applicable to mobile
    users reachablethrough a CS network. The sending of these events must be allowed
    bysetting the related marks in the HLR. Besides, the SPIRITS protocolmust be able
    to translate the CAMEL operations involving mobilityinformation into events that
    can be transferred to the SPIRITSclient.</p>"
