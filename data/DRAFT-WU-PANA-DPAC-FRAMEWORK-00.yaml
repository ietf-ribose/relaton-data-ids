abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This informational draft describes the DPAC (Data Packet Access\nControl)
    framework, potentially under PANA, to efficiently control\n'data packets' to access
    the network. Instead of using potentially\nmore expensive crypto-based mechanisms
    such as IPSec (layer 3) or IEEE\n802.11i (layer 2), DPAC introduces the possibility
    of using and\nnegotiating a range of light-weight per-data-packet source\nauthentication
    methods to control the data packets from PANA Clients\n(PaC). In DPAC, each data
    packet sent from PaCs to Enhanced Point (EP)\ncan be classified, with high probability,
    as either valid or invalid.\nFurthermore, under this framework, it is possible
    for EP and PAA to\naccount reliably on the network usage of each PaC.\n\t </p>\n
