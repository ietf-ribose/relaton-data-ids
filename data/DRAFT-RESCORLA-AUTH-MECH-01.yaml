abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Authentication is perhaps the most basic security problem for
    design-\ners of network protocols. Even the early Internet protocols such as\nTELNET
    and FTP, which provided no other security services, made pro-\nvision for user
    authentication. Unfortunately, these early authenti-\ncation systems were wholly
    inadequate for the Internet Threat Model\n[REF] and a vast array of other authentication
    mechanisms have been\nintroduced in an attempt to close these holes.\nThe most
    striking thing about these security mechanisms is how many\nof them are essentially
    similar. There are only 7 basic classes of\nauthentication protocol but there
    are a large number of slightly dif-\nferent protocols with essentially the same
    security properties. This\nmemo surveys the space of authentication mechanisms,
    describes the\nbasic classes and provides examples of protocols which fit into
    each\nclass.\n\t </p>\n      "
