abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Adaptive DNS Discovery is chartered to define mechanisms that
    allow\n   clients to discover and select encrypted DNS resolvers.  This\n   document
    describes several use cases for discovering DNS resolvers\n   that support encrypted
    transports, and lists requirements that any\n   proposed discovery and selection
    mechanisms should address.\n\nDiscussion Venues\n\n   This note is to be removed
    before publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Source for this draft and an issue tracker
    can be found at\n   https://github.com/ietf-wg-add/draft-add-requirements.\n\n\t
