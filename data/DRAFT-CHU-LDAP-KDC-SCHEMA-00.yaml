abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an LDAP [RFC4511] schema for implementing
    the\nKerberos 5 [RFC4120] KDC Information Model\n[I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kdc-model].
    \ It also defines additional elements\nwhich are not covered by the Information
    Model, but are already in\ncommon use.1.  Background and Motivation\n\nBoth Kerberos
    and LDAP are frequently used separately for distributed\nauthentication.  They
    can also be used in combination, but typically\ntheir user databases remained
    separate.  This distinction in\ndatabases causes unnecessary duplication of data
    and administration\noverhead.  As such it is desirable for both systems to share
    a single\ndatabase.  Since the LDAP data model is more general it is most\nappropriate
    to store the Kerberos data in LDAP.\n\nA number of Kerberos implementations already
    have support for using\nLDAP as their KDC backing store.  However, each implementation
    uses\nits own schema, and the multiple schemas are mutually incompatible.\nFor
    the sake of interoperability and administrative ease, it is\nimportant to define
    a single standard schema that can be used\nuniformly by all Kerberos KDC implementations
    and interoperates with\nexisting LDAP specifications.2.  General Issues\n\t </p>\n
