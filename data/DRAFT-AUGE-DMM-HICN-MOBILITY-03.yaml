abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document first discusses the use of locators and identifiers
    in\n   mobility management architectures, and their implication on various\n   anchorless
    properties.  A new architecture is then proposed that is\n   purely based on identifiers,
    and more specifically names as defined\n   in Hybrid-ICN (hICN) [I-D.muscariello-intarea-hicn].
    \ The document\n   then focuses on two main cases: the end-point sends data (data\n
    \  producer) or the end-point receives data (data consumer).  These two\n   cases
    are taken into account entirely to provide anchorless mobility\n   management
    in hICN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
