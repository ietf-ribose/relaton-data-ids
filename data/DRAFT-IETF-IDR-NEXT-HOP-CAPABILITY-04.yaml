abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 5492 advertises the capabilities of the BGP peer.  When
    the BGP\n   peer is not the same as the BGP Next-Hop, it is useful to also be\n
    \  able to advertise the capability of the BGP Next-Hop, in particular\n   to
    advertise forwarding plane features.  This document defines a\n   mechanism to
    advertise such BGP Next Hop dependent Capabilities.\n\n   This document defines
    a new BGP non-transitive attribute to carry\n   Next-Hop Capabilities.  This attribute
    is guaranteed to be deleted or\n   updated when the BGP Next Hop is changed, in
    order to reflect the\n   capabilities of the new BGP Next-Hop.\n\n   This document
    also defines a Next-Hop capability to advertise the\n   ability to process the
    MPLS Entropy Label as an egress LSR for all\n   NLRI advertised in the BGP UPDATE.
    \ It updates RFC 6790 with regard\n   to this BGP signaling.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
