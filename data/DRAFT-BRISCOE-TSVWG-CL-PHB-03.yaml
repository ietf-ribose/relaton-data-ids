abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) builds on the concepts of
    RFC 3168, \n   \"The addition of Explicit Congestion Notification to IP\". However,
    \n   Pre-Congestion Notification aims at providing notification before any \n
    \  congestion actually occurs. Pre-Congestion Notification is applied to \n   real-time
    flows (such as voice, video and multimedia streaming) in \n   DiffServ networks.
    As described in [CL-DEPLOY], it enables \"pre\" \n   congestion control through
    two procedures, flow admission control and \n   flow pre-emption. The draft proposes
    algorithms that determine when a \n   PCN-enabled router writes Admission Marking
    and Pre-emption Marking \n   in a packet header, depending on the traffic level.
    The draft also \n   proposes how to encode these markings. We present simulation
    results \n   with PCN working in an edge-to-edge scenario using the marking \n
    \  algorithms described. Other marking algorithms will be investigated \n   in
    the future. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
