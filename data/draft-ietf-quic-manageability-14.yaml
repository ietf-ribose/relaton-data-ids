abstract:
- content: <p>This document discusses manageability of the QUIC transport protocol,
    focusing on the implications of QUIC's design and wire image on network operations
    involving QUIC traffic. It is intended as a "user's manual" for the wire image,
    providing guidance for network operators and equipment vendors who rely on the
    use of transport- aware network functions.</p>
