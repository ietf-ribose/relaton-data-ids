abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo presents a schema for NETCONF RPC and protocol operationsexpressed
    in RELAX NG (compact syntax). The schema is modular andcleanly separates the server
    and client part of the NETCONFvocabulary and also the schema extensions provided
    by optionalcapabilities. The modular structure improves readability but alsoenables
    selecting certain modules and assembling them into a grammarthat can be used for
    validation of NETCONF protocol data units.</p>"
