abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With more and more enterprises using cloud based services,
    the\n   distances between the user and the applications are growing.  A lot\n
    \  of the current applications are designed to work across LAN's and\n   have
    various inherent assumptions.  For multiple applications such as\n   High Performance
    Computing and Electronic Financial markets, the\n   response times are critical
    as is packet loss, while other\n   applications require more throughput.\n\n   [RFC3031]
    describes the architecture of MPLS based networks.  This\n   draft extends the
    MPLS architecture to allow for latency, loss and\n   jitter as properties.\n\n
    \  Note MPLS architecture for Multicast will be taken up in a future\n   version
    of the draft.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
