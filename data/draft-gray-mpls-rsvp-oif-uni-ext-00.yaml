abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft defines a signaling mechanism based on RSVP-TE ([2]) tosupport
    an Optical User Network Interface (UNI). This effort is inpart driven by work
    in the OIF as well as the recent draft onsignaling requirements for the optical
    UNI ([3]), and is consistentwith recent work on Generalized MPLS (see [4], [5],
    [6], and [7]). The main function of this draft is to identify the relevant mechanismsin
    RSVP-TE (including further extensions) to satisfy functionalrequirements for an
    Optical UNI. This draft reflects ongoing work atthe Optical Interworking Forum
    (OIF), however, not all of theconcepts/requirements have been approved by the
    OIF.</p>"
