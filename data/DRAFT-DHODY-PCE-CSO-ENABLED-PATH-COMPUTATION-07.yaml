abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Applications like cloud computing, video gaming, HD Video streaming,\n
    \  Live Concerts, Remote Medical Surgery, etc are offered by Data\n   Centers.
    \ These data centers are geographically distributed and\n   connected via a network.
    \ Many decisions are made in the Application\n   space without any concern of
    the underlying network.  Cross stratum\n   application/network optimization focus
    on the challenges and\n   opportunities presented by data center based applications
    and\n   carriers networks together [CSO-DATACNTR].\n\n   Constraint-based path
    computation is a fundamental building block for\n   traffic engineering systems
    such as Multiprotocol Label Switching\n   (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS)\n   networks.  [RFC4655] explains the architecture for
    a Path Computation\n   Element (PCE)-based model to address this problem space.\n\n
    \  This document explains the architecture for CSO enabled Path\n   Computation.\n\n\t
