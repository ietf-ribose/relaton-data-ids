abstract:
- content: "<p>The Subnet Selections option is provided by a DHCP client to DHCP a
    server as an indication to which subnet or subnets to select an address from for
    the client's lease. When present, the DHCP server will use this value as an indication
    to which configured subnet pool of addresses to select from, effectively divorcing
    the giaddr of its overloaded subnet selection function for a packet forwarded
    by a DHCP relay agent. The giaddr is retains its function as the address for the
    DHCP server to send replies to. An application for this new option would be to
    allow a Network Access Server (NAS) acting as DHCP proxy on behalf of a large
    number of dial-in users to obtain an address that is in the desired subnet(s)
    for the dial users without having to configure multiple giaddr values at the NAS,
    or requiring the NAS to utilize an address within each subnet.</p>"
