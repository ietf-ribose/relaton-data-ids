abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper attempts to describe in detail the problems associated with
    passing H.323 through firewalls and NAT devices, and discuss the appli- cability
    of a range of technologies currently available to solve these problems. We conclude
    that the only general solution to the problem is external application control
    of firewalls.</p>"
