abstract:
  content: "<p>IPsec specifications [1-6] do not work well with any mobilitydevice
    based on addresses [7]. Mobile IPv6 interaction with IPsecis still far from being
    well achieved. This is mainly due to badinterpretations of IPsec specifications.
    HIP (Host IdentityPayload) [9] should change this regrettable situation.This document
    specifies some points where improvements can bemade in many current implementations,
    on the way of making IPsecmore suitable for Mobile IPv6.</p>"
