abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Section 1.1.1 of RFC 3986 defines URI syntax as \"a federated
    and\n   extensible naming system wherein each scheme's specification may\n   further
    restrict the syntax and semantics of identifiers using that\n   scheme.\"  In
    other words, the structure of a URI is defined by its\n   scheme.  While it is
    common for schemes to further delegate their\n   substructure to the URI's owner,
    publishing independent standards\n   that mandate particular forms of URI substructure
    is inappropriate,\n   because that essentially usurps ownership.  This document
    further\n   describes this problematic practice and provides some acceptable\n
    \  alternatives for use in standards.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
