abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end\n
    \  paths within link-state graphs by encoding paths as sequences of\n   topological
    sub-paths, called \"segments\".\n\n   The link-state routing protocols (IS-IS,
    OSPF and OSPFv3) have been\n   extended to advertise the segments.  But flooding
    based propagation\n   of path segments using IGPs is limited by the perimeter
    of the IGP\n   domain.  For building paths which span across IGP domains (e.g.\n
    \  multiple ASes), the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is better suited as\n   its
    propagation perimeter is not limited like the IGPs.\n\n   This draft defines extensions
    to the BGP Link-state address-family to\n   carry path segment information via
    BGP.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
