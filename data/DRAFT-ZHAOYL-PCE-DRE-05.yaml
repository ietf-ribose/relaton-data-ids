abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Path Computation Element (PCE) is proposed for path computation
    in\n   multi-layer and multi-domain networks where PCE can be implemented in\n
    \  either centralized method or distributed method.  In the former case,\n   PCE
    can serve tens or hundreds of nodes simultaneously, while in the\n   later case,
    each node is equipped with a PCE, which can be regarded\n   as a distributed routing
    controller (DRC) in GMPLS networks and each\n   one of those provides similar
    path computation capability.  PCE and\n   DRC have different advantages in path
    computation respectively.  PCE\n   is suitable for cross-layer and cross-domain
    path computation,\n   especially in multi-constraints environment.  But distributed
    routing\n   controller is good at path computation in parallel ways and\n   distributed
    network control in local domain.  A cooperative path\n   computation architecture
    named Dual Routing Engine (DRE) is necessary\n   to be used in the future networks,
    for it based on the ideas of the\n   cooperation of these two types of path computation
    engines and can\n   take the advantages of both centralized and distributed method
    by\n   which the PCE is implemented.  The corresponding PCE communication\n   protocol
    extension and other protocol requirements for cooperation\n   between PCE and
    distributed routing controller are listed in this\n   document to recommend the
    standard interfaces between different\n   components in DRE architecture.\n\n\t
