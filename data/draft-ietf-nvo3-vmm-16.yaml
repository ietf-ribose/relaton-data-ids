abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes virtual machine (VM) mobility solutions commonly
    used in data centers built with an overlay network. This document is intended
    for describing the solutions and the impact of moving VMs, or applications, from
    one rack to another connected by the overlay network. For layer 2, it is based
    on using an NVA (Network Virtualization Authority) to NVE (Network Virtualization
    Edge) protocol to update ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) tables or neighbor
    cache entries after a VM moves from an old NVE to a new NVE. For Layer 3, it is
    based on address and connection migration after the move.</p>"
