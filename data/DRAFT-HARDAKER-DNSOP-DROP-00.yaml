abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When DNS replies to be sent over UDP exceed the requestor's
    UDP\n   payload size, servers are expected to set the Truncated bit (TC) and\n
    \  remove remove additional information from the response.  Clients\n   receiving
    the TC bit might choose to retry the request over TCP to\n   fetch the removed
    information.  Sometimes this extra information is\n   not important to the DNS
    resolution process and retrying over TCP may\n   not be needed.  This document
    defines the DP bit to indicate that the\n   dropped information that caused the
    TC bit was supplemental\n   information.  This is useful, for example, in the
    case of Extended\n   DNS Error information which may be mostly debugging related\n
    \  information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
