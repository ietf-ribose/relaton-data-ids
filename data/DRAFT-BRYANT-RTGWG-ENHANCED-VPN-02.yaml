abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes a number of enhancements that need to
    be made to\n   virtual private networks (VPNs) to support the needs of new\n   applications,
    particularly applications that are associated with 5G\n   services.  A network
    enhanced with these properties may form the\n   underpin of network slicing, but
    will also be of use in its own\n   right.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
