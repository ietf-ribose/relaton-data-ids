abstract:
- content: "<p>This document gives an overview of the architecture of the L-band Digital
    Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS), which provides a secure, scalable
    and spectrum efficient terrestrial data link for civil aviation. LDACS is a scheduled,
    reliable multi-application cellular broadband system with support for IPv6. LDACS
    provides a data link for IPv6 network-based aircraft guidance. High reliability
    and availability for IP connectivity over LDACS, as well as security, are therefore
    essential.</p>"
