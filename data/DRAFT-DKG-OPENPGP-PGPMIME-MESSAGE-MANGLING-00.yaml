abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An e-mail message with OpenPGP encryption and/or signature
    has\n   standard form.  However, some mail transport agents damage those\n   forms
    in transit.  A user-friendly mail user agent that encounters\n   such a mangled
    message may wish to try to process it anyway, despite\n   the message's non-standard
    structure.\n\n   This document aims to be a sort of bestiary of common message\n
    \  mangling patterns, along with guidance for implementers for how to\n   cope
    with messages structured in these common ways.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
