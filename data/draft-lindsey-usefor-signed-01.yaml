abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The huge growth of Netnews/Usenet in recent years has beenaccompanied
    by many attempts to abuse the system by various formsof malpractice, particularly
    the forging of various headers,causing it to appear that articles came from parties
    other thanthose that actually injected them or conveyed some Approval thatthe
    real poster was not entitled to give. Insofar as Netnews isregularly gatwayed
    to and from Email systems, these problems alsoextend to the Email domain.This
    document provides a cryptographically secure means whereby itcan be established
    beyond doubt that relevant headers of a Netnewsarticle or an Email message have
    not been tampered with intransit, and that they were indeed originated by the
    personpurporting to have done so. It seeks to supplement, rather than tosupplant,
    the existing protocols for signing the bodies ofarticles and messages.[This proposal
    arises from the activities of the Usenet Format WorkingGroup, which is charged
    with updating the Netnews standards. Commentsare invited, preferably sent to the
    mailing list of the Group atusenet-format@landfield.com.]</p>"
