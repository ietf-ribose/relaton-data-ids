abstract:
  content: "<p>PIM is widely deployed multicast protocol. PIM protocol is defined
    in [RFC4601] and [RFC7761]. As deployment for PIM protocol growing day by day,
    user expect least traffic loss and fast convergence in case of any network failure.
    This document provides extension to existing defined protocol which would improve
    stability of PIM protocol with respect to traffic loss and convergence time when
    the PIM DR is down.</p>"
