abstract:
- content: <p>Recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board and ICANN's Security
    and Stability Advisory Committee have discussed the problems that the DNS is likely
    to experience with top-level domains that have address records in them (so-called
    "dotless domains"). However, these statements spoke of the problem mostly as theoretical,
    when in fact there are such TLDs today. This document lists the current dotless
    TLDs, and gives a script for finding them. This document lists data about dotless
    TLDs, but does not address the policy and technology issues other than to point
    to the statements of others.</p>
