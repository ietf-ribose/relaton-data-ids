abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A BGP path attribute for the purpose of network diagnostics
    is\n   described.  It is non-transitive, such that BGP speakers will not\n   forward
    it by default.  It is structured as a list of elements.  An\n   element begins
    with the BGP identifier and AS number of the speaker\n   that appends the element
    and includes a list of TLVs.  Any speaker\n   can add or remove an element to/from
    the list.  TLVs for a timestamp\n   and for a checksum are described.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
