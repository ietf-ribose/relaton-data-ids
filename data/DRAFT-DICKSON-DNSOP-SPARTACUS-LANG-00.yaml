abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As part of the SPARTACUS DNS gateway system, building a full
    DNS\n   parser was necessary.  Parsing DNS packets is the only way to avoid\n
    \  propogating packets which are not correctly formatted DNS packets.\n\n   In
    order to facilitate building a new parser from scratch, the author\n   chose to
    build a parser-builder which takes as input, a description\n   of the DNS wire
    format.\n\n   This document describes the language created to facilitate this\n
    \  description, and includes the resulting DNS wire format description\n   in
    this language.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
