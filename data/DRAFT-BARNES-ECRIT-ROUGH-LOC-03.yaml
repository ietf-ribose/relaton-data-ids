abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Emergency calling works best when precise location is available
    for\nemergency call routing.  However, there are situations in which a\nlocation
    provider is unable or unwilling to provide precise location,\nyet still wishes
    to enable subscribers to make emergency calls.  This\ndocument describes the level
    of location accuracy that providers must\nprovide to enable emergency call routing.
    \ In addition, we descibe\nhow emergency services and non-emergency services can
    be invoked by\nan endpoint that does not have access to its precise location.\n\t
