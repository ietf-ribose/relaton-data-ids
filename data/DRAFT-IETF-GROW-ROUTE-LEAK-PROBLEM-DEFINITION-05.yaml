abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A systemic vulnerability of the Border Gateway Protocol routing\n
    \  system, known as 'route leaks', has received significant attention in\n   recent
    years.  Frequent incidents that result in significant\n   disruptions to Internet
    routing are labeled \"route leaks\", but to\n   date a common definition of the
    term has been lacking.  This document\n   provides a working definition of route
    leaks, keeping in mind the\n   real occurrences that have received significant
    attention.  Further,\n   this document attempts to enumerate (though not exhaustively)\n
    \  different types of route leaks based on observed events on the\n   Internet.
    \ The aim is to provide a taxonomy that covers several forms\n   of route leaks
    that have been observed and are of concern to Internet\n   user community as well
    as the network operator community.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
