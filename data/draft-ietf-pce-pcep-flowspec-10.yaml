abstract:
- content: '<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component capable
    of selecting paths through a traffic engineering network. These paths may be supplied
    in response to requests for computation, or may be unsolicited instructions issued
    by the PCE to network elements. Both approaches use the PCE Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) to convey the details of the computed path. Traffic flows may be categorized
    and described using "Flow Specifications". RFC XXXX defines the Flow Specification
    and describes how Flow Specification Components are used to describe traffic flows.
    RFC XXXX also defines how Flow Specifications may be distributed in BGP to allow
    specific traffic flows to be associated with routes. This document specifies a
    set of extensions to PCEP to support dissemination of Flow Specifications. This
    allows a PCE to indicate what traffic should be placed on each path that it is
    aware of. RFC Editor Note: Please replace XXXX in the Abstract with the RFC number
    assigned to draft-ietf-idr-rfc5575bis when it is published. Please remove this
    note.</p>'
