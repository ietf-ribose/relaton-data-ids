abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Limiting and preventing SPAM for Internet Telephony (SPIT) is
    seen as\nan important task for future security work in the Voice over IP\nenvironment.
    \ This document addresses the problem by utilizing the\nconcept introduced by
    the SIP Identity Framework in combination with\nthe Security Assertion Markup
    Language (SAML) to warrant certain\nsecurity relevant attributes from one administrative
    domain to\nanother.  This approach allows the destination domain to make\nintelligent
    filtering decisions when receiving voice calls.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
