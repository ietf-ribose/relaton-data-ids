abstract:
  content: "<p>ETR Address Forwarding (EAF) is a novel method by which an IPv4 Core-Edge
    Separation solution to the Internet's routing scaling problemcan tunnel packets
    from an ITR to an ETR. EAF involves using 31 bitsof the IPv4 header for new purposes:
    bit 48, the More Fragments flag,the Fragment Offset field and the Header Checksum
    field - to carry a30 bit ETR address. Consequently, packets in this format need
    to behandled by routers with upgraded functionality. EAF is analternative to encapsulation
    and has advantages including: simplerITRs and ETRs, direct support for conventional
    RFC 1191 PMTUD, noencapsulation overhead and full compatibility with IPsec AH
    andTraceroute. This I-D also briefly explores an alternative to thisapproach:
    a new header, of the same length and different, with adifferent 4 bit Version,
    to carry 31 bits of ETR address.</p>"
