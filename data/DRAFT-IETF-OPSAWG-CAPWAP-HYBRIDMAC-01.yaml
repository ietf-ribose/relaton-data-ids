abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CAPWAP protocol defines two modes of operation for IEEE
    802.11\n   WTPs: Split and Local MAC (medium access control), as described in\n
    \  [RFC5415],[RFC5416].  Specifically, [RFC5416] describes in detail the\n   division
    of labor between WTP and AC in the Split and Local MAC\n   modes.  Unfortunately,
    there are many functions that have not yet\n   been clearly defined whether they
    belong to the WTP or the AC.  For\n   example IEEE 802.11 encryption is specified
    as located in either in\n   the AC or the WTP with no clear way to negotiate where
    it should be\n   located.  This lack of specification leads to interoperability\n
    \  between AC and WTP when AC and WTP come from different vendors.  To\n   solve
    this problem, this specification defines the concept of IEEE\n   802.11 MAC profile
    where each profile refers to a table containing an\n   unambigous division of
    labor between WTP and AC.  The profile is used\n   as follows: the WTP informs
    the AC of the supported profiles and the\n   AC selects the profile when it configures
    the WTP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
