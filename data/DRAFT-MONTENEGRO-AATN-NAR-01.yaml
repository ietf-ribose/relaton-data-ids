abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network address (and port) translation is a useful technology.\n
    \  However, several shortcomings have been identified (Mobile IP, IPSEC\n   and
    QOS flows). In these cases, NAT may be complemented by the use\n   of NAR (Negotiated
    Address Reuse). The negotiation phase in NAR is\n   currently based on SOCKS.\n\n\t
