abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The DCLASS object is proposed in [DCLASS] to represent and carry
    Diffrentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs) within RSVP messages. The principle
    use of the DCLASS object is to carry DSCP informationbetween a DS network and
    upstream nodes that may wish to mark packetswith DSCP values. A network element
    in the DS network determines the value for DSCP which is further carried as a
    DCLASS object in RSVP RESV message to the sender host.</p>"
