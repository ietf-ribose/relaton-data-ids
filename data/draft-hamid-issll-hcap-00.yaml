abstract:
- content: "<p>The DCLASS object is proposed in [DCLASS] to represent and carry Diffrentiated
    Services Code Points (DSCPs) within RSVP messages. The principle use of the DCLASS
    object is to carry DSCP information between a DS network and upstream nodes that
    may wish to mark packets with DSCP values. A network element in the DS network
    determines the value for DSCP which is further carried as a DCLASS object in RSVP
    RESV message to the sender host.</p>"
