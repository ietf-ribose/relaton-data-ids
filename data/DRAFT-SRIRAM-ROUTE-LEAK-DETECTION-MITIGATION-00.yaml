abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In [I-D.ietf-sriram-route-leak-problem-definition], the authors
    have\n   provided a definition of the route leak problem, and also enumerated\n
    \  several types of route leaks.  In this document, we first examine\n   which
    of those route-leak types are detected and mitigated by the\n   existing BGPSEC
    protocol [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol-09].  Where\n   the current BGPSEC protocol
    doesn't offer a solution, this document\n   suggests an enhancement that would
    extend the route-leak detection\n   and mitigation capability of BGPSEC.  The
    solution can be implemented\n   in BGP without necessarily tying it to BGPSEC.
    \ Incorporating the\n   solution in BGPSEC is one way of implementing it in a
    secure way.  We\n   do not claim to have provided a solution for all possible
    types of\n   route leaks, but the solution covers several, especially considering\n
    \  some significant route-leak attacks or occurrences that have been\n   observed
    in recent years.  The document also includes a stopgap\n   method for detection
    and mitigation of route leaks for the phase when\n   BGPSEC (path validation)
    is not yet deployed but only origin\n   validation is deployed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
