abstract:
- content: "<p>The world of Internet transport protocols is changing, after decades
    of TCP and UDP operation. Several proposals have been submitted for the past years
    (and counting) to introduce other transport protocols that aim at reducing the
    web latency of that of TCP or avoiding the burden of the various middle-boxes
    (NATs, firewalls, for one) encountered along the communication path. Such initiatives,
    although not new, are motivated by the complexity of some (non-transparent) networking
    functions. This document advocates for the definition of transport profiles and
    the need to document recommendations for middleboxes, including Performance Enhancement
    Proxies (PEPs) behaviors. A collaboration among the involved players (service
    providers, vendors) is required to soften the current complications encountered
    in the Internet at large.</p>"
