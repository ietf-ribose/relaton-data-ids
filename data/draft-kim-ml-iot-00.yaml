abstract:
- content: "<p>This document shares knowledge and insights regarding applying machine
    learning techniques on wireless sensor networks. It firstly introduces advantages
    and difficulties in adopting machine learning techniques on wireless sensor networks.
    Though dynamicity and unpredictability of wireless networks make it difficult
    to train the model with various possible scenarios, it has strong ability in terms
    of flexibility. This document also overviews several works that applied machine
    learning techniques on diverse research areas including networking, communications
    and lossy environment. The ultimate purpose of this document is to discuss a proper
    research direction aiming the realization of a system that detects, predicts and
    recovers from abnormal situations on wireless sensor networks.</p>"
