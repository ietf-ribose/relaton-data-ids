abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is a survey of the filtering of content.  The
    focus is\n   on the human rights involved as cited in the Universal Declaration
    of\n   Human Rights\" which is one of the foundational documents for HRPC.\n   The
    recent years have seen an increase in content filtering for a\n   variety of reasons
    including to further the aims of governments who\n   wish to maintain their rule
    and suppress dissent but also to enforce\n   cultural norms, human rights and
    compliance with the law.  Filters\n   also exist for security (botnets, malware
    etc.), user-defined\n   policies (parental control, corporate blocking of social
    networks\n   during work time, etc.), spam control, upload of copyrighted material\n
    \  and other reasons. This document is based on several real world\n   considerations:
    the existence of national and regional sovereignty,\n   Internet Service Providers
    (ISPs) and Content Distribution Networks\n   (CDNs) that provide connectivity
    and content hosting services, Over-\n   the-top (OTTs) and Content Delivery Platforms
    (CDPs) that play a\n   disproportionate role in capturing the attention and \"eyeballs\"
    of\n   many of the users of the Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
