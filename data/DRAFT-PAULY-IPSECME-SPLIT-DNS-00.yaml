abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines two new Configuration Payload Attribute
    Types\n   for the IKEv2 protocol that together define a set of private DNS\n   domains
    which should be resolved by DNS servers reachable through an\n   IPsec connection,
    while leaving all other DNS resolution unchanged.\n   This allows for split-DNS
    views for multiple domains and includes\n   support for private DNSSEC trust anchors.
    \ The information obtained\n   via the new attribute types can be used to reconfigure
    a locally\n   running DNS server with DNS forwarding for specific private domains.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
