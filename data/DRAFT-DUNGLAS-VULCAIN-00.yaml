abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines new HTTP headers (and query parameters)\n
    \  allowing a client to inform the server of the exact data it needs:\n\n   *
    \ \"Preload\" informs the server that relations of the main requested\n      resource
    will be necessary.  The server can then reduce the number\n      of round-trips
    by sending the related resources ahead of time\n      using HTTP/2 [RFC7540] Server
    Push.  When using Server Push isn't\n      possible (resources served by a different
    authority, server not\n      supporting HTTP/2...), the server can hint the client
    to fetch\n      those resources as early as possible by using the \"preload\"
    link\n      relation [W3C.CR-preload-20171026] and the \"103\" status code\n      [RFC8297].\n\n
    \  *  \"Fields\" informs the server of the list of fields of the retrieved\n      resources
    that will be used.  In order to improve performance and\n      reduce bandwidth
    usage, the server can omit the fields not\n      requested.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
