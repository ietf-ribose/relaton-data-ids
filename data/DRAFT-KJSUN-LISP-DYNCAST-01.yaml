abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Dynamic Anycast (Dyncast) is a new routing approach to support\n
    \  equivalent services running in distributed geolocations and connect\n   to
    them by considering both network-related metric and service-\n   related metric.
    \ In LISP, it is possible to support anycast EIDs and/\n   or anycast RLOCs without
    any modification, so it is suitable for\n   providing dyncast routing.  In this
    document, it describes the LISP-\n   based dyncast architecture and related standard
    works to meet dyncast\n   requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
