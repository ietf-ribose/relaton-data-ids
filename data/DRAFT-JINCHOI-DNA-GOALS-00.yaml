abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Upon establishing a new link-layer connection, a host may or
    may not \n   have valid IP configuration for Internet Connectivity. A host may
    \n   determine whether its IP configuration is valid by checking Network \n   Layer
    link change. With the information gathered, a host may decide \n   if their own
    configuration needs to be updated and initiate a new \n   configuration in case
    of link change. This procedure is described as \n   Detecting Network Attachment.
    \n\t </p>\n      "
