abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new Hop-by-Hop IPv6 option that is used to
    record the minimum Path MTU along the forward path between a source host to a
    destination host. This collects a minimum Path MTU recorded along the path to
    the destination. The value can then be communicated back to the source using the
    return Path MTU field in the option. This Hop-by-Hop option is intended to be
    used in environments like Data Centers and on paths between Data Centers, to allow
    them to better take advantage of paths able to support a large Path MTU. The method
    could also be useful in other environments, including the general Internet.</p>"
