abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies a TCP option for service numbers. The current
    SYN destination port is used both to indicate the desired service and as a connection
    demultiplexing field. This option separates those two functions, retaining the
    current destination port solely for demultiplexing and indicating the service
    separately in a service number option (SNO). By decoupling these two functions,
    SNO allows a larger number of concurrent connections for a single service, as
    might be useful between fixed addresses of proxies.</p>"
