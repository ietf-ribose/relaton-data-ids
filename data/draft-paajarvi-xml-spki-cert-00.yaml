abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft suggests a standard form for encoding SPKI certificates
    inXML as opposed to the original s-expression encoding defined in[SPKI]. The standard
    form is defined as an XML document typedefinition (DTD). The main emphasis is
    on the XML-encoding of anauthorization certificate that is the basic SPKI certificate
    form.This draft provides also a brief introduction to XML and a shortdiscussion
    about the benefits of choosing XML as the certificateencoding format.In addition,
    this draft discusses the problems of automaticprocessing of tags (attributes and
    authorizations transferred by acertificate are called tags in SPKI) when reducing
    certificates. Anexample of encoding Java permissions in an SPKI certificate is
    givento demonstrate the problem and, finally, a solution to this problemis suggested.</p>"
