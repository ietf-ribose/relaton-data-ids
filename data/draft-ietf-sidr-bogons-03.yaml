abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines a standard profile for Bogon OriginAttestations
    (BOAs). A BOA is a digitally signed object thatprovides a means of verifying that
    an IP address block holder has notauthorised any Autonomous System (AS) to originate
    routes that areequivalent to any of the addresses listed in the BOA. A BOA alsoprovides
    a means of verifying that a BGP speaker is not using an ASwithout appropriate
    authority. The proposed application of BOAs isintended to fit within the requirements
    for adding security measuresto inter-domain routing, including the ability to
    support incrementaland piecemeal deployment of such measures, and does not require
    anychanges to the specification of the Border Gateway Protocol.</p>"
