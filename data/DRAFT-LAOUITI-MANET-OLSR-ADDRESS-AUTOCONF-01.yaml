abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Several MANET routing protocols have been recently promoted
    to\n   experimental RFCs.  However, autoconfiguration of MANET networks is\n   still
    an unsettled area.  This document proposes a protocol for\n   autoconfiguration
    for both IPv4 or IPv6.  Its corner stone is an\n   conflict-detection algorithm.
    \ It aims at conceptual simplicity:\n   essentially, each node periodically sends
    its addresses and an\n   identifier.  Conflicts are detected as identifier mismatches.
    \ This\n   protocol might be used with any MANET protocol, although it naturally\n
    \  suits the OLSR routing protocol (on which we focus), with a light\n   increase
    of control message overhead.\n\t </p>\n      "
