abstract:
- content: "<p>Performing DNSKEY algorithm transitions with DNSSEC signing is unfortunately
    challenging to get right in practice without decent tooling support. This document
    weighs the correct, completely secure way of rolling keys against an alternate,
    significantly simplified, method that takes a zone through an insecure state.</p>"
