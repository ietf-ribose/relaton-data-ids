abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet draft provides a set of example text for the\n
    \  replacement of draft-ietf-idr-bgp-model-02.txt with the IETF models\n   based
    on the Network Management Datastore Architecture to be released\n   in draft-ietf-idr-bgp-model-03.txt.
    \ This draft is provided for the\n   IDR WG by potential editors as example text
    for draft-ietf-idr-bgp-\n   model-03.txt for the yang models.  Please send review
    comments or\n   suggestions to these potential editors and the IDR working group\n
    \  (idr@ietf.org).\n\n   This document defines a YANG data model for configuring
    and managing\n   BGP, including protocol, policy, and operational aspects based
    on\n   data center, carrier and content provider operational requirements.\n\n\t
