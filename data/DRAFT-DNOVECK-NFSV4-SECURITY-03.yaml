abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the core security features of the NFSv4\n
    \  family of protocols, applying to all minor versions.  The discussion\n   includes
    the use of security features provided by RPC on a per-\n   connection basis.\n\n
    \  This preliminary version of the document, is intended, in large part,\n   to
    result in working group discussion regarding existing NFSv4\n   security issues
    and to provide a framework for addressing these\n   issues and obtaining working
    group consensus regarding necessary\n   changes.\n\n   When a successor document
    is eventually published as an RFC, it will\n   supersede the description of security
    appearing in existing minor\n   version specification documents such as RFC 7530
    and RFC 8881.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
