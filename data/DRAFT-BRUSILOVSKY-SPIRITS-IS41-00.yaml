abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This   document  describes  IS-41  mobility-related  parameters
    \ (WIN\ninformation  and  its  encoding)  which  the  SPIRITS  protocol   can\ntransport
    \ from  the PSTN (wireline, as well as wireless) into the IP\nnetwork.  The SPIRITS
    protocol is a protocol through which  PSTN  can\nrequest  actions  (services)
    \ to  be carried out in the IP network in\nresponse to events occurring within
    the PSTN/IN (wireline, as well as \nwireless).   This  draft  outlines,   what
    \  IS-41   mobility-ralated\nparameters  are  of  immediate  interest  to SPIRITS,
    how they may be\nextracted and encoded for use within the SPIRITS domain.    IS-41
    \ is\nused  as  an example protocol to clarify the SPIRITS message encoding\nprocess.
    \ This Internet-Draft has been written  in  response  to  the\nSPIRITS WG  chairs'
    \ call  for SPIRITS Protocol proposals.  It may be\nviewed as being a direct contribution
    to the Informational RFC on the \nSPIRITS protocol parameters.    Section  1  of
    \ this  document  gives\nbackground  of  wireless  cellular  communication networks,
    including\nCore Networks,  Section  2  gives  a  backgrouder  for  the  Wireless\nIntelligent
    \ Network  (WIN).  Sections  3  and  4 briefly explain WIN\nFunctional and Physical
    \ entities.    Section  5  provides  WIN  BCSM\nDescription.  Section  6  gives
    \ ASN.1  Notation for the selected WIN\nParameters.  Sections  7,  8,  9,  10
    \ and  11  respectively  provide\nAcknowledgements,  References,  Author's  Address,
    \ Acronyms and Full\nCopyright Statement, as required.  Addendum 1 contains figures.
