abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution provides Designated\n
    \  Forwarder election procedures for multi-homing Ethernet Segments.\n   These
    procedures have been enhanced further by applying Highest\n   Random Weight (HRW)
    Algorithm for Designated Forwarded election in\n   order to avoid unnecessary
    DF status changes upon a failure.  This\n   draft improves these procedures by
    providing a fast Designated\n   Forwarder (DF) election upon recovery of the failed
    link or node\n   associated with the multi-homing Ethernet Segment.  The solution
    is\n   independent of number of EVIs associated with that Ethernet Segment\n   and
    it is performed via a simple signaling between the recovered PE\n   and each PEs
    in the multi-homing group.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
