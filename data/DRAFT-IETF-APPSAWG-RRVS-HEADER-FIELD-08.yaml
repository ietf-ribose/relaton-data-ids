abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an extension for the Simple Mail Transfer\n
    \  Protocol called RRVS, and a header field called Require-Recipient-\n   Valid-Since,
    to provide a method for senders to indicate to receivers\n   the point in time
    when the sender last confirmed the ownership of the\n   target mailbox.  This
    can be used to detect changes of mailbox\n   ownership, and thus prevent mail
    from being delivered to the wrong\n   party.\n\n   The intended use of these facilities
    is on automatically generated\n   messages that might contain sensitive information,
    though it may also\n   be useful in other applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
