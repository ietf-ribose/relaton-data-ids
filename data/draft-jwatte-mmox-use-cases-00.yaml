abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Virtual worlds, typically implemented as multi-user sharedsimulations,
    are becoming increasingly used for serious work inaddition to the traditional
    uses of research and entertainment.Based on actual need identified by interaction
    with various customerswhen working on virtual world interoperability over the
    last fouryears, this draft summarizes the main interoperability functionsrequired
    to satisfy those needs. From these use cases, requirementsfor the MMOX virtual
    world interoperability charter can be derived.</p>"
