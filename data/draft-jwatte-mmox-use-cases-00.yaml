abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual worlds, typically implemented as multi-user shared simulations,
    are becoming increasingly used for serious work in addition to the traditional
    uses of research and entertainment. Based on actual need identified by interaction
    with various customers when working on virtual world interoperability over the
    last four years, this draft summarizes the main interoperability functions required
    to satisfy those needs. From these use cases, requirements for the MMOX virtual
    world interoperability charter can be derived.</p>"
