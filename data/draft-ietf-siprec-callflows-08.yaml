abstract:
- content: "<p>Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
    environments, such as call centers and financial trading organizations. In some
    of these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory, compliance,
    and consumer-protection reasons. The recording of a session is typically performed
    by sending a copy of a media stream to a recording device. This document lists
    call flows with metadata snapshots sent from a Session Recording Client (SRC)
    to a Session Recording Server (SRS).</p>"
