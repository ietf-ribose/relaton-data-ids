abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Logical-interface is a software semantic internal to the
    host\n   operating system.  This semantic is available in all popular\n   operating
    systems and is used in various protocol implementations.\n   The Logical-interface
    support is required on the mobile node attached\n   to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain,
    for leveraging various network-based\n   mobility management features such as
    inter-technology handoffs,\n   multihoming and flow mobility support.  This document
    explains the\n   operational details of Logical-interface construct and the specifics\n
    \  on how the link-layer implementations hide the physical interfaces\n   from
    the IP stack and from the network nodes on the attached access\n   networks.  Furthermore,
    this document identifies the applicability of\n   this approach to various link-layer
    technologies and analyzes the\n   issues around it when used in conjunction with
    various mobility\n   management features.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
