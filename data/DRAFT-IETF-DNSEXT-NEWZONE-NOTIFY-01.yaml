abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes the NEWZONE_NOTIFY opcode for DNS, by which
    a \nprimary master server advises a set of slave servers that there is a \nzone
    has been created and that a query should be initiated to \ndiscover the new zone
    data.\n\nThis draft also specifies a mechanism for the slave servers to \nachieve
    authenticated synchronization of zone data as well as zone \nsynchronization information
    with the primary when a zone is created \non the primary.\n\t </p>\n      "
