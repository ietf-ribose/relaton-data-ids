abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When using Traffic Engineering (TE) in a dual-stack IPv4/IPv6
    network\n   the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) TE Label Switched Paths\n
    \  (LSP) infrastructure may be duplicated, even if the destination IPv4\n   and
    IPv6 addresses belong to the same remote router.  In order to\n   achieve an integrated
    MPLS TE LSP infrastructure, OSPF routes must be\n   computed over MPLS TE tunnels
    created using information propagated in\n   another OSPF instance.  This is solved
    by advertising cross-address\n   family (X-AF) OSPF TE information.\n\n   This
    document describes an update to RFC5786 that allows for the easy\n   identification
    of a router's local X-AF IP addresses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
