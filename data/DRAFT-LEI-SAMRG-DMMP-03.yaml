abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a Dynamic Mesh-based overlay Multicast\nProtocol
    (DMMP) framework to support multicast data delivery\napplications without relying
    on classic IP multicast, including\nmulticast group management, overlay hierarchy
    establishment,\nmulticast tree construction and data forwarding scheme from a
    source\nto a number of receivers.  The DMMP framework builds on control plane\nfunctions
    which dynamically manage an overlay core and a multicast\ntree.  The key idea
    is a number of end hosts self-organize into an\noverlay mesh, and dynamically
    maintain such a mesh.  Based on the\nconstructed mesh, some core-based clusters
    are formed with capacity-\naware trees inside.  Then, a multicast tree consisting
    of DMMP-aware\nend hosts (and/or specific routers) is built on the top of the\noverlay
    core for the efficient delivery of the multicast data.\n\t </p>\n      "
