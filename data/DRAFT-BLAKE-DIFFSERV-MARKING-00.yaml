abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ''Packet marking'' is proposed as an architectural generalization
    of\n   the type of service (TOS) and precedence facilities of IPv4 [RFC795,\n
    \  RFC1349], as well as the traffic class facilities of IPv6 [IPv6].  It\n   is
    intended to encompass all mechanisms by which a host or a router\n   may mark
    a packet to invoke some differentiated packet handling\n   behavior by another
    node along the transit path of the packet.  This\n   memo examines several proposed
    applications of a packet marking\n   facility and attempts to categorize each
    application in terms of the\n   behavioral requirements it imposes on hosts and
    routers.  In\n   addition, issues related to the deployment of packet marking,\n
    \  including provisioning, authorization, and security, are examined.\n   This
    memo is proposed as a framework to focus discussion on\n   implementation issues
    and mechanisms as new differentiated services\n   enabled by a packet marking
    facility are introduced into the\n   Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
