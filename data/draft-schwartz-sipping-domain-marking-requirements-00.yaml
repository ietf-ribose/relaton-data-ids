abstract:
  content: "\t <t>SIP as defined in RFC 3261 [1] defines a Via header as a construct
    tobe used for upstream response routing and for downstream assistancein loop detection.
    There is an increasing need on downstreamadministrative domains (ADs) to gain
    visibility into all the ADs inits upstream path. The information needed is not
    IP based asinternal architectures at upstream ADs is of no consequence todownstream
    ADs. Logical domain marking, however, is desperatelyneeded for any traffic analysis
    to occur at the receiving side.Gathering AD information from Via headers is non
    obvious and in manyinstances nearly impossible. This documents identifies therequirements
    for addressing this issue.</p>"
