abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-time Transport Control Protocol(RTCP) is designed
    to operate\n   along with Real-time Transport Protocol(RTP) in unicast, single-\n
    \  source multicast and any-source multicast environments.  With the\n   availability
    of overlay multicast and Application Layer\n   Multicast(ALM), the suitability
    of RTCP in such environments need to\n   be analyzed.  The applicability of the
    existing RTCP reporting\n   architectures in overlay multicast and ALM environments
    are\n   investigated and the new features that may be required are discussed\n
    \  in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
