abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When split-horizon DNS is deployed by a network, certain domains
    are\n   only resolvable by querying the network-designated DNS server rather\n
    \  than a public DNS server.  DNS clients which use DNS servers not\n   provided
    by the network need to route those DNS domain queries to the\n   network-designated
    DNS server.  This document informs DNS clients of\n   split-horizon DNS, their
    DNS domains, and is compatible with\n   encrypted DNS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
