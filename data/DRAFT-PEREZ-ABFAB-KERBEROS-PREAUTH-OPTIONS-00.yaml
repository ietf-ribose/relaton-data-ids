abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Kerberos is widely used for authentication within organisations.
    \ It\n   is not, however, commonly used for authentication between domains or\n
    \  realms (\"cross-realm operation\").  Abfab is a new architecture, based\n   on
    the AAA framework, that provides a mechanism for federating\n   authentication
    between realms.\n\n   AAA protocols are already widely used for federating authentication\n
    \  for network access scenarios today.  It has been proposed that Abfab\n   could
    be used to provide a mechanism yielding cross-realm\n   functionality for Kerberos.
    \ This document discusses two alternative\n   approaches with the aim of informing
    and facilitating discussion.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
