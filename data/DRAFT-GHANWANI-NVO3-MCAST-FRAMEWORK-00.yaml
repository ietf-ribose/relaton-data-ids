abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses a framework of supporting multicast
    traffic,\n   , in a network that uses Network Virtualization using Overlays over\n
    \  Layer 3 (NVO3). Both infrastructure multicast and application-\n   specific
    multicast are discussed. It describes the various\n   mechanisms and considerations
    that can be used for delivering such\n   traffic as well as the data plane and
    control plane considerations\n   for each of the mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n
