abstract:
  content: "<p>LEDBAT is an alternative experimental congestion control algorithm.LEDBAT
    enables an advanced networking application to minimize theextra delay it induces
    in the bottleneck while saturating thebottleneck. It thus implements an end-to-end
    version of scavengerservice. LEDBAT has been been implemented in BitTorrent DNA,
    as theexclusive congestion control mechanism, and in uTorrent, as anexperimental
    mechanism, and deployed in the wild with favorableresults.</p>"
