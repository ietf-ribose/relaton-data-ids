abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Persistent\n
    \  Web IDentifiers to web material in web archives using the 'pwid'\n   namespace
    identifier.  The purpose of the standard is to support\n   general, global, sustainable,
    humanly readable, technology agnostic,\n   persistent and precise web references
    for web materials in web\n   archives in a way that can make them potentially
    resolvable.\n\n   The PWID URN can assist in two ways: First, by providing potential\n
    \  resolvable precise and persistent reference scheme for web archive\n   materials,
    which is not sufficiently covered by existing web\n   reference practices and
    new suggested referencing methods.  Second,\n   to specify web elements in web
    collections (also known as web corpus)\n   even for collections where there are
    references to web elements in\n   several archives.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
