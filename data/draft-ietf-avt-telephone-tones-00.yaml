abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This note describes two RTP payload formats for in-band telephonysignal
    events (TSE) such as DTMF, dial-tone, ring-tone, off-hook, SIT, etc.One payload
    is designed to carry a named signal, and the other is designedcarry a compact
    representation of actual audio waveform cadence to be played.The two formats are
    independent, but they can be used together very usefullywithin redundant audio
    payloads; this enables highly efficient and robusttransport of telephony network
    signal events along with a representation ofthe actual audio media associated
    to the signal events. Acknowledgements: This internet draft is an extension of
    H. Schulzrinne'sdraft ietf-avt-dtmf-00.txt and borrows heavily from it (including
    copyingactual text). The main extensions appearing in this draft are as follows:
    a) many other telephony call progress tones and signal events have beenadded to
    the original DTMF and flash-hook of ietf-avt-dtmf-00.txt (anattempt has been made
    to align this with [MGCP] and [E.180 supp2]b) a second payload is defined which
    carries a highly compactfrequency representation of the audio waveform of the
    signal;c) a few clarifications about reliability and redundancy, including howthe
    two payloads will work together. Acknowledgement is also due to [MGCP]; part of
    this draft is an attemptto use RTP to provide the signal transport required by
    MGCP, in a waywhich can be reused by a large class of applications.</p>"
