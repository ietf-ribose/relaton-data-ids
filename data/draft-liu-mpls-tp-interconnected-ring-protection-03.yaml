abstract:
- content: "<p>The requirements for MPLS Transport Profile include a requirement (R93)
    that requires that MPLS-TP must support recovery mechanisms for a network constructed
    from interconnected rings that protect user data that traverses more than one
    ring. In particular, this includes protecting against cases of failure at the
    ring interconnect nodes and links. This document presents different configurations
    of interconnected rings and special mechanisms to address the recovery of ring-interconnect
    nodes and links. . This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering
    Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS
    and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet
    transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</p>"
