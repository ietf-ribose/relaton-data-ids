abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Continuity Check (CC), Proactive Connectivity Verification (CV)
    and \nRemote Defect Indication (RDI) functionalities required for are MPLS-\nTP
    OAM.  \n \nContinuity Check monitors the integrity of the continuity of the path
    \nfor any loss of continuity defect. Connectivity verification monitors \nthe
    integrity of the routing of the path between sink and source for \nany connectivity
    issues. RDI enables an End Point to report, to its \nassociated End Point, a fault
    or defect condition that it detects on \na PW, LSP or Section. \n \nThis document
    specifies methods for proactive CV, CC, and RDI for \nMPLS-TP Label Switched Path
    (LSP), PWs and Sections using \nBidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD). \n \n\nRequirements
    Language \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL
    NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].\n\t </p>\n
