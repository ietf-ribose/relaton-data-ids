abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IDNA makes available to DNS zone administrators a very wide
    range of\n   Unicode code points.  Most operators of zones should probably not\n
    \  permit registration of U-labels using the entire range.  This is\n   especially
    true of zones that accept registrations across\n   organizational boundaries,
    such as top-level domains and, most\n   importantly, the root.  It is unfortunately
    not possible to generate\n   algorithms to determine whether permitting a code
    point presents a\n   low risk.  This memo presents a set of principles that can
    be used to\n   guide the decision of whether a Unicode code point may be wisely\n
    \  included in the repertoire of permissible code points in a U-label in\n   a
    zone.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
