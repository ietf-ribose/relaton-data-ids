abstract:
  content: "<p>OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 include a reliable flooding mechanism todisseminate
    routing topology and Traffic Engineering (TE) informationwithin a routing domain.
    Given the effectiveness of thesemechanisms, it is convenient to envision using
    the same mechanism fordissemination of other types of information within the domain.However,
    burdening OSPF with this additional information will impactintra-domain routing
    convergence and possibly jeopardize thestability of the OSPF routing domain. This
    document presentsmechanism to relegate this ancillary information to a separate
    OSPFinstance and minimize the impact.</p>"
