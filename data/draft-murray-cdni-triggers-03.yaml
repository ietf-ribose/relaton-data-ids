abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the part of the CDN Interconnect Control Interface
    that allows a CDN to trigger activity in an interconnected CDN that is configured
    to deliver content on its behalf. The upstream CDN can use this mechanism to request
    that the downstream CDN pre-positions metadata or content, or that it re-validate
    or purge metadata or content. The upstream CDN can monitor the status of activity
    that it has triggered in the downstream CDN.</p>"
