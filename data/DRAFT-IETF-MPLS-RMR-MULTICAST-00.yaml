abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With Resilient MPLS Rings (RMR), although all existing multicast\n
    \  procedures and solutions can work as is, there are optimizations that\n   could
    be done for RSVP-TE P2MP tunnel signaling and Fast-ReRouting\n   for both mLDP
    and RSVP-TE P2MP tunnels.  This document describes RMR\n   multicast on a high
    level, with detailed protocol procedure for RSVP-\n   TE P2MP optimizations specified
    in a separate document.  This\n   document also discusses end to end multicast
    when there are RMRs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
