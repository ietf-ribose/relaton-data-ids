abstract:
- content: "<p>P2P Streaming has become popular application in the Internet. Currently,
    most home subscribers access Internet via ADSL, in which downlink bandwidth and
    uplink bandwidth are not symmetric. This feature would influence the performance
    of P2P Streaming, and the problem may be worse in mobile scenarios. This draft
    presents the interoperation between PPSP protocol and DECADE protocol to provide
    DECADE service for PPSP applications. Typically, there are two solution to achieve
    interoperation, loose interoperation among peers, and close interoperation via
    connection of peer and tracker. By introducing DECADE in both tracker protocol
    and peer protocol, PPSP streaming can alleviate strength of upload bandwidth and
    improve performance for fix and mobile scenario.</p>"
