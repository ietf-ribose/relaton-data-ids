abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document defines a mechanism that is meant to communicate
    DNS\n   resolver information to DNS clients for use as a criteria for server\n
    \  selection decisions.  In particular, the document defines a mechanism\n   for
    a DNS server to communicate its filtering behavior to DNS\n   clients.  Such an
    information that is cryptographically signed to\n   attest its authenticity is
    used for the selection of DNS resolvers.\n   Typically, evaluating the filtering
    behavior and the signatory, DNS\n   clients with minimal or no human intervention
    can select the DNS\n   servers for resolving domain names.\n\n   This assertion
    is useful for encrypted DNS (e.g., DNS-over-TLS, DNS-\n   over-HTTPS, or DNS-over-QUIC)
    servers that are either public\n   resolvers or discovered in a local network.\n\n\t
