abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Latency and packet loss is such requirement that must be achieved\n
    \  according to the Service Level Agreement (SLA) / Network Performance\n   Objective
    (NPO) between customers and service providers.  Latency and\n   packet loss can
    be associated with different service level.  The user\n   may select a private
    line provider based on the ability to meet a\n   latency and loss SLA.\n\n   The
    key driver for latency and loss is stock/commodity trading\n   applications that
    use data base mirroring.  A few milli seconds and\n   packet loss can impact a
    transaction.  Financial or trading companies\n   are very focused on end-to-end
    private pipe line latency\n   optimizations that improve things 2-3 ms.  Latency/loss
    and\n   associated SLA is one of the key parameters that these \"high value\"\n
    \  customers use to select a private pipe line provider.  Other key\n   applications
    like video gaming, conferencing and storage area\n   networks require stringent
    latency, loss and bandwidth.\n\n   This document describes requirements to communicate
    latency and\n   packet loss as a traffic engineering performance metric in today's\n
    \  network which is consisting of potentially multiple layers of packet\n   transport
    network and optical transport network in order to meet the\n   latency/loss SLA
    between service provider and his customers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
