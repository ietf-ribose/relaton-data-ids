abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work.
    \ This\n   often involves accessing the archived history of those email lists.\n
    \  Participants would like to have the ability to browse and search\n   those
    archives using standard IMAP clients.  This memo captures the\n   requirements
    for providing a service that would allow such browsing\n   and searching.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
