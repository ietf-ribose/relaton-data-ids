abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a canonical string object or 'token' including
    a digital signature for verifying the author of the token, their authority to
    author the token and the information asserted in the token, minimally, the originating
    identity or 'persona' corresponding specifically to the originator of 'personal
    communications', or signalled communications between a set of parties with identities.
    The PASSporT token is cryptographically signed to protect the integrity of the
    identify the originator of a personal communications session (e.g. the telephone
    number or URI) and verify the assertion of the identity information at the destination.
    The cryptographic signature is defined with the intention that it can confidently
    verify the originating persona even when the signature is sent to the destination
    party over an insecure channel. PASSporT is particularly useful for many personal
    communications applications over IP networks and other multi-hop interconnection
    scenarios where the originating and destination parties may not have a direct
    trusted relationship.</p>"
