abstract:
- content: "<p>Digital Twin Network (DTN) is a network system with Physical Network
    and Twin Network, which can be mapped interactively in real time. The construction
    of Digital Twin Network requires real-time data of Physical Network to update
    the state of Twin Network. However the existing method collects the full amount
    of data from the Physical Network for modeling, and does not consider the problems
    such as insufficient storage resources, low computational efficiency and waste
    of bandwidth resources. This document introduces an efficient data collection
    method in which the Twin Network sends instructions to the Physical Network to
    collect data on demand, and then the Physical Network parses and executes instructions
    such as data cleaning and knowledge representation, and sends the processed or
    requested data to the Digital Twin Network.</p>"
