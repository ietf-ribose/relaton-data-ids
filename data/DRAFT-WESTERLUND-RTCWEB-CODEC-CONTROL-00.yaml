abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes how WebRTC should handle media codec
    control\n   between peers.  With media codec control we mean such parameters as\n
    \  video resolution and frame-rate.  This includes both initial\n   establishment
    of capabilities using the SDP based JSEP signalling and\n   during ongoing real-time
    interactive sessions in response to user and\n   application events.  The solution
    uses SDP for initial boundary\n   establishment that are rarely, if ever changed.
    \ During the session\n   the RTCP based Codec Operations Point (COP) signaling
    solution is\n   used for dynamic control of parameters enabling timely and responsive\n
    \  controls.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
