abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a RESTful application\n
    \  protocol for constrained nodes and networks.  The state of a resource\n   on
    a CoAP server can change over time.  This document specifies a\n   simple protocol
    extension for CoAP that enables CoAP clients to\n   \"observe\" resources, i.e.,
    to retrieve a representation of a resource\n   and keep this representation updated
    by the server over a period of\n   time.  The protocol follows a best-effort approach
    for sending new\n   representations to clients and provides eventual consistency
    between\n   the state observed by each client and the actual resource state at\n
    \  the server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
