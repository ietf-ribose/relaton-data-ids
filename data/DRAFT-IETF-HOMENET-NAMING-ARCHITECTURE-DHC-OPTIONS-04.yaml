abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Home network devices are usually constrained devices with reduced\n
    \  network and CPU capabilities.  As such, a home network device\n   exposing
    the authoritative naming service for its home network on the\n   Internet may
    become vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks.  One\n   way to avoid exposing
    these devices is to outsource the authoritative\n   service to a third party,
    e.g.  ISP.\n\n   The Homenet Naming Authority (HNA) is the designated device in
    charge\n   of outsourcing the service to a third party, which requires setting\n
    \  up an architecture.\n\n   Such settings may be inappropriate for most end users.
    \ This document\n   defines DHCPv6 options so any agnostic HNA can automatically
    proceed\n   to the appropriate configuration and outsource the authoritative\n
    \  naming service for the home network.  In most cases, the outsourcing\n   mechanism
    is transparent for the end user.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
