abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As the Internet Protocol continues to increase in popularity as
    a\nglobal communication system, it becomes increasingly valuable to be\nable to
    use familiar IP tools such as ftp for local communication as\nwell. For example,
    two people with laptop computers with built-in\nwireless Ethernet may meet and
    wish to exchange files. It is\ndesirable for these people to be able to use IP
    application software\nwithout the inconvenience of having to manually configure
    static IP\naddresses or set up a DHCP [RFC 2131] server.\nThis draft describes
    a method by which a host may automatically\nconfigure an interface with an IP
    address in the 169.254/16 range\nthat is valid for link-local communication on
    that interface. This\nis especially valuable in environments where no other configuration\nmechanism
    is available.\n\t </p>\n      "
