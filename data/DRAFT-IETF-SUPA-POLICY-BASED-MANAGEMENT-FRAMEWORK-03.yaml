abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) defines base YANG
    data\n   models to encode policy, which point to device-, technology-, and\n   service-specific
    YANG models developed elsewhere.  Policy rules\n   within an operator's environment
    can be used to express high-level,\n   possibly network-wide policies to a network
    management function\n   (within a controller, an orchestrator, or a network element).
    \ The\n   network management function can then control the configuration and/or\n
    \  monitoring of network elements and services.  This document describes\n   the
    SUPA basic framework, its elements and interfaces.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
