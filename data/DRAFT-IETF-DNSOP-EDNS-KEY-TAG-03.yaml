abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide
    origin\n   authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital\n
    \  signatures.  These digital signatures can be verified by building a\n   chain-of-trust
    starting from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a\n   particular node in the
    DNS.  This document specifies two different\n   ways for validating resolvers
    to signal to a server which keys are\n   referenced in their chain-of-trust.  The
    data from such signaling\n   allow zone administrators to monitor the progress
    of rollovers in a\n   DNSSEC-signed zone.\n\n   This document describes two independent
    methods for validating\n   resolvers to publish their referenced keys: an EDNS
    option and a\n   different DNS query.  The reason there are two methods instead
    of one\n   is some people see significant problems with each method.  Having two\n
    \  methods is clearly worse than having just one, but it is probably\n   better
    for the Internet than having no way to gain the information\n   from the resolvers.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
