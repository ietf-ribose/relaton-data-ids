abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>John Klensin proposed a multi-layered search-based access model
    for the \nDNS to address more human-friendly naming and navigation need of the
    \nmodern Internet [DNSSEARCH]. When deploying the DNS search system in the \nglobal
    Internet, stability and scalability are two most important \nfactors no matter
    what protocol we finally use. This draft demonstrates \nthat caching is a significant
    objective for a stable and scalable DNS \nsearch system. Particularly, this document
    analyzes statistical \noperational data collected from our Keyword service. The
    collected data \nclearly demonstrates the potential high impact of caching in
    the \nresolution process. Based on deployment experience, the document \ndescribes
    alternative caching methods. From there, basic caching \nrequirements for DNS
    Search systems are discussed.\n\nThe goal of this document is not to propose some
    standard caching \nmechanisms or methods but to emphasize the necessity of caching
    for DNS \nSearch systems. Furthermore, the authors believe that the proven high
    \nefficiency of caching should be an important consideration when \ndesigning
    the future lookup protocol for such systems.\n\t </p>\n      "
