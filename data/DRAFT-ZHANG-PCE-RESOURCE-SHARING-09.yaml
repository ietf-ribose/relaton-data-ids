abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Resource sharing in a network means two or more Label Switched
    Paths\n   (LSPs) use common piece(s) of resource along their paths. This can\n
    \  help save network resource and is useful in scenarios such as LSP\n   recovery
    or when two LSPs do not need to be active at the same time.\n   A Path Computation
    Element (PCE) is responsible for path computation\n   with such requirement. The
    resource-sharing-based path computation\n   with better efficiency can be achieved
    together with the association\n   object in PCEP.\n\n   This document extends
    the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)\n   in order to support resource
    sharing-based path computation, which\n   is a special case in the association
    path computation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
