abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an extension to PIDF-LO (RFC4119) for
    the\n   expression of location information that is defined relative to a\n   reference
    point.  The reference point may be expressed as a geodetic\n   or civic location,
    and the relative offset may be one of several\n   shapes.  Optionally, a reference
    to a secondary document (such as a\n   map image) can be included, along with
    the relationship of the map\n   coordinate system to the reference/offset coordinate
    system to allow\n   display of the map with the reference point and the relative
    offset.\n   Also included in this document is a Type/Length/Value (TLV)\n   representation
    of the relative location for use in other protocols\n   that use TLVs.\n\n\t </p>\n
