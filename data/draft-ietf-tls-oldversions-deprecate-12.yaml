abstract:
- content: "<p>This document formally deprecates Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions
    1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346). Accordingly, those documents have been moved
    to Historic status. These versions lack support for current and recommended cryptographic
    algorithms and mechanisms, and various government and industry profiles of applications
    using TLS now mandate avoiding these old TLS versions. TLS version 1.2 became
    the recommended version for IETF protocols in 2008 (subsequently being obsoleted
    by TLS version 1.3 in 2018), providing sufficient time to transition away from
    older versions. Removing support for older versions from implementations reduces
    the attack surface, reduces opportunity for misconfiguration, and streamlines
    library and product maintenance. This document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS)
    version 1.0 (RFC 4347) but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version
    1.1. This document updates many RFCs that normatively refer to TLS version 1.0
    or TLS version 1.1, as described herein. This document also updates the best practices
    for TLS usage in RFC 7525; hence, it is part of BCP 195.</p>"
