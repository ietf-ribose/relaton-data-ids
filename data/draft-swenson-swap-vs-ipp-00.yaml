abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) has been compared in conversations
    to SWAP(Simple Workflow Access Protocol). Both are for starting an asynchronousjob,
    and then being able to check up on it later. The IPP is specificallydesigned for
    printers and print jobs. SWAP is more generic, and isgenerally oriented toward
    more computational jobs. But many of theproblems encountered are the same, and
    the approach to the solutions can beexamined and compared. This document goes
    through the features point bypoint and shows in what ways they are similar, and
    more importantly in whatways their approaches differ. The purpose of this is to
    guide discussionsabout the two protocols.</p>"
