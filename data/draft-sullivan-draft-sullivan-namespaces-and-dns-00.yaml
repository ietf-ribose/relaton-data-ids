abstract:
- content: "<p>You should probably not read this. It's not done. Not every domain
    name is intended to appear in the global DNS. It is also possible that not everything
    that looks like a domain name is intended to be one. Regardless of whether a given
    name is intended to appear in the DNS, such names often turn up in domain name
    slots. When choosing a naming scheme that is not intended to be part of the global
    DNS, it is necessary to understand the architectural implications of using domain
    names or a domain-name-like syntax.</p>"
