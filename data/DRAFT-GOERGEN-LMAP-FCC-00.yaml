abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Analyzing and aggregating large-scale broadband measurements
    is\n   essential to study trends and derive network analytics.  These trends\n
    \  and analyses could be made available through well defined protocols\n   such
    as the Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol.\n   However, ALTO
    requires network information to be distilled and\n   abstracted in form of a network
    map and a cost map.  We describe our\n   methodology for analyzing the United
    States Federal Communication\n   Commission's (FCC) Measuring Broadband America
    (MBA) dataset to\n   derive required topology and cost maps suitable for consumption
    by an\n   ALTO server.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
