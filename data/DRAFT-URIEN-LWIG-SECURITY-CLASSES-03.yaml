abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft attempts to define security classes for constraint
    IoT\n   devices. A device security is characterized by five Boolean security\n
    \  attributes: one time programmable memory (OTP), firmware loader\n   (FLD),
    secure firmware loader (FLD-SEC), tamper resistant key (TRT-\n   KEY) and diversified
    key (DIV-KEY).\n\n   This leads to the definition of 6 classes of devices, embedding
    or\n   not OTP resource, whose security increases with the class number (0\n   to
    5). The suffix + indicates OTP availability.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
