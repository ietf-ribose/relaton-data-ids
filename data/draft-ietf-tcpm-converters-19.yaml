abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an application proxy, called Transport Converter,
    to assist the deployment of TCP extensions such as Multipath TCP. A Transport
    Converter may provide conversion service for one or more TCP extensions. The conversion
    service is provided by means of the 0-RTT TCP Convert Protocol (Convert). This
    protocol provides 0-RTT (Zero Round-Trip Time) conversion service since no extra
    delay is induced by the protocol compared to connections that are not proxied.
    Also, the Convert Protocol does not require any encapsulation (no tunnels whatsoever).
    This specification assumes an explicit model, where the Transport Converter is
    explicitly configured on hosts. As a sample applicability use case, this document
    specifies how the Convert Protocol applies for Multipath TCP.</p>"
