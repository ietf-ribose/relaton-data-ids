abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes benchmarking considerations for a containerized
    infrastructure. In a containerized infrastructure, Virtualized Network Functions(VNFs)
    are deployed on operating-system-level virtualization platform by abstracting
    the user namespace as opposed to virtualization using a hypervisor. Leveraging
    this, the system configurations and networking scenarios for VNF benchmarking
    will be partially changed by way of resource allocation and network port binding
    between a physical host and VNFs. In this draft we compare the state of the art
    in container networking architecture with networking on VM-based virtualized systems,
    and provide several test scenarios for network performance in containerized infrastructure.</p>"
