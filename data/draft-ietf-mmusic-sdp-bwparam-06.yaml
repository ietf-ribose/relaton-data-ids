abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Session Description Protocol (SDP) Transport
    Independent Application Specific Maximum (TIAS) bandwidth modifier that does not
    include transport overhead; instead an additional packet rate attribute is defined.
    The transport independent bit-rate value together with the maximum packet rate
    can then be used to calculate the real bit-rate over the transport actually used.
    The existing SDP bandwidth modifiers and their values include the bandwidth needed
    for the transport and IP layers. When using SDP with protocols like the Session
    Announcement Protocol (SAP), the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and the Real-Time
    Streaming Protocol (RTSP), and when the involved hosts has different transport
    overhead, for example due to different IP versions, the interpretation of what
    lower layer bandwidths are included is not clear. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
