abstract:
- content: "<p>RBridges are link layer devices that use routing protocols as a control
    plane but do not target to scale up to large campus networks. This document contains
    an alternative proposal to link-state RBridges, named ABridges. ABridges overcome
    RBridges L2 network size restrictions allowing applicability to very large Ethernet
    campus networks while maintaining zero configuration and high performance, by
    assuming a topological restriction that is automatically performed. The proposal
    includes a two-layered network architecture with two hierarchical independent
    spanning tree layers. Expected convergence is fast, probably below two seconds.</p>"
