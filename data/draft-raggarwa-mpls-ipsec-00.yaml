abstract:
  content: "<p>In various applications of MPLS, label stacks with multiple entriesare
    used. In some cases, it is possible to replace the top label ofthe stack with
    an IP-based encapsulation, thereby enabling theapplication to run over networks
    which do not have MPLS enabled intheir core routers. MPLS-in-IP and MPLS-in-GRE
    encapsulations havealready been specified by the MPLS WG. In some cases, in addition
    toIP and GRE tunnels, it may be desirable to use IPsec for transportingMPLS packets
    securely over non-MPLS networks, using standard IPsecauthentication and/or encryption
    functions. This draft describesprocedures for encapsulating MPLS packets in IPsec.</p>"
