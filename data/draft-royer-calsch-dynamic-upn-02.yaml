abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This is an extension to the [CAP] protocol and can be used within[iTIP]
    objects. A CU may wish to invite a UPN to an event where theUPN does not have
    a account on the CU's CS. This memo describes twomethods to dynamically create
    UPNs in order for those UPNs to gainaccess to the 'Organizers' CS.This memo also
    includes a description of how to include an [OTP]challenge in an object directed
    to a CU. The CUA must compute thepassword in order to respond to the object. This
    challenge and itsresponse can be sent in the clear as the values are computed
    using asecret that would not be known to anyone snooping the line.</p>"
