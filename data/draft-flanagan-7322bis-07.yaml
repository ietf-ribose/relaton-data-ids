abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the fundamental and unique style conventions
    and editorial policies currently in use for the RFC Series. It captures the RFC
    Editor's basic requirements and offers guidance regarding the style and structure
    of an RFC. Additional guidance is captured on a website that reflects the experimental
    nature of that guidance and prepares it for future inclusion in the RFC Style
    Guide. This document obsoletes RFC 7322, "RFC Style Guide".</p>
