abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) architecture leverages source routing and tunneling
    paradigms and can be directly applied to the use of a Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) data plane. Segment Routing also provides an easy and efficient way to
    provide inter connectivity in a large scale network as described in [RFC8604].
    [RFC8287] illustrates the problem and defines extensions to perform LSP Ping and
    Traceroute for Segment Routing IGP-Prefix and IGP-Adjacency Segment Identifiers
    (SIDs) with an MPLS data plane. It is useful to have the LSP Ping and traceroute
    procedures when an SRend-to-end path spans across multiple ASes. This document
    describes mechanisms to facilitae LSP ping and traceroute in inter-AS SR networks
    in an efficient manner with simple OAM protocol extension.</p>"
