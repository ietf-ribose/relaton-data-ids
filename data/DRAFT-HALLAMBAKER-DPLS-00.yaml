abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A mechanism for encrypting and authenticating communication between
    a\nDNS Client and server is presented.  The mechanism is designed to\ncompliment
    use of DNSSEC in the case where DNSSEC validation is\nperformed at the resolver
    and it is not desirable to repeat\nvalidation at the server.\n\t </p>\n      "
