abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the IPv6 Alternate Marking Option to provide
    enhanced capabilities and allow advanced functionalities. With this extension,
    it can be possible to perform thicker packet loss measurements and more dense
    delay measurements with no limitation for the number of concurrent flows under
    monitoring.</p>"
