abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When an IP address is shared among several subscribers -- with
    a NAT\n   or with an application-level proxy -- it is impossible for the server\n
    \  to differentiate between different clients.  Such differentiation is\n   valuable
    in several scenarios.  This memo proposes a technique to\n   differentiate TCP
    and UDP clients sharing an IP address.  The\n   proposed method uses an ICMP Echo
    Request packet, which allows for\n   more information about the user mapping to
    be transmitted than in the\n   case of using the TCP option - and allows the use
    with UDP and other\n   protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
