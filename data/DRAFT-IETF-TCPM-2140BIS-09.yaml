abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo provides guidance to TCP implementers that are intended
    to\n   help improve convergence to steady-state operation without affecting\n
    \  interoperability. It updates and replaces RFC 2140's description of\n   interdependent
    TCP control blocks and the ways that part of TCP\n   state can be shared among
    similar concurrent or consecutive\n   connections. TCP state includes a combination
    of parameters, such as\n   connection state, current round-trip time estimates,
    congestion\n   control information, and process information. Most of this state
    is\n   maintained on a per-connection basis in the TCP Control Block (TCB),\n
    \  but implementations can (and do) share certain TCB information\n   across connections
    to the same host. Such sharing is intended to\n   improve overall transient transport
    performance, while maintaining\n   backward-compatibility with existing implementations.
    The sharing\n   described herein is limited to only the TCB initialization and
    so\n   has no effect on the long-term behavior of TCP after a connection\n   has
    been established.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
