abstract:
  content: "<p>This document introduces Virtual Service-aware Networks (VSNs) as asolution
    for inter-domain resource reservation with Quality-of-Service (QoS) on an Internet-wide
    scale. A VSN is a single-domainoverlay network that consists of guaranteed QoS
    pipes. VSNs ofneighboring domains that offer the same level of QoS establishpeering
    relationships. As such, they form a network of QoS-enablednetworks with a specific
    (QoS) routing context. In this network,admission control for traffic flows is
    performed in two phases. Thetwo-phase approach allows for the use of an off-path
    signalingprotocol, which enables the gradual introduction of thisarchitecture
    without changing the existing routers.</p>"
