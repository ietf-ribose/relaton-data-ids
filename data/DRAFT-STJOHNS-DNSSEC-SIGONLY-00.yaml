abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   Work on the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)( [RFC4033] et
    al) has\n   been in progress for close to 15 years and DNSSEC is still not\n   \"mature\"
    enough to be considered complete.  A substantial issue is\n   the complexity of
    the system.  This document describes a simplified\n   version of DNSSEC that can
    co-exist with the current protocols, but\n   with characteristics such that the
    author believes it can be\n   implemented and deployed with much less effort.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
