abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Domain Name System Resource Records are identified in part
    by their\n   class.  The class field is not effective, and it is not used the
    way\n   it appears to have been intended.  This memo suspends additions to\n   the
    DNS class registry pending greater clarity on how classes might\n   be used, and
    until such clarification requires those defining new\n   RRTYPEs to define them
    for all classes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
