abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Low-resource devices in a Low-power and Lossy Network (LLN)
    can\n   operate in a mesh network using the IPv6 over Low-power Personal Area\n
    \  Networks (6LoWPAN) and IEEE 802.15.4 link-layer standards.\n   Provisioning
    these devices in a secure manner with keys (often called\n   security bootstrapping)
    used to encrypt and authenticate messages is\n   the subject of Bootstrapping
    of Remote Secure Key Infrastructures\n   (BRSKI) [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra].
    \ Enrollment over\n   Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030], based on TLS and HTTP,
    is used for\n   BRSKI.  This document defines how low-resource devices are expected\n
    \  to use EST over DTLS and CoAP. 6LoWPAN fragmentation management and\n   minor
    extensions to CoAP are needed to enable EST over DTLS-secured\n   CoAP (EST-coaps).\n\n\t
