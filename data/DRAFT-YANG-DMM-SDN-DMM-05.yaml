abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DMM is a mobility protocol which has mobility functions to
    solve the\n   existing problems in the current centralized ones. However, when
    a\n   mobile node moves to another anchor, the previous flow is forwarded\n   by
    the previous router. For this reason, the routing optimization\n   could be an
    issue. This draft proposes a routing optimization method\n   in distributed anchor
    architecture. In this draft, we applied the\n   SDN concept to DMM architecture
    for routing optimization.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
