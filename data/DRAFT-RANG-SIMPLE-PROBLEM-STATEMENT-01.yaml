abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As more experience of deploying SIMPLE based presence systems
    is\n   accumulated, it seems that deploying a large SIMPLE presence system\n   is
    actually a very hard task.  The document analyzes several aspects\n   of SIMPLE
    based presence system deployment and shows that\n   difficulties around the amount
    of messages (network), state\n   management (memory) and processing load (cpu).\n\n
    \  Although this document is a problem statement document and not a BCP\n   document,
    several possible optimizations and directions are listed at\n   the end of the
    document in addition to an initial set of requirements\n   for what should be
    the characteristic of the solution to the problem\n   stated in the document\n\n
    \  This document is intended to be used by the SIMPLE WG in order to\n   work
    on possible solutions that will make the deployment of a\n   presence server more
    reasonable task.  Note that the document does\n   not try to compare the SIP based
    presence server to other types of\n   presence servers but only analyzes the SIP
    based presence server.\n\t </p>\n      "
