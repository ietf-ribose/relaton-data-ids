abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an auto-deployment mechanism that deploys resource-based
    network services through the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) in an Autonomic Network.
    This mechanism uses the GRASP in [RFC8990] to exchange the information among the
    autonomic nodes so that the resource among the service path can be coordinated.</p>"
