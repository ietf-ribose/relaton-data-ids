  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the reservation of Autonomous System
    numbers\n   (ASNs) that are for private use only and should not be advertised
    to\n   the Internet, known as private use ASNs.  This document enlarges the\n
    \  total space available for private use ASNs by documenting the\n   reservation
    of a second, larger range and updates RFC 1930.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
