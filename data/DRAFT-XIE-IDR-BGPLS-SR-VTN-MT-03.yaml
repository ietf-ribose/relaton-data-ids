abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to
    support\n   some applications' needs of enhanced isolation and stringent\n   performance
    requirements.  VPN+ requires integration between the\n   overlay VPN and the underlay
    network.  A Virtual Transport Network\n   (VTN) is a virtual underlay network
    which consists of a subset of the\n   network topology and network resources allocated
    from the physical\n   network.  A VTN could be used as the underlay for one or
    a group of\n   VPN+ services.\n\n   When Segment Routing is used as the data plane
    of VTNs, each VTN can\n   be allocated with a group of Segment Identifiers (SIDs)
    to identify\n   the topology and resource attributes of network segments in the
    VTN.\n   The association between the network topology, the network resource\n
    \  attributes and the SR SIDs may need to be distributed to a\n   centralized
    network controller.  For network scenarios where each VTN\n   can be associated
    with a unique logical network topology, this\n   document describes a mechanism
    to distribute the information of SR\n   based VTNs using BGP-LS with Multi-Topology.\n\n\n\t
