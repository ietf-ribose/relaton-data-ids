abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Virtual network overlays are extremely useful for supporting\n
    \  multicast applications in multi-tenant data center networks, by\n   distributing
    the per-tenant multicast state and forwarding actions at\n   the network edges
    with minimal control plane load and simpler\n   forwarding in the core.  A virtual
    overlay network may use existing\n   encapsulations such as MPLS-in-GRE or newer
    IP based encapsulations\n   such as VXLAN and NVGRE.\n\n   IP multicast sources
    and receivers are very commonly spread out\n   across multiple subnets.  Sources
    and receivers may also be spread\n   within and outside a single network domain
    such as a data center.\n   Hence, a Layer-3 multicast paradigm is the most suitable
    and\n   efficient approach for delivery of IP multicast traffic.\n\n   BGP based
    MVPNs provide a good basis for providing a solution to\n   support IP multicast
    across these overlay networks.  An appropriate\n   subset of the MVPN control
    plane and procedures are sufficient to\n   support the requirements, providing
    for a simpler model of operation.\n   This document describes the use of BGP based
    MVPNs alongwith the new\n   IP-based virtual network overlay encapsulations to
    provide a Layer-3\n   virtualization solution for IP multicast traffic, and specifies\n
    \  mechanisms to use the new encapsulations while continuing to leverage\n   the
    BGP MVPN control plane techniques and extensions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
