abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TURN server and the network in which it is hosted due to load
    could\n   adversely impact the traffic relayed through it.  During such high\n
    \  load event, it is desirable to shed some traffic but TURN server lack\n   requirements
    about the flows to prioritize them.  This document\n   defines such a mechanism
    to communicate flow characteristics from the\n   TURN client to its TURN server.\n\n\t
