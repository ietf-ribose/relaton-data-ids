abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MIF hosts normally have multiple provisioning domains or interfaces.\n
    \  In some cases, the applications running on the MIF hosts need to\n   select
    provisioning domain or interface based on either user\n   preferences or network
    polices.  There is currently no standard ways\n   for the MIF hosts to implement
    this kind of provisioning domain/\n   interface selection.  This document discusses
    the problem statement\n   of provisioning domain/interface control of the MIF
    hosts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
