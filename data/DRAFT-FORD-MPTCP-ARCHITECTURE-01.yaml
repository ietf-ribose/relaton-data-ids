abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Often endpoints are connected by multiple paths, but the nature
    of\nTCP/IP restricts communications to a single path per socket.\nResource usage
    within the network would be more efficient were these\nmultiple paths able to
    be used concurrently.  This should enhance\nuser experience through improved resilience
    to network failure and\nhigher throughput.\n\nThis document outlines architectural
    guidelines for the development\nof a Multipath Transport Protocol, with references
    to how these\narchitectural components come together in the Multipath TCP (MPTCP)\nprotocol.
    \ This document also lists certain high level design\ndecisions that provide foundations
    for the MPTCP design, based upon\nthese architectural requirements.\n\t </p>\n
