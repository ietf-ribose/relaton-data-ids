abstract:
  content: "\t <t>NETCONF and YANG are pieces of an ambitious plan to improve networkmanagement.
    NETCONF gives access to native capabilities of thedevices within a network, defining
    methods for manipulatingconfiguration databases, retrieving operational data,
    and invokingspecific operations. YANG provides the means to define the contenttrafficked
    via NETCONF, both data and operations. Using bothtechnologies, the standards modules
    can be defined to giveinteroperability and commonality to devices, while still
    allowingdevices to express their unique capabilities.This document describes how
    NETCONF and YANG help build networkmanagement applications that meet the needs
    of network servicesproviders. An architecture is described which is friendly to
    bothdevices and applications, to vendors and standards bodies, to youngand to
    old, to red states and to blue states. It's a startlingvision, coming to networks
    near you starting August, 2009.</p>"
