abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Allied Communications Publication (ACP) 142 defines P_MUL,
    which is a\n   protocol for reliable multicast suitable for bandwidth constrained\n
    \  and delayed acknowledgement (Emissions Control or \"EMCON\")\n   environments
    running over UDP.  This document defines an application\n   protocol called MULE
    (Multicast Email) for transferring of Internet\n   Mail messages (as described
    in RFC 5322) over P_MUL (as defined in\n   ACP 142A).  MULE enables Message Transfer
    Agents (MTA) to MTA\n   transfer and doesn't provide service similar to SMTP Submission
    (as\n   described in RFC 6409).\n\n   This document explains how MULE can be used
    in conjunction with\n   Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP, RFC 5321), including
    some common\n   SMTP extensions, to provide an alternate MTA to MTA transfer\n
    \  mechanism.\n\n   This is not an IETF specification, but describes an existing\n
    \  implementation.  It is provided in order to facilitate interoperable\n   implementations
    and third-party diagnostics.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
