abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) requirements document[RFC5654],\n
    \  describes that MPLS-TP MUST support associated bidirectional point-\n   to-point
    LSPs.  Path Computation Element (PCE), see [RFC4655], may be\n   used for path
    computation of an associated bidirectional LSP.  This\n   document defines the
    Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)-based\n   [RFC5440] extensions for associated
    bidirectional LSP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
