abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In the 802.16 Per-MS interface prefix model, one prefix can only
    beassigned to one interface of a mobile station by an access router anddifferent
    mobile stations can't share a prefix. Managing Per-MSinterface prefixes is likely
    to increase the processing load at theaccess router. Based on the idea that DHCPv6
    servers can manageprefixes as well as addresses, we propose a new technique in
    whichthe access router offloads delegation and release tasks of theprefixes to
    an DHCPv6 server. The access router first requests aprefix for an incoming mobile
    station to the DHCPv6 server. Theaccess router next advertises the prefix information
    to the mobilestation with a Router Advertisement message. When the mobile stationhands
    off, the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server. We alsodescribe how AAA servers
    can help in prefix delegation.</p>"
