abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document described conventions for using the Session Description
    \nProtocol (SDP) described in RFC2327 for controlling ATM Bearer \nConnections,
    and any associated ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL). The AALs\naddressed are Type 1,
    Type 2 and Type 5. This list of conventions is \nmeant to be exhaustive. Individual
    applications can use subsets of \nthese conventions. Further, these conventions
    are meant to comply \nstrictly with the SDP syntax as defined in rfc2327.\n\t
