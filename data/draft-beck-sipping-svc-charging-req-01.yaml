abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, a SIP user wanting to charge for a service needs to establish
    an agreement with all prospective callers. This administrative overhead can be
    avoided if caller and callee can prove the duration and existence of a call in
    case of a dispute. The draft describes requirements for protocols and SIP extension
    that can be used to implement such functionality.</p>"
