abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how a Push Notification Service (PNS)
    can be\n   used to wake suspended Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents\n
    \  (UAs), using push notifications, for the UA to be able to send\n   binding
    refresh REGISTER requests and to receive receive incoming SIP\n   requests.  The
    document defines new SIP URI parameters and new\n   feature-capability indicators
    that can be used in SIP messages to\n   indicate support of the mechanism defined
    in this document, to\n   exchange PNS information between the SIP User Agent (UA)
    and the SIP\n   entity that will request push notifications towards the UA, and
    to\n   trigger such push notification requests.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
