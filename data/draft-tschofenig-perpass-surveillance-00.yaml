abstract:
- content: "<p>Surveillance is the observation or monitoring of an individual's communications
    or activities. Surveillance is one of several privacy /security threats engineers
    try to take into account in their designs. The reports about pervasive monitoring
    of Internet traffic have, however, surprised many since the scale was not envisaged
    during the design of many Internet protocols. The approach to get access to meta-data
    as well as to communication content has taken forms that are largely indistinguishable
    from ordinary attacks. This document explains the attacks in context of the larger
    Internet eco-system.</p>"
