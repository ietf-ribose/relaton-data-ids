abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>From time to time, there have been complaints about internal\nconflicts
    within the IESG that have retarded projects.  Some IETF\nChairs have expressed
    frustration about not being able to resolve the\nproblems and several members
    of the community have expressed\nfrustration that the Chairs cannot do so.  The
    recall process has not\nbeen effective in either dealing with or deterring these
    problems.\nThis document proposes, as a process experiment, an alternate model\nwhose
    intent is to give the Chair some leverage on solving any such\nproblems that may
    arise in the future.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
