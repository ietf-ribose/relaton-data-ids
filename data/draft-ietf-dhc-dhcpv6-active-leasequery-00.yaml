abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) has been
    extended with a Leasequery capability that allows a requestor to request information
    about DHCPv6 bindings. That mechanism is limited to queries for DHCPv6 binding
    data updates until the time DHCPv6 server receive the Leasequery request. Continuous
    update of an external requestor with Leasequery data is sometimes desired. This
    document expands on the DHCPv6 Leasequery protocol, and allows for active transfer
    of real-time DHCPv6 binding information data via TCP. This document also extends
    DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery by adding new options.</p>"
