abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes a batch of Presence Information Data Format\n(PIDF)
    and its extension schemas written with the RELAX NG schema\nlanguage.  Unlike
    with the current W3C XML Schema language it is\npossible to write reasonable forwards
    and backwards compatible\npresence combination schemas.  These RELAX NG schemas
    are stricter\nthan the W3C Schemas and thus the instance documents that validate\nwith
    these schemas follow the intended content model more closely.\nEspecially, these
    schemas are targeted to actual implementations in\norder to decrease interoperability
    problems.\n\t </p>\n      "
