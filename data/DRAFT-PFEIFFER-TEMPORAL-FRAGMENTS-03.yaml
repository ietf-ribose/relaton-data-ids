abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a syntax for addressing time intervals
    within\n   time-based Web resources through URI queries and fragments.  This\n
    \  scheme is particularly used for Annodex [1] and CMML [2] Web\n   resources,
    though it could be picked up by any other time-based Web\n   resource format.
    \ Temporal addressing enables, e.g., direct access to\n   a clip inside a video
    stored on a Web Server, or direct jumps to a\n   specific event within a piece
    of music.  The syntax is not restricted\n   to audio or video Web resources though,
    but covers all kinds of Web\n   resources that contain time-continuous information.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
