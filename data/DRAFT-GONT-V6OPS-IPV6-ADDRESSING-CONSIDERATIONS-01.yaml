abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 addresses can differ in a number of properties, such as
    scope,\n   stability, and intended usage type.  This document analyzes the\n   impact
    of these properties on aspects such as security, privacy,\n   interoperability,
    and network operations.  Additionally, it\n   identifies challenges and gaps that
    currently prevent systems and\n   applications from leveraging the increased flexibility
    and\n   availability of IPv6 addresses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
