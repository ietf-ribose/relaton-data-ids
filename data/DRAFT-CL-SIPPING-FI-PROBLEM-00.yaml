abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internet applications have been enhanced with many features.\nA
    feature may be defined as a unit of functionality in a system, having\na self-contained
    role.\nHowever, the introduction and modification of features may result in\nundesired
    behaviors, and this effect is known as feature interaction-\nFI for short.\n\nThis
    document provides a description of the FI problem in Internet, the\nmain problems
    to be solved in the FI resolution, and compares some\nsolutions for FI identification
    and resolution explored that have been\ndiscussed in the literature.\n\t </p>\n
