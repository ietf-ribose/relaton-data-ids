abstract:
  content: "<p>Cryptographically Generated Addresses as defined for IPv6 SecureNeighbor
    Discovery are generated locally on the host using the CGA.However, it can be desireable
    for other systems to be involved in thegeneration and use of CGAs in a number
    of ways: offloading the heavycryptography for generating or validating CGAs, proxy-generation
    ofCGAs for hosts that don't support the CGA-related protocolsthemselves or registration
    of CGA addresses for the purposes ofcentral address administration. When additional
    hosts are involvedin aspects of CGA, it's necessary to discover these other hostsand/or
    additional configuration items such as the Sec value. TheDHCPv6 is a natural choice
    for doing this. This document provides anoverview of the opportunities and issues
    in this area.</p>"
