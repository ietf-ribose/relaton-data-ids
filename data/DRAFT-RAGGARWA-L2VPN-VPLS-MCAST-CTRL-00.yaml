abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The PEs participating in VPLS need to learn the IP multicast
    group\n   membership information from remote VPLS sites to enable them to send\n
    \  an IP multicast packet to only those other PEs in the VPLS that have\n   receivers
    interested in that particular IP multicast packet's\n   multicast source and group.
    This document describes procedures for\n   propagating multicast control information,
    learned from local Virtual\n\n   Private LAN Service (VPLS) sites, to remote VPLS
    sites. IGMP or PIM\n   snooping is required only on the customer facing interfaces.
    The\n   procedures do not require IGMP or PIM snooping on the Service\n   Provider
    backbone links. Instead they use reliable protocol messages\n   to exchange multicast
    control information between the PEs.\n\t </p>\n      "
