abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Recently several multicast mechanisms were proposed that scale
    better\nwith the number of multicast groups than traditional multicast does.\nThese
    proposals are known as small group multicast (SGM) or explicit\nmulticast (Xcast).
    Explicit multicast protocols, such as the Xcast \nprotocol, encode the list of
    group members in the Xcast header of \nevery packet. If the number of members
    in a group increases, routers\nmay need to fragment an Xcast packet. Fragmented
    packets may not be \nidentified as Xcast packets by routers. In this paper, we
    show that \nthe Xcast protocol does not support the IP fragmentation and we show\nalso
    that avoiding fragmentation induces hard-coded limits inside the\nprotocol itself
    in terms of group size. First, we describe the Xcast\nprotocol, the Xcast+ protocol
    (which is an extension of Xcast) and we\ncompare these two protocols with traditional
    multicast protocols.We\npropose then a generalized version of the Xcast protocol,
    called\nGXcast, intended to permit the Xcast packets fragmentation and to\nsupport
    the increasing in the number of members in a multicast\ngroup.\n\t </p>\n      "
