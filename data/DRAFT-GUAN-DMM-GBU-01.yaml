abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       Internet of Things (IoT) has been booming with rapid increase
    of\n       various wearable devices, vehicle embedded devices and so on, and\n
    \      providing the effective mobility management for these IoT devices\n       becomes
    a challenge due to the different application scenarios as\n       well as the
    limited energy and bandwidth. Many researchers have\n       focused on this topic
    and proposed several solutions based on the\n       combination of IoT features
    and traditional mobility management\n       protocols, in which most of these
    schemes take the IoT devices as\n       mobile networks and adopt the NEtwork
    MObility (NEMO) and its\n       variants to provide the mobility support. However,
    these solutions\n       are in face of the heavy signaling cost problem. Considering
    that IoT\n       devices generally collaborate to realize the complex functions,
    these\n       devices may have the similar movement behaviors. This document\n
    \      therefore specifies a PMIPv6-based group binding update method to\n       reduce
    the singling cost and improve the scalability for these\n       devices.\n\n\t
