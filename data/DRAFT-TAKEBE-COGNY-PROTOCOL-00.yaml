abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes Cogny protocol that is a SOAP-based
    protocol\n   for peer-to-peer content sharing systems. Unlike general purpose\n
    \  peer-to-peer protocols such as JXTA protocol, Cogny protocol is\n   specialized
    to support centralized peer-to-peer content sharing\n   systems. So it is much
    simpler and easier to implement than JXTA\n   protocol. Because Cogny protocol
    is specialized to content sharing\n   systems, it defines application layer functions
    necessary to them.\n   One of them is a content transfer protocol that keeps consistency
    of\n   content. Cogny protocol defines encryption method for it. Another is\n
    \  efficient full-text search. Cogny protocol defines a cache method for\n   full-text
    search.\n\t </p>\n      "
