abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Digital signatures are used to sign messages, X.509 certificates
    and\n   CRLs.  This document updates the \"Algorithms and Identifiers for the\n
    \  Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate\n   Revocation
    List Profile\" (RFC3279) and describes the conventions for\n   using the SHAKE
    function family in Internet X.509 certificates and\n   revocation lists as one-way
    hash functions with the RSA Probabilistic\n   signature and ECDSA signature algorithms.
    \ The conventions for the\n   associated subject public keys are also described.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
