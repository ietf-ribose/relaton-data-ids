abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The extensible authentication protocol (EAP), specified in RFC3748[1]
    is a generic framework supporting multiple authenticationmethods. The EAP keying
    hierarchy specified in [2] has two top levelkeys: a master session key (MSK) and
    an extended MSK (EMSK). The MSKis used for access control enforcement, whereas
    the purpose of EMSKis to be defined. Several proposals for the use of the EMSK
    havebeen made, among them are support for efficient re-authentication ofthe EAP
    peer as it moves from one authenticator to another,bootstrapping preshared keys,
    visited domain key management. In thisdocument, we explore the various proposed
    uses of the EMSK keyhierarchy and the design considerations in specifying the
    EMSK keyhierarchy.</p>"
