abstract:
- content: "<p>At the first meeting of the Path Aware Networking Research Group, the
    research group agreed to catalog and analyze past efforts to develop and deploy
    Path Aware techniques, most of which were unsuccessful or at most partially successful,
    in order to extract insights and lessons for path-aware networking researchers.
    This document contains that catalog and analysis.</p>"
