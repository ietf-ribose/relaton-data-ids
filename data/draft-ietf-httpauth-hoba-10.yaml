abstract:
  content: "\t <t>HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a digital-signature-based
    design for an HTTP authentication method. The design can also be used in JavaScript-based
    authentication embedded in HTML. HOBA is an alternative to HTTP authentication
    schemes that require passwords and therefore avoids all problems related to passwords,
    such as leakage of server-side password databases.</p>"
