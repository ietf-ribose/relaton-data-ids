abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies QUIC version 2, which is identical to QUIC
    version 1 except for some trivial details. Its purpose is to combat various ossification
    vectors and exercise the version negotiation framework. It also serves as a template
    for the minimum changes in any future version of QUIC. Note that "version 2" is
    an informal name for this proposal that indicates it is the second standards-track
    QUIC version. The protocol specified here will receive a version number other
    than 2 from IANA. Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC
    IETF mailing list quic@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository which contains the
    draft: https://github.com/quicwg/quic-v2.</p>'
