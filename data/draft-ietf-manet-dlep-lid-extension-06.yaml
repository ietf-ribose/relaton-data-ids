abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is a protocol for modems
    to advertise the status of wireless links between reachable destinations to attached
    routers. The core specification of the protocol (RFC 8175) assumes that every
    modem in the radio network has an attached DLEP router and requires that the Media
    Access Control (MAC) address of the DLEP interface on the attached router be used
    to identify the destination in the network, for purposes of reporting the state
    and quality of the link to that destination. This document describes a DLEP extension
    that allows modems that do not meet the strict requirement above to use DLEP to
    describe link availability and quality to one or more destinations reachable beyond
    a device on the Layer 2 domain.</p>"
