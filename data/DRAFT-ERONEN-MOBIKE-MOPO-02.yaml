abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mobility and multihoming extension to
    the\n   IKEv2 protocol.  The main purpose of this extension is to update the\n
    \  (outer) addresses associated with IKE and IPsec Security\n   Associations.
    \ The extension also includes features that assist in\n   selecting which addresses
    to use, and verify return routability\n   during and after updates.  It is also
    able to work together with NAT\n   Traversal in some scenarios.\n\t </p>\n      "
