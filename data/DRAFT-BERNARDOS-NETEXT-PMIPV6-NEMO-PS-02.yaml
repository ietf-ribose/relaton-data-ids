abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  PMIPv6\n
    \  enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across\n   gateways
    without changing the IP address.\n\n   Current PMIPv6 specification does only
    support the movement of hosts\n   within the localized mobility domain.  A mobile
    network (commonly\n   referred to as a NEMO, NEtwork that MOves) can also benefit
    from the\n   network-based localized mobility support provided by PMIPv6\n   [I-D.ietf-netext-pd-pmip],
    but with some limitations.  This I-D\n   describes what can be done with current
    standardized protocols, and\n   describes the problem statement of fully supporting
    network mobility\n   in Proxy Mobile IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
