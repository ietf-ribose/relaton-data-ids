abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Footprint advertisement is a very important step for CDN\n
    \  interconnection and generates a lot of discussion.  Actually, each\n   CDN
    can serve the whole world if its surrogates are publicly\n   reachable by IP addresses.
    \ But if a CDN does that, it can not\n   satisfy the requirements from the applications.
    \ So CDNs deliver\n   contents for applications, and the basic requirements should
    be from\n   the applications, but there is rare discussion on service level\n
    \  requirements based footprint.  This document is used to generate the\n   discussion
    on this aspect.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
