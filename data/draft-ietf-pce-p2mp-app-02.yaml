abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. Extensions to the MPLS and GMPLS signaling
    and routing protocols have been made in support of point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
    Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). This document examines the
    applicability of PCE to path computation for P2MP TE LSPs in MPLS and GMPLS networks.
    It describes the motivation for using a PCE to compute these paths and examines
    which of the PCE architectural models are appropriate. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
