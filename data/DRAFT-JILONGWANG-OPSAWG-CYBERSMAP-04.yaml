abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo discusses the design of the native cyberspace map
    which is\n   stable and flexible to describe cyberspace.  Although we have\n   accepted
    the cyberspace as a parallel new world, we even have not\n   defined its basic
    coordinate system, which means cyberspace have no\n   its basic space dimension
    till now.  The objective of this draft is\n   to illustrate the basic design methodology
    of the native coordinate\n   system of cyberspace, and show how to design cyberspace
    map on this\n   basis.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
