abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document, it identifies gateways for field-bus networks,
    data\n   storages for archiving and developing data sharing platform, and\n   application
    units to be important system components for developing\n   digital communities:
    i.e., building-scale and city-wide ubiquitous\n   facility networking infrastructure.
    \ The standard defines a data\n   exchange protocol that generalizes and interconnects
    these components\n   (gateways, storages, application units) over the IPv4/v6-based\n
    \  networks.  This enables integration of multiple facilities, data\n   storages,
    application services such as central management, energy\n   saving, environmental
    monitoring and alarm notification systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
