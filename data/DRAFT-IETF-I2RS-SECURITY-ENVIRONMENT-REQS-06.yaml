abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides environment security requirements for
    the I2RS\n   architecture.  Environment security requirements are independent
    of\n   the protocol used for I2RS.  The security environment requirements\n   are
    the good security practices to be used during implementation and\n   deployment
    of the code related to the new interface to routing system\n   (I2RS) so that
    I2RS implementations can be securely deployed and\n   operated.\n\n   Environmental
    security requirements do not specify the I2RS protocol\n   seecurity requirements.
    \ This is done in another document (draft-\n   ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements).\n\n\t
