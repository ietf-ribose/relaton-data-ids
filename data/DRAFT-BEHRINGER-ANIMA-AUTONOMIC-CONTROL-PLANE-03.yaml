abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which\n
    \  depends on some addressing and routing.  This Autonomic Control Plane\n   should
    ideally be self-managing, and as independent as possible of\n   configuration.
    \ One application is a \"virtual out of band channel\"\n   for communications
    over a network that is not configured or mis-\n   configured.  This document describes
    requirements and implementation\n   options for an \"Autonomic Control Plane\".\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
