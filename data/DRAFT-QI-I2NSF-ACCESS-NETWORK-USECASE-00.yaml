abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In traditional telecommunication system, operators usually
    provide\n   general and limited security protection service for users during\n
    \  access (e.g.  AKA in 3G/4G network).  Now, with the development of\n   network
    virtualization technology, the physical network device is\n   became a network
    function software which is running on virtual\n   machine and the network functions
    can be flexible and elastic.  So\n   operators can provide more flexible security
    function to users\n   through network function.  In order to provide more flexible
    security\n   function, an interface between operator's network and user should
    be\n   needed.  The interface will be used to request/negotiate/allocate/\n   operate
    (Virtual) Network Security Functions from operator's network.\n   This draft describes
    use cases for using the interface in operator's\n   network environment.\n\n\t
