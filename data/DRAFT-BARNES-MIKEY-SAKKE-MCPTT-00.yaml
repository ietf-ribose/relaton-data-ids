abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   3GPP TS 33.179 defines the group services and system aspects
    for the\n   Security of Mission Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT) service.  To create\n
    \  a group's security association, a Group Master Key (GMK) and\n   associated
    identifier (GMK-ID) is distributed to MCPTT User Equipment\n   (UE) by a Group
    Management Server (GMS).  The GMK is distributed\n   encrypted specifically to
    a user and signed using an identity\n   representing the Group Management Server.
    \ The GMK is distributed\n   within a Group Key Transport payload, which is a
    MIKEY-SAKKE\n   I_MESSAGE, as defined in RFC 6509, which ensures the confidentiality,\n
    \  integrity and authenticity of the payload.  In order to convey the\n   MCPTT
    specific service in the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE, this document\n   defines new values
    for the Type field of the General Extensions\n   Payload Field defined for MIKEY
    in RFC 3830 the ID Role field in RFC\n   6043 and the ID Scheme field in RFC 6509.\n\n\t
