abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, some service providers
    are\n   choosing to deploy IPv6 only networks without dual-stack\n   functionality
    for IPv4.  However, as access to IPv4 based services\n   will continue to be a
    requirement for the foreseeable future, IPv4\n   over IPv6 mechanisms, such as
    softwire tunnels are being developed.\n\n   In order to provision end-user's hosts
    with the IPv4 configuration\n   necessary for such mechanisms, a number of different
    approaches have\n   been proposed.  This memo discusses each of the proposals,
    identifies\n   the benefits and drawbacks and recommends a single approach as
    the\n   basis for future deployment and development.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
