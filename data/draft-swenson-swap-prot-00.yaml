abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A standard protocol is needed to integrate work providers, asynchronousservices,
    across the intranet/internet and provide for their interaction.The integration
    and interactions consist of control and monitoring of thework. Control means creating
    the work, setting up the work, starting thework, stopping the work, being informed
    of exceptions, being informed ofthe completion of the work and getting the results
    of the work Monitoringmeans checking on the current status of the work and getting
    a history ofthe execution of the work. The protocol should be light weight and
    easy toimplement, so that a variety of devices and situations can be covered.
    The Simple Workflow Access Protocol is a proposed way to solve this problemthrough
    use of HTTP protocol, and by transferring structured informationencoded in XML.
    A new set of HTTP methods is defined, as well as theinformation to be supplied
    and the information returned in XML, thataccomplish the control of generic asynchronous
    services. This hasapplicability to workflow because a workflow is itself an asynchronousservice,
    and it also has the need to be able to call asynchronous servicesaoutside of itself.</p>"
