abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of this document is to facilitate interoperability
    and\n   automation by profiling the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP)\n   version
    2, the related Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)\n   version 2, and the
    HTTP Transfer for the Certificate Management\n   Protocol.  It specifies a subset
    of CMP and CRMF focusing on typical\n   use cases relevant for managing certificates
    of devices in many\n   industrial and IoT scenarios.  To limit the overhead of
    certificate\n   management for more constrained devices only the most crucial
    types\n   of operations are specified as mandatory.  To foster interoperability\n
    \  in more complex scenarios, other types of operations are specified as\n   recommended
    or optional.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
