abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In developing a solution for CDN Internetworking it is necessary
    to\ndefine and accommodate requirements for Authentication,\nAuthorization, and
    Accounting.  Since the Authentication,\nAuthorization, and Accounting (AAA) working
    group is already focused\non defining these requirements, this document attempts
    to leverage\nthat work.  It contains the requirements that would have to be\nsupported
    by a AAA service to formulate a solution for CDN peering.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
