abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC2780 specifies the registration policy for reserved TCP
    header\n   flags as Standards Action.  RFC3168 created an IANA registry for\n
    \  these header flags and registered bit 8 (CWR) and 9 (ECE).  This\n   draft
    changes the registration policy of the registration to IETF\n   Review as usually
    new TCP mechanisms that could use the remaining\n   reserved flags will be first
    specified as experimental.  Not noting\n   any of those experiments in the registry
    would undermine the purpose\n   of having a registry.  However, care must be taken,
    as only a few\n   reserved flags are left and if a new (experimental) mechanism
    sees\n   deployment in the Internet, the flag cannot be unassigned anymore or\n
    \  used for something else.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
