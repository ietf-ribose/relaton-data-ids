abstract:
- content: "<p>Some networks deploy firewalls configured to block UDP traffic. When
    SIP user agents or WebRTC endpoints are deployed behind such firewalls, media
    cannot be sent over UDP across the firewall, but must be sent using TCP (which
    causes a different user experience) or through a session border controller. This
    draft describes an alternate model wherein extensions to ICE connectivity checks
    can be examined by the firewall to permit outgoing UDP flows across the firewall.</p>"
