abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely used security protocol\n
    \  that offers communication security services at the transport layer.\n   The
    initial design of TLS was focused on the protection of\n   applications running
    on top of the Transmission Control Protocol\n   (TCP), and was a good match for
    securing the Hypertext Transfer\n   Protocol (HTTP).  Subsequent standardization
    efforts lead to the\n   publication of the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
    protocol,\n   which allows the re-use of the TLS security functionality and the\n
    \  payloads to be exchanged on top of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).\n\n   With
    the work on the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), as a\n   specialized
    web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and\n   constrained networks,
    DTLS is a preferred communication security\n   protocol.\n\n   Smart objects are
    constrained in various ways (e.g., CPU, memory,\n   power consumption) and these
    limitations may impose restrictions on\n   the protocol stack such a device runs.
    This document only looks at\n   the security part of that protocol stacks and
    the ability to\n   customize TLS/DTLS. To offer input for implementers and system\n
    \  architects this document illustrates the costs and benefits of\n   various
    TLS/DTLS features for use with smart objects and constraint\n   node networks.\n\n\n\t
