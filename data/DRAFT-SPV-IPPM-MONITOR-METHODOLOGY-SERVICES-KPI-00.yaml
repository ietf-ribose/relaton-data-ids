abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We are introducing a new method to calculate services KPIs
    and\n   metrics in the network using TWAMP protocol.  The services here\n   ranging
    from subscriber aware services to security application,\n   Traffic load balancing,
    content delivery, real time streaming and\n   like.The KPIs discussed in this
    draft include Service Latency,\n   Serviced Packets Count, Serviced Subscriber
    Count, Application\n   Liveliness and Session load per Service.  KPIs monitoring
    of these\n   services therefore, play a vital role in optimum usage of network\n
    \  resources such as capacity and throughput.  Once we have the\n   attributes
    like service latency, the network topology can be chosen\n   to provide better
    quality of experience to the end user.  For\n   different services, the attributes
    may vary and our design takes care\n   of supporting different KPIs for different
    services model.\n   Additionally, liveliness of application and servers can be
    monitored\n   using this proposed solution.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
