abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding
    standard ITU-T Recommendation H.265 and ISO/IEC International Standard 23008-2,
    both also known as High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and developed by the Joint
    Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC).  The RTP payload format allows for
    packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP
    packet payload as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.
    \ Furthermore, it supports transmission of an HEVC bitstream over a single stream
    as well as multiple RTP streams.  When multiple RTP streams are used, a single
    transport or multiple transports may be utilized.  The payload format has wide
    applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate
    entertainment-quality video, among others.\n\t </p>\n      "
