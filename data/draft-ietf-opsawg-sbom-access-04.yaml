- content: "<p>To improve cybersecurity posture, automation is necessary to locate
    what software is running on a device, whether that software has known vulnerabilities,
    and what, if any recommendations suppliers may have. This memo specifies a model
    to provide access to this information. It may optionally be discovered through
    manufacturer usage descriptions.</p>"
