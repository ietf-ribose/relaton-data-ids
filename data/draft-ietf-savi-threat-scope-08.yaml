abstract:
  content: "<p>The Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) effort aims to complement
    ingress filtering with finer-grained, standardized IP source address validation.
    This document describes threats enabled by IP source address spoofing both in
    the global and finer-grained context, describes currently available solutions
    and challenges, and provides a starting point analysis for finer-grained (host
    granularity) anti-spoofing work.</p>"
