abstract:
  content: "<p>The need for assured communication arisen protocols like RSVP [2]and
    SBM [3] which are linked to access technologies to guarantee thedelay and drop
    probabilities of a given IP flow.One of the side-effects of the assurance is that
    when the bandwidthof the IP flow goes outside the contracted region then the IP
    flowwill be disturbed and the communication will be effected.This document discusses
    the effects of assured communication to SDPprotocol, identifies the weaknesses
    and proposes a new attribute torectify these weaknesses.</p>"
