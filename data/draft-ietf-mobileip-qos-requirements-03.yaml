abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Mobile IP ensures correct routing of packets to mobile node as themobile
    node changes its point of attachment to the Internet.However, it is also required
    to provide proper QoS forwardingtreatment to mobile node's packet stream at the
    intermediate nodesin the network, so that QoS-sensitive IP services can be supportedover
    Mobile IP. This document describes requirements for an IP QoSmechanism for its
    satisfactory operation with Mobile IP.</p>"
