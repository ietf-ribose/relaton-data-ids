abstract:
- content: "<p>Path computation in a large-scale SDN indeed requires a significant
    amount of computation load. The SDN controller can easily suffer from performance
    degradation resulting from the centralized design of control plane. In this document,
    we argue the necessity in building a distributed model to speed up the path computation
    in SDN control plane. With proper consistency model, path computation can be implemented
    among multiple controllers.</p>"
