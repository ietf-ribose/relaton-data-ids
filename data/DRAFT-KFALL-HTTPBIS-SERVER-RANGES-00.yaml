abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document clarifies the semantics associated with the Content-Range\nHTTP
    header and associated Partial Content (206) response code.\n\nIt specifically
    allows a server to produce a Content-Range response\nwhose range is a subrange
    of the corresponding range requested using a\nprevious Range request. The HTTP
    protocol syntax is not modified.\nInstead, this document clarifies that a server
    responding to a client\nrequesting a range (x-y) may respond with a range ((x+e)-(y-f))
    for\nnonzero integers e,f such that (x+e) &lt; (y-f). In addition, it clarifies\nthe
    semantics of Request ranges which contain only a starting value.\n\n\t </p>\n
