abstract:
  content: "\t <t>CASP is a modular potocol for establishing network control state
    along adata path between two nodes communicating on the Internet.The signalling
    problem addressed by CASP is the same as the overallproblem being addressed by
    the NSIS activities.The CASP framework is defined as a modular protocol, which
    includes ageneral purpose messaging layer (M-layer), which supports a number ofclient
    layers for particular signalling applications (e.g. QoS, MIDCOM).In addition there
    is distinct, special purpose client component fornext-peer discovery.</p>"
