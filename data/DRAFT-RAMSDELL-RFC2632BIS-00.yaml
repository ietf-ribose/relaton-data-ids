abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), described
    in\n[SMIME-MSG], provides a method to send and receive secure MIME\nmessages.
    Before using a public key to provide security services, the\nS/MIME agent MUST
    certify that the public key is valid. S/MIME agents\nMUST use PKIX certificates
    to validate public keys as described in the\nInternet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKIX) Certificate and CRL\nProfile [KEYM]. S/MIME agents MUST meet the certificate
    processing\nrequirements documented in this document in addition to those stated\nin
    [KEYM].\n\t </p>\n      "
