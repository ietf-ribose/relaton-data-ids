abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Usage
    for managing shared write access to RELOAD Resources. Shared Resources in RELOAD
    (ShaRe) form a basic primitive for enabling various coordination and notification
    schemes among distributed peers. Access in ShaRe is controlled by a hierarchical
    trust delegation scheme maintained within an access list. A new USER-CHAIN-ACL
    access policy allows authorized peers to write a Shared Resource without owning
    its corresponding certificate. This specification also adds mechanisms to store
    Resources with a variable name that is useful whenever peer-independent rendezvous
    processes are required.</p>"
