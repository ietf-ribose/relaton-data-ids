abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the operation of IP over tunnel virtual links
    using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO). Nodes attached to AERO links
    can exchange packets via trusted intermediate routers that provide forwarding
    services to reach off-link destinations and redirection services for route optimization.
    AERO provides an IPv6 link-local address format known as the AERO address that
    supports operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol and links IPv6
    ND to IP forwarding. Admission control, provisioning and mobility are supported
    by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), and route optimization
    is naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates. Although DHCPv6
    and IPv6 ND messaging are used in the control plane, both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported
    in the data plane. AERO is a widely-applicable tunneling solution using standard
    control messaging exchanges as described in this document.</p>"
