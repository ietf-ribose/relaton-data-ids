abstract:
- content: "<p>The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
    is an HTTP based protocol that makes managing identities in multi- domain scenarios
    easier to support through a standardized service. Examples include but are not
    limited to enterprise to cloud service providers, and inter-cloud based scenarios.
    This specification extends the SCIM Protocol to include support for HTTP SEARCH.</p>"
