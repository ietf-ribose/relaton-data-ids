abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies mechanisms for backward compatibility of Ethernet
    VPN (EVPN) and Provider Backbone Bridge Ethernet VPN (PBB- EVPN) solutions with
    Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) and Provider Backbone Bridge VPLS (PBB-VPLS)
    solutions. It also provides mechanisms for seamless integration of these two technologies
    in the same MPLS/IP network on a per-VPN-instance basis. Implementation of this
    document enables service providers to introduce EVPN/PBB-EVPN PEs in their brown-field
    deployments of VPLS/PBB-VPLS networks. This document specifies control-plane and
    forwarding behavior needed for auto-discovery of a VPN instance, multicast and
    unicast operation, as well as MAC-mobility operation in order to enable seamless
    integration between EVPN and VPLS PEs as well as between PBB-VPLS and PBB-EVPN
    PEs.</p>"
