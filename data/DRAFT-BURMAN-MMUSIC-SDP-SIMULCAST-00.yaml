abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In some application scenarios it may be desirable to send multiple\n
    \  differently encoded versions of the same media source in independent\n   RTP
    streams.  This is called simulcast.  This document discusses the\n   best way
    of accomplishing simulcast in RTP and how to signal it in\n   SDP.  A solution
    is defined by making an extension to SDP, and using\n   RTP/RTCP identification
    methods to relate RTP streams belonging to\n   the same media source.  The SDP
    extension consists a new media level\n   SDP attribute that express capability
    to send and/or receive\n   simulcast RTP streams.  One part of the RTP/RTCP identification\n
    \  method is included as a reference to a separate document, since it is\n   useful
    also for other purposes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
