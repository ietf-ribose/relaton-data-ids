abstract:
- content: "<p>Event-driven management is meant to provide a useful method to monitor
    state change of managed objects and resources, and facilitate automatic triggering
    of a response to events, based on an established set of rules. This would provide
    rapid autonomic responses to specific conditions, enabling self-management behaviors,
    including: self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization, and self- protection.
    This document provides a framework that describes the architecture for supporting
    event-driven management of managed object state across devices. It does not describe
    specific protocols or protocol extensions needed to realize the objectives and
    capabilities discussed in the document.</p>"
