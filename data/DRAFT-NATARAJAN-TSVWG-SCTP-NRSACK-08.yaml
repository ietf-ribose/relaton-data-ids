abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960] specifies\n
    \  Selective Acknowledgements (SACKs) to allow an SCTP data receiver to\n   acknowledge
    DATA chunks which arrive out-of-order.  In SCTP, SACK\n   information is advisory
    -- though SACKs notify a data sender about\n   the reception of specific out-of-order
    data, the SCTP data receiver\n   is permitted to later discard the data, a.k.a
    reneging.  Since\n   delivery of a SACKed out-of-order DATA chunk is not guaranteed,
    a\n   copy of this DATA chunk MUST be kept in the data sender's\n   retransmission
    queue until this DATA chunk is cumulatively acked.\n\n   By definition, data that
    has been delivered to the application is\n   non-renegable by the SCTP data receiver.
    \ (Recall that, in SCTP, out-\n   of-order data can sometimes be delivered.)  Also,
    SCTP\n   implementations can be configured such that the SCTP data receiver is\n
    \  not allowed to, and therefore, never reneges on out-of-order data.\n   With
    SCTP's current SACK mechanism, non-renegable out-of-order data\n   is selectively
    acked, and is (wrongly) deemed renegable by the SCTP\n   data sender.\n\n   This
    document specifies an extension to SCTP's acknowledgment\n   mechanism called
    Non-Renegable Selective Acknowledgements (NR-SACKs.)\n   NR-SACKs enable a data
    receiver to explicitly inform the data sender\n   of non-renegable out-of-order
    data.  As opposed to renegable data, a\n   data sender can consider non-renegable
    data as never requiring\n   retransmission, and therefore can remove non-renegable
    data from the\n   retransmission queue.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
