abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explains how to use the TCP Security Filter mechanism
    to initiate a Transport Layer Security (TLS) session to secure HTTP connections
    over the Internet. This allows unsecured and secured HTTP traffic to share the
    same well known port (in this case, http: at 80 rather than https: at 443). As
    an additional point, a similar mechanism like the described here could be used
    to provide other different kind of layers to HTTP connections.</p>"
