abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a set of TCP extensions to improve\n
    \  performance over paths with a large bandwidth * delay product and to\n   provide
    reliable operation over very high-speed paths.  It defines\n   the TCP Window
    Scale (WS) option and the TCP Timestamps (TS) option\n   and their semantics.
    \ The Window Scale option is used to support\n   larger receive windows, while
    the Timestamps option can be used for\n   at least two distinct mechanisms, PAWS
    (Protection Against Wrapped\n   Sequences) and RTTM (Round Trip Time Measurement),
    that are also\n   described herein.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC1323 and
    describes changes from it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
