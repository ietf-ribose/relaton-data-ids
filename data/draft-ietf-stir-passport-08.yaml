abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a method for creating and validating a token
    that cryptographically verifies an originating identity, or more generally a URI
    or telephone number representing the originator of personal communications. The
    PASSporT token is cryptographically signed to protect the integrity of the identity
    the originator and to verify the assertion of the identity information at the
    destination. The cryptographic signature is defined with the intention that it
    can confidently verify the originating persona even when the signature is sent
    to the destination party over an insecure channel. PASSporT is particularly useful
    for many personal communications applications over IP networks and other multi-hop
    interconnection scenarios where the originating and destination parties may not
    have a direct trusted relationship.</p>"
