abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In contrast to the present Internet architecture, a path-aware\n
    \  internetworking architecture has two important properties: it exposes\n   the
    properties of available Internet paths to endpoints, and provides\n   for endpoints
    and applications to use these properties to select\n   paths through the Internet
    for their traffic.  While this property of\n   \"path awareness\" already exists
    in many Internet-connected networks\n   within single domains and via administrative
    interfaces to the\n   network layer, a fully path-aware internetwork expands these
    concepts\n   across layers and across the Internet.\n\n   This document poses
    questions in path-aware networking open as of\n   2021, that must be answered
    in the design, development, and\n   deployment of path-aware internetworks.  It
    was originally written to\n   frame discussions in the Path Aware Networking proposed
    Research\n   Group (PANRG), and has been published to snapshot current thinking
    in\n   this space.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
