abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The RRG is working on the design of an alternate Internet\nArchitecture
    in order solve issues of the current architecture\nrelated to scalability, mobility,
    multi-homing, and inter-domain\nrouting.  Among the various proposals, LISP (Locator/ID
    Separation\nProtocol) is one of the most advanced.  The present draft describes\nthe
    overall architecture of OpenLISP, an open source implementation\nof the LISP proposal.
    \ Further, the draft contains some general\nremarks concerning the design and
    the implementation of the LISP\nprotocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
