abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile networks are changing towards distributed mobility management
    (DMM), tackling inefficiencies of existing mobility protocols regarding network
    management and packet routing. Identifying IP multicast use cases applicable to
    DMM is a logical step before exploring solution spaces. This document describes
    use cases where IP multicast is applied in DMM environments, considering two main
    deployment options: multicast router or MLD-Proxy deployment at a Mobility Access
    Router (MAR). Due to the lack of standard terminology, we refer to MAR as the
    entity embedding mobility-related functions, e.g. providing network access and
    flow anchoring capabilities. Each deployment option is thoroughly analyzed regarding
    its advantages and disadvantages, and both multicast listener and source mobility
    support are considered.</p>"
