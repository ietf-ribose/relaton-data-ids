abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The exhaustion of IPv4 addresses is coming, while due to manyreasons,
    no significant IPv6 deployment has occured. The transitionof users, networks and
    services from IPv4 to IPv6 is not so smoothlyand expeditiously as expected. The
    solutions now available are notsufficient for all the scenarios, so the IPv6 deployment
    models arerevisited, and some new methods used for transition have beendeveloped
    to complement the existing ones. This document discussesthe transition of services
    and the use of these new mechanisms fromthe ISP's point of view to provide approaches
    to the transition forICPs.</p>"
