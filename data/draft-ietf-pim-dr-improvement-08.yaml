abstract:
  content: "<p>Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is widely deployed
    multicast protocol. As deployment for PIM protocol is growing day by day, user
    expects lower traffic loss and faster convergence in case of any network failure.
    This document provides an extension to the existing protocol which would improve
    the stability of the PIM protocol with respect to traffic loss and convergence
    time when the PIM DR role changes.</p>"
