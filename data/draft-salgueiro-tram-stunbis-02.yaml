abstract:
- content: "<p>Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves
    as a tool for other protocols in dealing with Network Address Translator (NAT)
    traversal. It can be used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port
    allocated to it by a NAT. It can also be used to check connectivity between two
    endpoints, and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings. STUN works with
    many existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them. STUN
    is not a NAT traversal solution by itself. Rather, it is a tool to be used in
    the context of a NAT traversal solution. This document obsoletes RFC 5389.</p>"
