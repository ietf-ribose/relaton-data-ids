abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The details of Generic Security Service (GSS) credential store\n
    \  management vary by platform and even by GSS mechanism.  Credential\n   store
    management is an interesting concept that requires exploration.\n\n   This document
    defines a small extension to the GSS-API for GSS-API\n   credential store management.
    \ While exploration of the credential\n   store management problem is the goal
    of this document, implementation\n   of these interfaces is not discounted nor
    discouraged.\n\t </p>\n      "
