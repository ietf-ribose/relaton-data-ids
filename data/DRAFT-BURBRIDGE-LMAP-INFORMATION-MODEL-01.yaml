abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Information Model applies to the Measurement Agent within
    a\n   Large-Scale Measurement Platform.  As such it outlines the\n   information
    that is (pre-)configured on the MA or exists in\n   communications with a Controller
    or Collector within an LMAP\n   framework.  The purpose of such an Information
    Model is to provide a\n   protocol and device independent view of the MA that
    can be\n   implemented via one or more Control and Report protocols.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
