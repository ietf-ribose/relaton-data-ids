abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet-Draft presents a new scheme that enables the\n
    \  simultaneous re-authentication of a group of nodes in an efficient\n   manner.
    The Internet-Draft proposes to aggregate the re-\n   authentications of multiple
    network nodes members of the same group.\n   The scheme is based on the Extensible
    Authentication Protocol (EAP)\n   framework, defined in RFC 3748. As an example
    of operation, a method\n   inspired from EAP-GPSK RFC 5433, is provided.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
