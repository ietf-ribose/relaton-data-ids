abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes how to support mobile networks with MobileIP
    or Mobile IPv6 using reverse tunneling. It provides this supportcapability with
    no modifications to Mobile IP or routing protocolsignaling, but also defines new
    extensions to ease in the implementationof network mobility. There are two described
    scenarios of mobile routersupport, consumer mode, and fully enabled mode. In the
    former, themobile router is not allowed to use routing protocol signaling with
    thehome agent, but performs routing for subnet(s) assigned to it. In thelatter
    mode, both the home agent and the mobile router use a routingprotocol in the same
    manner as fixed routers.</p>"
