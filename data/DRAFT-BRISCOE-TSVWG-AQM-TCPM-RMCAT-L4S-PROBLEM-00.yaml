abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document motivates a new service that the Internet could
    provide\n   to eventually replace best efforts for all traffic: Low Latency, Low\n
    \  Loss, Scalable throughput (L4S).  It is becoming common for all (or\n   most)
    applications being run by a user at any one time to require low\n   latency, but
    the only solution the IETF can offer for ultra-low\n   queuing latency is Diffserv,
    which only offers low latency for some\n   packets at the expense of others.  Diffserv
    has also proved hard to\n   deploy widely end-to-end.\n\n   In contrast, a zero-config
    incrementally deployable solution has been\n   demonstrated that keeps average
    queuing delay under a millisecond for\n   _all_ applications even under very heavy
    load; and it keeps\n   congestion loss to zero.  At the same time it solves the
    long-running\n   problem with the scalability of TCP throughput.  Even with a
    high\n   capacity broadband access, the resulting performance under load is\n
    \  remarkably and consistently improved for applications such as\n   interactive
    video, conversational video, voice, Web, gaming, instant\n   messaging, remote
    desktop and cloud-based apps.  This document\n   explains the underlying problems
    that have been preventing the\n   Internet from enjoying such performance improvements.
    \ It then\n   outlines the parts necessary for a solution and the steps that will\n
    \  be needed to standardize them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
