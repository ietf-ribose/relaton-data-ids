abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a protocol for Network Address Translator\n
    \  (NAT) traversal for UDP-based multimedia sessions established with\n   the
    offer/answer model.  This protocol is called Interactive\n   Connectivity Establishment
    (ICE).  ICE makes use of the Session\n   Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol
    and its extension,\n   Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN).  ICE can be used by any
    protocol\n   utilizing the offer/answer model, such as the Session Initiation\n
    \  Protocol (SIP).\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 5245.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
