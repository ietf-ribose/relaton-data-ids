abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how to extend the Internet Key Exchange Protocol
    Version 2 (IKEv2) to allow multiple key exchanges to take place while computing
    a shared secret during a Security Association (SA) setup. The primary application
    of this feature in IKEv2 is the ability to perform one or more post-quantum key
    exchanges in conjunction with the classical (Elliptic Curve) Diffie-Hellman key
    exchange, so that the resulting shared key is resistant against quantum computer
    attacks. Another possible application is the ability to combine several key exchanges
    in situations when no single key exchange algorithm is trusted by both initiator
    and responder. This document updates RFC7296 by renaming a transform type 4 from
    "Diffie-Hellman Group (D-H)" to "Key Exchange Method (KE)" and renaming a field
    in the Key Exchange Payload from "Diffie-Hellman Group Num" to "Key Exchange Method".
    It also renames an IANA registry for this transform type from "Transform Type
    4 - Diffie- Hellman Group Transform IDs" to "Transform Type 4 - Key Exchange Method
    Transform IDs". These changes generalize key exchange algorithms that can be used
    in IKEv2.</p>
