abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the traceroute facility for Content-Centric\n
    \  Network (CCN), named \"Contrace\".  Contrace investigates: 1) the\n   routing
    path information per name prefix, device name, and function/\n   application,
    2) the Round-Trip Time (RTT) between content forwarder\n   and consumer, and 3)
    the states of in-network cache per name prefix.\n   In addition, it discovers
    a gateway that supports different protocols\n   such as CCN and NDN.\n\n\t </p>\n
