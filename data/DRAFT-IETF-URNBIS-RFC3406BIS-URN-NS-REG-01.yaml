abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are intended to serve as persistent,\n
    \  location-independent, resource identifiers.  To structure and\n   organize
    their usage, the URN syntax specifies a hierarchy that\n   divides the set of
    possible URNs into \"URN Namespaces\" that can be\n   individually defined and
    managed.  URN Namespaces in particular serve\n   to map existing identifier systems
    into the URN system and thereby\n   make available generic, network-based resolution
    services for the\n   identified documents, artifacts, and other objects (and their\n
    \  metadata).\n\n   To actually leverage such synergetic advantage, URN Namespaces
    need\n   to be specified in a comparable manner, and their Namespace\n   Identifiers
    (NIDs) need to be registered with IANA, so that naming\n   conflicts are avoided
    and implementers of services can follow a\n   structured approach in support of
    various namespaces, guided by the\n   registry to the related documents and the
    particularities of specific\n   namespaces, as described in these namespace registration
    documents.\n\n   This document serves as a guideline for authors of URN Namespace\n
    \  definition and registration documents.  It describes the essential\n   content
    of such documents and how they shall be structured to allow\n   readers familar
    with the scheme to quickly assess the properties of a\n   specific URN Namespace.
    \ Further, this RFC describes the process to\n   be followed to get a URN Namespace
    registered with IANA.\n\n   This document is a companion document to the revised
    URN Syntax\n   specification, RFC 2141bis; it supersedes and replaces RFC 3406.\n\n\t
