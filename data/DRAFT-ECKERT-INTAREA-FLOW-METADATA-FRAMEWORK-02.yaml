abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a framework for communicating information\n
    \  elements (a.k.a. metadata) in a consistent manner between\n   applications
    and the network to provide better visibility of\n   application flows, thereby
    enabling differentiated treatment of those\n   flows.  These information elements
    can be conveyed using various\n   signaling protocols, including PCP, RSVP, and
    STUN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
