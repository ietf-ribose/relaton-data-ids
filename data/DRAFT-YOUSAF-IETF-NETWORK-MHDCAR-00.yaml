abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) protocol specified
    in \n[1] is aimed to enable seamless IP layer handover by aiding seamless \nLayer
    3 (L3) mobility management protocols like Fast Mobile IP (FMIP) \nby providing
    identity and capabilities information of the candidate \naccess routers (CARs)
    to the mobile node (MN) prior to the initiation \nof handover while the MN is
    still connected to its current AR. \n \n \n The specifications as laid down in
    [1], however, specifies a very \ngeneric mechanism of the CARD protocol effective
    only in specific \nnetwork architecture scenarios and it doesn't take into account
    the \nstringent requirements of a fast moving MN and real time \ncommunication
    sessions, especially when it comes to resolving \ncandidate access routers that
    my be adjacent geographically but not \ntopologically. \n\nThis draft addresses
    the expected shortcomings of the base CARD \nprotocol with respect to fast moving
    MNs and real time communication \nsessions by proposing extensions that is expected
    to improve and/or \nenhance the performance of the generic CARD protocol as specified
    in \n[1].\n\t </p>\n      "
