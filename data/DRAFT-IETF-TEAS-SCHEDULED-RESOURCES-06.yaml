abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Time-scheduled reservation of traffic engineering (TE) resources
    can\n   be used to provide resource booking for TE Label Switched Paths so as\n
    \  to better guarantee services for customers and to improve the\n   efficiency
    of network resource usage at any moment in time including\n   future planned network
    usage.  This document provides a framework\n   that describes and discusses the
    architecture for supporting\n   scheduled reservation of TE resources.  This document
    does not\n   describe specific protocols or protocol extensions needed to realize\n
    \  this service.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
