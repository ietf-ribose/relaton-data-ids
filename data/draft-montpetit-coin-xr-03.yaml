abstract:
- content: "<p>Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), combined as Extended
    Reality or XR, challenge networking technologies and protocols because they combine
    the features of fast information display, image processing, computing and forwarding.
    This document presents some of these challenges and how adding computing in the
    network could respond to them.</p>"
