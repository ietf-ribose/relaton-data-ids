- content: "<p>This memo defines the publication stream for RFCs from the Internet
    Research Task Force. Most documents undergoing this process will come from IRTF
    Research Groups, and it is expected that they will be published as Informational
    or Experimental RFCs by the RFC Editor. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
