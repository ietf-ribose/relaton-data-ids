abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The KINK working group is chartered to create a standards trackprotocol
    to facilitate centralized key exchange in an applicationindependent fashion. Participating
    systems will use the Kerberosarchitecture as defined in RFC 1510 for key management
    and the KINKprotocol between applications. The goal of the working group is toproduce
    a low latency, computationally efficient, easily managed, andcryptographically
    sound protocol that is flexible enough to be ableto be extended for many applications.The
    focus of the initial working group will be keying IPsec securityassociations as
    defined in RFC 2401. The working group may considermeans to key other protocols
    in the future, but the initial goal ofthe KINK working group is specifically targeted
    at producing a lowlatency and computationally efficient keying mechanism for IPsec.
    Theworking group will not be involved with, nor should it requirechanges to either
    IPsec (RFC 2401), or Kerberos (RFC 1510).</p>"
