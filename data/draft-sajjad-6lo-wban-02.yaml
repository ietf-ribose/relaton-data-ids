abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) intend to facilitate use cases
    related to medical field. IEEE 802.15.6 defines PHY and MAC layer and is designed
    to deal with better penetration through the human tissue without creating any
    damage to human tissues with the approved MICS (Medical Implant Communication
    Service) band by USA Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Devices of WBANs
    conform to this IEEE standard. This specification defines details to enable transmission
    of IPv6 packets, method of forming link-local and statelessly autoconfigured IPv6
    addresses on WBANs.</p>"
