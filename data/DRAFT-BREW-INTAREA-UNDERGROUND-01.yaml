abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When users are at known underground locations, such as tube stations\nthey
    often do not have a GPS signal, as the radio waves from the\nsatellites required
    cannot penetrate the earth, this draft suggests\nproviding GPS locations over
    WiFI using remote IP detection for a\nserver to respond with the correct name
    of clients location and\nthe clients GPS location.IP address.\n\n\nExtending this
    to those without WiFI access the standard goes one\nstage further, by offering
    a hidden WiFI network with a standard name,\nsuch as .location. The principle
    being that mobile devices can\nlook for this network in cases where GPS data cannot
    be collected. It\nis hoped that this will allow those using mapping services to
    know\nwhere they are when travelling on underground trains etc.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
