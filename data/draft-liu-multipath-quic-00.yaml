abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies multipath extension for the QUIC protocol to
    enable the simultaneous usage of multiple paths for a single connection. The extension
    is compliant with the single-path QUIC design. The design principle is to support
    multipath by adding limited extension to [QUIC-TRANSPORT].Discussion Venues This
    note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC. Source for this draft and an
    issue tracker can be found at https://github.com/yfmascgy/Multipath-QUIC-IETF-Draft.</p>"
