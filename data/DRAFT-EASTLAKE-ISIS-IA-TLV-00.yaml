abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate\n
    \  System) TLV that enables the reporting by an Intermediate System of\n   sets
    of addresses of different types such that all of the addresses\n   in each set
    designate the same interface. For example, an EUI-48 MAC\n   (Extended Unique
    Identifier 48-bit, Media Access Control) address,\n   IPv4 address, and IPv6 address
    can be reported as all corresponding\n   to the same interface. Such information
    could be used, for example,\n   to synthesize responses to or by-pass the need
    for the Address\n   Resolution Protocol (ARP) or the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)\n
    \  protocol in some cases.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
