abstract:
- content: "<p>As SRv6 and the new services such as IOAM are progressing, more and
    more new requirements are imposed upon the IPv6 extension headers, i.e.. Hop-by-hop
    Options Header, Destination Options Header and Routing Header. This document defines
    new IPv6 extension headers and corresponding processing procedures considering
    the interactions among the existing IPv6 extension headers, SRH and the newly
    introduced IPv6 extension headers.</p>"
