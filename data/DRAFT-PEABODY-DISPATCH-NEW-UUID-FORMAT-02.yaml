abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents new time-based UUID formats which are
    suited\n   for use as a database key.\n\n   A common case for modern applications
    is to create a unique\n   identifier for use as a primary key in a database table.
    \ This\n   identifier usually implements an embedded timestamp that is sortable\n
    \  using the monotonic creation time in the most significant bits.  In\n   addition
    the identifier is highly collision resistant, difficult to\n   guess, and provides
    minimal security attack surfaces.  None of the\n   existing UUID versions, including
    UUIDv1, fulfill each of these\n   requirements in the most efficient possible
    way.  This document is a\n   proposal to update [RFC4122] with three new UUID
    versions that\n   address these concerns, each with different trade-offs.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
