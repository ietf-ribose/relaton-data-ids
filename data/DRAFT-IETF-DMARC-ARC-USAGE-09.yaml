abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) provides an authenticated\n
    \  \"chain of custody\" for a message, allowing each entity that handles\n   the
    message to see what entities handled it before, and to see what\n   the message's
    authentication assessment was at each step in the\n   handling.  But the specification
    does not indicate how the entities\n   handling these messages should interpret
    or utilize ARC results in\n   making decisions about message disposition.  This
    document will\n   provide guidance in these areas.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
