abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies extensions to the Service Location Protocol\nverson
    2 (SLPv2) which allow applications residing in Mobile IPv6\nnodes to interact
    with SLPv2 agents in fixed networks.  Each mobile\nnode contains a Visiting Agent
    which communicates with Access Agents\nresiding in fixed networks.  In networks
    already deployed with SLPv2-\nbased service infrastructure, this allows applications
    in visiting\nmobile nodes to use SLPv2 and provide site-local services without\nneeding
    prior knowledge or static configuration of the networks they\nvisit.  By monitoring
    changes in Access Agent Advertisements,\nVisiting Agents can decide if the mobile
    node has moved to a new\nnetwork, and if it is necessary to rediscover and reregister
    site-\nlocal services.  This document extends SLPv2 and the SLP API with new\nmessage
    types, error codes and function calls.  Both C and Java API\nbindings are provided.\n\n\t
