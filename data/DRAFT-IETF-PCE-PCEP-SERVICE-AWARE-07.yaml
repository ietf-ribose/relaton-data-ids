abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks like financial information network (stock/\n
    \  commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications,\n   Latency
    (delay), Latency Variation (jitter) and Packet Loss are\n   becoming key requirements
    for path computation along with other\n   constraints and metrics.  These metrics
    are associated with the\n   Service Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and
    service\n   providers.  The Link Bandwidth Utilization (the total bandwidth of
    a\n   link in current use for the forwarding) is another important factor\n   to
    consider during path computation.\n\n   IGP Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric extensions
    describes mechanisms\n   with which network performance information is distributed
    via OSPF\n   and IS-IS respectively.  The Path Computation Element Communication\n
    \  Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements\n   (PCEs)
    to perform path computations in response to Path Computation\n   Clients (PCCs)
    requests.  This document describes the extension to\n   PCEP to carry Latency,
    Latency Variation, Packet Loss, and Link\n   Bandwidth Utilization as constraints
    for end to end path computation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
