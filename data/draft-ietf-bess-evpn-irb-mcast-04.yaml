abstract:
- content: <p>Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides a service that allows a single Local Area
    Network (LAN), comprising a single IP subnet, to be divided into multiple "segments".
    Each segment may be located at a different site, and the segments are interconnected
    by an IP or MPLS backbone. Intra-subnet traffic (either unicast or multicast)
    always appears to the endusers to be bridged, even when it is actually carried
    over the IP or MPLS backbone. When a single "tenant" owns multiple such LANs,
    EVPN also allows IP unicast traffic to be routed between those LANs. This document
    specifies new procedures that allow inter-subnet IP multicast traffic to be routed
    among the LANs of a given tenant, while still making intra-subnet IP multicast
    traffic appear to be bridged. These procedures can provide optimal routing of
    the inter- subnet multicast traffic, and do not require any such traffic to leave
    a given router and then reenter that same router. These procedures also accommodate
    IP multicast traffic that needs to travel to or from systems that are outside
    the EVPN domain.</p>
