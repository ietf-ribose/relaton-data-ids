abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>While the Domain Name System (DNS) has allowed any octets in labels\nand
    ressource records since its inception, traditionally, addresses\nused for hostnames,
    email addresses, and other names actuall used in\nthe DNS were limited to ASCII
    characters.\n\nThis memo defines an extension to allow the use of a wide range
    of\ninternationalised addresses that need to be converted to ACE form on\nthe
    wire, including domain names and email addresses in zone master\nfiles, without
    removing the ability to include arbitrary octets.\n\t </p>\n      "
