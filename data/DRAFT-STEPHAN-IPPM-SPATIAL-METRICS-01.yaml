abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group has standardized
    \nmetrics for measuring end-to-end performance. This memo defines \nspatial metrics
    both for measuring end-to-end network performance \nusing aggregation of sequence
    of network measures and for measuring \nthe performance of segments of an IP path
    trajectory. It \ndistinguishes clearly the decomposition of one end-to-end measure
    \nresult in a sequence of per hop results from the aggregation of a \nsequence
    of per hop measure results in an end-to-end result.\n\t </p>\n      "
