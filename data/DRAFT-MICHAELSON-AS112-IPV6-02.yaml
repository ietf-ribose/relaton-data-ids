abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To reduce longterm traffic to the DNS root servers and the
    IP6.ARPA\n   authoritative servers, the IAB is requested to instruct the IANA
    to\n   delegate a set of sub-domains of IP6.ARPA to the AS112 Project\n   [RFC6304].
    \ These domains represent IPv6 address prefixes that are\n   not conventionally
    populated in the global reverse-DNS, including\n   IPv6 prefixes that are not
    globally scoped and certain prefixes used\n   in an anycast context.\n\n   The
    reverse DNS query load associated with these IPv6 address\n   prefixes appear
    to have unacceptable scaling consequences as IPv6\n   uptake increases.  By delegating
    these sub-domains to the AS112\n   project, the DNS query load can be passed to
    a distributed sink,\n   reducing the query load on the root servers and the IP6.ARPA\n
    \  authoritative servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
