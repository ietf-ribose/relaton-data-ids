abstract:
- content: "<p>Pervasive Monitoring (PM) attacks on the privacy of Internet users
    is of serious concern to both the user and operator community. RFC7258 discussed
    the critical need to protect users' privacy when developing IETF specifications
    and also recognized making networks unmanageable to mitigate PM is not an acceptable
    outcome, an appropriate balance is needed. This document discusses current security
    and network management practices that may be impacted by the shift to increased
    use of encryption to help guide protocol development in support of manageable,
    secure networks.</p>"
