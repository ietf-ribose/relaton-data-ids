abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>During the Cisco [Cisco] European networkers Conference 2009 that
    ran\nfrom 26th to 29th January in Barcelona native IPv6 was added to the\ntraditional
    IPv4 infrastructure.  During this conference the 3500\nattendees had dual stack
    access to both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.\nThe goal of this IPv6 deployment
    project was to gather usage\nstatistics in a situation where the end-user just
    wants to access\nhis/her enterprise VPN or simply get onto the Internet.  The\ncollected
    statistics are not only useful per se but this document\npresents easy ways to
    measure the quality of the IPv6 connectivity\noffered on such events.  In essence
    the users were not conducting\nIPv6 technology tests, but were just using Internet
    services.  The\nstatistics collected give some pieces of information on the size
    and\nimpact of IPv6 onto the normal userbase and will also derive the\nimportance
    of IPv6 onto the infrastructiure and end-user operating\nsystems and firewall
    technologies.  The experiment ran in\ncollaboration with Google [Google] and Tata-Communications
    [Tata].\n\t </p>\n      "
