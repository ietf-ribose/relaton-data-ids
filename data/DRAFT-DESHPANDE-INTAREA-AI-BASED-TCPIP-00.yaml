    Networks are evolving from Wireless Networks and Programming.\n\tThis draft describes
    how Big Data bottlenecks are present in\n\tcurrent Networks.\n\tThis draft describes
    Network and Cloud Orchestrated Reflectors\n\tfor resolving the Big Data bottleneck
    at Inter-AS and CSC\n\t(Carrier Supporting Carrier) level. This draft proposes
    a Context\n\tMapping Language for E2E context-awareness and M2M communication.\n\tThis
    draft proposes Path diversity in Wired Networks as it evolves\n\tfrom Wireless
    Networks. Path diversity through Cloud Orchestrated\n\tReflectors can be implemented
    through the Wireless concepts of\n\tRx Diversity, Tx Diversity and MIMO (Multi-Input,
    Multi-Output)\n\tThis draft is more of a fundamental concept that identifies how
    the\n\tNetwork is evolving. This draft explains about the implicit\n\tlife cycle,
    which is also somewhat mathematical as it involves\n\tone-to-many and many-to-one
    function mapping between Cloud and\n\tNetwork reflectors. Then it relates the
    many cloud reflectors\n\ttogether throug\tWireless network technologies like Tx,
    Rx\n\tdiversity and MIMO. This draft explains how this can be\n\timplemented in
    Wired networks through Cloud software, path\n\tdiversity, spatial multiplexing\tand
    Diversity precoding.\n\nIntroduction\n\n\tThis draft:\n\t1.Identifies the Big
    data, Digital Data bottleneck in present\n\tNetwork.\n\t2.Identifies that Networks
    are evolving from Wireless Networks\n\tas well as Programming.\n\t3. Provides
    a resolution to the Data bottleneck problem by evolving\n\tthe present Wired Networks
    and Cloud architectures to incorporate\n\tfeatures from Wireless networks and
    Programming.\n\n\tThis draft begins at a very basic level where it identifies
    the\n\tproblem\tin the M2M communication. John Backus (Inventor of FORTRAN\n\tor
    Formula Translation) describes the Von Neumann bottleneck as\n\tan Intellectual\tbottleneck.\n\tThis
    Intellectual bottleneck also affects the TCP-IP model or the\n\tNetworking layers.
    There is a static nature to the TCP-IP model. If\n\tan AI approach is chosen to
    understand the TCP-IP layers the\n\tproblem in M2M communication can be further
    classified.\n\tThe problem is that there is a duality between the state machine\n\tand
    the program control. However, the state machine is like a point\n\tvalue or a
    basic computational element. This point value links the\n\tstate machine to Wireless
    Networks through Mass-Energy equivalence.\n\t Thus the state machine comes first
    and then the Program control.\n\tFrom the AI based TCP-IP model and analysis of
    digital data it can\n\tbe seen that this duality is centred between the Internet
    and the\n\tTransport layers.\n\tThe Digital Data or Big Data is the central point
    around which we\n\tare\tbuilding a network architecture, therefore a design model\n\tsomewhat
    different from SDN or TCP-IP can be arrived at.\n\tThis is described through the
    diagrams in this draft:\n\t1.\tImplicit Lifecycle with Big Data in Centralised
    Control plane\n\tand Distributed forwarding\n\t2.\tImplicit Lifecycle between
    Network, Cloud and the Internet\n\t(aka Network of Networks).\n\n\tImpact on EPN
    (Evolved Programmable Networks):\n\tHaving arrived at these models we can understand
    how the Network is\n\tnot just evolving from Programming but is evolving from
    the M2M\n\tbottleneck or M2M duality. This duality has Digital data or Big\n\tdata
    as the central point. This digital data can be considered as\n\t an infinitesimal
    mass value or a finite state element.\n\tConsidering the implicit lifecycle and
    the mass-energy equivalence\n\t we can arrive at the conclusion that Networks
    are also evolving\n\tfirstly from Wireless Networks and then from Programming.\n\tAs
    the Network is evolving from both Wireless Networking as well\n\tas Software Programming
    we can thus find out more about the\n\tinter-working of the Cloud (more of a software
    based and Wireless\n\t concept) and the Network (Hardware based and both a Wired,\n\tWireless
    concept). The digital or Big data is the central\n\tconnecting point so it cannot
    be declassified from both the Cloud\n\t and the Network. Based on this analysis
    it can be seen that the\n\tBig Data bottleneck occurs at the Inter-AS and CSC(Carrier\n\tsupporting
    Carrier) level. A Network grows as we add more physical\n\t hosts. A Network will
    keep growing and scaling.\n\tThus we can predict from Wireless Network architecture
    and\n\tProgramming how the present Network needs to evolve (grow and\n\tscale)
    to merge with the Cloud Architecture.\n\tThrough new features described in my
    draft such as Cloud\n\tOrchestrated Reflectors, Network Orchestrated Reflectors,\n\tContext
    Mapping, Path diversity (as evolved from Wireless concepts\n\tsuch as Tx Diversity,
    Rx diversity and MIMO) the Big data or\n\tDigital data bottleneck problem in present
    Networks can be\n\tresolved.\n\nDescription:\n\tThe goal is to build a Seamless
    cloud infrastructure which allows\n\tany CE to be seamlessly connected to the
    Internet (or SP). The\n\t Infrastructure would combine high speed core (data center)\n\t
    architecture with the Service provider and also to the end user.\n\t The Seamless
    cloud does not have the drawbacks of the hybrid cloud\n\t division that breaks
    down the Cloud into a public and a private\n\t cloud infrastructure. The Seamless
    Cloud infrastructure can\n\t provide an alternate way of building the CSC (Carrier
    Supporting\n\t Carrier) framework which is the present SP backbone design.\n\n\tA
    Distributed Intelligence system is more suited for the\n\thierarchical layered
    system that defines the Network. A centralized\n\tcontrol plane for the entire
    network may have vulnerabilities and\n\talso greatly increases the complexity.
    A distributed system is more\n\tpractical considering the Routing/Switching infrastructure
    and\n\tNetwork layers that we have. From an AI perspective this would be a\n\tbottoms-up
    approach rather than a top-down approach.\n\tPlease see below diagram of the TCP/IP
    model from this AI\n\tperspective.It is important to understand that the AI in
    a Network\n\tor a Cloud is centered around the Internet and Transport Layer\n\twhile
    still needing a Top-down approach from the Application layer\n\tand a bottoms-up
    approach from the Link layer. The Cisco proprietary\n\tparameter appropriately
    named as \"weight\" in the BGP protocol is\n\tsuggestive of the fact that the
    Intelligence in a Network needs to\n\tbe centered around the Network and Transport
    Layers. Also the term\n\t\"Weighted\" appears in QoS as \"Weighted Fair Queueing\".\n\n\tTCP/IP

    based FSM with IntelligentFlow in contrast to OpenFlow needs to\n\t be developed
    to build an AI based Network Infrastructure.\n\n\tThis FSM can form a sort of
    Shadow Router that tracks and defines\n\tthe\tNetwork from a bottoms-up approach.\n\tThe
    underlying hardware approach can assist in fast switching the\n\tdata as in Shortest
    path bridging.\n\tBasically TCP is stateful, IP is stateless and BGP is stateful.\n\tIntelligentFlow:
    Scaling the Data Flow\n\tIf an AI based FSM can somehow be sandboxed and moved
    between\n\tdevices (or hosts) then IntelligentFlow may be possible with the\n\tbottoms
    up and top down AI approach.\n\tFrom a programming point of view, a combination
    of high level and\n\tlow level programming is needed by which we can Sandbox the
    AI\n\tbased FSM between hosts. This calls for introducing an\n\tIntelligentStack
    as opposed to an Openstack within the data flow\n\tof the AI Based TCP/IP model.
    This IntelligentStack could work in\n\ttangent with the Elastic Compute Cloud
    of Openstack by providing\n\tmore traction over the Internet. The AI based FSM
    Sandbox can\n\toptimize the traffic flows by acting as Intermediary in the Data\n\tflow
    model. The Sandbox can scale up or reverse-scale the flows.\n\tThis could solve
    the BGP slow convergence and divergence problems.\n\tAI is like the logic behind
    a thought process.\n\tA Combinatorial logic is needed to combine the low level
    and high\n\tlevel languages. This combination can develop into a very basic\n\ttype
    of M2M Intelligence which is essential for IoT.\n\tFrom a high level programming
    perspective, the data type is a\n\tprogram construct and the control flow is a
    type of program\n\texecution (in a Machine).\n\tFrom a low level perspective,
    the AI based FSM can do the reverse\n\twhich is to program the data flow by sending
    the control plane\n\tinformation(to a Machine).\n\tIn other words, there is a
    duality in the M2M architecture through\n\tthe State Machine and the Program Control.
    This maybe the only way\n\tto tackle the Von Neumann Bottleneck:\n\tThe Von Neumann
    bottleneck was described by John Backus in his 1977\n\tACM  Turing Award lecture.
    According to Backus:\n\tSurely there must be a less primitive way of making big
    changes in\n\tthe store than by pushing vast numbers of words back and forth\n\tthrough
    the von Neumann bottleneck. Not only is this tube a literal\n\tbottleneck for
    the data traffic of a problem, but, more\n\timportantly, it is an intellectual
    bottleneck that has kept us tied\n\tto word-at-a-time thinking instead of encouraging
    us to think in\n\tterms of the larger conceptual units of the task at hand. Thus\n\tprogramming
    is basically planning and detailing the enormous\n\ttraffic of words through the
    Von Neumann bottleneck, and much of\n\tthat traffic concerns not significant data
    itself, but where to\n\tfind it.[22][23]\n\tThis is contrast to the duality in
    the Cloud that is implied in the\n\tIntercloud Architecture. Hence according to
    me the Seamless Cloud\n\tcan incorporate the M2M architecture via the Network
    that cannot be\n\tdeclassified from the Cloud.\n\tThe Combinatorial logic behind
    the above categorization of a\n\tMachine (M2M) is that the binary or digital data
    is not completely\n\tdefined and can be divided into low level machine learning
    based\n\tdata (letters or numbers presented to Machine for reading)\n\tand high
    level Top down AI based data (checks inputs of letters\n\tor numbers against a
    description). The binary data gets more well\n\tdefined (turing complete?) when
    put into a finite state machine.\n\tWhen binary data is put into a state machine
    it adds value and\n\tthus weight into the machine. This is where BGP, TCP, IP
    protocols\n\tcome into the picture through the weight parameter and the CBWFQ
    in\n\tQoS. This is where we need to find the data based on the Von\n\tNeumann
    bottleneck. If this M2M Intelligence can be developed\n\tRobots can identify Objects
    and take actions through Proximity\n\tSensors. Robots can focus on near Objects,
    identify them and take\n\tactions. A great boost for IoT. From a bio-technology
    perspective\n\tthe network is akin to a nervous system controlled by a centralized\n\tNeural
    network. However, both distributed and centralized\n\tintelligence may be required
    considering the hierarchical\n\tdistributed layers in the legacy network data
    flow model where both\n\ta bottoms-up and top-down AI model is required. Neural
    networks\n\thave a concept called Convergence and Divergence.\n\tIn Networking
    the focus is mostly on convergence through routing\n\tprotocols. However, a divergent
    approach is also needed in order\n\tto meet the AI/IoT based TCP/IP model requirement.\n\n\tAs
    described above I have defined an AI Based TCP-IP model.\n\tThrough that model
    I explained the significance of the \"weight\"\n\tparameter. This allows us to
    define an Intelligent Automation\n\tfor Autonomous system through Cloud and Network
    orchestration.\n\n\tThere can be alternate ways of approaching Inter-AS and CSC.\n\tThe
    weight parameter is localized in an AS. With this being\n\tintroduced in Segment
    routing it allows dynamic scaling of\n\tsuch parameters. Thus an AS can grow or
    shrink. Or a Private\n\tAS can be dynamically generated. A public AS can scale,
    grow or\n\tshrink.\n\tIn essence this means adding more value and functions into
    AS\n\tnumbers through algorithms which can dynamically alter the\n\tAutonomous
    systems without impacting the network in any way.\n\tAutonomous systems could
    be further classified into Temporary and\n\tPermanent Autonomous Systems. This
    could serve as the mapping\n\tbetween Cloud and network resources because the
    network cannot\n\tbe declassified from the cloud. This mapping can form an interface\n\tbetween
    Network computing and Cloud computing.\n\tThis is rather like finding a number
    within a number. This\n\talgorithm could involve randomly changing numbers. Making
    numbers\n\tbig or small. However, one-to-many is not the same as many-to-one.\n\tQuantum
    computing with Qubits and Shor Algorithm could implement\n\tsuch an algorithm.\n\tThe
    efficiency of Shor's algorithm is due to the efficiency of the\n\tquantum Fourier
    transform, and modular exponentiation by repeated\n\tsquarings.\n\tThese concepts
    of an Automated AS can be of significance in the IoT\n\tscenario where IoT devices
    can pe present anywhere and everywhere.\n\tIoT technologies like Smart Grid, Smart
    Transportation,Smart Cities\n\trequire a more robust and intelligent M2M communication.\n\tThis
    is rather oddly somewhat like APIPA in Windows but now at the\n\tAutonomous System
    level.\n\tThe M2M interface between Cloud and Network can be further defined\n\tbased
    on the concept of finding a number within a number. There is\n\tan element of
    time in-variance in the network while there is an\n\telement of time variance
    in the Cloud. This means that the network\n\tconvergence system needs to act as
    a Network Orchestrated Reflector\n\tbased on the ASN (Autonomous System number)
    while the Cloud needs\n\tto act as Cloud Orchestrated Reflector based on the Cloud
    platform\n\tASN (Autonomous System number). This defines the interface between\n\tthe
    two which in turn defines the mapping between Cloud and\n\tNetwork. Thus Fast
    Computing in the Cloud compensates for the slow\n\tcomputation in the Network.\n\tThe
    Network orchestrated reflector and Cloud orchestrated reflector\n\tdefined above
    are similar to the Route reflector but include ASN\n\tand other relevant features.\n\tThe
    loop or life cycle between the Network and Cloud reflectors can\n\tbe closed through
    the Segment routing and \"weight\" parameter There\n\tmay not really be a need
    for Quantum computing as of now to\n\timplement these concepts.\n\n\tThere is
    an Implicit Life cycle and need for Seamless Cloud\n\tInfrastructure as indicated
    by the diagrams below:\n\n\tDiagram 1: Implicit Life cycle (time bound) as the
    Network\n\tcannot be declassified from the Cloud (one way)\n\n\t|-----&gt; Internet

    Public Cloud &lt;-----------&gt; Private Cloud &lt;---------|\n\n\tBig Data analysis
    for TCP-IP:\n\t1. Big Data analysis in terms of Artificial Intelligence,\n\t Digital
    footprint, Programming and Quality. Not only in terms\n\t of Volume\n\t2. Big
    Data is the central intelligence that sits between the\n\tcontrol plane and the
    forwarding plane.\n\t3. Big Data can be considered as a centralized intelligence
    around\n\t which we are trying to put our concepts together. Big data is\n\t centered
    around IP, BGP and TCP.\n\t4. Big Data in terms of volume (content) drags us down
    to the link\n\tlayer. Concepts such as MPLS, switching take us away from Big Data.\n\t5.
    Big Data is both a centralized intelligence and a bottleneck.\n\tA Distributed
    intelligence approach is also thus mandated.\n\t6. Intelligent automation in the
    Cloud through Big Data (Hadoop,\n\t MapReduce) needs to interface with the Network
    at the Internet\n\t and Transport layers.\n\tWhat is the proof for Scale and manageability
    of these concepts ?\n\tBig Data is centered around TCP, IP and BGP layers. This
    is the\n\t forwarding path information in IGP via IBGP as well as EBGP.\n\tThe
    interconnect between EBGP and IBGP is through Autonomous s\n\tystems (ASN).\n\tThe
    slow convergence problem is in BGP and in IBGP.\n\tThis convergence issue is uncorrelated
    and exponential.\n\tHowever, this affects EBGP scenarios and overall Internet\n\tstability
    and scalability.\n\n\tThis scale problem can only be solved by options which\n\t
    take into consideration path diversity and matching for\n\t LPM (Longest Prefix
    Match) between Autonomous systems.\n\tThe number of unique Autonomous networks
    has grown to\n\t 47000 in mid-2014.\n\tInter-AS options and CSC are big data bottlenecks.\n\t
    The present Inter-AS options consider solutions such as\n\t inter-VRF, ASBR with
    MP-BGP,etc. As these consider the\n\t routes and prefixes, they do not really
    solve the scale\n\t problem. Thus we need to look for alternate ways to approach\n\t
    this problem.\n\tManipulating AS numbers, Cloud and network orchestrated Reflectors,\n\t
    HRR is required.\n\tSegment routing with parameters (eg: weight introduced into
    Segment\n\t routing) which can manipulate BGP AS path, communities are thus\n\t
    required.\n\tI use the word Cloud orchestrated Reflectors and Network\n\torchestrated
    Reflectors as the problem needs to be abstracted from\n\tthe Internet Architecture
    in order to avoid manageability issues in\n\tthe present and in the future.\n\tBased
    on the diagram involving the Cloud, Internet and Network\n\twhich is an implicit
    life cycle I believe that this is the only\n\toption to scale the Internet in
    the future. This is taking into\n\tconsideration the limitations right now in
    BGP convergence,\n\tInter-AS and Cloud computing.\n\tAs this is a limitation issue
    even if the manageability is not\n\tfeasible as of now it would still have to
    be considered in the\n\tfuture.\n\tThe implicit life cycle proves that the Internet
    needs to be\n\tchanged at the core as well and not just at the edges.\n\tCloud
    orchestrated reflectors are also important as the Internet\n\tcontinues to scale
    with the Cloud and SDN. Big data as defined\n\tin Hadoop through MapReduce suggests
    that the interface between\n\tCloud and Network is also important.\n\tNew BGP
    AF/SAF options do not really solve this scalability\n\tproblem:\n\tIP6\n\tIP-VPN\n\tBGP
    Flow Specification\n\tPseudo Wires\n\tL2VPN\n\t2547 Multicast VPNs\n\n\tThe scalability
    problem needs to be solved taking into\n\tconsideration the fact that the network
    cannot be declassified\n\tfrom the Cloud. Hence The IP Packet need to be classified
    through\n\ta new AF/SAF which could likely involve BGP, ASN, segment routing\n\tand
    path diversity, etc.\n\tAlternate ways to approach inter-AS is needed as the traditional\n\t
    methods are traffic (big data) bottlenecks.\n\tThis draft proposes the following:\n\tCloud
    and Network Orchestrated Reflectors to route the\n\tMulti-service, multi-tenant
    data between Cloud and Network.\n\tLimitations of the  Cloud and Network can only
    be resolved through:\n\t1. IP Packet\n\t2. Segment routing (weight parameter,
    load balancing, distributed\n\t computing, QoS, etc)\n\t3. New AS numbers (having
    Cloud and Network orchestrated reflectors\n\t in a reserved, private or a public
    AS)\n\t4. Cloud and Network orchestrated Reflectors\n\t5. New BGP AF/SAF having
    Segment routing\n\t6. New Inter-AS options considering Segment Routing, distributed\n\t
    intelligence, Path diversity, LPM (longest prefix match)\n\n\tBenefits:\n\t1.
    Inter-AS options are based on inter-VRF, MPLS VPN and ASBRs\n\twhich re-distribute
    routes. Re-distributing repeats the routes.\n\t Segment routing with RR is a better
    option. MPLS takes the Big\n\t data away from Internet layer and towards Link
    layer.\n\t2. Segment routing needs to focus on Big Data, routing for Path\n\t
    diversity, LPM (Longest prefix match), QoS and Multi-service\n\t Mutli-tenant
    offerings.\n\t3. The benefits with Segment routing are that it can avoid\n\t redistribution
    and rely on path diversity, distributed\n\t intelligence, distributed computing,
    etc through the\n\t interworking of Cloud and Network.\n\t4. Benefits for Multi-service
    Multi-tenancy is greater scale,\n\t redundancy, distributed computing, distributed
    intelligence,\n\t Improved exchange and transit points for Services. These\n\t
    benefits outweigh the present Inter-AS options which are\n\t a big data bottleneck.
    Context Maps in BGP, Segment Routing\n\t and SDN Controllers. The traditional
    route maps in BGP can\n\t match for routes, BGP PA, communities. However for distributed\n\t
    intelligence and SDN Controllers the Service providers need\n\t to be more context-aware.\n\t
    Segment routing can act as a Centralized Controller in the SDN\n\t framework.
    However BGP, Segment routing does not support or cannot\n\t differentiate between
    different contexts (virtual, cloud, network)\n\t or services such as Network services
    , Web services (WSDL), Cloud\n\t services(REST API). A context map can map and
    act as an interface\n\t between the Cloud services, Network services and Web services.\n\tThe
    concept of Path diversity is analogous to the concept of\n\tTransmit diversity
    and Receiver diversity in Wireless networks.\n\tThe concept of Cloud reflectors
    is thus analogous to the concept\n\tof reflection in Wireless networks. Therefore
    it should be\n\ttheoretically possible to implement features like MIMO\n\t(Multi-input
    Multi-output) and Tx, Rx diversity in Wired networks\n\tthrough COR and context
    mapping. MIMO concepts such as Spatial\n\tMultiplexing and Diversity Precoding
    can be implemented through\n\tCloud Orchestrated Reflectors. This would also indirectly
    resolve\n\tthe problem of sub-optimal routing that occurs through Route\n\treflectors.
    Context maps or Context Mapping Language (CML) are\n\tthe next evolutionary step
    in Cloud-fog-Computing:\n\tRoute map-&gt; Policy map -&gt; Context map\n\tRPL
    --&gt; CML\n\tThis mapping between Cloud and Network is rather like an M2M\n\tinterface
    therefore the Context Maps or CML needs to be in both\n\tBGP as well as in the
    SDN Controller or Cloud.\n\tODL learns the Customer network through the NOR and
    transfers the\n\ttopology to the COR transparently. COR is just a contextual\n\trepresentation
    of the NOR. There is a one-to-many mapping between\n\tNOR and COR. For one NOR
    or ODL we can have multiple COR.\n\tThis is the most efficient way of Cloud and
    Network inter-working.\n\tContext maps can give us E2E context awareness for Smart
    cities,\n\tSmart grid, etc.\n\n\tDiagram 4: Cloud and Network Orchestrated Reflectors

    a Security perspective the AI based bottoms-up/Top-down\n\t approach can help
    develop an Internet Map or a Cloud Map from\n\t this Seamless Cloud which can
    be further developed to form an\n\t Intelligent Secure network which is a Security-aware,
    Zone-aware\n\t Seamless Cloud. The Seamless cloud can dynamically identify and\n\t
    mitigate security vulnerabilities. Personalized Secure clouds can\n\t become a
    reality. Security boundaries and perimeters for the Cloud\n\t can be more clearly
    identified.\n\t A Distributed Intelligence system is more suited for the hierarchical\n\t
    layered system that defines a Network. A centralized control plane\n\t for the
    entire network may have vulnerabilities and also greatly\n\t increases the complexity.
    A distributed system is more practical\n\t considering the Routing/Switching infrastructure
    and Network layers\n\t that we have. From an AI perspective my draft would be
    a bottoms-up\n\t approach rather than a top-down approach.\n\t The Network needs
    to grow (and scale) towards the Cloud and not\n\t just the other way round.\n\n\n\n\t
