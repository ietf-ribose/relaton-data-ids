abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Pairing is a special map from two elliptic curve that called
    Pairing-\n   friend curves to a finite field and is useful mathematical tools
    for\n   constructing cryptographic primitives.  It allows us to construct\n   powerful
    primitives. (e.g. [3] and [4])\n\n   There are some types of pairing and its choice
    has an impact on the\n   performance of the primitive.  For example, Tate Pairing
    [3] and Ate\n   Pairing [4] are specified in IETF.  This memo focuses on Optimal
    Ate\n   Pairing [2] which is an improvement of Ate Pairing.\n\n   This memo defines
    Optimal Ate Pairing for any pairing-friendly curve.\n   We can obtain concrete
    algorithm by deciding parameters and building\n   blocks based on the form of
    a curve and the description in this memo.\n   It enables us to reduce the cost
    for specifying Optimal Ate Pairing\n   over additional curves.  Furthermore, this
    memo provides concrete\n   algorithm for Optimal Ate Pairing over BN-curves [7]
    and its test\n   vectors.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
