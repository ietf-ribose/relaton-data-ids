abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Teredo uses return routing to discover the closest Teredo relay\ncorresponding
    to any given peer.  Discovery is achieved by sending an\nICMPv6 Echo Request and
    waiting for the appropriate relay to forward\nthe ICMPv6 Echo Reply back.  Unanswered
    ICMPv6 Echo Requests make\nTeredo clients assume that the peer is unreachable.
    \ This document\nidentifies two scenarios where a stateful middlebox can detect
    the\nlack of ICMPv6 Echo Reply and craft one for the Teredo client in\norder to
    avoid possibly erroneous peer unreachability assumptions.\n\t </p>\n      "
