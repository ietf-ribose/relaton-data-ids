abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the\n   Endpoint
    Cost Service.  However the base protocol defines only a\n   single cost metric,
    i.e., the generic \"routingcost\" metric (Sec. 14.2\n   of ALTO base specification
    [ALTO]).  In practice, applications may\n   request network information on other
    cost (including performance)\n   metrics.\n\n   In this document, we define five
    new base metrics which are delay,\n   jitter, pktloss (packet loss), bandwidth
    and hopcount.  These base\n   metrics are further extended with these nine new
    metrics linkdelay,\n   linkjitter, linkloss, maxbw (Maximum Bandwidth), maxreservbw
    (Maximum\n   Reserved Bandwdith), unreservbw (Unreserved Bandwidth), residuebw\n
    \  (Residual Bandwidth), availbw (Available Bandwidth), and utilbw\n   (Utilized
    Bandwidth).  Also a new parameter anomalousstate is added.\n   These fourteen
    cost metrics are derived from OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE and\n   can be either used as
    constraint attribute associated with\n   'routingcost' cost metric attribute or
    used as returned Cost metrics\n   in the response, or both and hence provide a
    relatively comprehensive\n   set of cost metrics for ALTO.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
