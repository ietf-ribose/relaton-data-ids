abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo documents the concept of RF fingerprint which is
    the unique\n   identity characteristics of wireless device and can not be modified.\n
    \  Then, we give the method to get the RF fingerprint from the emitted\n   wireless
    signal. At last, we tell how to use the RF fingerprint to\n   carry out the authentication.
    Because of the non-replicable of RF\n   fingerprint, the security of the authentication
    can be improved.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
