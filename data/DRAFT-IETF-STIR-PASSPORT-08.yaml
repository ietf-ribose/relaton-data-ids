abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a method for creating and validating
    a token\n   that cryptographically verifies an originating identity, or more\n
    \  generally a URI or telephone number representing the originator of\n   personal
    communications.  The PASSporT token is cryptographically\n   signed to protect
    the integrity of the identity the originator and to\n   verify the assertion of
    the identity information at the destination.\n   The cryptographic signature is
    defined with the intention that it can\n   confidently verify the originating
    persona even when the signature is\n   sent to the destination party over an insecure
    channel.  PASSporT is\n   particularly useful for many personal communications
    applications\n   over IP networks and other multi-hop interconnection scenarios
    where\n   the originating and destination parties may not have a direct trusted\n
    \  relationship.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
