abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip\n
    \  times to the closest DNS root server such as during a network attack.\n   Some
    DNS recursive resolver operators want to prevent snooping by\n   third parties
    of requests sent to DNS root servers.  Such resolvers\n   can greatly decrease
    the round-trip time and prevent observation of\n   requests by serving a copy
    of the full root zone on the same server,\n   such as on a loopback address or
    in the resolver software.  This\n   document shows how to start and maintain such
    a copy of the root zone\n   that does not cause problems for other users of the
    DNS, at the cost\n   of adding some operational fragility for the operator.\n\n
    \  This document obsoletes RFC 7706.\n\n   [ This document is being collaborated
    on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/wkumari/draft-kh-dnsop-7706bis.  The most
    recent\n   version of the document, open issues, and so on should all be\n   available
    there.  The authors gratefully accept pull requests. ]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
