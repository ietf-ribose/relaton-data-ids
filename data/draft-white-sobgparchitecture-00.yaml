abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a great deal of concern over the security of the Border Gateway
    Protocol, which is used to provide routing information to the Internet and other
    large internetworks. This draft provides an architecture for a secure distributed
    registry of routing information to address these concerns. The draft begins with
    an overview of the operation of this system, and then follows with various deployment
    scenerios, starting with what we believe will be the most common deployment option.</p>"
