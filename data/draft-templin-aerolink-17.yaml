abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the operation of IPv6 over tunnel virtual Non-Broadcast,
    Multiple Access (NBMA) links using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO).
    Nodes attached to AERO links can exchange packets via trusted intermediate routers
    on the link that provide forwarding services to reach off-link destinations and/or
    redirection services to inform the node of an on-link neighbor that is closer
    to the final destination. Operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol
    over AERO links is based on an IPv6 link local address format known as the AERO
    address.</p>"
