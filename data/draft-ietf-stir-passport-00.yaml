abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a token format for verifying with non- repudiation
    the sender of and authorization to send information related to the originator
    of personal communications. A cryptographic signature is defined to protect the
    integrity of the information used to identify the originator of a personal communications
    session toward a terminating entity. The cryptographic signature is defined with
    the intention that it can confidently verify the originating persona even when
    the signature is sent to the terminating party over a potentially unsecure channel.
    The Persona Assertion Token (PASSporT) is particularly useful for many personal
    communications applications over IP networks and other multi-hop interconnection
    scenarios where the originating and terminating parties may not have a direct
    trusted relationship.</p>"
