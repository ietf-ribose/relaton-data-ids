abstract:
- content: "<p>Maintaining reachability of an EID prefix despite the failures of ETRs
    is a key concern in the LISP architecture. In this document, we first analyse
    this problem in comparison with traditional routing protocols. Then, we explain
    how Internet Service Providers could offer a service that preserves the reachability
    of the LISP ETRs of their customers in case of failures.</p>"
