abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Maintaining reachability of an EID prefix despite the failures ofETRs
    is a key concern in the LISP architecture. In this document, wefirst analyse this
    problem in comparison with traditional routingprotocols. Then, we explain how
    Internet Service Providers couldoffer a service that preserves the reachability
    of the LISP ETRs oftheir customers in case of failures.</p>"
