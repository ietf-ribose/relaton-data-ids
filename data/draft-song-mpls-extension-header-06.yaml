abstract:
- content: "<p>Motivated by the need to support multiple in-network services and functions
    in an MPLS network, this document describes a generic and extensible method to
    encapsulate extension headers into MPLS packets. The encapsulation method allows
    stacking multiple extension headers and quickly accessing any of them as well
    as the original upper layer protocol header and payload. We show how the extension
    header can be used to support several new network applications and optimize some
    existing network services.</p>"
