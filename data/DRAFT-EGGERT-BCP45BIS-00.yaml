abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing
    list\n   furthers the development and specification of Internet technology\n   through
    discussion of technical issues, and hosts discussions of IETF\n   direction, policy,
    meetings, and procedures.  As this is the most\n   general IETF mailing list,
    considerable latitude is allowed.\n   Advertising, whether to solicit business
    or promote employment\n   opportunities, falls well outside the range of acceptable
    topics, as\n   do discussions of a personal nature.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
