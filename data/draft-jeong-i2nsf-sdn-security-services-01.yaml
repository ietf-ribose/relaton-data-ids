abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides requirements for security services based on
    Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with two representative use cases: (i) centralized
    firewall system and (ii) centralized DDoS-attack mitigation system. For the centralized
    firewall system, this document raises challenging issues in existing firewalls
    and proposes a solution for such challenges with a use case of the centralized
    firewall system based on SDN. For the centralized DDoS-attack mitigation system,
    this document also raises challenging issues in existing DDoS-attack mitigation
    techniques and proposes a solution for such challenges with a use case of the
    centralized DDoS-attack mitigation system based on SDN.</p>"
