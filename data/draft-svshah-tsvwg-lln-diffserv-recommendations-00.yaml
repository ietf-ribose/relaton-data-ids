abstract:
- content: "<p>Differentiated services architecture is widely deployed in traditional
    networks. There exist well defined recommendations for the use of appropriate
    differentiated service classes for different types of traffic (eg. audio, video)
    in these networks. Per-Hop Behaviors are typically defined based on this recommendations.
    With emerging Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), it is important to have similar
    defined differentiated services recommendations for LLN traffic. Defined recommendations
    are for LLN class of traffic exiting out of LLNs towards high-speed backbones,
    converged campus network and for the traffic in the reverse direction.</p>"
