abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This file is a proposal for P2P based Domain Name query strategy
    in IpV6. The DNS servers construct n-tuple overlay virtual hierarchical overlay
    network. With cached addresses of DNS servers, the overload of traffic in tree
    structure can be avoided and more security can be enhanced due to the random lookup
    paths. This strategy may use for Domain Name query and reverse Domain Name query
    in IpV6 for a large number of domain names.</p>"
