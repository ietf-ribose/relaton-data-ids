abstract:
  content: "<p>SAM is a generic and simple mechanism for packets having addresses
    ina family IPvX to traverse routing domains where this address familyis not directly
    routed.SAM topological scenarios are those of Mesh Softwire, i.e. with pointto
    multipoint tunnels between border nodes of interior routingdomains. In the mesh-softwire
    context, SAM differs from RFC 5565 inthat SAM uses no protocol between border
    nodes of the domain, and inthat customer border nodes don't need to maintain states
    for allother border nodes. (RFC 5565 is based on an Exterior Border-GatewayProtocol
    e-BGP between border nodes, with dynamic routing tables tobe maintained in all
    of them). SAM's address mappings are stateless,based on only a few domain parameters.
    SAM is thus suitable to smallto medium enterprises, and small to medium ISPs,
    that cannot afforde-BGP in all their border nodes. All combinations of IPv4 and
    IPv6,global or private, are supported. Also, to mitigate consequences ofthe IPv4
    address shortage, SAM supports port-extended IPv4 addresses(A+P).</p>"
