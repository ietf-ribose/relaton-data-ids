abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some entities on the Internet make inferences about the\n   administrative
    relationships among Internet services based on the\n   domain names at which those
    services are offered.  At present, it is\n   not possible to ascertain organizational
    administrative boundaries in\n   the DNS; therefore such inferences can be erroneous.
    \ Mitigation\n   strategies deployed so far will not scale.  This memo provides
    a\n   means to make explicit assertions regarding certain kinds of\n   administrative
    relationships between domain names.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
