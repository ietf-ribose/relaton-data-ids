abstract:
  content: "<p>There is no defined mechanism today by which SIP proxies can insertpath
    related information in a SIP message that is being routedacross a network.As an
    example, a network administrator may want to trace the path asa SIP message traverses
    across her network to detect failurepoints.As another example, a user may want
    to discover capabilities ofservers in the path of a call. Although there is an
    informal mentionof using the OPTIONS method to achieve the latter example [1],
    thereis no defined way to achieve the same today.</p>"
