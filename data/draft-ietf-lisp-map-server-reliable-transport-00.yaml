abstract:
- content: "<p>The communication between LISP ETRs and Map-Servers is based on unreliable
    UDP message exchange coupled with periodic message transmission in order to maintain
    soft state. The drawback of periodic messaging is the constant load imposed on
    both the ETR and the Map-Server. New use cases for LISP have increased the amount
    of state that needs to be communicated with requirements that are not satisfied
    by the current mechanism. This document introduces the use of a reliable transport
    for ETR to Map-Server communication in order to eliminate the periodic messaging
    overhead, while providing reliability, flow-control and endpoint liveness detection.</p>"
