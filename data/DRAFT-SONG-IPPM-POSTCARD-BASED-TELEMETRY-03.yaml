abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Postcard-Based Telemetry (PBT) allows network OAM applications
    to\n   collect telemetry data about any user packet.  Unlike the E2E and\n   trace
    modes in in-situ OAM (IOAM), PBT does not require user packets\n   to carry any
    telemetry data, but directly exports the telemetry data\n   from network nodes
    to a collector through separated OAM packets\n   called postcards.  Two variations
    of PBT, PBT-I and PBT-M, are\n   described.  PBT-I requires inserting an instruction
    header to user\n   packets to guide the data collection.  PBT-I is designed as
    another\n   mode of IOAM, Per-Hop Postcard (PHP), to complement the existing\n
    \  operational modes of IOAM.  PBT-M only marks the user packets or\n   configure
    the flow filter to invoke the data collection.  PBT-M also\n   provides a complement
    to IOAM and address several implementation and\n   deployment challenges of it.\n\n\t
