abstract:
  content: "<p>The purpose of traditional mobility support is to provide continuousInternet
    connectivity to mobile hosts (host mobility support). Incontrast, network mobility
    support is concerned with situations wherean entire network changes its point
    of attachment to the Internet andthus its reachability in the topology. We shall
    refer to such anetwork as a mobile network (MONET). This document tries to identifywhat
    constraints limit the implementation and the deployment of apotentially and ideally
    good solution, and what requirementssolutions must comply to. Our main aim is
    to raise the discussion onthe mailing list.</p>"
