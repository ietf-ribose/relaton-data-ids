abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are no defined private-use namespaces in the Domain Name
    System\n   (DNS).  For a domain name to be considered private-use, it needs to\n
    \  be future-proof in that its top-level domain will never be delegated\n   from
    the root zone.  The lack of a private-use namespace has led to\n   locally configured
    namespaces with a top-level domain that is not\n   future proof.\n\n   The DNS
    needs an equivalent of the facilities provided by BCP 5 (RFC\n   1918) for private
    internets, i.e. a range of short, semantic-free\n   top-level domains that can
    be used in private internets without the\n   risk of being globally delegated
    from the root zone.\n\n   This document describes a particular set of code points
    which, by\n   virtue of the way they have been designated in the ISO 3166 standard,\n
    \  are thought to be plausible choices for the implementation of private\n   namespaces
    that are anchored in top-level domains.\n\n   The ISO 3166 standard is used for
    the definition of eligible\n   designations for country-code top-level Domains.
    \ This standard is\n   maintained by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency.  The ISO
    3166 standard\n   includes a set of user-assigned code elements that can be used
    by\n   those who need to add further names to their local applications.\n\n   Because
    of the rules set out by ISO in their standard, it is\n   extremely unlikely that
    these user-assigned code elements would ever\n   conflict with delegations in
    the root zone under current practices.\n\n   In order to avoid the operational
    and security consequences of\n   collisions between private and global use of
    these code elements as\n   top-level domains, this document specifies that such
    top-level\n   domains should never be deployed in the global namespace, and\n
    \  reserves them accordingly in the Special-Use Names Registry\n   [RFC6761].\n\n\t
