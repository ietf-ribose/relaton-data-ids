abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a Framework and protocol for application\n
    \  deployment where the application logic and processing are\n   distributed.
    \ The framework uses the Session Initiation Protocol\n   (SIP) to establish an
    application-level control mechanism between\n   application servers and associated
    external servers such as media\n   servers.\n\n   The motivation for the creation
    of this Framework is to provide an\n   interface suitable to meet the requirements
    of a distributed,\n   centralized conference system, as defined by the XCON work
    group of\n   the IETF.  It is not, however, limited to this scope and it is\n
    \  envisioned that this generic Framework will be used for a wide\n   variety
    of de-coupled control architectures between network entities.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
