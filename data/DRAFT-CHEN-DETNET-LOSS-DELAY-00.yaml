abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is defined to provide end-to-end\n
    \  bounded latency and extremely low packet loss rates for critical\n   flows.
    \ It's important to measure and monitor the packet loss rates\n   and end-to-end
    delay and delay variation of a DetNet flow path, which\n   allows evaluation of
    whether the Service Level Agreements (SLA) of\n   the provided DetNet services
    are satisfied.  These metrics are also\n   useful in network/traffic planning,
    trouble shooting, and network\n   performance evaluation.\n\n   This document
    defines protocol mechanisms to support passive\n   Performance Measurement (PM)
    for DetNet service.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
