abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Software applications typically generate a large amount of
    log data\n   in the course of their operation in order to help with monitoring,\n
    \  troubleshooting, etc.  However, like all data generated and operated\n   upon
    by software systems, logs can contain information sensitive to\n   users.  Personal
    data identification and anonymization in logs is\n   thus crucial to ensure that
    no personal data is being inadvertently\n   logged and retained which would make
    the logging application run\n   afoul of laws around storing private information.
    \ This document\n   focuses on exploring mechanisms to specify personal or sensitive
    data\n   in logs, to enable any server collecting, processing or analyzing\n   logs
    to identify personal data and thereafter, potentially enforce\n   any redaction.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
