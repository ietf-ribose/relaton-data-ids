abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the expected business telephony requirements
    \nfor delivering called party name towards SIP entities. A couple of \nmechanisms
    exist to deliver calling name and number to the called \nparty. None exist for
    exposing the called party name or preferred \nidentity to the calling party. This
    draft proposes a mechanism to \nprovide this capability. \n\t </p>\n      "
