abstract:
- content: "<p>In various network deployments, end to end paths are partitioned into
    multiple segments. In some cloud based WAN connections, multiple overlay tunnels
    in series are used to achieve better path selection and lower latency. In satellite
    communication, the end to end path is split into two terrestrial segments and
    a satellite segment. Packet losses can be caused both by random events or congestion
    in various deployments. Traditional end-to-end transport layers respond to packet
    loss slowly especially in long-haul networks: They either wait for some signal
    from the receiver to indicate a loss and then retransmit from the sender or rely
    on sender's timeout which is often quite long. Non- congestion caused packet loss
    may make the TCP sender over-reduce the sending rate unnecessarily. With end-to-end
    encryption moving under the transport (QUIC), traditional PEP (performance enhancing
    proxy) techniques such as TCP splitting are no longer applicable. LOOPS (Local
    Optimizations on Path Segments) aims to provide non end- to-end, locally based
    in-network recovery to achieve better data delivery by making packet loss recovery
    faster and by avoiding the senders over-reducing their sending rate. In an overlay
    network scenario, LOOPS can be performed over the existing, or purposely created,
    overlay tunnel based path segments.</p>"
