  content: "\n\t <p>This document explains the concept of object to object communications
    \n   and specifies naming and addressing issues for object identification. \n
    \  In order to use Host Identity Protocol (HIP) for object to object \n   communications,
    this document provides the extended architecture of \n   HIP according to mapping
    relationships between host and object(s). In \n   addition, packet formats and
    considerations for HIP extensions \n   concerning object are specified.\n\t </p>\n
