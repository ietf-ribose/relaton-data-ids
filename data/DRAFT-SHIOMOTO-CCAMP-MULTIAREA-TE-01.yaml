abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes a traffic engineering framework for multi-layer
    path\nnetworks using dynamic virtual topology configuration capability of\nGMPLS
    protocols.  The electrical label switched path is routed over the\nvirtual topology
    built on a set of optical label switched path in multi-\nlayer path networks.
    \ The virtual topology is dynamically altered by\nsetting up or tearing down optical
    label switched paths.  Virtual topol-\nogy is configured in response to traffic
    demand change so that conges-\ntion of the network is mitigated.  Utilization
    of label switched path is\nmeasured at ingress node and disseminated with routing
    protocol\nextensions for the individual node to decide whether the virtual topol-\nogy
    should be altered or not without centralized coordination.\n\t </p>\n      "
