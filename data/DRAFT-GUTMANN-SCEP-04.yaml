abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Simple Certificate Enrolment Protocol\n
    \  (SCEP), a PKI communication protocol that leverages existing\n   technology
    by using CMS (formerly known as PKCS #7) and PKCS #10 over\n   HTTP.  SCEP is
    the evolution of the enrolment protocol sponsored by\n   Cisco Systems, which
    enjoys wide support in both client and server\n   implementations, as well as
    being relied upon by numerous other\n   industry standards that work with certificates.\n\n\t
