abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a TCP-based convergence layer (TCPCL)
    for\n   Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN).  This version of the TCPCL protocol\n
    \  is based on implementation issues in the earlier TCPCL Version 3 of\n   RFC7242
    and updates to the Bundle Protocol (BP) contents, encodings,\n   and convergence
    layer requirements in BP Version 7.  Specifically,\n   the TCPCLv4 uses CBOR-encoded
    BPv7 bundles as its service data unit\n   being transported and provides a reliable
    transport of such bundles.\n\n   This document is an update of the protocol described
    in RFC7242,\n   reflecting lessons learned.  For this reason it obsoletes RFC7242,
    an\n   IRTF-stream document.\n\n   Note to the RFC editor: The Internet Research
    Task Force is requested\n   to mark RFC7242 as obsolete.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
