abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobile devices sometimes want to give temporary access to their\n
    \  presence and location information to third parties that may not have\n   a
    trust relationship with their presence server.  Also, in addition\n   to other
    mechanisms, application-layer location configuration\n   protocols are helpful
    in building location-based systems.  This\n   document describes a Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) event package,\n   locationref, that periodically delivers randomized
    presence URLs to\n   the target, which the target can then hand to call recipients
    and\n   other parties.\n\t </p>\n      "
