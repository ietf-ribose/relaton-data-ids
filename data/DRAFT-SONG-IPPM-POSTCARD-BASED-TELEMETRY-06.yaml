abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Postcard-Based Telemetry (PBT) allows network OAM applications
    to\n   directly collect and export telemetry data about any user packet at\n   each
    node on the forwarding path.  PBT has two variations, PBT-I and\n   PBT-M.  PBT-I
    requires inserting an instruction header to user\n   packets to guide the data
    collection.  An implementation of PBT-I is\n   the IOAM Direct Export option described
    in\n   [I-D.ioamteam-ippm-ioam-direct-export].  In contrast, PBT-M only\n   marks
    the user packets or configure the flow filter to invoke the\n   data collection
    and postcard export.  PBT complements IOAM trace\n   option by addressing several
    specific implementation and deployment\n   challenges.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
