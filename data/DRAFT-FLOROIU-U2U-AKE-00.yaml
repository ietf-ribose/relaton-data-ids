abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The present draft describes an user-to-user (u2u) authenticated
    key\n   exchange mechanism based on the UMTS AKA mechanism [1]. The proposed\n
    \  scheme is based on the generation of security tokens (in fact\n   encrypted
    public Diffie-Hellman keys) by the peer's operator. Such a\n   security token
    along with credential information contained within the\n   peer's AKA Authentication
    Vector (AV) enables two communicating peers\n   to securely derive a shared key.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
