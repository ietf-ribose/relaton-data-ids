abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A separate document [I-D:draft-mcfadden-opsec-endp-evolve]
    attempts\n   to establish the capabilities and limitations of endpoint-only\n
    \  security solutions and explore potential alternative approaches.\n   That document
    discusses endpoints in general terms. It has been\n   suggested that there are
    classes of endpoints that have different\n   characteristics. Those classes may
    have completely different threat\n   landscapes and the endpoints may have completely
    different security\n   capabilities. As a companion to the endpoint evolution
    draft, this\n   document provides a taxonomy of endpoints that is intended to\n
    \  provide a foundation for further work on endpoint security evolution\n   and
    research on approaches to providing endpoint security\n   alternatives in a diverse
    group of settings.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
