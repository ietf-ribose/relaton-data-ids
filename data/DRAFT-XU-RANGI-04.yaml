abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IRTF Routing Research Group (RRG) is exploring a new routing and
    \naddressing architecture to address the issues with the current \nInternet, e.g.,
    mobility, multi-homing, traffic engineering, and \nespecially the routing scalability
    issue. This document describes a \nnew identifier (ID)/locator split based routing
    and addressing \narchitecture, called Routing Architecture for the Next Generation
    \nInternet (RANGI), in an attempt to deal with the above problems.\n\t </p>\n
