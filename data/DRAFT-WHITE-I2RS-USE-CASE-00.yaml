abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Programmatic interfaces to provide control over individual
    forwarding\n   devices in a network promise to reduce operational costs while\n
    \  improving scaling, control, and visibility into the operation of\n   large
    scale networks.  To this end, several programmatic interfaces\n   have been proposed.
    \ OpenFlow, for instance, provides a mechanism to\n   replace the dynamic control
    plane processes on individual forwarding\n   devices throughout a network with
    off box processes that interact\n   with the forwarding tables on each device.
    \ Another example is\n   NETCONF, which provides a fast and flexible mechanism
    to interact\n   with device configuration and policy.\n\n   There is, however,
    no proposal which provides an interface to all\n   aspects of the routing systemas
    a system.  Such a system would not\n   interact with the forwarding system on
    individual devices, but rather\n   with the control plane processes already used
    to discover the best\n   path to any given destination through the network, as
    well as\n   interact with the routing information base (RIB), which feeds the\n
    \  forwarding table the information needed to actually switch traffic at\n   a
    local level.\n\n   This document describes a set of use cases such a system could\n
    \  fulfill.  It is designed to provide underlying support for the\n   framework,
    policy, and other drafts describing the Interface to the\n   Routing System (IRS).\n\n\t
