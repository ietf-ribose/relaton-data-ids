abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL facilitates loop free connectivity to non TRILL legacy networks
    via choice of an Appointed Forwarder for set of VLANs. Appointed Forwarder provides
    VLAN level load sharing with active- standby model. Mission critical operations
    such as High Performance Data Centers require active-active load sharing model.
    Active-Active load sharing model can be accomplished by representing any given
    non TRILL legacy network with a single virtual RBridge. Virtual representation
    of the non-TRILL legacy network with a single RBridge poses serious challenges
    in multi-destination RPF calculations. This document presents the required enhancements
    to build Coordinated Multicast Trees (CMT) within the TRILL campus. CMT provides
    flexibility to RBridges to select desired path of association to a given distribution
    tree.</p>"
