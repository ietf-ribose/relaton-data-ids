abstract:
  content: "\t <t>When using IPv6 within a single L2 network segment it is neccesary
    toensure that all routers advertising their services within it arevalid. In cases
    where it is not convinient or possible to use SeND[1] a rogue Router Advertisement
    (RA) [2] could be sent by accidentdue to misconfiguraton or ill intended. Simple
    solutions forprotecting against rogue RAs are beneficial in complementing SeND
    insecuring the L2 domain for ceratin types of devices or in certaintransitional
    situations.This document proposes a solution to reduce the threat of rogue RAsby
    enabling layer 2 devices to forward only RAs received overdesignated ports.</p>"
