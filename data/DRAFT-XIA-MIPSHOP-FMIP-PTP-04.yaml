abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers specification currently does not\nexplicitly
    define prefix management over point-to-point links when a\nmobile node uses a
    prefix to formulate a new care-of-address.  In\nthis document a mechanism is developed
    for a previous access router\nto request unique prefixes from a new access router,
    and in turn, the\nprevious access router advertises the prefixes to the mobile
    node for\na new care-of-address configuration.  Extensions to Mobile IPv6 Fast\nHandovers
    specification are also specified in this document.\n\t </p>\n      "
