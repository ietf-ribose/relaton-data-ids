abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Security Extensions require a greater interaction between zone
    administrations sharing a zone cut. The center of the interaction is the handling
    of the zone keys of the child and the signature applied by the parent. DNSSEC
    does not include a protocol for this, but the means of this interaction need definition
    to maintain the security of DNS.</p>"
