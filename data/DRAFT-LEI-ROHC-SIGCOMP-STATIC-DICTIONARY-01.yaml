abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The SigComp static dictionary for Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP)\nsignalling was done by first version RFC3485.  SIP protocol related\nextensions
    were completed and published in a series IETF documents.\nThose SIP protocol extensions
    had been used in 3GPP IMS and IMS based\napplications.  The new extensions to
    SIP protocol weaken the\nintention of static dictionary for SIP signalling compressing
    which\nis to reduce overload risks in radio access network and core network\ninvolving
    wireless network.\n\t </p>\n      "
