abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a bare bones \"index table\"-approach
    for\n   organizing a set of ICN data objects into a large, File-Like ICN\n   Collection
    (FLIC).\n\n   At the core of this collection is a so called manifest which acts
    as\n   the collection's root node.  The manifest contains an index table\n   with
    pointers, each pointer being a hash value pointing to either a\n   final data
    block or another index table node.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
