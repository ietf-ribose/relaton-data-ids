abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a real-time communication session, there may be a need or\n
    \  preference for receiving the same content in two or more simultaneous\n   modalities.
    \ There may also be a need to prioritize which media to\n   use for language communications.
    \ This document defines the semantics\n   for grouping media in the Session Description
    Protocol (SDP)\n   containing human languages in order to assign their relative
    priority\n   and also grouping media that are desired to be received together.\n
    \  The semantics defined in this document are to be used with the SDP\n   Grouping
    Framework.  Applications are for example a possibility to\n   indicate when a
    sign language is most desired, but written language\n   an acceptable lower rated
    alternative, offered for the other party to\n   select between.  Applications
    are also for indication of need for\n   both spoken and written content in a real-time
    call (captioning)\n   together, or provision of both spoken language original
    and sign\n   language interpretation of the original language together in a real-\n
    \  time session.  These indications are specified for the sending and\n   receiving
    direction separately.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
