abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many networks configure the link metric relative to the link\n
    \  capacity.  High bandwidth traffic gets routed as per the link\n   capacity.
    \ Flexible algorithms provides mechanisms to create\n   constraint based paths
    in IGP.  This draft documents a generic metric\n   type and set of bandwidth related
    constraints to be used in Flexible\n   Algorithms.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
