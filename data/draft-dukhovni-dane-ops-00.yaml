abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo discusses some operational aspects of publishing and using
    DANE TLSA records. Server operators need to consider whether the intended clients
    are able to authenticate the server's certificate chain via the published TLSA
    records, some variations of TLSA records may not work as expected in all cases.
    Clients need to decide which variations of TLSA records are sufficiently robust
    to be usable for server authentication.</p>"
