abstract:
- content: "<p>Data centers based applications provide a wide variety of services
    such as cloud computing, video gaming, grid application and others. Currently
    application decisions are made with little information concerning underlying network
    used to deliver those services so that such decisions cannot be the most optimal
    from both network and application resource utilization and quality of service
    objectives. This document presents a novel architecture of Cross Stratum Optimization
    for application and network resource in dynamic optical networks. Several global
    load balancing strategies are proposed and demonstrated by experiments in Optical
    as a Service experimental environment.</p>"
