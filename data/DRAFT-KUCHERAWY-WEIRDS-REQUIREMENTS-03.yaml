abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document enumerates a base set of requirements to be included
    in\n   any system that provides registration information for Internet\n   registration
    entities, i.e., network and/or domain name assignments.\n   Some of these, in
    turn, will define requirements for registrars;\n   this, however, is an issue
    outside of the scope of this document.\n\n   It is hoped that this work will also
    influence the development of\n   requirements and specifications for domain name
    registries at some\n   point in the future.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
