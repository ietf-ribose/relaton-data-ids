  content: "\n\t <p>In an instant messaging and presence application, it is frequently\nnecessary
    for the user to configure a number of pieces of\ninformation. Users will need
    to manipulate their buddy list, adding\nand removing presentities, and manipulate
    their authorization lists,\nwhich specify the set of users that can subscribe
    to their presence.\nIn this document, we provide a set of requirements for such
    data\nmanipulations, and provide a framework for viewing them in a common\nway.\n\t
