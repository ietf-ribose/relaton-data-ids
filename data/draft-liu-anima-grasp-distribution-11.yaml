abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the requirement to autonomic nodes supporting
    information distribution based over GRASP in autonomic networks. In general, information
    distribution can be categorized into two different modes: 1) one autonomic node
    instantly sends information to other nodes in the domain; 2) one autonomic node
    publishes some information and asynchronously some other interested nodes request
    the published information. In the former case, information data will be generated
    and consumed instantly. In the latter case, information data live longer in the
    network. These capabilities are basic and fundamental to an autonomous network
    system (i.e. ANI [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model]). This document clarifies possible
    use cases of information distribution in ANI and requirements to ANI so that rich
    information distribution can be natively supported. Extensions to autonomic nodes
    are proposed and detailed embodiments based on GRASP are discussed.</p>"
