abstract:
  content: "\t <t>SIP lacks a mechanism to determine which domain can claim ownershipof
    a certain telephone number. Due to this, it is impossible toestablish meaningful
    identity or to authenticate endpoints that usetelephone number URIs and domain
    names in their From address. Thisdocument proposes a solution to this problem
    using a returnroutability test.</p>"
