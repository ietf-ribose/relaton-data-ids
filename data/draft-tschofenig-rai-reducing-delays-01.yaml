abstract:
  content: "\t <t>During the last year, participants in the Real-time Applications
    andInfrastructure (RAI) area have been quite active in discussingproposals that
    could improve their way of working. This document isa contribution to that discussion
    and focuses on the reduction ofdelays experienced in producing specifications.
    We believe that thisis one of the main problems in the RAI area (and quite likely
    inother areas of the IETF as well) and it requires attention. A numberof side
    effects, caused by the long specification work, areillustrated in this document.</p>"
