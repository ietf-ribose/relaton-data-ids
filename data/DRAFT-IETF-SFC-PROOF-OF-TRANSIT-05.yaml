abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Several technologies such as Traffic Engineering (TE), Service\n
    \  Function Chaining (SFC), and policy based routing are used to steer\n   traffic
    through a specific, user-defined path.  This document defines\n   mechanisms to
    securely prove that traffic transited said defined\n   path.  These mechanisms
    allow to securely verify whether, within a\n   given path, all packets traversed
    all the nodes that they are\n   supposed to visit.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
