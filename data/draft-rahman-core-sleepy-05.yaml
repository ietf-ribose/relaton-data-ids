abstract:
- content: <p>CoAP is a specialized web transfer protocol for constrained devices.
    These devices typically have some combination of limited battery power, small
    memory footprint and low throughput links. It is expected that in CoAP networks
    there will be a certain portion of devices that are "sleepy" and which may occasionally
    go into a sleep mode (i.e. go into a low power state to conserve power) and temporarily
    suspend CoAP protocol communication. This document proposes a minimal and efficient
    mechanism building on the Resource Directory (RD) functionality to enhance sleepy
    node support in CoAP networks. The RD functionality may be incorporated as part
    of a CoAP Proxy.</p>
