abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces the capabilities of the DHCPv4 Relay
    Agent \n   Information Option in RFC 3046 and the corresponding RADIUS-\n   Attributes
    Sub-option to DHCPv6. In particular, the document \n   describes a new DHCPv6
    option called the Relay agent RADIUS \n   Attributes Option (RRAO) which extends
    the set of DHCPv6 options as \n   defined in RFC 3315 and 3376. Following its
    DHCPv4 counterpart, the \n   new option is inserted by the DHCPv6 relay agent
    when forwarding \n   client-originated DHCPv6 packets to a DHCPv6 server. Servers
    \n   recognizing the RRAO may use the information to implement IP address \n   or
    other parameter assignment policies.  The DHCP Server echoes the \n   option back
    verbatim to the relay agent in server-to-client replies, \n   and the relay agent
    strips the option before forwarding the reply to \n   the client.  \n\t </p>\n
