abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing enables an operator or an application to specify
    a\n   packet processing program. When Segment Routing is applied to IPv6\n   data
    plane, the list of IPv6 SIDs in SRH makes overhead a big\n   challenge.\n\n   This
    document proposes Short SID (SSID) and Short SRH (SSRH), and the\n   operations
    with SSRH. The proposed solution tries to reduce the\n   overhead of SRv6 without
    defining new routing header.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
