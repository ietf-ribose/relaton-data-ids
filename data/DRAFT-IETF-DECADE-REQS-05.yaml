abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The target of DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) is
    to\n   provide an open and standard in-network storage system for\n   applications,
    primarily P2P (peer-to-peer) applications, to store,\n   retrieve and manage their
    data.  This draft enumerates and explains\n   requirements, not only for storage
    and retrieval, but also for data\n   management, access control and resource control,
    that should be\n   considered during the design and implementation of a DECADE
    system.\n   These are requirements on the entire system; some of the requirements\n
    \  may eventually be implemented by an existing protocol with/without\n   some
    extensions (e.g., a protocol used to read and write data from\n   the storage
    system).  The requirements in this document are intended\n   to ensure that the
    DECADE architecture includes all of the desired\n   functionality for intended
    applications.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
