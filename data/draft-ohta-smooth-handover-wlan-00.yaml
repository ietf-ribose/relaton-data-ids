abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo describes, based on the experience of MIS (Mobile InternetServices,
    Inc.) for commercial mobile IP service over IEEE 802.11bbased wireless LAN environment,
    how smooth handover between accesspoints is implemented.The major obstacle for
    the smooth handover is time required to scanfrequency bands and latency of mobile
    registration is not so much aproblem, both of which is solved with terminals having
    twotransceivers.</p>"
