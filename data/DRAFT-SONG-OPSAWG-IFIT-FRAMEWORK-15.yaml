abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As network scale increases and network operation becomes more\n
    \  sophisticated, traditional Operation, Administration and Maintenance\n   (OAM)
    methods, which include proactive and reactive techniques,\n   running in active
    and passive modes, are no longer sufficient to meet\n   the monitoring and measurement
    requirements.  On-path telemetry\n   techniques which provide high-precision flow
    insight and real-time\n   issue notification are emerging to support suitable
    quality of\n   experience for users and applications, and fault or network\n   deficiency
    identification before they become critical.\n\n   Centering on the new data-plane
    on-path telemetry techniques, this\n   document outlines a high-level framework
    to provide an operational\n   environment that utilizes these techniques to enable
    the collection\n   and correlation of performance measurement information from
    the\n   network.  The framework identifies the components that are needed to\n
    \  coordinate the existing protocol tools and telemetry mechanisms, and\n   addresses
    key deployment challenges for flow-oriented on-path\n   telemetry techniques,
    especially in carrier networks.\n\n   The framework is informational and intended
    to guide system designers\n   attempting to apply the referenced techniques as
    well as to motivate\n   further work to enhance the ecosystem .\n\n\t </p>\n      "
