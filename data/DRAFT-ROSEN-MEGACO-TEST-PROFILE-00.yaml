abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a profile for use in interoperability
    \ntesting of the Megaco/H.248 protocol and a set of scenarios to try \nincreasingly
    difficult mechanisms in the protocol.  To support early \nphase testing, it is
    useful to define a simple, easy to implement \nset of characteristics that allow
    initial implementations to get \nvery basic functions working. By implementing
    this profile, testing \na variety of MGs against a variety of MGCs is possible.
    \ The test \nscenarios describe high-level behavior expected by the MGs and MGCs,
    \nbut not explicit message sequences. \n\n   Also included is a set of test messages
    that may be used to verify \n   early stage MG/MGC functionality.  They could
    be used to test \n   parsers, and they can be used to assure that implementations
    have \n   base functionality prior to testing with devices that may not \n   produce
    the same messages.\n\t </p>\n      "
