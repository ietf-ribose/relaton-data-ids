abstract:
  content: "<p>This document gives an overview of LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding.
    When employing adaptation layer fragmentation in 6LoWPAN, it may be beneficial
    for a forwarder not to have to reassemble each packet in its entirety before forwarding
    it. This has always been possible with the original fragmentation design of RFC4944.
    This document is a companion document to [I-D.ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly],
    which details the virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) implementation technique which
    reduces the latency and increases end-to-end reliability in route-over forwarding.</p>"
