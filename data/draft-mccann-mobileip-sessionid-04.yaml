abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Network Access Identifier can be added to a Mobile IPregistration
    request to identify the user and to allow theassignment of a dynamic home address.
    However, users may want toopen several simultaneous sessions using the same NAI
    from the sameor different devices and to obtain a unique IP address for eachsession.
    The Mobile IP Session Identifier Extension defined in thisdraft can be used to
    distinguish registration requests belonging tothese various sessions. This draft
    also clarifies how a dynamicaddress is to be managed when and if the user returns
    to the homenetwork that assigned the address.</p>"
