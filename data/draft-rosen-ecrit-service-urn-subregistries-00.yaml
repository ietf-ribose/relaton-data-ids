abstract:
- content: <p>In most countries, there are multiple kinds of police forces. RFC5031
    defines a "Service URN" which is used to route emergency calls. The urn has a
    sub registry for different kinds of emergency services that may be reached from
    different telephone numbers or service numbers (as opposed to a single number
    like 112). In many countries, the "police" service is not a single service, but
    more than one service where the service area and/or types of emergencies they
    respond to are different. In some countries there are multiple ambulance services.
    This document defines sub registries for urn:service:sos.police, urn:service:sos.ambulance
    and, for completeness, urn:service:sos.fire. It also provides an initial set of
    entries for these sub registries. These services are in addition to the base urn:service:sos.police,
    etc. services.</p>
