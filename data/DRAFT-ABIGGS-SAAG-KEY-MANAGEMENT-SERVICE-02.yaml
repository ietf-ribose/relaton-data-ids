abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the interest of addressing pervasive threats to the\n   confidentiality
    and integrity of online communications identified by\n   the Internet community
    [I-D.barnes-pervasive-problem] this\n   specification introduces an open architecture
    for the establishment,\n   management, and secure distribution of cryptographic
    keys for use in\n   the end-to-end (E2E) encryption of online communications and
    shared\n   content.  This architecture allows for the independent deployment of\n
    \  dedicated key management services in a manner that supports the\n   adoption
    of third-party communications and data sharing services by\n   individuals and
    organizations that require full and exclusive\n   discretion over the confidentiality
    of their data.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
