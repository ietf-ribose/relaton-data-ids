abstract:
  content: "<p>For the resource constrained devices and networks of 6LowApp it isessential
    that the payload of messages are compact. The use of XMLto represent data in web
    applications has become almost universal.The interoperability of 6LowApp with
    these applications will requirethat XML can also be carried over the embedded
    web. This documentintroduces and compares techniques for encoding or compressing
    XMLfor use with 6LowApp including EXI, BXML and Fast Infoset. Theperformance and
    requirements for using these encodings are analyzedin the scope of 6LowApp. It
    is shown that these standard encodingscan represent XML in a compact form, with
    reasonable overhead, andrequire only Internet media type and content transfer
    encodingindication from the application protocol.</p>"
