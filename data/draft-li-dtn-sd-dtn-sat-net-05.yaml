abstract:
- content: "<p>Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) is designed for a severe
    environment where communication quality is not guaranteed. It works as an overlay
    network associated with Bundle Protocol (BP) and some convergence layer protocols
    like Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP). DTN is suitable for satellite networks.
    Because communication delay is long and peer-to-peer communication is not guaranteed
    in satellite networks. We implement SDN to solve the problems of controllable,
    manageable, and flexible in satellite networks. In this document, we propose a
    framework of Software Defined DTN-based satellite networks, using Bundle tunnel
    and protocol translation gateway.</p>"
