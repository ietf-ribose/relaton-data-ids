abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an experimental algorithm, Proportional
    Rate\n   Reduction (PPR) to improve the accuracy of the amount of data sent by\n
    \  TCP during loss recovery.  Standard Congestion Control requires that\n   TCP
    and other protocols reduce their congestion window in response to\n   losses.
    \ This window reduction naturally occurs in the same round\n   trip as the data
    retransmissions to repair the losses, and is\n   implemented by choosing not to
    transmit any data in response to some\n   ACKs arriving from the receiver.  Two
    widely deployed algorithms are\n   used to implement this window reduction: Fast
    Recovery and Rate\n   Halving.  Both algorithms are needlessly fragile under a
    number of\n   conditions, particularly when there is a burst of losses that such\n
    \  that the number of ACKs returning to the sender is small.\n   Proportional
    Rate Reduction minimizes these excess window reductions\n   such that at the end
    of recovery the actual window size will be as\n   close as possible to ssthresh,
    the window size determined by the\n   congestion control algorithm.  It is patterned
    after Rate Halving,\n   but using the fraction that is appropriate for target
    window chosen\n   by the congestion control algorithm.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
