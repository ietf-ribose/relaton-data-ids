abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 4858 talks about \"Document Shepherding from Working Group
    Last\n   Call to Publication\".  There's a significant part of a document's\n
    \  life that happens before working group last call, starting at the\n   time
    that a working group begins discussing a version of the idea\n   that's been posted
    as an individual draft.  This document extends RFC\n   4858, discussing the potential
    for extending shepherding and what\n   tasks might be involved throughout a working
    group document's\n   lifecycle, from start to finish.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
