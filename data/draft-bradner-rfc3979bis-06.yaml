abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), such as
    patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are designed to
    ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as much information about
    any IPR constraints on a technical proposal as possible. The policies are intended
    to benefit the Internet community and the public at large, while respecting the
    legitimate rights of IPR holders. This memo details the IETF policies concerning
    IPR related to technology worked on within the IETF. It also describes the objectives
    that the policies are designed to meet. This memo updates RFC 2026 and obsoletes
    RFC 3979 and RFC 4879.</p>"
