abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Topology Broadcast based on Reverse-Path Forwarding (TBRPF) is
    a\nlink-state routing protocol designed for use in a mobile ad-hoc\nnetwork (MANET)
    or an internet.  TBRPF provides each node with the\nstate of each link in the
    network, but does so much more efficiently\nthan flooding (e.g., OSPF).  TBRPF
    uses the concept of reverse-path\nforwarding to efficiently and reliably broadcast
    each link-state\nupdate along the minimum-hop-path tree rooted at the source of
    the\nupdate.  The broadcast trees (one tree per source) are updated\ndynamically
    using the topology information that is received along the\ntrees themselves, thus
    requiring very little additional overhead for\nmaintaining the trees. This document
    describes TBRPF and discusses\ndetails for the implementation of TBRPF in IPv4-based
    MANETs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
