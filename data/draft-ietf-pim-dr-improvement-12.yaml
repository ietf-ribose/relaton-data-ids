abstract:
- content: "<p>Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is a widely deployed
    multicast protocol. As deployment for the PIM protocol is growing day by day,
    a user expects lower packet loss and faster convergence regardless of the cause
    of the network failure. This document defines an extension to the existing protocol,
    which improves the PIM's stability with respect to packet loss and convergence
    time when the PIM Designated Router (DR) role changes.</p>"
