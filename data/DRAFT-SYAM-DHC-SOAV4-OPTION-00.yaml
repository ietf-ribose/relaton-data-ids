abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a new option in DHCPv4 for Service-Oriented\n
    \  Address assignment for a particular type of service that DHCPv4\n   Clients
    provide.  The Service-Oriented Address can be either\n   Anycast/Shared Unicast
    or a Well-known Unicast Addresses.  This\n   address assignment is much similar
    to other address type assignments,\n   except that Service-Oriented Address assignment
    requires the\n   specification of Service Type of the node that is requesting
    the\n   address.\n\t </p>\n      "
