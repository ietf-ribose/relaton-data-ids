abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes certain functionality that is missing
    in the\ncurrent 'Integration of Resource Management and SIP' [1] (a.k.a.\nmanyfolks
    draft). An extension to add this functionality is\noutlined.\nThis functionality
    is needed in general to provide richer signalling\ncapabilities and can be employed
    in several scenarios. This draft\ndescribes its use in third party call control
    applications.\n   If this extension is accepted it is foreseen that this draft
    would\n   be merged with [1].\n\t </p>\n      "
