abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo presents a technique for using as subset HTML as
    a source\n   format for documents in the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and Request for\n
    \  Comments (RFC) series. The HTML subset provides equivalent\n   functionality
    to the traditional XML2RFC tool but is designed for\n   ease of use with readily
    available editing tools.\n\n   Extensions to the HTML markup allow the use of
    external bibliography\n   files to manage citations and references in the manner
    of BibTeX.\n   Planned extensions include building concordances of defined terms
    and\n   normative language.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
