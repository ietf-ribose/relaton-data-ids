abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A number of TCP enhancements in so diverse fields as congestion\n
    \  control, loss recovery or side-band signaling could be improved by\n   allowing
    both ends of a TCP session to interpret the values carried\n   in the Timestamp
    option.  Further enhancements are enabled by\n   changing the receiver side processing
    of timestamps in the presence\n   of Selective Acknowledgements.\n\n   This documents
    updates RFC1323 and specifies a backwards compatible\n   way of negotiating for
    Timestamp capabilities, and lists a number of\n   benefits and drawbacks of this
    approach.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
