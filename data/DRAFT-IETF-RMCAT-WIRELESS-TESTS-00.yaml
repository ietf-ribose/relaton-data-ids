abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is evident that to ensure seamless and robust user experience\n
    \  across all type of access networks multimedia communication suits\n   should
    adapt to the changing network conditions.  There is an ongoing\n   effort in IETF
    RMCAT working group to standardize rate adaptive\n   algorithm(s) to be used in
    the real-time interactive communication.\n   In this document test cases are described
    to evaluate the\n   performances of the proposed endpoint adaptation solutions
    in LTE\n   networks and Wi-Fi networks.  It is aimed that the proposed solutions\n
    \  should be evaluated using the test cases defined in this document to\n   select
    most optimal solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
