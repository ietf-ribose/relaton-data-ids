abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS is defined in literally dozens of different RFCs.  The\n
    \  terminology used by implementers and developers of DNS protocols, and\n   by
    operators of DNS systems, has sometimes changed in the decades\n   since the DNS
    was first defined.  This document gives current\n   definitions for many of the
    terms used in the DNS in a single\n   document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
