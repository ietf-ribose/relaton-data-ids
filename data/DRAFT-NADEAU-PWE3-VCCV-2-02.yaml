abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a unified mode for Virtual Circuit\n
    \  Connectivity Verification (VCCV), which provides a control channel\n   that
    is associated with a pseudowire (PW). VCCV applies to all\n   supported access
    circuit and transport types currently defined for\n   PWs, as well as those being
    transported by The MPLS Transport\n   Profile. This new mode is intended to augment
    those described in\n   RFC5085, but this document describes new rules requiring
    this mode\n   to be used as the default/mandatory mode of operation for\n   VCCV.
    The older types will remain optional.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
