abstract:
- content: "<p>The DHCPv6 protocol, defined in [RFC3315] allows for multiple servers
    to operate on a single network, however it does not define any way the servers
    could share information about currently active clients and their leases. Some
    sites are interested in running multiple servers in such a way as to provide increased
    availability in case of server failure. In order for this to work reliably, the
    cooperating primary and secondary servers must maintain a consistent database
    of the lease information. [RFC3315] allows for but does not define any redundancy
    or failover mechanisms. This document outlines requirements for DHCPv6 failover,
    enumerates related problems, and discusses the proposed scope of work to be conducted.
    This document does not define a DHCPv6 failover protocol.</p>"
