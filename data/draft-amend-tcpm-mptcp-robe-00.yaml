abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP extends the plain, single-path limited, TCP towards the
    capability of multipath transmission. This greatly improves the reliability and
    performance of TCP communication. For backwards compatibility reasons the Multipath
    TCP was designed to setup successfully an initial path first, after which subsequent
    paths can be added for multipath transmission. For that reason the Multipath TCP
    has the same limitations as the plain TCP during connection setup, in case the
    selected path is not functional. This document proposes a set of implementations
    and possible combinations thereof, that provide a more Robust Establishment (RobE)
    of MPTCP sessions. It includes RobE_TIMER, RobE_SIM, RobE_eSIM and RobE_IPS. RobE_TIMER
    is designed to stay close to MPTCP in that standard functionality is used wherever
    possible. Resiliency against network outages is achieved by modifying the SYN
    retransmission timer: If one path is defective, another path is used. RobE_SIM
    and RobE_eSIM provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths for connection
    setup. They ensure connectivity if at least one functional path out of a bunch
    of paths is given and offers beside that the opportunity to significantly improve
    loading times of Internet services. RobE_IPS provides a heuristic to select properly
    an initial path for connection establishment with a remote host based on empirical
    data derived from previous connection information. In practice, these independent
    solutions can be complementary used. This document also presents the design and
    protocol procedure for those combinations in addition to the respective stand-alone
    solutions.</p>"
