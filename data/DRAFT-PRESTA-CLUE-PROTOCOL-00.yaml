abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is a work-in-progress draft aimed at shedding light on
    the\n   application-level protocol associated with the creation and\n   management
    of a CLUE-enabled telepresence session between a Media\n   Consumer and a Media
    Provider.  The draft sketches the high-level\n   interactions occurring between
    the above mentioned entities, as well\n   as depicts the state transitions occurring
    at both ends during a\n   telepresence session.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
