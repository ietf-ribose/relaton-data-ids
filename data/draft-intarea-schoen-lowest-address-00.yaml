abstract:
- content: "<p>With ever-increasing pressure to conserve IP address space on the Internet,
    it makes sense to consider where relatively minor changes can be made to fielded
    practice to improve numbering efficiency. One such change, proposed by this document,
    is to increase the number of unicast addresses in each existing subnet, by redefining
    the use of the lowest-numbered (zeroth) host address in each IPv4 subnet as an
    ordinary unicast host identifier, instead of as a duplicate segment- directed
    broadcast address.</p>"
