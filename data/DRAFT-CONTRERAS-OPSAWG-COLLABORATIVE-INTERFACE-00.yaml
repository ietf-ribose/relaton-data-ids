abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The absence of appropriate mechanisms for information exchange\n
    \  between Network Operators and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and\n   content
    providers leads to avoidable inefficiency for the delivery of\n   contents to
    end users in situations like congestion, selection of\n   best distributed delivery
    end point, etc.\n\n   This document describes the need of an information exchange
    interface\n   between Network Operators and CDNs to collaborate in order to provide\n
    \  the best service quality to the end users.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
