abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many of todayâ€™s networks use PPP as a means of providing access
    \nlinks to remote users. In case a PPP user is mobile and performs a \nsubnet
    handover, it needs to tear down and re-establish of its PPP \nlink with the network.
    PPP link re-establishment is an elaborate \nprocedure (as explained in a later
    section of this document) \ninvolving multiple messages. This will lead in an
    extended service \ndisruption as due to the round trip time involved in the messaging
    \nas well extensive radio bandwidth usage. Of this reason, we \nconsider PPP to
    be a prime candidate for context transfer [1-3]. \nThe proposal in this document
    can reduce the number of PPP \nestablishment messages by 50%-100. Furthermore,
    it will save \nsignificant amount of time in PPP state machine transitions, due
    \nto the multiphase nature of PPP. Reliability and timing issues of \nPPP context
    transfer are also discussed. \n\t </p>\n      "
