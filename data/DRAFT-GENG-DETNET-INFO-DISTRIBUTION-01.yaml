abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are requirements in diverse industries to establish multi-hop\n
    \  paths for characterized flows with bounded end-to-end latency and\n   extremely
    low packet loss rate.  Deterministic Networking (DetNet)\n   can provide service
    satisfying the requirements.\n\n   This document describes extensions to IGP-TE,
    including OSPF-TE and\n   ISIS-TE to distribute information of DetNet, which can
    be used for\n   DetNet path computation/selection.\n\n   This document only covers
    the mechanisms by which DetNet information\n   is distributed.  The mechanisms
    for measuring, calculating or\n   configuring DetNet capabilities, resources and
    other relevant\n   parameters are out of the scope.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
