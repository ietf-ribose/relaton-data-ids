abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo]proposes a solution that allows IGPs\n
    \  themselves to compute constraint based paths over the network, and it\n   also
    specifies a way of using Segment Routing (SR) Prefix-SIDs and\n   SRv6 locators
    to steer packets along the constraint-based paths.\n\n   [RFC8570] describes IS-IS
    extensions to distribute network-\n   performance information (such as residual
    bandwidth, and available\n   bandwidth).\n\n   This draft describes the IGP extensions
    to advertise the\n   corresponding network-performance information of the Flex-Algorithm.\n\n\t
