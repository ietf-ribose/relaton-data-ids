abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When an IP multicast tree needs to pass through an MPLS domain,
    it is\nadvantageous to map the tree to a Point-to-Multipoint or Multipoint-\nto-Multipoint
    Label Switched Path.  This document specifies a way to\nprovide a one-one mapping
    between IP multicast trees and Label\nSwitched Paths using mLDP signaling.  The
    IP multicast control\nmessages are translated into MPLS control messages when
    they enter\nthe MPLS domain, and are translated back into IP multicast control\nmessages
    at the far end of the MPLS domain.  The IP multicast control\ninformation is coded
    into the MPLS control information in such a way\nas to ensure that a single Multipoint
    Label Switched Path gets set up\nfor each IP multicast tree.\n\t </p>\n      "
