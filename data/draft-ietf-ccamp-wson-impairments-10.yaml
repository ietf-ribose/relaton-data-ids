abstract:
- content: '<p>As an optical signal progresses along its path, it may be altered by
    the various physical processes in the optical fibers and devices it encounters.
    When such alterations result in signal degradation, these processes are usually
    referred to as "impairments". These physical characteristics may be important
    constraints to consider when using a GMPLS control plane to support path setup
    and maintenance in wavelength switched optical networks. This document provides
    a framework for applying GMPLS protocols and the Path Computation Element (PCE)
    architecture to support Impairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA)
    in wavelength switched optical networks. Specifically, this document discusses
    key computing constraints, scenarios, and architectural processes: routing, wavelength
    assignment, and impairment validation. This document does not define optical data
    plane aspects; impairment parameters; or measurement of, or assessment and qualification
    of, a route; rather, it describes the architectural and information components
    for protocol solutions. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>'
