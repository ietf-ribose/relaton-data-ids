abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a mechanism to encapsulate layer 4 transport
    protocols over UDP. Such encapsulation facilitates deployment of alternate transport
    protocols or transport protocol features on the Internet. DTLS can be employed
    to encrypt the encapsulated transport header in a packet thus minimizing the exposure
    of transport layer information to the network and so promoting the end-to-end
    networking principle. Transport connection identification can be disassociated
    from network location (IP addresses) to provide connection persistence for mobility
    and across state eviction in NAT.</p>"
