abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Like other internet activities, multicast is affected by the
    fact\n   that the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is occurring over a period of\n
    \  years, via multiple transition paths.  As a result, mechanisms need\n   to
    be added to the basic multicast architecture to assist in specific\n   transition
    scenarios.  This document describes detailed use cases so\n   that the requirements
    for the multicast transition mechanisms can be\n   better understood.\n\n   The
    considered opinion in discussions to date on multicast transition\n   requirements
    has been that the two most important transition\n   scenarios in the near future
    will be the \"4-6-4\" and \"6-4\" network\n   scenarios.  These scenarios are
    described in detail below, in their\n   several possible variants, showing the
    new issues that IPv6\n   transition raises for multicast operation.\n\n   There
    is further general agreement that Any-Source Multicast (ASM)\n   (the service,
    not necessarily the technology) is no longer an\n   important use case.  As a
    result, this document restricts itself to\n   scenarios where the set of multicast
    sources is separate from the set\n   of multicast receivers.  As a final restriction,
    it assumes a single\n   administrative provider domain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
