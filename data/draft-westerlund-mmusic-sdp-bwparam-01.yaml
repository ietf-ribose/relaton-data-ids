abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The existing Session Description Protocol (SDP) bandwidth modifiersand
    their values include the bandwidth needed also for the transportand IP layers.
    When using SDP in protocols like SAP, SIP and RTSP andthe involved hosts reside
    in networks running different IP versions,the interpretation of what type of lower
    layers that is included isnot clear. This documents defines a bandwidth modifier
    that does notinclude transport overhead, instead additional packet rate attributesare
    defined. The transport independent bitrate value together withthe packet rate
    can then be used to calculate the real bitrate overthe actually used transport.</p>"
