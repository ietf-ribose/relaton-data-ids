abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ultra-Low Latency is a highly desired property for many types
    of\n   services, such as 5G MTC (Machine Type Communication) requiring\n   E2E
    connection for V2V to be less than 2ms, AR/VR requiring delay\n   less than 5ms,
    V2X less than 20ms, etc.\n\n   This draft examines the E2E latency from architectural\n
    \  perspective, from studying how different OSI layers contribute to\n   E2E latency,
    how different domains, which can be different\n   operators' domains or administrative
    domains, contribute to E2E\n   latency, to analyzing the gaps of recent technology
    advancement\n   in reducing latency.\n\n   By studying the contributing factors
    to E2E latency from various\n   angles, the draft identifies some gaps of recent
    technology\n   advancement for E2E services traversing multiple domains and\n
    \  involving multiple layers, which can be the basis for IAB to\n   organize more
    in-depth discussion, like workshop or cross Area\n   (or industry wide) BOF, as
    the scope of the discussion will be\n   too wide for one IETF WG. The discussion
    might touch upon\n   multiple IETF areas.\n\n   The goal of those further \"deep-dive\"
    workshop or cross area BOF\n   is to establish more comprehensive foundation to
    IESG and the\n   IETF community in identifying potential new work initiatives
    for\n   reducing E2E latency of services over the Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
