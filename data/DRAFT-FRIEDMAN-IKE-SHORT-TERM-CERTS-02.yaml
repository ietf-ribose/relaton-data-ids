abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an extension to IKEv2 that allows an
    endpoint\n   which has authenticated to a gateway to request a short-term\n   credential,
    possession of which proves the authentication.  This\n   allows it to prove to
    a security gateway that it was already\n   authenticated by another trusted security
    gateway, thereby allowing\n   the authentication of the endpoint without user
    intervention.  This\n   credential is a certificate issued by the authenticating
    gateway for\n   a short period of time, which can be used to authenticate the
    user\n   with IKE signature based authentication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
