abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines enhancements to the OSPF protocol to support
    a new\n   class of link-state advertisements (LSA) called Opaque LSAs.  Opaque\n
    \  LSAs provide a generalized mechanism to allow for the future\n   extensibility
    of OSPF. Opaque LSAs consist of a standard LSA header\n   followed by application-specific
    information.  The information field\n   may be used directly by OSPF or by other
    applications.  Standard OSPF\n   link-state database flooding mechanisms are used
    to distribute Opaque\n   LSAs to all or some limited portion of the OSPF topology.\n\n
    \  This document replaces [RFC2370], and adds to it a mechanism to\n   enable
    an OSPF router to validate AS-scope opaque LSAs originated\n   outside of the
    router's OSPF area.\n\t </p>\n      "
