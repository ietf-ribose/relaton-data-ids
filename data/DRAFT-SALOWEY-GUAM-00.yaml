abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Generic Security Services API (GSS-API), the Simple Authentication\n
    \  and Security Layer (SASL), the Extensible Authentication Protocol\n   (EAP)
    and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are examples of four\n   different security
    frameworks within the IETF.  Each of these\n   frameworks have evolved separately
    towards a common goal of\n   authentication and establishing a cryptographic context.
    \ They\n   support different types of security mechanisms and have historically\n
    \  evolved to integrate with different security infrastructures.  This\n   document
    discusses their similarities and differences and how these\n   security mechanisms
    might start to converge into a more uniform\n   approach involving generally useful
    authentication mechanisms that\n   can be used in any of these frameworks with
    a variety of different\n   security infrastructures.\n\t </p>\n      "
