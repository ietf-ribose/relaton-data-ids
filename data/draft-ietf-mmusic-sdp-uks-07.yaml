abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes unknown key-share attacks on the use of Datagram
    Transport Layer Security for the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (DTLS-SRTP).
    Similar attacks are described on the use of DTLS-SRTP with the identity bindings
    used in Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) and SIP identity. These attacks
    are difficult to mount, but they cause a victim to be misled about the identity
    of a communicating peer. This document defines mitigation techniques that implementations
    of RFC 8122 are encouraged to deploy.</p>"
