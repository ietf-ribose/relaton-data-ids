abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is an XML document format for\nexchanging
    emergency alerts and public warnings.  Different\norganizations issue alerts for
    specific geographic regions.  The\nLocation-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol
    provides a way to\ndiscover servers that distribute these alerts for a geographical\nregion.
    \ This document defines the Service Uniform Resource Names\n(URN)s for warnings
    in the same way as they have been defined with\nRFC 5031 for citizen-to-authority
    emergency services.  Additionally,\nthis document suggests to use LoST for the
    discovery of servers\ndistributing alerts.\n\t </p>\n      "
