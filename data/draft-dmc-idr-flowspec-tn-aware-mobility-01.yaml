abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a BGP Flow Specification (flowSpec) extension
    to disseminate flows from 5G mobile networks so that the 5G mobile systems slices
    and Service Types (SSTs) can be mapped to optimal underlying network paths in
    the data network outside the 5G UPFs, or the N6 interface in 3GPP 5G Architecture
    [3GPP TR 23.501].</p>"
