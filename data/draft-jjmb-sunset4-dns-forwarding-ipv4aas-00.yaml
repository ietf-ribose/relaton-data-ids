abstract:
- content: "<p>The depletion of IPv4 coupled with the wide spread deployment of IPv6
    for broadband globally is creating an environment where service providers can
    seriously begin to consider alternate uses and applications for native IPv6 connectivity.
    Pervasive, reliable support for IPv6 across many access technologies suggests
    that one critical use for native IPv6 is the carry legacy IPv4 communications.
    Today this is referred to as IPv4 as a Service (IPv4aaS). IPv4aaS can leverage
    a variety of transports ranging from Mapping of Address and Ports (MAP) to Generic
    Route Encapsulation (GRE) along with other viable protocols. Most every use case
    for IPv4aaS includes the use of CG-NAT, however, this is not strictly required.
    The purpose of this document is to hone in on DNS specific behavior that must
    be taken into consideration as the deployment of IPv4aaS advances globally.</p>"
