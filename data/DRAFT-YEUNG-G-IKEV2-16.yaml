abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a set of IKEv2 exchanges that comprise
    a group\n   key management protocol.  The protocol is in conformance with the\n
    \  Multicast Security (MSEC) key management architecture, which contains\n   two
    components: member registration and group rekeying.  Both\n   components require
    a Group Controller/Key Server to download IPsec\n   group security associations
    to authorized members of a group.  The\n   group members then exchange IP multicast
    or other group traffic as\n   IPsec packets.  This document obsoletes RFC 6407.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
