abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document explains a few use cases where operators would
    like to\n   introduce so-called \"walled gardens\" into home-networks, including\n
    \  distribution of new DNS anchors.  This document proposes an\n   alternative
    solution involving DNS delegations to access controlled\n   DNS servers.  The
    results are much more scalable, and can be deployed\n   today, using existing
    operating systems and existing DNS\n   infrastructure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
