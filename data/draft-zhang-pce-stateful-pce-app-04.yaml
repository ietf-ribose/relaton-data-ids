abstract:
  content: "<p>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information about
    Label Switched Path (LSP) characteristics and resource usage within a network
    in order to provide traffic engineering calculations for its associated Path Computation
    Clients (PCCs). This document describes general considerations for a stateful
    PCE deployment and examines its applicability and benefits through a number of
    use cases. Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) extensions required for stateful
    PCE usage are covered in separate documents.</p>"
