abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The aim of this document is to provide a way forward to best
    decide\n   upon how alternative transport information can be expressed in a CoAP\n
    \  URI.  This draft examines the requirements for a new URI format for\n   representing
    CoAP resources over alternative transports.  Various\n   potential URI formats
    are presented.  Benefits and drawbacks of\n   embedding alternative transport
    information in various ways within\n   the URI components are also discussed.
    \ From all listed formats, the\n   document finds scheme-based model to be the
    most technically\n   feasible.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
