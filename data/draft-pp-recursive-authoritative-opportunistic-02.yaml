abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a use case and a method for a DNS recursive
    resolver to use opportunistic encryption when communicating with authoritative
    servers. A motivating use case for this method is that more encryption on the
    Internet is better, and opportunistic encryption is better than no encryption
    at all. The method here is optional for both the recursive resolver and the authoritative
    server. Nothing in this method prevents use cases and methods that require authenticated
    encryption.</p>"
