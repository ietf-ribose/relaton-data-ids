abstract:
- content: "<p>Redundancy protection provides a mechanism to achieve the high reliability
    of the service transmission in network. Specifically, packets of flows are replicated
    into two or more copies, which are transported through different paths in parallel.
    When copies of packets are merged at network node, the redundant packets are eliminated
    to guarantee one copy of the flow is successfully transmitted. This document extends
    the capabilities in SR paradigm to support redundancy protection function, including
    the definitions of new Segments and a variation of Segment Routing Policy. The
    new mechanism applies equally to both Segment Routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS)
    and Segment Routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</p>"
