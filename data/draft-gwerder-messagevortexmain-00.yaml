abstract:
- content: "<p>MessageVortex Protocol specifies messages embedded within existing
    transfer protocols such as SMTP or XMPP to send them anonymously from peer to
    peer. The protocol outperforms other protocols by decoupling transport from the
    final transmitter and receiver party. There is no trust put into any infrastructure
    except for the infrastructure of the sending and receiving party of a message.
    The Message flow is entirely selected by the creator of the routing block. Routing
    nodes gain no non- obvious knowledge about messages even when collaborating. Third-
    party anonymity is always achieved. Furthermore, one out of sender and receiver
    anonymity may be achieved.</p>"
