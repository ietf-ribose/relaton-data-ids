abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF has produced a complete\n
    \  architecture for controlling media server resources in Internet\n   Protocol
    (IP) based networks.  An important function in the MediaCtrl\n   architecture
    is the Media Resource Broker entity which monitors and\n   allocates media resources
    to requesting applications.  This document\n   introduces a Media Resource Broker
    (MRB) Location Function (MLF)\n   which works in partnership with MRB's in large
    deployments providing\n   a light weight scaling and failover mechanism.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
