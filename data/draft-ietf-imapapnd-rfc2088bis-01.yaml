abstract:
- content: '<p>The Internet Message Access Protocol (RFC 3501) contains the "literal"
    syntactic construct for communicating strings. When sending a literal from client
    to server, IMAP requires the client to wait for the server to send a command continuation
    request between sending the octet count and the string data. This document specifies
    an alternate form of literal which does not require this network round trip. This
    document specifies 2 IMAP extensions: LITERAL+ and LITERAL-. The former allows
    the alternate form of literals in all IMAP command. The latter is the same as
    LITERAL+, but disallow the alternate form in IMAP APPEND, unless they are 4096
    bytes or less.</p>'
