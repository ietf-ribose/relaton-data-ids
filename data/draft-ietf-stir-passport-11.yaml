abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a method for creating and validating a token
    that cryptographically verifies an originating identity or, more generally, a
    URI or telephone number representing the originator of personal communications.
    The Personal Assertion Token, PASSporT, is cryptographically signed to protect
    the integrity of the identity of the originator and to verify the assertion of
    the identity information at the destination. The cryptographic signature is defined
    with the intention that it can confidently verify the originating persona even
    when the signature is sent to the destination party over an insecure channel.
    PASSporT is particularly useful for many personal-communications applications
    over IP networks and other multi-hop interconnection scenarios where the originating
    and destination parties may not have a direct trusted relationship.</p>"
