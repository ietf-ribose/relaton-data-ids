abstract:
- content: "<p>Along as the adoption of TCP/IP in increasingly emerging scenarios,
    challenges emerge as well due to the ossified address structure. To still enable
    TCP/IP for networks that previously using exclusive protocols, a flexible address
    structure would be highly preferred for their particular properties. This document
    describes well-recognized scenarios that typically require a flexible address
    structure, and states the requirements of such flexible address structure.</p>"
