abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo supports the process of progressing performance metric RFCsalong
    the standards track. Observing that the metric definitionsthemselves should be
    the primary focus rather than theimplementations of metrics, this memo describes
    results of examplelab test procedures to evaluate specific metric RFC requirementclauses
    to determine if the requirement has been implemented asintended. A single implementation
    has been tested against the keyspecifications of RFC 2679 on One-way Delay.</p>"
