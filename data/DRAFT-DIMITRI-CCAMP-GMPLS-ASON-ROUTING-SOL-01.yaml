abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocols has been defined
    to \ncontrol different switching technologies as well as different \napplications.
    These include support for requesting TDM connections \nincluding SONET/SDH and
    Optical Transport Networks (OTNs). \n    \nThis document provides the extensions
    of the IETF Link State Routing \nProtocols to meet the routing requirements for
    an Automatically \nSwitched Optical Network (ASON) as defined by ITU-T.  \n\n\t
