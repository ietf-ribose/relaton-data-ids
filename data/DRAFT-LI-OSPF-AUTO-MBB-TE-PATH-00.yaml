abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the network scale expands, especially in the mobile backhaul\n
    \  network, automatic computation of MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) path\n   becomes
    very important.  But owing to requirements on the MPLS TE\n   path, explicit path
    or affinity property has to be introduced for the\n   path computation.  This
    causes the complexity of MPLS TE path design.\n   The document proposes an architecture
    and corresponding OSPF\n   extensions to improve automation on computation of
    MPLS TE path.\n   MPLS TE networks are divided into different traffic engineering\n
    \  layers and areas according to the characteristics of the network\n   topology.
    \ MPLS TE path can compute automatically based on traffic\n   engineering layers
    and areas to satisfy major requirements to bear\n   mobile network services.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
