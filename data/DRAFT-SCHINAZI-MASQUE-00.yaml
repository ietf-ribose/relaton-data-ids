abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes MASQUE (Multiplexed Application Substrate\n
    \  over QUIC Encryption).  MASQUE is a mechanism that allows co-locating\n   and
    obfuscating networking applications behind an HTTPS web server.\n   The currently
    prevalent use-case is to allow running a VPN server\n   that is indistinguishable
    from an HTTPS server to any unauthenticated\n   observer.  We do not expect major
    providers and CDNs to deploy this\n   behind their main TLS certificate, as they
    are not willing to take\n   the risk of getting blocked, as shown when domain
    fronting was\n   blocked.  An expected use would be for individuals to enable
    this\n   behind their personal websites via easy to configure open-source\n   software.\n\n
    \  This document is a straw-man proposal.  It does not contain enough\n   details
    to implement the protocol, and is currently intended to spark\n   discussions
    on the approach it is taking.  As we have not yet found a\n   home for this work,
    discussion is encouraged to happen on the GitHub\n   repository which contains
    the draft:\n   https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts [1].\n\n\t </p>\n
