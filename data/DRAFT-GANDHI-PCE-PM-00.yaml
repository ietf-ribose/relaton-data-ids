abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks, network performance data such as packet
    loss,\n   delay and delay variation (jitter) is a critical measure for traffic\n
    \  engineering.  This data provides operators the characteristics of\n   their
    networks for performance evaluation that is required to ensure\n   the Service
    Level Agreements (SLAs).  Performance measurement\n   mechanisms can be employed
    to measure these metrics for TE LSPs in\n   real-time.  This document describes
    PCEP extensions for reporting\n   such performance measurements to an Active Stateful
    PCE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
