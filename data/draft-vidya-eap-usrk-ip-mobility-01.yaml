abstract:
  content: "<p>EAP [1] is increasingly used for network access authentication invarious
    networks. Also, key generating EAP methods are being adoptedin various systems
    for the purposes of cryptographic protectionbetween an EAP peer and an enforcement
    point in the network. Keygenerating EAP methods produce an MSK and an EMSK in
    accordance with[1]. The MSK is meant for use by the EAP lower layer at the peer
    andthe authenticator and is used differently by various lower layers.The EMSK
    hierarchy is defined in [2]. The EMSK hierarchy is meant tobe extensible to derive
    keys for various usages. This documentdefines the key hierarchy and key derivations
    for using the EMSKhierarchy for keying in IP mobility protocols.</p>"
