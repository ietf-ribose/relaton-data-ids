abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network functions are traditionally implemented on specialized\n
    \  hardware and less on commodity server, but there is a clear trend to\n   implement
    a number of network functions, such as firewall or load\n   balancer, as software
    on virtualized computing platforms.  These\n   virtualized functions are called
    Virtualized Network Functions\n   (VNFs).  We call a group of such VNFs a VNF
    set, which can be used to\n   build network services.  The use of VNF set to build
    network services\n   introduces additional challenges on reliability, such as
    additional\n   points of failure and the need to coordinate various VNFs in a
    VNF\n   set.\n\n   This document discusses the problems related to the reliability
    of\n   VNF set.  A VNF pooling architecture is also briefly introduced, as\n   well
    as related IETF protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
