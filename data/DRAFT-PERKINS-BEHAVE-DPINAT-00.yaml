abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SIPNAT has been proposed as an effective method for enabling global\nInternet
    access to IPv6-only domains.  New methods have been devised\nfor accurate delivery
    of packets from the global Internet into the\ninternal domain of destinations
    that do not share a common address\nspace with the majority of the global Internet.
    \ These improvements\ncan be used to augment Source-IP NAT so that perfect accuracy
    can be\nachieved in many common cases of interest.\n\t </p>\n      "
