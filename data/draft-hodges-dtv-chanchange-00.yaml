abstract:
- content: "<p>Advances in video compression techniques and new technology for delivering
    broadband services are making digital television (DTV) services practical and
    marketable. One of the missing elements is a flexible and open protocol for DTV
    clients to request desired video/audio streams, or 'channel changing'. This document
    describes a protocol that a client may use to change DTV channels, and how servers
    may authenticate the client, authorize the requested streams, perform viewership
    accounting, and form a reply to inform the client on the status of the request.</p>"
