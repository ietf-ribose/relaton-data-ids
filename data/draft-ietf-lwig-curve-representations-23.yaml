abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how to represent Montgomery curves and (twisted)
    Edwards curves as curves in short-Weierstrass form and illustrates how this can
    be used to carry out elliptic curve computations leveraging existing implementations
    and specifications of, e.g., ECDSA and ECDH using NIST prime curves. We also provide
    extensive background material that may be useful for implementers of elliptic
    curve cryptography.</p>"
