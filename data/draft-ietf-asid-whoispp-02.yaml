abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Whois++, an extension to the trivial WHOIS
    service described in RFC 954 to permit WHOIS-like servers to make available more
    structured information to the Internet. We describe an extension to the simple
    WHOIS data model and query protocol and a companion extensible, distributed indexing
    service. A number of options have also been added such as the use of multiple
    languages and character sets, more advanced search expressions, structured data
    and a number of other useful features. An optional authentication mechanism for
    protecting all or part of the associated Whois++ information database from unauthorized
    access is also described.</p>"
