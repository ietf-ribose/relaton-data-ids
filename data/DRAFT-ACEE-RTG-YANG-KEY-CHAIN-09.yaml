abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the key chain YANG data model.  A key
    chain\n   is a list of elements each containing a key, send lifetime, accept\n
    \  lifetime, and algorithm.  By properly overlapping the send and accept\n   lifetimes
    of multiple key chain elements, keys and algorithms may be\n   gracefully updated.
    \ By representing them in a YANG data model, key\n   distribution can be automated.
    \ Key chains are commonly used for\n   routing protocol authentication and other
    applications.  In some\n   applications, the protocols do not use the key chain
    element key\n   directly, but rather a key derivation function is used to derive
    a\n   short-lived key from the key chain element key.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
