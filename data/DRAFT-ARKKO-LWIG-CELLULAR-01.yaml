abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo discusses the use of the Constrained Application
    Protocol\n   (CoAP) protocol in building sensors and other devices that employ\n
    \  cellular networks as a communications medium.  Building communicating\n   devices
    that employ these networks is obviously well known, but this\n   memo focuses
    specifically on techniques necessary to minimize power\n   consumption.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
