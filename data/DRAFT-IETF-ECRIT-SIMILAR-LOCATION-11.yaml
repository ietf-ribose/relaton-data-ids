abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a new way to provide returned location\n
    \  information in LoST responses that is either of a completed or\n   similar
    form to the original input civic location, based on whether\n   valid or invalid
    civic address elements are returned within the\n   &lt;findServiceResponse&gt;
    message.  This document defines a new extension\n   to the &lt;findServiceResponse&gt;
    message within the LoST protocol\n   [RFC5222] that enables the LoST protocol
    to return in a response a\n   completed civic address element set for a valid
    location response,\n   and one or more suggested sets of similar location information
    for an\n   invalid location.  These two types of civic addresses are referred
    to\n   as either \"complete location\" or \"similar location\", and are included\n
    \  as a compilation of CAtype xml elements within the existing LoST\n   &lt;findServiceResponse&gt;
    message structure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
