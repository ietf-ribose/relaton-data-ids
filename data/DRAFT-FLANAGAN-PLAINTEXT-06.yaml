abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In 2013, after a great deal of community discussion, the decision
    was\n   made to shift from the plain-text, ASCII-only canonical format for\n   RFCs
    to XML as the canonical format.  The high-level requirements\n   that informed
    this change were defined in RFC6949, \"RFC Series Format\n   Requirements and
    Future Development.\"  Plain text is still an\n   important format for many in
    the IETF community, and will still be\n   one of the publication formats rendered
    from the XML.  This draft\n   documents the rendering requirements for the plain-text
    RFC\n   publication format.  These requirements do not apply to plain-text\n   RFCs
    published before the format transition.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
