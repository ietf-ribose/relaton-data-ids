abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to generate negative answers
    from\n   NSEC records for the special case of the DNS root.  This improves\n   performance;
    the resolver can answer immediatly, and does not need to\n   query the root.  It
    also cuts down on the so-called \"junk\" queries.\n\n   [ Ed note: Text inside
    square brackets ([]) is additional background\n   information, answers to frequently
    asked questions, general musings,\n   etc.  They will be removed before publication.]\n\n
    \  [ This document is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-cheese-shop.
    \ The most\n   recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be\n
    \  available here.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]\n\n\t </p>\n
