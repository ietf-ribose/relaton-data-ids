abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo outlines support for unreliable streams in QUIC.
    \ This\n   draft contains a collection of considerations and requirements for\n
    \  unreliable streams in QUIC based on [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-transport].\n   It
    provides to alternatives demonstrating how unreliable streams can\n   be realized.
    \ The intention of this document is to collect\n   considerations regarding unreliable
    streams in QUIC and to frame the\n   design space.  All content of this memo is
    supposed to be merged into\n   [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-transport], [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-recovery]
    and,\n   [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-applicability] once unreliable streams get\n   integrated
    with QUIC.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
