abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The growth of the Internet has witnessed an emergence of transportservices
    that rely on or can benefit from assistance of networkintermediaries between communicating
    end-points. Such services,for example, include TCP performance enhancements, multimediapacket
    filtering, header compression, and prevention ofDenial-of-Service. In this draft,
    we describe some of theimportant aspects of the problem of securely enablingintermediary-based
    services. We also present several scenarioswhere this problem is manifested.</p>"
