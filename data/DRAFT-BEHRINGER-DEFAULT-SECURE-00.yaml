abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Pervasive monitoring on the Internet is enabled by the lack
    of\n   general, fundamental security.  In his presentation at the 88th IETF\n
    \  Bruce Schneier called for ubiquitous use of security technologies to\n   make
    pervasive monitoring too expensive and thus impractical.\n   However, today security
    is too operationally expensive, and thus only\n   used where strictly required.\n\n
    \  In this position paper we argue that all network transactions can be\n   secure
    by default, with minimal or no operator involvement.  This\n   requires an autonomic
    approach where all devices in a domain enrol\n   automatically in a trust domain.
    \ Once they share a common trust\n   anchor they can secure communications between
    themselves, following a\n   domain policy which is by default secure.\n\n   The
    focus of this proposal is the network itself, with all protocols\n   between network
    elements, including control plane protocols (e.g.,\n   routing protocols) and
    management plane protocols (e.g., SSH,\n   netconf, etc).  The proposal is evolutionary
    and allows a smooth\n   migration from today's Internet technology, device by
    device.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
