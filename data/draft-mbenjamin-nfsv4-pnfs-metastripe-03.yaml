abstract:
- content: <p>This Internet-Draft describes a means to add metadata striping to pNFS.
    The text of this draft is substantially based on prior drafts by Eisler, M., with
    some departures. The current draft attempts to define a somewhat lighter-weight
    protocol, in particular, seeks to permit striping for "filehandle only" operations
    such as LOCK and OPEN + CLAIM_FH, without clients having to obtain metadata layouts
    on regular files. We gratefully acknowledge the primary contributions of Mike
    Eisler, Pranoop Ersani, and others. Internet Draft Comments Comments regarding
    this draft are solicited.</p>
