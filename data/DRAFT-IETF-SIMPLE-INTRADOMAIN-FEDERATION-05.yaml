abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Presence and Instant Messaging (IM) bridging involves the sharing
    of\npresence information and exchange of IM across multiple systems\nwithin a
    single domain.  As such, it is a close cousin to presence\nand IM federation,
    which involves the sharing of presence and IM\nacross differing domains.  Presence
    and IM bridging can be the result\nof a multi-vendor network, or a consequence
    of a large organization\nthat requires partitioning.  This document examines different
    use\ncases and models for intra-domain presence and IM bridging.  It is\nmeant
    to provide a framework for defining requirements and\nspecifications for presence
    and IM bridging.  The document assumes\nSIP as the underlying protocl but many
    of the modles can fit other\nprotocols as well.\n\t </p>\n      "
