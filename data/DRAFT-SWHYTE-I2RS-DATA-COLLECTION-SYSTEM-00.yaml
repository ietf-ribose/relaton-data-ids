abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Collecting large amounts of data from network infrastructure
    devices\n   has never been very easy.  Existing methods generate CPU and memory\n
    \  loads that may be unacceptable, the output varies across\n   implementations
    and can be difficult to parse, and these methods are\n   often difficult to scale.
    \ I2RS programmatic interfacing with the\n   routing system may exacerbate this
    problem: state needs to be\n   collected from nodes and fed to consumers participating
    in the\n   control plane that may not be physically close to the nodes.  This\n
    \  state includes not only control plane information, but elements of\n   the
    data plane that have a direct impact on control plane behavior,\n   like traffic
    engineering.\n\n   This document outlines a set of use cases requiring a flexible\n
    \  framework to collect routing system data, and the features and\n   functionality
    needed to make such a framework useful for these use\n   cases.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
