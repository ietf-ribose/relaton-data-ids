abstract:
- content: "<p>The address space holder needs to issue an ROA object when it authorizes
    one or more ASes to originate routes to IP prefix(es). During the process of ROA
    issuance, the address space holder may need to specify an origin AS for a list
    of IP prefixes. Besides, the address space holder has a free choice to put multiple
    prefixes into a single ROA or issue separate ROAs for each prefix based on the
    current specification. This memo analyzes and presents some operational problems
    which may be caused by the ROAs containing multiple IP prefixes. Some suggestions
    and considerations also have been proposed.</p>"
