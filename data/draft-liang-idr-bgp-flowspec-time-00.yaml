abstract:
- content: <p>The BGP flow specification (FlowSpec) is an additional tool to mitigate
    the effects of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Since DDoS attacks
    are dynamic, filtering of a flow may only be necessary for some specified time,
    and be undesirable at other times. This document proposes a new BGP path attribute
    called "Flow Extended Attribute", which carries expected valid period information
    for a FlowSpec rule. So network administrators can control certain types of traffic
    in a specified period.</p>
