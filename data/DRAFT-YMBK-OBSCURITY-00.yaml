  content: "\n\t <p>Hiding security vulnerabilities in algorithms, software, and/or\nhardware
    decreases the likelihood they will be repaired and increases\nthe likelihood that
    they can and will be exploited by evil-doers.\nDiscouraging or outlawing discussion
    of weaknesses and\nvulnerabilities is extremely dangerous and deleterious to the\nsecurity
    of computer systems, the network, and its citizens.\n\t </p>\n      "
