abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms allow for burst\n
    \  tolerance while enforcing short queues to minimise the time that\n   packets
    spend enqueued at a bottleneck.  This can cause noticeable\n   performance degradation
    for TCP connections traversing such a\n   bottleneck, especially if they are only
    a few or their bandwidth-\n   delay-product is large.  An Explicit Congestion
    Notification (ECN)\n   signal indicates that an AQM mechanism is used at the bottleneck,
    and\n   therefore the bottleneck network queue is likely to be short.  This\n
    \  document therefore proposes an update to the TCP sender-side ECN\n   reaction
    in congestion avoidance to reduce the Congestion Window\n   (cwnd) by a smaller
    amount than the congestion control algorithm's\n   reaction to loss.\n\n\t </p>\n
