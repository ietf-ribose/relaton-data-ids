abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) allows one Label Switching\n
    \  Router (LSR) to advertise to another a set of \"bindings\" between\n   MPLS
    labels and \"Forwarding Equivalence Classes\" (FECs).  Suppose\n   LSR2 is advertising
    a set of label bindings to LSR1.  Frequently,\n   LSR1 does not need to know all
    of LSR2's label bindings, and LSR1\n   may be configured to disregard bindings
    in which it has no interest.\n   This document defines an \"Outbound Label Filtering\"
    (OLF) mechanism\n   that allows LSR1 to inform LSR2 dynamically of the set of
    FECs for\n   which it needs to receive label bindings.  LSR2 then applies this\n
    \  filter before sending its label bindings to LSR1. In addition to the\n   generic
    aspects of this mechanism, this document also specifies\n   outbound label filter
    for the \"Address Prefix FEC\" type.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
