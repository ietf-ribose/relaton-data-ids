abstract:
- content: "<p>GMPLS provides control for multiple switching technologies and for
    hierarchical switching within a technology. GMPLS routing and signaling use common
    values to indicate the type of switching technology. These values are carried
    in routing protocols via the Switching Capability field, and in signaling protocols
    via the Switching Type field. While the values used in these fields are the primary
    indicators of the technology and hierarchy level being controlled, the values
    are not consistently defined and used across the different technologies supported
    by GMPLS. This document is intended to resolve the inconsistent definition and
    use of the Switching Capability and Type fields by narrowly scoping the meaning
    and use of the fields. This document updates all documents that use the GMPLS
    Switching Capability and Types fields, in particular RFCs 3471, 4202, 4203, and
    5307.</p>"
