abstract:
- content: "<p>This is an overview of SCSI over IP considerations leading to the FC-SCTP-IP
    draft and to suggest possible implementations of this FC- SCTP-IP draft. With
    two basic architectures covered, it is the intent to illustrate decisions leading
    to both simple FC encapsulation as well as native IP access.</p>"
