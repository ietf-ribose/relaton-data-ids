abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
    \nSwitching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched optical \nnetworks
    (WSON).  Such extensions are necessary in WSONs under a number \nof conditions
    including: (a) when optional processing, such as \nregeneration, must be configured
    to occur at specific nodes along a \npath, (b) where equipment must be configured
    to accept an optical signal \nwith specific attributes, or (c) where equipment
    must be configured to \noutput an optical signal with specific attributes. In
    addition this memo \nprovides mechanisms to support distributed wavelength assignment
    with \nbidirectional LSPs, and choice in distributed wavelength assignment \nalgorithms.
    These extensions build on previous work for the control of \nlambda and G.709
    based networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
