abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Many domain registries, especially sponsored TLDs and ccTLDs, havespecific
    policy that calls for the server to perform additionalbackend processing before
    it completes a transform operation on anobject requested by a client. When the
    pending action is completed,the server must notify the client about the outcome.
    However, currentEPP core specifications do not address the notification messaging
    ina generic way. As a result, a registry has to resort to defining anew schema
    as extension to the object mapping concerned for thispurpose.Inspired by recent
    discussions on the 'ietf-provreg' mailing list onrelated topics, this draft presents
    a strawman proposal for uniformtreatment of server notification for pending action
    in the base EPPprotocol. A new OPTIONAL child element is added to &lt;poll&gt;
    response asbasic notification content, which consists of the transaction ID thattriggered
    the pending action and the outcome of the pending action.In addition, object specific
    data and extension information can bepiggybacked in existing child elements of
    &lt;response&gt;. The requiredmodification to the EPP base protocol is kept to
    the minimum andincurs no change to the EPP base object mappings. Most importantly,the
    proposed solution is applicable to any object mapping, ensuringEPP's extensibility
    beyond domain registry applications.Strong interests by the registry community
    in deploying this featurewarrant that it be best handled as a generic but optional
    feature inthe EPP base protocol. This allows any registry to handle pendingaction
    without the need to define a new schema, eliminating theproliferation of ad hoc
    object extensions repetitively defined bydisparate registries for the very same
    purpose.</p>"
