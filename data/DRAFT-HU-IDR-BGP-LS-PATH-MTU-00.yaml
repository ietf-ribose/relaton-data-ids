abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP Link State (BGP-LS) describes a mechanism by which link-state
    and\n   TE information can be collected from networks and shared with\n   external
    components using the BGP routing protocol.  The centralized\n   controller (PCE/SDN)
    completes the service path calculation based on\n   the information transmitted
    by the BGP-LS and delivers the result to\n   the Path Computation Client (PCC)
    through the PCEP protocol.\n\n   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing
    paradigm, which can\n   be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with no change
    on the\n   forwarding plane and applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new\n
    \  type of routing header, called SRH.  The SR uses the IGP protocol as\n   the
    control protocol.  Compared to the MPLS tunneling technology, the\n   SR does
    not require signaling.  Therefore, the SR does not support\n   the negotiation
    of the Path MTU.  Since Multiple labels or SRv6 SIDs\n   are pushed in the packets,
    it is more likely that the MTU exceeds the\n   limit in the SR tunneling technology.\n\n
    \  This document specify the extension to BGP Link State (BGP-LS) to\n   carry
    maximum transmission unit (MTU) messages.  The PCE/SDN\n   calculates the Path
    MTU while completing the service path calculation\n   based on the information
    transmitted by the BGP-LS.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
