abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft describes an experimental protocol, MM-HOP, which
    was defined during the fall of 2000 and is currently being implemented by ABNW.
    Using MM-HOP fast, state-preserving handovers between pico-cell wireless base-stations
    carrying IP traffic may be achieved. This draft is NOT submitted to seamoby as
    candidate for any standard protocol, only as a record of a limited implementation
    of context transfer and micro-mobility support.</p>"
