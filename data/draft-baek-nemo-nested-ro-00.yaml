abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a nested NEMO Route Opimization (NNRO) protocol
    for the communications between any two nodes in the same nested mobile network.
    A nested NEMO Route Opimization message is used to exchange the routing information
    between two mobile network nodes in the same nested mobile network. The protocol
    is designed in a way such that the mobility of the entire nested mobile network
    is transparent to the nodes therein.</p>"
