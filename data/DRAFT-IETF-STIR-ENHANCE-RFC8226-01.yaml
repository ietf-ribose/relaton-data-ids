abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 8226 provides a certificate extension to constrain the
    JWT claims\n   that can be included in the PASSporT as defined in RFC 8225.  If
    the\n   signer includes a JWT claim outside the constraint boundaries, then\n
    \  the recipient will reject the entire PASSporT.  This document defines\n   additional
    ways that the JWT claims can be constrained.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
