abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information
    on\n   the current network state, including: computed Label Switched Path\n   (LSPs),
    reserved resources within the network, and pending path\n   computation requests.
    This information may then be considered when\n   computing new traffic engineered
    LSPs, and for associated\n   and dependent LSPs, received from Path Computation
    Clients (PCCs).\n\n   The Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) architecture,\n
    \  provides an architecture to allow the optimum sequence of\n   inter-connected
    domains to be selected, and network policy to be\n   applied if applicable, via
    the use of a hierarchical relationship\n   between PCEs.\n\n   Combining the capabilities
    of Stateful PCE and the Hierarchical PCE\n   would be advantageous. This document
    describes general considerations\n   and use cases for the deployment of Stateful
    PCE(s) using the\n   Hierarchical PCE architecture.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
