abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Optical networks which support a large number of emerging\n
    \  applications, such as 5G, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Internet of\n   things,
    autonomous driving, etc., play an increasingly important\n   role in the current
    world. All the time spectrum resources in\n   optical networks have been treated
    equally. All spectrum resources\n   form a resource pool which is allocated to
    applications bit by bit\n   until it is all used up. Although this pattern reduces
    the\n   complexity of resource maintenance, it has poor flexibility and high\n
    \  operation complexity for different types of applications. This draft\n   proposes
    a framework of centralized control and distributed function\n   slicing for fast
    connection establishment and fault recovery in\n   optical networks. The proposed
    framework divides all spectrum\n   resources into four functional areas, i.e.,
    optical channel area,\n   fault recovery area, resource pool area, and the reserved
    functional\n   area. A functional area is responsible for a specific network\n
    \  function. This framework improves the flexibility of optical\n   networks and
    can achieve fast connection establishment and fault\n   recovery for the request
    with a highest service level.\n\t </p>\n      "
