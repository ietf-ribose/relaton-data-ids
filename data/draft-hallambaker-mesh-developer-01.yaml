- content: "<p>The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an end-to-end secure infrastructure
    that facilitates the exchange of configuration and credential data between multiple
    user devices. This document describes how to install and run the Mesh reference
    code and make use of the reference code in applications. It does not form a part
