abstract:
- content: <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) specifies a query type (QTYPE) "ANY". The
    operator of an authoritative DNS server might choose not to respond to such queries
    for reasons of local policy, motivated by security, performance or other reasons.
    The DNS specification does not include specific guidance for the behaviour of
    DNS servers or clients in this situation. This document aims to provide such guidance.</p>
