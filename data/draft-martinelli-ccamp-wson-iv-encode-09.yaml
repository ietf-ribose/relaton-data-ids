abstract:
- content: "<p>Impairment-Aware (IA) Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) function
    might be required in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON) that already
    support RWA. This document defines proper encoding to support this operation.
    It goes in addition to the available impairment-free WSON encoding and it is fully
    compatible with it. As the information model, the encoding is independent from
    control plane architectures and protocol implementations. Its definitions can
    be used in related protocol extensions.</p>"
