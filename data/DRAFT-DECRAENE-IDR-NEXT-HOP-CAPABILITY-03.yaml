abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 5492 defines capabilities advertisement for the BGP peer.
    \ In\n   addition, it is useful to be able to advertise BGP Next-Hop dependant\n
    \  capabilities, in particular for forwarding plane features.  RFC 5492\n   is
    not applicable because the BGP peer may be different from the BGP\n   Next-Hop,
    in particular when BGP Route Reflection is used.  This\n   document defines a
    mechanism to advertise such BGP Next Hop dependant\n   Capabilities.\n\n   This
    document defines a new BGP non-transitive attribute to carry\n   Next-Hop Capabilities.
    \ This attribute is deleted or possibly\n   modified when the BGP Next Hop is
    changed.\n\n   This document also defines a Next-Hop capability to advertise the\n
    \  ability to handle the MPLS Entropy Label defined in RFC 6790.  It\n   updates
    RFC 6790 with regard to this BGP signaling.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
