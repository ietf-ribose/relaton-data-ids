abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the basic requirements for food for folks that
    attend IETF meetings require special diets, as well as those that prefer to eat
    healthy. While, the variety of special diets is quite broad, the most general
    categories are described. There can be controversy as to what constitutes healthy
    eating, but there are some common, generally available foods that comprise the
    basis for healthy eating and special diets. This document provides some recommendations
    to meeting planners, as well as participants, in handling these requirements.</p>"
