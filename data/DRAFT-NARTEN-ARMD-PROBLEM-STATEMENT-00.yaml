abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document examines problems related to the massive scaling
    of\n   data centers.  Our initial scope is relatively narrow.  Specifically,\n
    \  we focus on address resolution (ARP and ND) within a single L2\n   broadcast
    domain, in which all nodes are within the same physical\n   data center.  From
    an IP perspective, the entire L2 network comprises\n   one IP subnet or IPv6 \"link\".
    \ Data centers in which a single L2\n   network spans multiple geographic locations
    are out-of-scope.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
