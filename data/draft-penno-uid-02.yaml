abstract:
  content: "\t <t>With the advent of Content Delivery Networks and personalizedservices
    there is a need to uniquely identify a user in oder tobe able to offer customized
    services and content. Unfortunately,the IP Internet makes personalizing content
    and servicesdifficult for the providers.With the virtualization of Web resources
    and the widespread use ofproxies, an IP address no longer uniquely identifies
    a Web user ordestination.So in oder to uniquely identify a user, the service provider
    has tomake the identification on the edge (or access) network, before theuser
    looses his identity in the core of the network. We presenthere a overview of these
    techniques available on the differenttypes of access networks.</p>"
