abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the original intentions for the IPv6 host configuration, was
    to configure the network-layer parameters only with IPv6 ND, and use service discovery
    for other configuration information. Unfortunately that hasn't panned out quite
    as planned, and we are in a situation where all kinds of configuration options
    are added to RAs and DHCP. This document proposes a new universal option for RA
    and DHCP in a self-describing data format, with the list of elements maintained
    in an IANA registry, with greatly relaxed rules for registration.</p>"
