abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is a proposal to add new event/signal packages and
    termi-\nnation classes to the Megaco protocol [3], to support an IP telephone\nMG.
    \ The proposal covers the requirements (section 3), design approach\n(section
    4) and resource/termination model (section 5) to be used for IP\ntelephones. The
    new event/signal packages and termination classes are\ndefined in sections 6 and
    7 respectively.  Megaco protocol issues\naffecting effective implementation of
    IP telephones, including\ncomplexity, reliable transport, message encoding, security
    and others\nare presented in section 8.  The proposal represents a current view
    from\nthe TIA working group on IP telephone specification, TIA TR-41.3.4, with\nthe
    intent of using this as part of its 'whole device' specification as\na method
    of device control.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
