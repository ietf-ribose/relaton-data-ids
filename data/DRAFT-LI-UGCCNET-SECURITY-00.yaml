    for the\n   protocol defined in \"Ubiquitous Green Community Control Network\",\n
    \  specifies security requirements, defines system security\n   architecture,
    gives a standardized description of authentication,\n   authorization, along with
    security procedures and protocols.  This\n   standard can avoid unintended data
    disclosure to the public and\n   unauthorized access to resources, while providing
