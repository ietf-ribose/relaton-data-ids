abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS-SD Service Registration Protocol uses the standard DNS Update
    mechanism to enable DNS-Based Service Discovery using only unicast packets. This
    eliminates the dependency on Multicast DNS as the foundation layer, which greatly
    improves scalability and improves performance on networks where multicast service
    is not an optimal choice, particularly 802.11 (Wi-Fi) and 802.15.4 (IoT) networks.
    DNS-SD Service registration uses public keys and SIG(0) to allow services to defend
    their registrations against attack.</p>"
