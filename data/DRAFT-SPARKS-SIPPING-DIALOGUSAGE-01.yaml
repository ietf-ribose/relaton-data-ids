abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Several methods in the Session Initiation Protocol can create
    an\n   association between endpoints known as a dialog.  Some of these\n   methods
    can also create a new association within an existing dialog.\n   These multiple
    associations, or dialog usages, require carefully\n   coordinated processing as
    they have independent life-cycles, but\n   share common dialog state.\n\n   This
    memo argues that multiple dialog usages should be avoided.  It\n   discusses alternatives
    to their use and clarifies essential behavior\n   for elements that cannot currently
    avoid them.\n\t </p>\n      "
