abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes techniques for allowing sites running the Locator/ID
    Separation Protocol (LISP) to interoperate with Internet sites (which may be using
    either IPv4, IPv6, or both) but which are not running LISP. A fundamental property
    of LISP speaking sites is that they use Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), rather than
    traditional IP addresses, in the source and destination fields of all traffic
    they emit or receive. While EIDs are syntactically identical to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses,
    normally routes to them are not carried in the global routing system so an interoperability
    mechanism is needed for non- LISP-speaking sites to exchange traffic with LISP-speaking
    sites. This document introduces three such mechanisms. The first uses a new network
    element, the LISP Proxy Ingress Tunnel Routers (Proxy-ITRs) (Section 5) to act
    as a intermediate LISP Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) for non-LISP-speaking hosts.
    Second the document adds Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality to LISP
    Ingress and LISP Egress Tunnel Routers (xTRs) to substitute routable IP addresses
    for non-routable EIDs. Finally, this document introduces the Proxy Egress Tunnel
    Router (Proxy ETR) to handle cases where a LISP ITR cannot send packets to non-LISP
    sites without encapsulation.</p>"
