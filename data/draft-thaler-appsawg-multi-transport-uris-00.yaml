abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) today have some mechanism
    to resolve them to one or more specific endpoints where that resource is available.
    This document discusses issues that arise when the same resource can be reached
    over multiple protocol stacks, and discusses various approaches that have been
    used or discussed, and the tradeoffs between them. Such issues are important to
    consider when defining new URI schemes and resolution mechanisms.</p>"
