abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group (WG) has produced
    a\n   set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path Computation\n   Element
    as a tool to help MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSP tunnels placement.\n   In the PCE architecture,
    a main assumption has been done concerning\n   the information that the PCE needs
    to perform its computation: the\n   Traffic Engineering Database (TED) contains
    all pertinent and\n   suitable information regarding the network that is in the
    scope of a\n   PCE.  Nevertheless, the TED requirements as well as the TED\n   information
    have not yet been formalized.  In addition, some recent\n   RFC (like the Backward
    Recursive Path Computation procedure) or WG\n   draft (like draft-ietf-pce-hierarchy
    ...) suffer from a lack of\n   information in the TED, leading to a non optimal
    result or to some\n   difficulties to deploy them.  This memo tries to identity
    some TED\n   requirements for the PCE.  It is split in two main section: the\n
    \  identification of the specific information to be stored in the TED\n   and
    how it may be populated.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
