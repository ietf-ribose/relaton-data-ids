abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a solution for BGP route reflectors
    to allow\n   them to choose the best path their clients would have chosen under\n
    \  the same conditions, without requiring further state or any new\n   features
    to be placed on the clients.  This facilitates, for example,\n   best exit point
    policy (hot potato routing).  This solution is\n   primarily applicable in deployments
    using centralized route\n   reflectors.\n\n   The solution relies upon all route
    reflectors learning all paths\n   which are eligible for consideration.  Best
    path selection is\n   performed in each route reflector based on a configured
    virtual\n   location in the IGP.  The location can be the same for all clients
    or\n   different per peer/update group or per peer.  Best path selection can\n
    \  also be performed based on user configured policies in each route\n   reflector.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
