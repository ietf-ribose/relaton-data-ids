abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP is used as the only routing protocol in some networks today.
    \ In\n   such networks, it is useful to get a detailed view of the nodes and\n
    \  underlying links in the topology along with their attributes similar\n   to
    one available when using link state routing protocols.  Such a\n   view of a BGP-only
    fabric enables use cases like traffic engineering\n   and forwarding of services
    along paths other than the BGP best path\n   selection.\n\n   This document defines
    extensions to the BGP Link-state address-family\n   (BGP-LS) and the procedures
    for advertisement of the topology in a\n   BGP-only network.  It also describes
    a specific use-case for traffic\n   engineering based on Segment Routing.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
