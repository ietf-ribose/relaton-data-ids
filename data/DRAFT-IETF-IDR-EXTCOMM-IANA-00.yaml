abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document reorganizes the IANA Registries for the type
    values and\n   sub-type values of BGP Extended Communities attribute and the BGP\n
    \  IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Communities attribute.  This is done\n   in
    order to remove inter-dependencies among the registries, thus\n   making it easier
    for IANA to determine which codepoints are available\n   for assignment in which
    registries.  This document also clarifies the\n   information that must be provided
    to IANA when requesting an\n   allocation from one or more of these registries.
    \ These changes are\n   compatible with the existing allocations, and thus do
    not affect\n   protocol implementations.  The changes will however impact the
    \"IANA\n   Considerations\" sections of future protocol specifications.  This\n
    \  document updates RFCs 4360 and 5701.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
