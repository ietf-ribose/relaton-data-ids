abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In basic PMIPv6[RFC5213], Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) should
    forward\n   all traffic for the registered MN.  Localized Routing (LR) for PMIPv6\n
    \  proposed in [RFC6705] allows MN to exchange data directly by using\n   localized
    forwarding or tunnel between the MAGs.  But in some multi-\n   access scenarios,
    it is apparently suboptimal.  The present document\n   proposes two localized
    routing mechanisms that are compatible with\n   RFC 6705 for multi-access MNs
    which have some interfaces attached to\n   the same MAGs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
