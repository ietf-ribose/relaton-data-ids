abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of the Locator/ID Separation
    Protocol\n   (LISP) to interconnect multiple disparate and independent network\n
    \  overlays by using a transit overlay.  The transit overlay is referred\n   to
    as the \"uberlay\" and provides connectivity and control plane\n   abstraction
    between different overlays.  Each network overlay may use\n   different control
    and data plane approaches and may be managed by a\n   different organization.
    \ Structuring the network into multiple\n   network overlays enables the interworking
    of different overlay\n   approaches to data and control plane methods.  The different
    network\n   overlays are autonomous from a control and data plane perspective,\n
    \  this in turn enables failure survivability across overlay domains.\n   This
    document specifies the mechanisms and procedures for the\n   distribution of control
    plane information across overlay sites and in\n   the uberlay as well as the lookup
    and forwarding procedures for\n   unicast and multicast traffic within and across
    overlays.  The\n   specification also defines the procedures to support inter-overlay\n
    \  mobility of EIDs and their integration with the intra-overlay EID\n   mobility
    procedures defined in draft-ietf-lisp-eid-mobility.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
