abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes length hiding methods of operation for the TLS protocol.
    It defines a TLS extension to allow arbitrary amount of padding in any TLS ciphersuite,
    and it presents guidelines and a reference implementation of record fragmentation
    and padding so that the length of the exchanged messages is effectively concealed
    within a given range of lengths. The latter guidelines also apply to the standard
    TLS padding allowed by the TLS block ciphers.</p>"
