abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A multitude of applications are carried over the network, which
    have\n   varying needs for network bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet\n   loss,
    etc.  Some new emerging applications have very demanding\n   performance requirements.
    \ However, in current networks, the network\n   and applications are decoupled,
    that is, the network is not aware of\n   the applications' requirements in a fine
    granularity.  Therefore, it\n   is difficult to provide truly fine-granularity
    traffic operations for\n   the applications and guarantee their SLA requirements.\n\n
    \  This document proposes a new framework, named Application-aware\n   Networking
    (APN), where application-aware information (i.e.  APN\n   attribute) including
    APN identification (ID) and/or APN parameters\n   (e.g.  network performance requirements)
    is encapsulated at network\n   edge devices and carried in packets traversing
    an APN domain in order\n   to facilitate service provisioning, perform fine-granularity
    traffic\n   steering and network resource adjustment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
