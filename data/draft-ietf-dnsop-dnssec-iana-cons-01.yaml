abstract:
- content: <p>This document changes the review requirements needed to get some DNSSEC
    algorithms and resource records added to IANA registries. It updates RFC 6014
    to include hash algorithms for DS records and NSEC3 parameters. It also updates
    RFC 5155 and RFC 6014, which have requirements for DNSSEC algorithms. It also
    updates RFC 8624 to say that algorithms that are described in RFCs that are not
    on standards track are only at the "MAY" level of implementation recommendation.
    The rationale for these changes is to bring the requirements for DS records and
    for the hash algorithms used in NSEC3 in line with the requirements for all other
    DNSSEC algorithms.</p>
