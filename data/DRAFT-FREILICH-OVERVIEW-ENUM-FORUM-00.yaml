abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the current status and work plans for
    the\nENUM Forum and its Task Groups as an informational document to \ndetail additional
    resources available and avoid overlap and \nduplication of efforts in the area
    of ENUM. The primary mission \nof the ENUM Forum is to develop the implementation
    framework for \ndeploying RFC 2916 in a two-tiered DNS structure rooted under
    \n“e164.arpa” for E.164 numbers within the United States and a \npotential common
    implementation with other countries served by the \nNorth American Numbering Plan
    (NANP).\n\t </p>\n      "
