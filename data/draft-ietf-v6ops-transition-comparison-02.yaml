abstract:
- content: "<p>Several IPv6 transition technologies have been developed to provide
    customers with IPv4-as-a-Service (IPv4aaS) for ISPs with an IPv6-only access and/or
    core network. All these technologies have their advantages and disadvantages,
    and depending on existing topology, skills, strategy and other preferences, one
    of these technologies may be the most appropriate solution for a network operator.
    This document examines the five most prominent IPv4aaS technologies considering
    a number of different aspects to provide network operators with an easy to use
    reference to assist in selecting the technology that best suits their needs.</p>"
