abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain network deployments, a single operator has multiple Autonomous
    Systems(AS) to facilitate ease of management. A multiple AS network design could
    also be a result of network mergers and acquisitions. In such scenarios, a centralized
    Inter-domain TE approach could provide most optimal allocation of resources and
    the most controlled path placement. BGP-LS-EPE [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe]
    describes an extension to BGP Link State (BGP-LS) for the advertisement of BGP
    Peering Segments along with their BGP peering node and inter-AS link information,
    so that efficient BGP Egress Peer Engineering (EPE) policies and strategies can
    be computed based on Segment Routing. This document describes extensions to the
    BGP-LS EPE to enable it to be used for inter-AS Traffic-Engineering (TE) purposes.</p>"
