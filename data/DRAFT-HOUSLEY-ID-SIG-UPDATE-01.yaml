abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 5485 specifies the conventions for digital signatures on\n
    \  Internet-Draft documents.  The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) is\n   used
    to create a detached signature, which is stored in a separate\n   companion file
    so that no existing utilities are impacted by the\n   addition of the digital
    signature.\n\n   The RFC Editor recently published the first RFC that includes
    non-\n   ASCII characters in a \"text\" file.  The conventions specified in RFC\n
    \  7997 were followed.  We assume that non-ASCII characters will soon\n   start
    appearing in Internet-Drafts as well.  This document updates\n   the handling
    of digital signatures on Internet-Draft document for\n   non-ASCII characters
    in a \"text\" file.\n\n   This document (once approved) updates RFC 5485.\n\n\t
