abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The IP Router Alert Option is an IP option that alerts transitrouters
    to more closely examine the contents of an IP packet. RSVP,PGM and IGMP are some
    of the protocols which make use of the IPRouter Alert option. The current specification
    for the IP RouterAlert Option does not define mechanisms to facilitate discriminatingacross
    different users of Router Alert. As a result, networks usingrouter Alert may have
    more secuity exposure than necessary and/or mayunnecessarily block some transit
    Router Alert packets. This documentdescribes new rules for the IP Router-Alert
    Option that aid routersto process these packets more selectively.</p>"
