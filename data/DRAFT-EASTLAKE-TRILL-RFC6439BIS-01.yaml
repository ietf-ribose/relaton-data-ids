abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL supports multi-access LAN (Local Area Network) links
    where a\n   single link can have multiple end stations and TRILL switches\n   attached.
    \ Where multiple TRILL switches are attached to a link,\n   native traffic to
    and from end stations on that link is handled by a\n   subset of those TRILL switches
    called \"Appointed Forwarders\", with\n   the intent that native traffic in each
    VLAN be handled by at most one\n   TRILL switch.  This document clarifies and
    updates the Appointed\n   Forwarder mechanism. It updates RFC 6325, updates RFC
    7177, and\n   obsoletes RFC 6439.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
