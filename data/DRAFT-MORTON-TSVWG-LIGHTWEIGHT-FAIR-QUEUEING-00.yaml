abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note presents Lightweight Fair Queueing (LFQ), a fair
    queueing\n   algorithm with a small code footprint, low memory requirements, no\n
    \  multiply operations, only two physical queues, and only one set of\n   AQM
    state.  LFQ provides throughput fairness, sparse flow\n   prioritization and ordering
    guarantees, making it suitable for a\n   mixture of traffic flow types.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
