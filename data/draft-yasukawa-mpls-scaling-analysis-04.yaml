abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) is deployed
    in providers' backbone networks. As providers plan to grow these networks, they
    need to discover whether existing protocols and implementations can support the
    network sizes that they are planning. This document presents an analysis of some
    of the scaling concerns for MPLS-TE backbone networks, and examines the value
    of two techniques for improving scaling. The intention is to motivate the development
    of appropriate deployment techniques and protocol extensions to enable the application
    of MPLS-TE in large networks. This document considers only scalability for point-to-point
    MPLS-TE. Point-to-multipoint MPLS-TE is for future study.</p>"
