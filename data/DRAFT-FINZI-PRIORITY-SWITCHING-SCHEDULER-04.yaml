abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We detail the implementation of a network rate scheduler based
    on\n   both a packet-based implementation of the generalized processor\n   sharing
    (GPS) and a strict priority policies.  This credit based\n   scheduler called
    Priority Switching Scheduler (PSS), inherits from\n   the standard Strict Priority
    Scheduler (SP) but dynamically changes\n   the priority of one or several queues.
    \ Usual scheduling\n   architectures often combine rate schedulers with SP to
    implement\n   DiffServ service classes.  Furthermore, usual implementations of
    rate\n   scheduler schemes (such as WRR, DRR, ...) do not allow to efficiently\n
    \  guarantee the capacity dedicated to both AF and DF DiffServ classes\n   as
    they mostly provide soft bounds.  This means excessive margin is\n   used to ensure
    the capacity requested and this impacts the number of\n   additional users that
    could be accepted in the network.  PSS allows a\n   more predictable output rate
    per traffic class and is a one fit all\n   scheme allowing to enable both SP and
    rate scheduling policies within\n   a single algorithm.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
