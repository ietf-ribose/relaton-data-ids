abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol
    is\n   designed to allow entities with knowledge about the network\n   infrastructure
    to export such information to applications that need\n   to choose one or more
    resources from a candidate set.  This document\n   provides motivation for using
    ALTO in a Virtual Private Network (VPN)\n   environment.  We discuss use cases,
    requirements, and possible\n   extensions to the base ALTO protocol that will
    be needed to support\n   VPN services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
