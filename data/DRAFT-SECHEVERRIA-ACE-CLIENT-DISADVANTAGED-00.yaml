abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a set of recommendations to use when\n
    \  implementing ACE/OAuth 2.0 clients that are working in disadvantaged\n   networks.
    \ Issues such as token revocation have a much higher\n   priority in scenarios
    where Resource Servers are IoT devices, and\n   network connectivity is limited
    and intermittent.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
