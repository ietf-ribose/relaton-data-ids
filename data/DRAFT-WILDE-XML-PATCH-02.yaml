abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The XML Patch media type \"application/xml-patch+xml\" defines
    an XML\n   document structure for expressing a sequence of patch operations that\n
    \  are applied to an XML document.  The XML Patch document format's\n   foundations
    are defined in RFC 5261, this specification defines a\n   document format and
    a media type registration, so that XML Patch\n   documents can be labeled with
    a media type, for example in HTTP\n   conversations.\n\nNote to Readers\n\n   This
    draft should be discussed on the apps-discuss mailing list [13].\n\n   Online
    access to all versions and files is available at github [14].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
