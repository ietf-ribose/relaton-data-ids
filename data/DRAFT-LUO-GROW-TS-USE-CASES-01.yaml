abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Due to the dramatically increased network traffic and the desire
    of\n   differentiated services, it is essential for operators to provide the\n
    \  traffic steering service under limited network resources and maximize\n   their
    benefits at the same time.\n\n   This document lists some typical use cases for
    traffic steering\n   services.  This document does not attempt to enumerate all
    kinds of\n   scenarios, but rather it describes several key features of these\n
    \  scenarios from which solutions may be constructed.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
