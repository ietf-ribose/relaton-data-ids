abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An HTTP \"Nice\" header field is defined that marks a request
    as low\n   priority.  Intermediaries can choose to discard the request or serve\n
    \  it from cache rather than forwarding it to an origin server.  This\n   enables
    constrained origin servers, such as those that rely on\n   battery power, to avoid
    expending limited resources on serving\n   requests.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
