abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Flexible grid is regarded as an efficient way to improve the
    network\n   capacity utilization.  Mixed bit rate transmission systems can\n   allocate
    their channel with different spectral bandwidths so that\n   they can be optimized
    for the bandwidth requirements of the\n   particular bit rate and modulation scheme
    of the individual channels.\n   To support the flexible grid technique, this document
    extends the\n   wavelength label to accommodate this new specification.  It is\n
    \  demonstrated that the extended label format is compatible to the\n   rigid
    one and can be used in the routing and signaling procedure in\n   the Wavelength
    Switched Optical Network (WSON).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
