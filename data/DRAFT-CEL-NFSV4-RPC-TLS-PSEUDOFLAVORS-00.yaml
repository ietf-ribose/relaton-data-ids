abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent innovations in Remote Procedure Call (RPC) transport
    layer\n   security enable broad deployment of encryption and mutual peer\n   authentication
    when exchanging RPC messages.  These security\n   mechanisms can protect peers
    who continue to use the AUTH_SYS RPC\n   auth flavor, which is not cryptographically
    secure, on open networks.\n   This document introduces several RPC auth pseudo-flavors
    and other\n   mechanisms that an RPC service can use to indicate transport layer\n
    \  security requirements for accessing that service.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
