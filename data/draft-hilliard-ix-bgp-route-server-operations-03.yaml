abstract:
- content: "<p>The popularity of Internet exchange points (IXPs) brings new challenges
    to interconnecting networks. While bilateral eBGP sessions between exchange participants
    were historically the most common means of exchanging reachability information
    over an IXP, the overhead associated with this interconnection method causes serious
    operational and administrative scaling problems for IXP participants. Multilateral
    interconnection using Internet route servers can dramatically reduce the administrative
    and operational overhead of IXP participation and these systems used by many IXP
    participants as a preferred means of exchanging routing information. This document
    describes operational considerations for multilateral interconnections at IXPs.</p>"
