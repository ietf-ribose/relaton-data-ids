abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In various network deployments, end to end forwarding paths
    are\n   partitioned into multiple segments.  For example, in some cloud-based\n
    \  WAN communications, stitching multiple overlay tunnels are used for\n   traffic
    policy enforcement matters such as to optimize traffic\n   distribution or to
    select paths exposing a lower latency.  Likewise,\n   in satellite communications,
    the communication path is decomposed\n   into two terrestrial segments and a satellite
    segment.  Such long-\n   haul paths are naturally composed of multiple network
    segments with\n   various encapsulation schemes.  Packet loss may show different\n
    \  characteristics on different segments.\n\n   Traditional transport protocols
    (e.g., TCP) respond to packet loss\n   slowly especially in long-haul networks:
    they either wait for some\n   signal from the receiver to indicate a loss and
    then retransmit from\n   the sender or rely on sender's timeout which is often
    quite long.\n   Non-congestive loss may make the TCP sender over-reduce the sending\n
    \  rate unnecessarily.  With the increase of end-to-end transport\n   encryption
    (e.g., QUIC), traditional PEP (performance enhancing\n   proxy) techniques such
    as TCP splitting are no longer applicable.\n\n   LOOPS (Local Optimizations on
    Path Segments) is a network-assisted\n   performance enhancement over path segment
    and it aims to provide\n   local in-network recovery to achieve better data delivery
    by making\n   packet loss recovery faster and by avoiding the senders over-reducing\n
    \  their sending rate.  In an overlay network scenario, LOOPS can be\n   performed
    over a variety of the existing, or purposely created,\n   tunnel-based path segments.\n\n\t
