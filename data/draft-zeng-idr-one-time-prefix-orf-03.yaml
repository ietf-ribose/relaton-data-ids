abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for BGP,
    termed "One-time Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", which would allow a BGP
    speaker to send to its BGP peer a route refresh request with a set of address-prefix-based
    filters to make the peer send only the specific routes matching the filters to
    the speaker. This ORF-type enables a BGP speaker to re-advertise some specific
    routes without the need of advertising the whole Adj-RIB-Out of a specific address
    family, which makes the route recovery and trouble shooting operation more efficient
    and also reduces the impact on network stability. This filter does not change
    the outbound route filters or policies on the BGP peer and should only be used
    for one- time route filtering.</p>
