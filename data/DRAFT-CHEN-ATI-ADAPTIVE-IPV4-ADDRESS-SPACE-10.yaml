abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a solution to the Internet address
    depletion\n   issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part
    of\n   the original IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for\n   Easy
    IPv4), outlines the IPv4 public address pool expansion and the\n   Internet system
    architecture enhancement considerations. EzIP may\n   expand an IPv4 address by
    a factor of 256M without affecting the\n   existing IPv4 based Internet, or the
    current private networks. It is\n   in full conformance with the IPv4 protocol,
    and supports not only\n   both direct and private network connectivity, but also
    their\n   interoperability. EzIP deployments may coexist with existing Internet\n
    \  traffic and IoTs (Internet of Things) operations without perturbing\n   their
    setups, while offering end-users the freedom to indepdently\n   choose which service.
    EzIP may be implemented as a software or\n   firmware enhancement to Internet
    edge routers or private network\n   routing gateways, wherever needed, or simply
    installed as an inline\n   adjunct hardware module between the two, enabling a
    seamless\n   introduction. The 256M case detailed here establishes a complete\n
    \  spherical layer of an overlay of routers for interfacing between the\n   Internet
    fabic (core plus edge routers) and the end user premises or\n   IoTs. Incorporating
    caching proxy technology in the gateway, a fairly\n   large geographical region
    may enjoy address expansion based on as few\n   as one ordinary IPv4 public address
    utilizing IP packets with\n   degenerated EzIP header. If IPv4 public pool allocations
    were\n   reorganized, the assignable pool could be multiplied 512M fold or\n   even
    more. Enabling hierarchical address architecture which\n   facilitates both hierarchical
    and mesh routing, EzIP can provide\n   nearly the same order of magnitude of address
    pool resources as IPv6\n   while streamlining the administrative aspects of it.
    The basic EzIP\n   will immediately resolve the local IPv4 address shortage, while
    being\n   transparent to the rest of the Internet as a new parallel facility.\n
    \  Under the Dual-Stack environment, these proposed interim facilities\n   will
    relieve the IPv4 address shortage issue, while affording IPv6\n   more time to
    reach maturity for providing the availability levels\n   required for delivering
    a long-term general service.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
