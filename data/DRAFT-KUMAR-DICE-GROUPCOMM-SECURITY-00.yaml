abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP unicast and group communication for low-power and lossy
    networks\n   (LLNs) are foreseen to be used for building and lighting control\n
    \  systems.  Although unicast CoAP communication mandates DTLS for\n   security,
    no similar existing security mechanisms exist to secure\n   CoAP group communication.
    \ The draft, DTLS multicast security\n   [I-D.keoh-dice-multicast-security], proposes
    a solution based on\n   reusing the DTLS record layer to also secure CoAP group\n
    \  communication.  Although that solution has advantages in terms of\n   code
    reuse, it does not ensure source authentication within the\n   group.  This draft
    presents alternative CoAP group communication\n   security solutions based on
    public key cryptographic signatures to\n   also ensure source authentication within
    the group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
