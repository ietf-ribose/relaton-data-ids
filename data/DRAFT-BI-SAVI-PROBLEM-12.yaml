abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IETF Source Address Validation Improvements (SAVI) working
    group is\n   chartered for source address validation within the first hop from
    end\n   hosts, i.e., preventing a node from spoofing the IP source address of\n
    \  another node in the same IP link.  However, since SAVI requires the\n   edge
    routers or switches to be upgraded, the deployment of SAVI will\n   need a long
    time.  During this transition period, some source address\n   validation techniques
    beyond the first hop (SAVI-BF) may be needed to\n   complement SAVI and protect
    the networks from spoofing based attacks.\n   In this document, we first propose
    three desired features of the\n   SAVI-BF techniques.  Then we analyze the problems
    of the current\n   SAVI-BF technique, ingress filtering.  Finally, we discuss
    the\n   directions that we can explore to improve SAVI-BF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
