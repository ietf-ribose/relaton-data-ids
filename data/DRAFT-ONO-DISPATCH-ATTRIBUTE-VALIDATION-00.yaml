abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for referencing and validating\n
    \  user attributes in SIP communication.  User attributes, such as an\n   organizational
    affiliation and role, are helpful for the recipients\n   of a communication request
    to decide whether or not to grant the\n   sender access to the recipient's resources,
    especially when the\n   sender identity is unknown to the recipients.  This mechanism
    allows\n   the sender to claim her attributes to recipients using an attribute\n
    \  reference identifier without needing to prove the sender identity.\n   This
    document defines a new SIP \"Sender-References\" header field to\n   convey one
    or more attribute reference identifiers.  This mechanism\n   satisfies all the
    requirements for trait-based authorization defined\n   in RFC 4484, except that
    it provides only one assertion scheme.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
