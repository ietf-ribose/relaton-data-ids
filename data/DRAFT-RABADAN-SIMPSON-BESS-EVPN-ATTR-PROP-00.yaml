abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EVPN is being actively used to provide tenant inter-subnet-forwarding\n
    \  in DC networks, as described in [IP-PREFIX] and [INTER-SUBNET]. When\n   those
    tenant networks are interconnected to vpn-ipv4/vpn-ipv6 or\n   ipv4/ipv6 BGP networks,
    there is a need for the EVPN BGP Path\n   Attributes to be seamlessly propagated
    so that the receiver PE or NVE\n   can consider the original EVPN Attributes in
    its path calculations.\n   This document analyses the use-cases, requirements
    and rules based on\n   which the BGP Path Attributes should be propagated between
    EVPN and\n   other BGP families.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
