abstract:
- content: "<p>Dual-stack requires IPv4 and IPv6 are deployed in parallel, as it costs
    more to run two technologies than one. IPv6-only is considered to be the next
    stage of IPv6 development from dual-stack. This document specifies requirements
    when deploying IPv6-only in multi- domain networks.</p>"
