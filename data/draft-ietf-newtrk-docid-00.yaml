abstract:
  content: "<p>In the present Internet Standards Process, stable identifiers forstandards,
    as distinct from documents (for which RFC numbers aresufficient), has become problematic
    because proportionately fewdocuments reach Full Standard and are assigned STD
    numbers. Severalproposals have been introduced into NEWTRK to address this problem,but
    only in the context of trying to resolve a number of otherissues. In the hope
    of making some progress on this dimension, thisdocument proposes a change to the
    standards-track document identifiersystem only.</p>"
