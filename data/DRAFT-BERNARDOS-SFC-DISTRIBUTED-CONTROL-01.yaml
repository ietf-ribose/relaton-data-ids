abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service function chaining (SFC) allows the instantiation of
    an\n   ordered set of service functions and subsequent \"steering\" of traffic\n
    \  through them.  In order to set up and maintain SFC instances, a\n   control
    plane is required, which typically is centralized.  In\n   certain environments,
    such as fog computing ones, such centralized\n   control might not be feasible,
    calling for distributed SFC control\n   solutions.  This document introduces the
    role of SFC pseudo-\n   controller and specifies solutions to select and initialize
    such new\n   logical function.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
