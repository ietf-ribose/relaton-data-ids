abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In many IoT applications, direct discovery of resources is
    not\n   practical due to sleeping nodes, disperse networks, or networks where\n
    \  multicast traffic is inefficient.  These problems can be solved by\n   employing
    an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which contains\n   information about
    resources held on other servers, allowing lookups\n   to be performed for those
    resources.  The input to an RD is composed\n   of links and the output is composed
    of links constructed from the\n   information stored in the RD.  This document
    specifies the web\n   interfaces that a Resource Directory supports for web servers
    to\n   discover the RD and to register, maintain, lookup and remove\n   information
    on resources.  Furthermore, new target attributes useful\n   in conjunction with
    an RD are defined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
