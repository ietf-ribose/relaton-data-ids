abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The objective of the Footprint and Capability Interface of
    CDNi is to\n   allow a dCDN to expose information to a uCDN so that the uCDN can\n
    \  select a set of dCDN(s) to delivery contents for content publishers.\n   In
    this draft, we propose a flexible approach for a dCDN to expose\n   its footprint
    and capabilities based on a generic concept called\n   Service Access or Anchor
    Point.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
