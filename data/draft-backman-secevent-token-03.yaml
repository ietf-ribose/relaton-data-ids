- content: "<p>This specification defines the Security Event Token, which may be distributed
    via a protocol such as HTTP. The Security Event Token (SET) specification profiles
    the JSON Web Token (JWT), which can be optionally signed and/or encrypted. A SET
    describes a statement of fact from the perspective of an issuer that it intends
    to share with one or more receivers.</p>"
