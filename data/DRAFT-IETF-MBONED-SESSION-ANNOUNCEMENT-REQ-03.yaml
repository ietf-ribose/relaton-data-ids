abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [2] was used to announce\ninformation
    for all available IP multicast sessions to the\nprospective receiver in an experimental
    network.  It is easy to use,\nbut not scalable and difficult to control the SAP
    message\ntransmission in a wide area network.  This document describes the\nissues
    and the requirements for multicast session announcement in the\nglobal Internet.\n\t
