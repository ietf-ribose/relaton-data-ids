abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is a working document intended to focus discussion and
    refine\n   draft language for the CoAP protocol specification (or other proposed\n
    \  standards) in the areas of discovery, naming, and addressing.\n   Engineering
    tradeoffs become more challenging in constrained\n   environments; therefore discovery,
    naming, and addressing are\n   considered within the context of adjacent topics
    that may impact or\n   be impacted by design choices in the subject areas.  Special
    emphasis\n   is placed on group definition and discovery.  Examples show how\n
    \  groups can be represented in CoAP Resource Directories or DNS-SD.\n\n\t </p>\n
