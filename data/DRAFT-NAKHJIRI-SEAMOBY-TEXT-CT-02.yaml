abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents a context transfer proposal that allows
    \ncompletion of context transfer outside timing critical message \nsequence for
    handover.  The context transfer process is initiated \nat a moment of MN’s choice
    (in regard to layer 2 and 3 handover \nand MN’s traffic) and is completed without
    a disruption in the \nflow of MN’s real time traffic. This proposal is in line
    with the \ncurrent fast handover framework within Mobile IP WG [3].  Although
    \nthis document provides a specific recommendation, the framework \nproposed here,
    along with multiple alternatives that are \nmentioned, provides a great amount
    of flexibility in detailed \ndesign of context transfer. A minimum reliability
    mechanism for \nensuring quality of transferred context is added to provide \ncontext
    updates that cannot be achieved by any transport protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
