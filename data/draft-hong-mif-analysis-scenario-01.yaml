abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document includes an analysis of multiple interfaces in a hostand
    a description of scenarios of multiple interfaces with therespect of the relationship
    between layer 2 connection and layer 3connection. The current TCP/IP mechanism
    and networking methods aresuitable for single network interface. When a host has
    multipleinterfaces, the current TCP/IP mechanism and networking methodscannot
    directly be used for them. A network interface establisheslayer 2 connection to
    layer 2 entity (e.g., WLAN Access Point) and itdoes not mean providing proper
    layer 3 connection. So every activenetwork interfaces do not guarantee successful
    IP layer operations.In this document, we describe some problems for a host which
    hasmultiple interfaces as an aspect of host's operations and usagescenarios of
    multiple interfaces in a host.</p>"
