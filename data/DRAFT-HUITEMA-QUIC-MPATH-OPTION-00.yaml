abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The initial version of QUIC provides support for path migration.
    \ In\n   this draft, we argue that there is a very small distance between\n   supporting
    path migration and supporting simulatneous traffic on\n   multipath.  Instead
    of using an implicit algorithm to discard unused\n   paths, we propose a simple
    option to allow explicit management of\n   active and inactive paths.  Once paths
    are explicitly managed, pretty\n   much all other requirements for multipath support
    can be met by\n   appropriate algorithms for scheduling transmissions on specific\n
    \  paths.  These algorithms can be implemented on the sender side, and\n   do
    not require specific extensions, except maybe a measurement of one\n   way delays.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
