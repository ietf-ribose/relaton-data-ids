abstract:
  content: '<p>The size of the global routing table is a rapidly growing problem.Several
    solutions have been proposed. These solutions commonlydivide the Internet into
    two address spaces, one for determining thedelivery location, and one to use during
    transit. Packets destinedfor delivery addresses are tunneled through the default-free
    zone(DFZ), which uses only transit addresses. For this process to work,there must
    be a mapping service that can supply an appropriatedestination transit address
    for any given delivery address. Wepresent a design for such a mapping service.
    We adhere to a "do noharm" design philosophy: maintain all desirable features
    of thecurrent architecture without negatively affecting its security orreliability.
    Our design aims to minimize delay and prevent loss inpacket encapsulation, minimize
    the number of modifications toexisting hardware, minimize the number of new devices,
    and keep thelevel of control traffic manageable.</p>'
