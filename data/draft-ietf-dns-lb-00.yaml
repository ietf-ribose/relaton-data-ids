abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC is meant to first chronicle a foray into the IETF DNS Working
    Group, discuss other possible alternatives to provide/simulate load balancing
    support for DNS, and to provide an ultimate, flexible solution for providing DNS
    support for balancing loads of many types. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any
    kind.</p>"
