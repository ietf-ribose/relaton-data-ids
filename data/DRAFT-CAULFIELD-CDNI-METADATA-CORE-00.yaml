abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CDNI Metadata Interface enables interconnected CDNs to
    exchange\n   content distribution metadata for the purpose of content acquisition\n
    \  and delivery.  The CDNI metadata associated with a piece of content\n   provides
    a downstream CDN with the information necessary for the\n   downstream CDN to
    service content requests on behalf of an upstream\n   CDN in accordance with the
    delivery policies defined by the upstream\n   CDN.  This document describes the
    core set of CDNI metadata that all\n   interconnected CDNs must support.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
