abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an efficient augmented password-only\n
    \  authentication and key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user\n   remembers
    a low-entropy password and its verifier is registered in\n   the intended server.
    \ In general, the user password is chosen from a\n   small set of dictionary whose
    space is within the off-line dictionary\n   attacks.  The AugPAKE protocol described
    here is secure against\n   passive attacks, active attacks and off-line dictionary
    attacks (on\n   the obtained messages with passive/active attacks), and also provides\n
    \  resistance to server compromise (in the context of augmented PAKE\n   security).
    \ In addition, this document describes how the AugPAKE\n   protocol is integrated
    into IKEv2.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
