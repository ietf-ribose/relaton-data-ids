abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When multiple congestion controlled Real-time Transport Protocol\n
    \  (RTP) sessions traverse the same network bottleneck, combining their\n   controls
    can improve the total on-the-wire behavior in terms of\n   delay, loss and fairness.
    \ This document describes such a method for\n   flows that have the same sender,
    in a way that is as flexible and\n   simple as possible while minimizing the amount
    of changes needed to\n   existing RTP applications.  It specifies how to apply
    the method for\n   the Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA) congestion control\n
    \  algorithm, and provides suggestions on how to apply it to other\n   congestion
    control algorithms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
