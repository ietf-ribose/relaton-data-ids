abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the 497 (Call Transfer Failure) SIP\n
    \  response code, allowing Call Pull and Call Push parties to\n   indicate that
    the operation was rejected. Optional warning codes\n   are defined to carry granular
    information. SIP entities may use\n   this information to adjust how subsequent
    calls can be handled\n   intelligently.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
