abstract:
- content: "<p>The CAPWAP binding for 802.11 is specified by RFC5416 and it was based
    on IEEE 802-11.2007 standard. Several new amendments of 802.11 have been published
    since RFC5416 was published in 2009. 802.11n is one of those amendments and it
    has been widely used in real deployment. This document extends the CAPWAP binding
    for 802.11 to support 802.11n and also defines a power and channel auto configuration
    extension.</p>"
