abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The aim of the Versatile File Delivery Protocol is to deliver
    files \nfrom few octets up to few hundred gigaoctets over multicast \nnetworks.
    It works over UDP and uses IP multicast addresses. VFDP \ntransmissions have been
    designed to be as reliable as possible \naccording to various and strong network
    constraints, either by \nretransmitting the whole file or by sending only the
    missing packets \ndepending of a return channel existence.\n\t </p>\n      "
