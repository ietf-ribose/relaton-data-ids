abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NAT (Network Address Translation) has been proposed to extend
    the\n   lifetime of IPv4 by allowing one or more subnets to exist behind a\n   single
    IP address.  It is desirable to support dozens, if not\n   hundreds, of nodes
    on a NAT subnet.  As it is currently defined, NAT\n   may not gracefully scale
    beyond networks containing a few dozen\n   nodes.  In particular, the computational
    burden placed on the NAT\n   router may be significant, especially if the router
    is shared by\n   several NAT-enabled subnets.  Additionally, NAT requires that
    support\n   for many protocols be specifically programmed into the translation\n
    \  mechanism. In this document, we introduce DNAT (Distributed Network\n   Address
    Translation), an alternative to NAT.  In particular, DNAT\n   will eliminate all
    address and port translation at the router,\n   providing an application independent
    mechanism for sharing an IP\n   address amongst many hosts while providing end-to-end
    connectivity.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
