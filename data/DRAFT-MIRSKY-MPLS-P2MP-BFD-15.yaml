abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes procedures for using Bidirectional
    Forwarding\n   Detection (BFD) for multipoint networks to detect data plane failures\n
    \  in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) point-to-multipoint (p2mp)\n   Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) and Segment Routing (SR) point-to-\n   multipoint policies
    with SR-MPLS data plane.\n\n   It also describes the applicability of LSP Ping,
    as in-band, and the\n   control plane, as out-band, solutions to bootstrap a BFD
    session.\n\n   It also describes the behavior of the active tail for head\n   notification.\n\n\t
