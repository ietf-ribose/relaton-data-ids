abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There are many proposals for improving the Inter-domain routingsystem,
    most of which involve a form of locater-identity split.There needs to be a means
    to reason about the strengths of thedifferent proposals against the design criteria,
    and withoutrequiring large scale implementations. This document aims to startthis
    process by drawing parallels with existing systems. Itidentifies a number of questions
    that need to be more fully thoughtabout whilst we press ahead with system development.</p>"
