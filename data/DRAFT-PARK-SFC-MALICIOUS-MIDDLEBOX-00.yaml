abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document addresses problems caused by malicious middleboxes
    and\n   proposes a scheme that can detect them in Service Function Chaining\n
    \  (SFC) by combining two mechanisms: direct and indirect.  The direct\n   mechanism
    injects a tool into the middleboxes to observe and report\n   the state of each
    middlebox.  In contrast, the indirect mechanism\n   creates a probe service chain,
    which includes trustful middleboxes,\n   to investigate the operation of other
    middleboxes in the network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
