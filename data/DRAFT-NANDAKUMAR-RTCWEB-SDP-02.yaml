    is\n   charged to provide protocol support for direct interactive rich\n   communication
    using audio,video and data between two peers' web\n   browsers.  With in the WebRTC
    framework, Session Description protocol\n   (SDP) [RFC4566] is used for negotiating
    session capabilities between\n   the peers.  Such a negotiataion happens based
    on the SDP Offer/Answer\n   exchange mechanism described in the RFC 3264 [RFC3264].\n\n
    \  This document serves a introductory purpose in describing the role of\n   SDP
    for the most common WebRTC use-cases.\n\n   This SDP examples provided in this
    document is still a work in\n   progress, but aims to align closest to the evolving
    standards.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
