abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network integrated applications want simple ways to access
    YANG\n   objects and subtrees which might be distributed across network.\n   Performance
    requirements may dictate that it is unaffordable for a\n   subset of these applications
    to go through existing centralized\n   management brokers.  For such applications,
    development complexity\n   must be minimized.  Specific aspects of complexity
    developers want to\n   ignore include:\n\n   o  whether authoritative information
    is actually sourced from remote\n      datastores (as well as how to get to those
    datastores),\n\n   o  whether such information has been locally cached or not,\n\n
    \  o  whether there are zero, one, or more controllers asserting\n      ownership
    of information, and\n\n   o  whether there are interactions with other applications\n
    \     concurrently running elsewhere\n\n   The solution requirements described
    in this document detail what is\n   needed to support application access to authoritative
    network YANG\n   objects from controllers (star) or peering network devices (mesh)
    in\n   such a way to meet these goals.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
