abstract:
- content: "<p>Complaint Feedback Loops similar to those described herein have existed
    for more than a decade, resulting in many de facto standards and best practices.
    This document is an attempt to codify, and thus clarify, the ways that both providers
    and consumers of these feedback mechanisms intend to use the feedback, describing
    some already common industry practices. This document is the result of cooperative
    efforts within the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group, a trade organization separate
    from the IETF. The original MAAWG document upon which this document is based was
    published in April, 2010. This document does not represent the consensus of the
    IETF; rather it is being published as an Informational RFC to make it widely available
    to the Internet community and simplify reference to this material from IETF work.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
