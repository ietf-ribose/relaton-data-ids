abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an extension to the Location to Service\n
    \  Translation (LoST) protocol (RFC5222) that allows planned changes to\n   the
    data to be handled smoothly.  This extension is only useful with\n   the validation
    function of LoST.  It is beneficial for LoST\n   validation clients to be aware
    of planned changes, as records that\n   previously were valid may become invalid
    at a known future date, and\n   new locations may become valid after the date.
    \ This extension adds\n   an element to the &lt;findService&gt; request: a date
    that allows the LoST\n   client to request that the server perform validation
    as of the date\n   specified.  It adds an optional Time-To-Live element to the
    response,\n   which informs clients of the current expected lifetime of a\n   validation.
    \ It also adds a separate interface to the LoST server\n   that allows a client
    to poll for planned changes.  Additionally, this\n   document provides a conventional
    XML schema for LoST, as a backwards\n   compatible alternative to the RelaxNG
    schema in RFC5222.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
