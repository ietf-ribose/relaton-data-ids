abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model that can be used by a network
    operator to configure a VPN service that spans multiple administrative domains
    and that is constructed from component VPNs in each of those administrative domains.
    The component VPNs may be L2VPN or L3VPN or a mixture of the two. This model is
    intended to be instantiated at the management system to deliver the end to end
    service (i.e., performing service provision and activation functions at different
    levels through a unified interface). The model is not a configuration model to
    be used directly on network elements. This model provides an abstracted common
    view of VPN service configuration components segmented at different layer and
    administrative domain. It is up to a management system to take this as an input
    and generate specific configurations models to configure the different network
    elements within each administrative domain to deliver the service. How configuration
    of network elements is done is out of scope of the document.</p>"
