abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a deployment scenario to assess the\n
    \  applicability of DOTS protocols together with a discussion on DOTS\n   deployment
    considerations of such scenario.  This scenario assumes\n   that a DMS (DDoS Mitigation
    System) whose utilization rate is high\n   sends its blocked traffic information
    to an orchestrator using DOTS\n   protocols, then the orchestrator requests forwarding
    nodes such as\n   routers to filter the traffic.  Doing so enables service providers
    to\n   mitigate the DDoS attack traffic automatically while ensuring\n   interoperability
    and distributed filter enforcement.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
